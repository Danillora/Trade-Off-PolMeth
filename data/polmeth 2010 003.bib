Abstract = {In recent studies of football supporters, a specifically Marxist
   understanding of commodification has been left out of the equation,
   producing analysis that tends to superimpose commodification and ignore
   the wider relations of production out of which the dialectical
   contradictions of commodification arise. This paper aims to demonstrate
   the practical import of a Marxist political economy of football support
   through a case study of Everton supporters as they contest Everton
   Football Club's proposed ground move. The aim is not so much to reveal
   class struggles or fan revolts, but rather to offer a snapshot of the
   daily uncertainties and dilemmas of fans, embroiled in resisting and
   responding to commodity fetishism in the context of an industry
   exhibiting a highly unstable commodity structure.},

Abstract = {Recent research raises doubts about whether the presence of women
   contesting or occupying prominent public office enhances women's
   political engagement. Taking into account both gender and party
   congruence between politicians and constituents, the authors find that
   it is primarily female candidates of the same party who enhance women's
   interest in politics. The stronger impact of party-congruent (over
   party-incongruent) female candidates can be attributed to either greater
   visibility or agreement on substantive issues. Party matters, but rather
   than obscuring the role of gender in electoral politics, it enhances our
   understanding of how, or under what conditions, it works.},

Abstract = {In the 2008 presidential election cycle, data from the National
   Annenberg Election Survey (NAES) showed that the gap between
   self-identified Democrats and Republicans widened from where it was
   after the 2004 presidential election. The Democratic edge grew from
   nearly 4 points in the 2004 NAES to almost 9 points in the 2008 NAES.
   This change reverses the trend, observed since the 2000 NAES, showing a
   narrowing of the gap. This article tracks the national trend from
   October 2007 through the November 2008 presidential general election to
   show that party self-identification fluctuated during the 2008 election
   season. Using both the 2008 NAES telephone rolling cross-sectional
   survey and the 2008 NAES Internet Panel, the authors document this
   national trend and show where the shifts occurred demographically and
   regionally. Additionally, the authors examine shifts among
   self-identified 2004 Bush and Kerry voters who participated in the 2008
   National Annenberg Election survey-looking at whom they voted for and
   whether they switched party identification.},

Abstract = {Why are fewer women than men elected? Research suggests that this is the
   combined result of: (1) the supply of female aspirants, or the
   qualifications of women as a group to run for political office; and (2)
   the demand for female aspirants, or the preference of political elites

   this explanation through the lens of recent case studies of female
   representation in four regions of the world: Africa, Latin America,
   North America and Western Europe. On their own, each contribution lends
   support to arguments about either supply or demand, leading their
   authors to offer distinct recommendations for change: an increase in the
   number of women who come forward, which is likely to be a slow and
   difficult process, or the adoption of gender quotas, which are quick but
   may produce mixed results. Yet juxtaposing these studies also exposes
   the limits of the traditional supply and demand model of candidate
   selection. On the one hand, the `political market' does not operate
   efficiently towards an equilibrium solution of supply and demand.
   Rather, ideologies of gender introduce important distortions to the
   process: the fact that women are under-represented in all countries
   around the world suggests that both the supply of and demand for female
   candidates is artificially repressed, leading to low numbers of women in
   elective office. On the other hand, important variations exist in
   women's descriptive representation across countries and across political
   parties. These differences suggest that dynamics of supply and demand
   are shaped in crucial ways by features of the broader political context,
   which may include structural conditions but also the emergence of new
   and sometimes unanticipated opportunities.},

Abstract = {In this article the new Croatian model of `local presidential' system is
   defined in its most important aspects concerning the electoral model,
   the position, the powers, the relationship with the local council, and
   the accountability of directly elected heads of municipalities, mayors
   and county governors. However, some aspects of the new system, e.g. the
   powers of the directly elected local executive, are still not defined,
   and some changes in the electoral system have already been adopted
   before its actual implementation. What could be preliminarily stated is
   that the Croatian model is a very specific model with certain features
   resembling other contemporary systems of `local presidentialism' in
   Europe, but also with some peculiarities similar to the American model
   (particularly the model of electing mayor and deputy mayor on the same
   ticket), which point to the conclusion that the Croatian model is a new
   variant of the `local presidential' system.},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The content and form of literary works are inseparably linked to one
   another. The heroes in the novels of the flourishing era of classical
   Russian realism during the 19th century are young men. As a rule, they
   are rebelling against society, but then grow into it after all. Older
   persons appear mostly as supporting figures. Socialist realism takes
   over the idealistic pathos of its predecessor. The heroes are again
   young men who now, however, cast off the old and heroically move into
   the new world. This romanticizing representation came into an
   indissoluble conflict with Soviet everyday life. In the late-Soviet
   village prose, old women are the protagonists. The closeness of their
   death heralds a dual ending: that of the Soviet Union and that of
   Russian realism.},

Abstract = {This essay argues that the current economic crisis normalizes a
   transformation of the U.S. imperialist structure of surplus
   ``accumulation.'' Whereas the prior form of imperialism worked to create
   the conditions for surplus value production within the United States,
   the new imperialism works to channel globally produced surplus back to
   it. And whereas the prior form of imperialism was characterized by
   relatively high labor-power values in the United States, the new
   imperialism is characterized by a lowering of the value of labor power.
   The current economic crisis works to normalize this lowering of the
   value of labor power in the United States. It is this lowering of the
   value of labor power that sets the conditions for class struggle over
   the foreseeable future and thus the terms for Marxian theoretical and
   political work.},

   of a naturally occurring experiment-the distribution of personal

   confidence. Analysis of a large Gallup survey of attitudes toward Social
   Security finds that recipients of personal Social Security Statements
   gained more knowledge of and confidence in, Social Security than
   nonrecipients after controlling for individual differences. These
   results suggest that citizens' evaluations of government institutions
   echo, in part, the quality and quantity of information distributed to
   them. The implication for future research on political trust and

   global to specific objects of evaluation.},

Abstract = {The article explores the question of impact of European Union (EU)
   enlargement (2004) on social dialogue in two new EU member countries:
   Poland and Estonia. The research shows a contradictory influence of the
   enlargement. On the one hand, social dialogue was supported by European
   institutions as a way to improve effectiveness and legitimacy of public
   policies. On the other hand, the logic of European accession was based
   on the quick transfer of vast numbers of regulations (acquis
   communautaire), which were not intended as subject to change. This fact
   made it difficult to develop social dialogue in many areas of public
   policy, and it made the possibilities to discuss changes in European law
   with social partners more of a challenge. Consequently, enlargement
   weakened the role of social dialogue, as an effective mechanism of
   public reforms in the two countries examined. The article demonstrates
   the importance of political and administrative culture in the
   implementation of social dialogue in Central-East European countries.
   When the influence of European accession is weak and contradictory, the
   influence of local conditioning grows in importance. In order to explain
   the impact of local culture on the enlargement processes, the article
   proposes two models of relations between state and society: (i)
   administrative state, which is based on socialist state legacy; and (ii)
   network state, which corresponds with Western European standards of
   democracy. Acta Politica (2010) 45, 112-135. doi: 10.1057/ap.2009.32},

Abstract = {By the mid-1990s neo-liberalism had begun to reach its economic, social
   and political limits. International as well national and even
   sub-national social policymakers in and concerned with Latin America and
   Europe began to converge around new ideas about doing social policy,
   characterized here as the social investment perspective. The first
   section of the article documents this convergence across two regions.
   The second section then identifies three social mechanisms that
   supported this convergence. The first began in the heyday of
   neo-liberalism, and involved opening space for legitimate alternatives.
   A second was the polysemic character of social investment as a
   quasi-concept that could penetrate and link numerous policy communities.
   The third was boundary-crossing, as distinctions that had separated
   analysis and action in the two regions fell away.},

Abstract = {Technological innovation continually shifts boundaries of possibilities
   and at the same time challenges ethical dimensions. Radio Frequency
   Identification (RFID) technology challenges both what is possible and
   what is ethical. On this basis, this paper incorporates an analysis of
   RFID development and provides penetrating insight concerning the ethical
   issues society faces and will face. Attention is given to the burgeoning
   and challenging field of human-centred RFID technology and its impact on
   the individuals privacy, safety, civil liberty and on society in
   general. The paper briefly outlines the history of RFIDs and identifies
   three broad themes concerning the application of RFID tags for the
   purpose of human ``branding{''}. In particular, the social rights impact
   of implants in humans, the potential and actual damage of implants to
   the physical health of the person, and the ownership, use and miss-use
   of information collected through implant technology, act as the central
   themes. In conclusion, the authors identify the critical areas
   surrounding human branding that require research and public
   deliberation.},

Abstract = {We examine whether the EMU has led to greater labour market flexibility,
   differentiating between reform that enhances the capacity of an economy
   to adjust to economic shocks and reform that aims to increase long-run
   output. Based on a panel model and using OECD data on labour market
   reforms for 27 OECD countries over the period 1994-2004, we find that
   the two types of labour market reform are driven by different variables.
   Most importantly, our results suggest that the EMU has had no effect on
   reform that enhances the economy's capacity to adjust to shocks. Most of
   our evidence for reform that increases long-run output suggests that the
   EMU has not affected this type of reform either.},

   Re-grounding the Focus of Medicine Amidst the Current ``Global Systemic
   Shift{''} and the Forces of the Market: Elements for a Contemporary
   Social Philosophy of Medicine},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the role and the status of medicine within the
   ``post-modern{''} culture(s) of the West. As we know, culture is a major
   factor that influences the perception, the interpretation, and the
   expectations toward medicine, medical institutions, medical politics,
   and the persons involved with them. When culture changes, the social
   construct called ``medicine{''} changes. Today, the Western condition of
   ``post-modernity{''} finds itself in a process of rapid change due to
   the ``global systemic shift{''} that is manifesting since a couple of
   years within all four main systemic logics and discoursive patterns of
   Western societies: in culture, religion, politics, and economics. In
   this situation, the article tries to elaborate on crucial questions
   about how a contemporary social philosophy of medicine can be delineated
   within the current ``global systemic shift{''} and what some
   consequences and perspectives could be. It pleas for an integrative
   philosophy of medicine which has to strive to re-integrate the ``(de)
   constructivist{''} patterns of ``nominalistic{''} post-modern thought
   (dedicated primarily to freedom and equality) with the ``idealistic{''}
   patterns of ``realistic{''} neo-humanism (dedicated primarily to the
   ``essence{''} of human dignity and the possibility of intersubjective
   morality). Only the institution of a balanced ``subjective-objective{''}
   paradigm can ensure medicine its appropriate place, role, and status
   within our rapidly changing society.},

Abstract = {There are good reasons to expect that greater proportions of women in
   decision making bodies shape decision making in important ways that are
   not fully considered in the current literature. In the present study, a
   conceptual framework is presented that differs significantly from other
   explanations for gendered group decision making. Data from an original
   laboratory experiment offers support for the hypothesis that group
   outcomes will vary based on gender composition due to differing process
   strategies used by men and women. These data illuminate how gender
   diversity in decision making bodies is likely to shape policy making, as
   well as enhance our understanding of how policymaking is itself
   gendered.},

Abstract = {Candidate appearances on entertainment television have become a staple
   of recent presidential campaigns, yet little is known about their effect
   on voters. Many assume that they leave viewers uninformed and focused on
   the candidate's personal image. In this article, the author investigates
   this idea with an experiment using John Kerry's 2004 appearance on the
   Late Show with David Letterman. He finds that-contrary to popular
   expectations-late night interviews have particular features that can, at
   times, engage otherwise politically disinterested viewers, causing them
   to process and recall substantive policy information.},

Abstract = {Since the publication of the OECD's Programme for International Student
   Assessment (PISA), scholarly interest in analysing the effectiveness and
   performance of education policy has risen again. The present article
   follows this path and presents the first empirical evaluation of the
   influence of national education policies on educational inequality in
   the European Union member states. We examine whether the availability of
   preschool education, an all-day school tradition, tracking during
   secondary education, a large private school sector, average class size
   and education expenditures moderate the relationship between individual
   social background and educational success. As a main finding, our
   multi-level analyses show that education policy affects educational
   inequality very differently, an outcome that is most visible when
   comparing West European and post-communist countries.},

   Campaign of Ron Paul from a Third-Party Perspective},
Journal = {POLITICS \& POLICY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {38},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {The 2007/2008 Republican presidential primary run for Ron Paul was a
   relatively unique candidacy, as he was a former third-party presidential
   candidate for the Libertarian Party in 1988. In this article, I argue
   that his recent run as a Republican needs to be studied as a third-party
   movement within a major party. To do so, I conduct a state-level
   analysis of support for Paul using a dependent variable measuring the
   number of online Paul donors. The results indicate that the strongest
   explanation for Paul support is a state's vote for Paul in 1988. This
   finding shows that a third-party campaign can help a politician's
   national-level career rather than serving merely as an outlet for
   popular discontent. It also shows that candidate-centered support can
   carry over into a major-party campaign, even if almost 20 years has
   elapsed and a candidate's third-party vote percentage was quite low.},

Abstract = {This article addresses the determinants of regulatory agency design in
   multiparty-coalition governments. Previous research has mainly focused
   on U.S. institutions, producing context-specific findings. We found
   electoral uncertainty, government turnover, and coalition size to be key
   factors explaining the bureaucratic autonomy of 31 state regulatory
   agencies recently created at the subnational level in Brazil. The
   legislative support that chief executives enjoy only acquires
   explanatory power when it is interacted with government turnover.
   Because Brazilian governors have great ability to build oversized
   majority coalitions, coalition strength influences the governor's
   strategy when the governor faces credible threats from rival elite
   groups.},

Abstract = {The present experiment examined the effects of mortality salience and

   One-hundred and fifty participants from two universities in Iran took
   part in a 2 (mortality salience or dental pain) x 3 (social consensus
   for, consensus against or no information) between-subjects design.
   Participants were primed with either death or pain, and then read that
   the majority of Iranians supported martyrdom attacks against the United
   States, the majority was against these types of attacks or no
   information was provided. Results indicated that mortality salience led
   to more support for violence martyrdom attacks in the no information and
   high social support for martyrdom conditions, but had no effect on
   support for such attacks when participants were led to believe that most
   of the people in their country opposed such tactics. Implications for
   terror management theory and peaceful solutions to intergroup conflict
   are discussed.},

Title = {Regime-Transitions in the 2003-2010 Iraq War: An Approach Based on
   Correlations of Daily Fatalities},
Journal = {PEACE ECONOMICS PEACE SCIENCE AND PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {16},

Abstract = {This paper studied the dynamics of civilian and military fatalities in
   the Iraq War during the 2003-2010 period. R/S-scaling analysis, a method
   to characterize fractality and memory effects in sequences, was used to
   estimate time variations in the correlations of daily fatalities.
   Together with concepts from complex social networks and systems
   theories, the dynamics of correlations (measured in terms of the
   so-called scaling Hurst exponent) provide a framework to describe the
   Iraq War evolution and to evaluate the effects of the major military and
   political events. In terms of changes in a correlations parameter, five
   regimes in the evolution of the war were identified. The first regime,
   occurring in the first months after the invasion, corresponds to a
   conventional confrontation. In the second regime occurred in the last
   months of 2004, the dynamics of civilian fatalities evolved toward
   uncorrelated behavior, indicating that the occurrence of daily
   fatalities was basically governed by random processes. This is in
   contrast to the dynamics of military fatalities that showed increased
   correlations. The second regime can be seen as the advent of a chaotic
   episode where the different insurgency groups acted within an erratic,
   poorly coordinated, manner. In the third regime that occurred in the
   first two 2005 quarters, correlations of civilian fatalities increased
   and converged into the correlations patterns of military fatalities, and
   this was interpreted as the surging of a well-organized, although
   non-centralized, insurgency structure. The fourth regime lasted from
   mid-2005 to the last 2007 months and showed an important correlation
   decrement for the military fatalities. This was related to the clash of
   two antagonist war structures, namely, the traditional centralized
   Coalition Army and a non-centralized insurgent army. Finally, the fifth
   regime, from mid-2007 to date, is characterized by stable fatality
   dynamics converging to uncorrelated behavior. It is apparent that this
   behavior is related to the start of the endgame to achieve stable
   economy and government. The concept of a scale-free network was used to
   describe the insurgency operations and the subsequent war and political
   events oriented to incorporate the former Baath Party member in the
   formation of a national Iraqi government. It is concluded that, given
   the availability of data (fatalities, economic activity, migration,
   etc.) in contemporary conflicts, the usage of mathematical methods and
   tools would provide further insights of the conflict evolution and, in
   this way, help to design better policies and strategies to reduce the
   adverse effects of violence on civilians.},

   the world has generated unprecedented inequalities within and between
   nation states, This has led to the systematic exclusion of people with

   in almost all societies, the generation of an international disabled
   people's movement, and their demand for legal frameworks with which to
   address the multiple deprivations encountered by people viewed as
   `disabled'. It is argued that the poverty and exclusion encountered by
   disabled people and other oppressed groups in all societies will not be
   eliminated without fundamental structural change at the international

Abstract = {In this article, we argue that the extent to which Canadian federal
   incumbents are punished for past economic deterioration is contingent
   upon the political party forming government. Examining the effect of
   national macroeconomic conditions on incumbent vote in Canadian federal
   elections over a 50-year period (1953-2000), the article proposes an
   aggregate-level model of economic voting that takes into account the
   partisan affiliation of the incumbent government. The results of the
   pooled cross-sectional time-series analysis indicate that Liberal
   incumbents are not as strongly affected by macroeconomic conditions as
   Conservative incumbents. Contrary to what prior scholarship has
   suggested, the observed difference does not appear to be caused by the
   parties' respective ideological priorities, but rather by the parties'
   reputation (or perceived competence) in handling economic problems.},

Abstract = {In this article, we ask how far armed conflicts in the Virunga Region
   directly and indirectly contribute to the extinction of the Great Apes
   and the critically endangered Mountain Gorilla in specific. We introduce
   the conflict situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the
   concept of `New Wars' in order to identify mechanisms linking armed
   conflict with the situation of these animals. Contrary to prior
   research, our empirical analysis draws a more complete and up-to-date
   picture. Latest available data on the animals' distribution and Red List
   Status are combined with new (geographically disaggregated) conflict
   data that include low-level as well non-state fighting. We conclude with
   some policy implications.},

Abstract = {The expertise of its members is often cited as one of the distinctive
   features of the House of Lords. It is frequently argued that, in
   particular, because of its composition, and in particular the existence
   of the Crossbench Peers, debates in the Lords are more informed than in
   the Commons. Peers, it has been claimed, bring professional experience
   and expertise to the scrutiny of legislation, and have the time to
   maintain their expertise, in contrast to the Commons, where MPs, because
   of the demands of re-election and constituency business, are sometimes
   seen as being required to know a little about a wide range of subjects.
   Moreover, the presumed expertise of the Upper House has also been
   central to debates about the reform of the House of Lords, with
   assertions that any further reform should retain the Lords' ability to
   provide distinctive and informed scrutiny. Drawing on a series of
   interviews with a large sample of MPs and Peers, this article seeks to
   examine what is meant by parliamentary expertise by focusing on one
   particular policy area-welfare. It seeks to explore the nature of
   parliamentary expertise on welfare in both Houses, and suggests that in
   the field of welfare the Upper House may, in fact, be less expert than
   the House of Commons.},

Abstract = {Digital technology is causing the greatest upheaval in cinema since it
   was invented. In regard Small DV cameras make shooting at lesser costs
   possible; they are hand-held and offer an alternative way of recording
   picture and sound. Studio shooting, with high definition (HD) cameras,
   allow a greater control of special effects. Editing has become virtual
   editing on computer. Films will get to the theatres as thin DVD disks.
   At the present time, only a minority of theatres are so equipped for the
   format, but the phenomenon is gathering momentum and there is every
   reason to fear that industry rather than art will benefit from it.},

Abstract = {In Condorcet's model of information aggregation, a group of people
   decides among two alternatives a and b, with each person getting an
   independent bit of evidence about which alternative is objectively
   superior. I consider anonymous procedures, in which the group's decision
   depends only on the number of people who report a or b, not their
   identities. A procedure is called incentive compatible for a person if
   she wants to report truthfully given that others report truthfully. I
   show that if an anonymous procedure is incentive compatible for both a
   person who is significantly biased toward a and a person who is
   significantly biased toward b, then it is incentive compatible for any
   person, regardless of his preferences and prior beliefs; also, if it is
   not trivial, it must be nonmonotonic, with an additional report for a
   sometimes decreasing the probability the group chooses a. I define the
   ``supermajority penalty{''} (SP) procedure and show that when there are
   significant biases in both directions, the SP procedure is the optimal
   anonymous incentive compatible procedure from the point of view of an
   unbiased person.},

Abstract = {This article aims to address the life of man in society from the
   definition of logos as a hallmark of human being in relation to other
   animals. This requires, for order his conduct in society, setting a
   higher ethical, resulting of the principle according to which man is for
   man. This principle includes responsibility for another, with the
   observance of higher ethical values, including one who demands respect
   to secrecy, solitude, finally, the consideration for the right to
   privacy. This reference makes sense in this particular study, which also
   refers to the role of rhetoric in jus-political issues for which the
   persuasion is not dispensable, since fair. It is even possible that the
   argument in the legal and political domain, in which little is shown,
   not always prove and convince itself, but it's necessary to persuade
   face to face.},

Title = {Host Nation Language Ability and Immigrant Integration in Germany: Use

Journal = {DEMOCRACY \& SECURITY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {6},
Number = {2},
Pages = {147-182},
Abstract = {Civic integration contracts in western European states developed in a
   context of high unemployment rates among those of migrant background,
   European and national efforts to control migration, and the
   implementation of antiterrorism security measures. Language and cultural
   education programs are now required for non-Western immigrants to Europe
   in order to assure their employment and respect for the political and
   cultural traditions of the host nation. Political considerations spurred
   the development of these programs in the absence of systematic empirical
   analyses of the effectiveness of language acquisition in facilitating
   integration. Like its predecessors in other states, the 2005 German
   Immigration Act was based in part on the assumption that the
   professional and social integration of immigrants are predicated on
   German language skills. The Federal Office for Migration and Refugees
   (http://www.integration-in-deutschland.de ) announced that the language
   support effort marked ``the beginning of the development of the
   nation-wide integration programme.{''} This paper presents the results
   of a multivariate analysis of German Socio-Economic Panel Data (GSOEP)
   using indicators suggested by the European Parliament in assessing the
   importance of language on specific dimensions of integration before
   implementation of the Act. The results indicate that immigrant
   integration programs focusing primarily on host nation language
   acquisition and cultural orientation ignore key problems of integration.
   Some aspects of immigrant integration in Germany-including the
   likelihood of unemployment and fear of antiforeigner hostility-are not
   enhanced by knowledge of German. The results also suggest that
   non-German citizens classified as Turkish have less contact with
   Germans, regardless of German language skill and schooling in Germany.},

Abstract = {This article conducts a critical analysis of the historical lessons, the
   assumptions and the conduct of `hearts and minds' approaches to
   counterinsurgency. This results in challenges. Theoretically the `hearts
   and minds' approach is rooted in modernisation theory and a normative
   Western approach to legitimacy that fails to live up to the expectations
   of the local population. The approach is also based on lessons from past
   successes such as the British 1950s campaign in Malaya. However, a great
   contextual shift has taken place since then and the relevance of past
   experiences is therefore questionable in a context of complex
   state-building in the wake of intervention. This also has practical
   consequences as we seek to rectify the often misapplied approaches of
   today.},

Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},

Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Pages = {17-30},
Abstract = {`Community cohesion' is the preferred framework for managing `race
   relations' and `conflict' in contemporary Britain. Initially adopted in
   government policy following civil disturbances in the summer of 2001,
   `community cohesion' combined visions of shared belonging with
   strategies of managing diversity. More recent versions still place a
   strong emphasis on ideas of shared belonging but these are combined with
   strategies of managing migration and identity which are deployed in view
   of securing local communities against threats posed by extremism,
   deprivation, diversity and feelings of `white unease'. This article
   examines how the community cohesion agenda relies on strategies of
   governance that seek to design particular kinds of human behaviours such
   as `mixing' and `meaningful interaction', in view of `delivering'
   cohesion in the community. I analyse the cohesion agenda as a form of
   governance that operates through mechanisms of subjectivation. However,
   instead of privileging the responsible, discerning, rational, autonomous
   `free subject', I argue that community cohesion is a form of `governing
   through affect' that draws on and targets the affective subject for
   certain strategies and regulations aimed at designing people's
   behaviours and attitudes in the public domain.},

Title = {The Relationship of Verbal and Nonverbal Behavior to Political Stature:
   The Political Interviews of Israel's Prime Minister Ariel Sharon},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL MARKETING},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Pages = {229-253},
Abstract = {The study presents an innovative model for examining both the
   relationship between the verbal and nonverbal behavior of a political
   figure in political interviews and the effects of his/her political
   stature on his/her performance. The uniqueness of the model lies in the
   simultaneous examination of the two channels of communication, the
   verbal and nonverbal and the definition of their relationship, e. g.,
   discrepancy when there is a contradiction and inconsistency between the
   channels, and nondiscrepancy when they are consistent and do not
   contradict each other. The model characterizes patterns of discrepancy
   and non-discrepancy both in the behavior of the interviewer and in that
   of the interviewee and relates them to the political standing of the
   interviewee. The study examined the behavior of Israel's former prime
   minister Ariel Sharon in television appearances over the past 20 years,
   in which he had both periods of strong political standing as well as
   periods of low political status. Findings significantly show that
   patterns of discrepancy and non-discrepancy between the verbal and the
   nonverbal messages are indicative of the political stature of the
   political person being interviewed. The findings have interesting
   methodological and theoretical implications.},

Abstract = {The article focuses on the possibility of a ``cultural learning{''}
   without a projection of the own cultural self-conception on the subject
   of learning. At first, the author describes the ``cultural turn{''} in
   the social and cultural sciences, thus explaining current intercultural
   conceptions of learning (intercultural education and intercultural
   competence), but also the critique of these. In philosophy, an
   alternative concept of intercultural thinking has developed since the
   late 1980s. After presenting a short overview of selected approaches and
   propositions of intercultural philosophy, the author suggests the
   concept of ``culturality{''} as a perspective for social criticism that,
   in the end, challenges ``cultural learning{''}.},

Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Pages = {39-54},
Abstract = {There is a tension between the idea of popular sovereignty and our
   understanding that basic constitutional rights and liberties have a
   normative authority which is independent from the results of democratic
   decision-making procedures. On the one hand there is the claim that the
   content of political justice, at least as far as the basic liberties are
   concerned, is to be fixed solely by substantive moral and political
   argument, while on the other there is the claim that it is the people
   who determine the specific scheme of basic liberties that they live
   under. The apparent tension between the two claims can be resolved by
   introducing, firstly, a distinction between the concept of justice and
   the concept of legitimacy and, secondly, between proto-rights and
   constitutional rights. Unlike constitutional rights, proto-rights are
   moral, not legal, rights, and they are less specific than constitutional
   rights: one set of proto-rights allows for various schemes of legal
   constitutional rights. Proto-rights are part of the principles of
   justice and can be established only by substantive argument while
   constitutional rights have to be established by the procedures of
   democratic legitimization, and, therefore, they are a result of the
   exercise of popular sovereignty. The correlated distinctions between
   justice and legitimacy, and between proto-rights and constitutional
   rights, allow us to specify the scope of the two claims and, hence, to
   affirm both simultaneously. The philosophical and legal relevance of the
   distinctions made is elucidated by a brief discussion of the
   constitutional rights of freedom of speech in the US and Germany.},

Pages = {29-46},
Abstract = {Are peace operations effective in managing violence against civilians in
   civil wars? I examine the short-term effects of peace operations on the
   intensity of violence against the civilian population in internal
   conflicts. Missions are often sent to ongoing conflicts, where the
   warring parties have not yet managed to settle their dispute through the
   use of military means. I propose three mechanisms through which the
   presence of a third party may increase the parties' incentives to target
   civilians. A quantitative assessment of all intrastate armed conflicts,
   1989-2006, shows that while the presence of a peace operation does not
   have a clear effect on government violence, it is associated with higher
   levels of violence by rebel groups. Only UN peace operations with an
   explicit mandate to protect civilians significantly reduce violence
   against civilians by rebels.},

Abstract = {This article contributes to the public policy analysis in Swiss
   political science. Applying a two-dimensional approach, it explains the
   current output of the Swiss climate policy, taking into account
   structures and preferences of the Swiss political elite. Following
   the-Advocacy Coalition Framework, the author studies the existence of
   coalitions, power relations and policy preferences and proceeds in two
   steps: First, social network analysis frames the empirical study of
   structures and relations within the actors' network around the CO(2) law
   decision making process. Second, using a sophisticated mathematical
   algorithm, the multicriteria analysis furnishes a systematic evaluation
   of elite's belief system. This methodological combination constitutes
   the added value of this research and allows complementary conclusions
   explaining current climate policy choice. The main goal of this
   contribution finally, is to outline what can be learnt for climate
   policy formulation after 2010/2012.},

Title = {Australia's Ambivalent Re-imagining of Asia},
Journal = {AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {45},
Number = {1},
Pages = {59-74},
Abstract = {This article argues that `Asia' has tended to function as an ambivalent
   `sign' in Australian political discourse, signifying both fear and hope.
   That ambivalence is reflected in Australian government policy. The
   article focuses on the period from Gough Whitlam on, tracing the links
   between debates over Australian relations with Asia and key issues in
   Australian domestic politics, including debates over immigration, the
   economy and Australian national identity. Key differences are identified
   between the views of John Howard and those of recent Australian Labor
   Prime Ministers. However, it is pointed out that Kevin Rudd also has
   ambivalent attitudes towards Asia, both encouraging Asian engagement as
   a path to future prosperity and fearing that Australia will be left
   behind in an increasingly `Asian Century'.},

Abstract = {The Landtag election in Saxony was one of three elections for state
   parliaments, all taking place on 30 August 2009. Out of the three, it
   was the one where there was little doubt that the CDU would, once again,
   appoint the next Prime Minister. Aside from the lack of surprise in the
   election outcome, this election had some historic moments. After the
   right-wing NPD was able to re-enter the Saxon Landtag, Saxony is the
   only German state parliament with six party parliamentary groups
   present. Further, turnout at this election was 52 per cent, an all-time
   low. The election ended Saxony's grand coalition and established its
   first CDU-FDP coalition. Within two weeks after the election, the new
   coalition contract was negotiated and the new government was sworn in so
   as to present a clear signal to national voters that a black and yellow
   coalition was a good and workable alternative to the grand coalition in
   the German Bundestag as well.},

Abstract = {The article considers the prospects of Russia's transition towards the
   innovational type of development. Apart from stating that the main
   obstacle to modernization of a country is conservatism and stagnancy
   within the socio-political practices, Yu.Krasin argues that in Russia
   there are certain opportunities for the innovational type of
   modernization. He supposes that nowadays Russia finds herself in a
   somewhat ``reformational situation{''} encouraging the ruling elite to
   think about how to change the method of governing. The pressure coming
   from the plethora of challenges and threats that cannot be fought by the
   autocratic methods leads to fissures and niches in the political system
   broadening its public sphere. Krasin states that these looming
   tendencies can be viewed as a hint at the stepwise democratic evolution
   of the political system and the emergence of new democratic alternatives
   that are capable of altering the authoritarian vector of the federal
   policy.},

   developed from the threads of the Structuration Theory, by exploring the

   structuration. The main point of this work is, in one side, to underline
   how the dialogue between disciplines opens frameworks to analyse social
   and political life, through the perspective of Place; and, in the other,
   to deepen in a geographical heuristic tool to update questions about the
   relationship between theory and methodology in research processes.},

Title = {The Ideological ``Coherence{''} of the Brazilian Party System, 1990-2009},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS IN LATIN AMERICA},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {2},
Number = {3},
Pages = {39-69},
Abstract = {This paper contributes to the debate about the ideological coherence of
   the Brazilian party system. Using discriminant function analysis of 20
   years of surveys of Brazilian legislators, we find that the party system
   now exhibits relatively little coherence. Though the Worker's Party (
   PT) is clearly distinct, no clear ideological differences exist between
   the placement of the system's three other main parties. Moreover, the
   spatial distance between the PT and the other parties is diminishing
   over time. Given the importance of a coherent ideological map to any
   consolidated party system, we question the notion that the Brazilian
   party system has gradually consolidated. Indeed, our results suggest the

Volume = {6},

Abstract = {Americans are often perceived as holding extremely negative views of
   governmental bureaucrats. Phrases like bureaucratic waste and
   unresponsive bureaucracy fill the mainstream media and taint the image
   of bureaucrats. Beginning in basic high school civics classes, students
   are taught to respect the lawmaking process, the executive power of the
   President, and the interpretive influence of judges, yet very few are
   instructed to remember the mail carrier who delivers their mail
   consistently or the social service worker who handles a constant stream
   of phone calls-perhaps even on their behalf. Given the lack of
   background most students have on the bureaucracy, political science
   classes at the collegiate level are imperative in helping to overcome
   the popularly held negative myths of these important institutions. This
   article examines how academics attempt to tackle the complex issues
   surrounding the American bureaucracy with their American government
   students.},

Number = {1},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Why are differences so politically significant? Too often political
   science discussions of differences assume they are Immutable. The
   attendant implication is that the political divisions attached to these
   variations-in religion, ethnicity, race, or any of the other
   dissimilarities that frequently enter political fife-are considered
   rigid and inflexible. This commentary draws oil recent work in moral and
   social psychology and evolutionary biology to suggest that the critical
   political factor surrounding differences is not their immutability but
   rather the moral and political salience we accord such differences.
   Simple experiments in social identity theory-and a conversation with an
   incensed 12-year-old-demonstrate that the psychological process by which
   differences between people and groups become deemed ethically and
   politically relevant is totally socially constructed and hence can be
   restructured in a fashion that leads to more tolerant treatment of those
   judged different.},

Abstract = {This article reviews the tenets of the intellectual consensus on how to
   organize the international financial system that came to crystallize at
   the end of the 1990s and the contestation of such a consensus in the
   aftermath of the global financial crisis of 2007-09. Illustrating the
   path of ideational transformation from the early 1990s until the present
   time, the article builds on recent constructivist works in international
   political economy that take economic ideas held by agents as the
   principal unit of analysis. In doing so, it brings to the surface both
   the substantive changes that had taken place in the principles
   underlying the governance of the international financial system and the
   dynamics of ideational change. Specifically, the article suggests a
   shift away from a governance project based on the dispersion of
   supervisory authority and finds that new policy ideas of regulation and
   political centralization have all been conceived with negative reference
   to the past.},

Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {22},
Number = {2-3},
Pages = {331-354},
Abstract = {Do people tend to disagree over political issues because of conflicting
   values? Or do they disagree about which policies will most effectively
   promote shared values? In a previous article, I argued that the issues
   most people think are most important tend to fall into the latter
   category. On the issues of greatest importance to the mass public, most
   citizens agree about the ends that are desirable, but disagree about
   which policy means would best effectuate those ends. Consequently,
   disputes about factsdisputes about the actual effects of proposed public
   policieslie at the heart of the most important divisions in contemporary
   American public opinion. However, people do not necessarily interpret
   their political disagreements this way. If they fail to recognize that
   facts that they see as self-evident are disputed by their opponents,
   they may see their opponents as having different values, since there
   could be few other explanations for their opponents' disagreement with
   them. However, evidence that disagreements about facts are really
   driving public opinion can be found by using conditional surveys, which
   ask respondents if they would support a given policy if they believed
   that it would cause specific negative consequences.},

Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Pages = {19-43},
Abstract = {Unlike all other present-day nationalities, Arab nationality is defined
   exclusively in terms of a single written language, which encompasses a
   huge range of mutually incomprehensible speech forms-the better to make
   the ``Arab nationality'' as large as possible, and to establish
   continuity between today's ``Arabs'' and the glorious past of the early
   Islamic conquerors. The secular version of Arabic nationalism lost its
   appeal when the Arab countries failed to unite politically and when they
   were defeated by Israel in 1967. The apparent Islamization of Arabic
   society since 1967 is actually a response to these failures. When
   ``Arabs'' perceived that secular ideology had failed to achieve their
   national goals, they turned to Islamism as a different strategy for
   achieving the same objectives.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses the differences in the liberal secularist and the
   Islamists' discourses related to the `War on Terror'. These views are
   crystallised around a number of issues and their understanding of these
   differentiates them from each other. These issues include attitudes
   towards the nature of the Pakistani and Afghan states and the place of
   religion in these; attitudes towards the West in general and the US in
   particular, and the support for and criticism of the War on Terror
   carried out in the name of freedom, democracy and modernity. The
   hegemonic discourses of the liberals and secularists and
   counter-hegemonic discourses of the Islamists indicate an ideological
   and strategic polarisation, as reflected in the condemnation of, or
   support for, Islamism and armed resistance by militants in Pakistan and
   Afghanistan.},

Title = {Dawn of a New Climate Order: Analysis of USA plus BASIC Collaborative
   Frameworks},
Journal = {POLITIKON},

Volume = {37},
Number = {2-3},
Pages = {353-376},
Abstract = {A new climate order was confirmed at the end of the Copenhagen Climate
   Summit in December 2009. The new climate order ushered in collaborative
   frameworks among the USA and the BASIC Group made up of Brazil, South
   Africa, India and China. Collaboration among the identified countries
   resulted in three sets of partnerships, namely: the USA-India-China (UIC
   Group); the BASIC Group; and IBSA (India-Brazil-South Africa Dialogue
   Forum). The UIC partnership presents a triangle bringing together top
   global greenhouse gas (GHG) emitters committing to address climate
   change. As of 2007, the UIC Group accounted for about 47\% of total
   global GHG emissions. The USA + BASIC Group crafted the Copenhagen
   Accord architecture. Although not binding, the Copenhagen Accord was the
   major outcome from COP15. The IBSA collaboration brings further insights
   to the new climate order as it draws India into the centre of
   proceedings from the three sets of collaborative frameworks under
   deliberation. This paper focuses on what this new climate order means
   for climate leadership in general and the climate negotiation road
   leading to Mexico in December 2010.},

Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {32},

Pages = {367-387},
Abstract = {In a recently published collection of interviews with ``the most
   prominent scholars in comparative politics since World War II,{''}Adam
   Przeworski revealed that his writings from the 1980s on Social Democracy
   served a political end, that is, to defend it from critics such as
   Lenin, Trotsky, Lukacs, and Luxemburg. His co-authored book, Paper
   Stones: A History of Electoral Socialism (1986), still a classic in the
   sub-field, claims that none other than Frederick Engels sanctioned
   Social Democracy's quintessential stance, the peaceful or parliamentary
   road to socialism. A close reading of Paper Stones reveals, however,
   that it misrepresents-sometimes in quite blatant fashion-the views of
   not only Engels but Marx as well. This involves the omission of
   contradictory evidence from many places in the Marx-Engels corpus, the
   same text, the same page or even the next sentence. Przeworski's
   reinvention of Marx and Engels duplicates what Edward Bernstein did more
   than a century ago in his quest to revise their views. Paper Stones
   excludes evidence that challenges its central finding that the reformist
   outcome for European Social Democracy was inevitable-a claim, therefore,
   that can only remain hypothetical.},

Journal = {AFRICAN JOURNAL ON CONFLICT RESOLUTION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {10},
Number = {3},
Pages = {51-73},
Abstract = {The electoral process in many of Africa's `new' democracies has been
   characterised by violence. However, recent manifestations of electoral
   violence have assumed an unprecedented magnitude and changing form and
   character, with negative implications for democratic stability and
   consolidation. This paper analyses electoral violence in Africa, with
   emphasis on its manifestations, causes, implications and possible
   solutions. The paper argues that rising electoral violence in Africa is
   closely connected with the neo-patrimonial character of the African
   state, the nature of contestation for power, the weak
   institutionalisation of democratic architectures, including political
   parties and electoral management bodies (EMBs), and the fascinating
   political economy of electoral violence. This is complicated by the
   absence/paucity of democrats, with democratic mindset, to play the game
   of politics according to established rules. Worse still, avenues for
   democratic redress, including the judiciary and civil society, are also
   deeply implicated in the deepening contradictions of the state. The
   result is the deinstitutionalisation of the people in the
   democratisation process. Electoral violence is thus a major source of
   democratic instability with palpable threats of deconsolidation. These
   contradictions will have to be redressed to tame the monster.},

Abstract = {Both Russia and Ukraine are mentioned in the title of this article. But
   in reality the article is neither about Russia, nor about Ukraine, it is
   about what is to be found ``between them{''}: about interdependence of
   political processes. when revolution in one place provokes reaction in
   the other. To descry and properly appraise this interdependence. it is
   necessary to look at the newest political history of both Ukraine and
   Russia from a certain standpoint. A truth which is. after all, obvious
   enough. should be acknowledged: that the ``Orange revolution{''} is not
   just the effect of an accident concurrence of circumstances, and that
   the changes in Russian politics after 2004 have had a pronounced
   ``restoration{''} character. Ukrainian revolution provoked Russian
   counter-revolution. But that, possibly. will not be all there is to it.
   because the mutual influence of internal political processes of the
   neighbor countries is ``a street with two-way traffic{''}.},

Abstract = {Analyzed in the article are similarities and distinctions between the
   former Soviet and today's Russian political systems, as well as the
   state of modern Russian politics and the prospects of its further
   evolution. The author makes the main accent in his study on juxtaposing
   the two main models of political relations in the USSR and in Russia,
   which, from his point of view, are pluralism and corporatism. In his
   conclusions the author suggests that. as distinct from the Soviet
   corporate-pluralistic model of the 1970s to the 1980s. today's Russian
   model has a very substantial potential of development in the direction
   of new corporatism and of political pluralism of full value.},

   been conducted, including in the pages of this journal's predecessor. It
   will instead briefly consider the political environment in BiH 15 years
   after the war, the continued human dimension efforts of the Mission, and
   reflections on the scope and limits of such a field Mission in the

Abstract = {This article aims at exploring knowledge geographies as a critical
   alternative to the history and social studies of science, which allows
   making visible the spatialities that intervene or emerge during the
   process of production, distribution and appropriation of knowledge.
   Knowledge geographies constitute a fertile field of analysis from which
   to approach archaeology as a practice which contributes to the
   transformation and reproduction of certain conceptions and spatial
   experiences among the general public. The analysis of two logics of
   spatial relation in archaeology, the so-called in situ and ex situ,
   allows us to see how knowledge geographies operate in this disciplinary
   field. Additionally, its helps identify the nature of the tensions which
   emerge today between the de-location and location of archaeological
   materialities. Finally, these tensions are eluded in the Latin-American
   context, where a process of transformation in the in situ/ex situ
   relations is at work, and with it, new geographies of archaeology come
   into view.},

Abstract = {The past decade has seen a spate of new work on empire in political
   theory and the history of political thought. Much of this work has
   focused on the place of empire in the thought of many canonical thinkers
   and in the formation of modern liberalism and related arenas, such as
   post-colonial settler societies and the discipline of international law.
   Political theory's turn to empire has been belated in comparison to
   other fields, such as history, literature, and anthropology, which had
   been grappling with the histories and legacies of modern European
   empires since the 1970s. Despite intense attention to the question of
   American imperialism during the Bush administration, political theory
   arguably continues to fail to deal adequately with the imperial features
   of the current global order, including the substantial responsibility on
   the part of the great powers for conditions such as extreme poverty,
   ecological crisis, civil conflict, and tyranny around the world.},

Abstract = {The article presents the results of a comparative analysis of
   ethno-political transformation in the Republic of Belarus and in the
   Republic of Ukraine in the post-Soviet period. Thanks to the comparative
   statistical and substantial analysis of the migratory behaviour in each
   of the two cases. the author has determined the differentiation between
   the two models of ethnical development. Impartial analysis shows that
   the Belarus model is aimed at construction of the political nation
   providing civil consensus of all ethnic groups. The Ukrainian model
   actually pursues construction of the ethno-cultural nation based on
   cultural-political isolation of ethnic groups, which creates
   preconditions for interethnic conflicts.},

Title = {Local Institutional Structure and Territorial Organization in Spain:
   Local Associationism, Large Cities and Surviving Provinces},
Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {47},
Number = {3},
Pages = {67-91},
Abstract = {This paper offers a vision of the local structures in Spain, a country
   with a large number of municipalities (more than 8.110) without any
   policy addressed to the rationalization and simplification of such
   fragmentation. The local associationism has proved to be a mostly
   anarchic movement, where municipalities make arrangements for very
   different reasons and delivering all kind of services, but without a
   common pattern. Even more, a large number of ``mancomunidades{''}
   (voluntary associations of municipalities) actually doesn't work and
   exists only in theory.
   This fragmented local map is very unbalanced because almost 40 per cent
   of the Spanish population lives in a small group of 62 municipalities
   with more than 100,000 inhabitants, which represent the core of the
   local power in Spain. The traditionally uniform Spanish local legal
   framework - based in the French model-has introduced for the first time
   a specific model for the largest cities in 2003, taking into account the
   complexity of their government and governance context. Also the two main
   Spanish cities - Madrid and Barcelona-have special laws approved by the
   Spanish Parliament in 2006.
   Nevertheless, the Spanish functional metropolitan areas present a low
   institutional profile due to the resistance of the Autonomous
   Communities - the regional level with legislative powers to establish or
   suppress them-to institutionalize these urban areas as they are
   perceived mostly as political competitors. Finally, the traditional
   second local level, the province, has experienced a substantial cutback
   of its competences after the establishment of the Autonomous Communities
   in 1979-1983. In theory, the main role of the province is the
   economical, technical and legal cooperation with the small and medium
   size municipalities, but actually this role could be implemented by the
   Autonomous Communities, and the provinces means an arena for the
   political clientelism and a privileged and comfortable space for the
   local political elites that could perfectly be suppressed, especially in
   a context of deep economic crisis and reduction of public resources.},

Title = {EU Cohesion Policy and the Europeanization of Central and East European
   Regions},
Journal = {REGIONAL AND FEDERAL STUDIES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Pages = {45-62},
Abstract = {This article probes the extent to which politics in Central and Eastern
   European (CEE) regions are becoming Europeanized. Existing analyses
   suggest that Europeanization and regionalization in CEE have been
   loosely related phenomena. These claims, along with broader forecasts
   about the waning post-accession influence of the European Union (EU),
   generate predictions that the politics of the regions will be `lightly
   Europeanized'. The article presents evidence to refute these
   predictions. It shows that EU norms, incentives and discourses are being
   transmitted through EU cohesion policy and becoming deeply embedded in
   the identities and strategies of Polish, Czech and Slovak regional
   officials. It further suggests that subnational actors are drawing on EU
   resources to reinforce their traditionally weak positions vis-a-vis
   their respective central states.},

Abstract = {What are the effects of deliberation about political issues by
   likeminded people? An experimental investigation involving two
   deliberative exercises, one among self-identified liberals and another
   among self-identified conservatives, showed that participants' views
   became more extreme after deliberation. Deliberation also increased
   consensus and significantly reduced diversity of opinion within the two
   groups. Even anonymous statements of personal opinion became more
   extreme and homogeneous after deliberation.},

   Chile},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS IN LATIN AMERICA},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {2},
Number = {3},
Pages = {71-97},
Abstract = {Most analyses of the judicialization of politics focus on judicial
   policy-making and rights creation; however when judicialization of
   politics unfolds in a separation of powers political context courts are
   also involved in distributing power. The task of power delineation among
   branches of government is different from policy-making or rights
   adjudication. Judicializing political disputes about power gives courts
   the opportunity to alter the balance of institutional power, to create
   stronger executives (or legislatures) and a stronger (or weaker) role
   for themselves. To illustrate these points, this article examines how
   the Chilean Constitutional Tribunal (TC) adjudicated a specific type of
   separation of powers conflict between the Legislature and the Executive
   from 1990-2005. The analysis of the TC doctrine overtime highlights how
   the TC has shifted the balance of power in the policy-making process and
   augmented its influence within the political system.},

Abstract = {In this article, we investigate the effect of political parties on
   legislative behaviour. We compile and analyse a unique dataset of all
   roll-call votes for all the sessions of the Irish Free State Seanad (the
   Upper Chamber in the legislature, 1922-36). The development of
   legislative parties inside the Irish Seanad led to the formation of
   cohesive voting blocs after 1928. This caused dramatic shifts in the
   rank-ordering of members and changed the coalition pattern. The
   establishment of disciplined parties also sealed the fate of the
   legislature when the Fianna Fail party, hostile to the Free State
   Seanad, became an organized force inside the institution.},

Abstract = {This election report presents condensed information on the election
   campaign, the results and the coalition formation of the 2009 Land
   election in Brandenburg. The SPD with its hugely popular Prime Minister
   Matthias Platzeck emerged as strongest party, leaving the Left Party in
   second and the CDU in third place. The stark difference between the
   CDU's and SPD's result in the Land election and the national election
   that was held on the same day underlines that Brandenburg is still both
   a stronghold of the SPD and a wasteland for the CDU. Coalition
   negotiations led to a - for many surprising - end of the ten year long
   SPD/CDU coalition and to the formation of the first `red-red' government
   between SPD and Left Party in Brandenburg. Accompanied by heated debates
   about the Left Party's past and the position of the SPD towards it,
   Matthias Platzeck was re-elected as Prime Minister of Brandenburg.},

Abstract = {This paper addresses the question of whether and how contemporary forms
   of popular culture engage young people with the wider world, in
   particular with respect to the formation of their political identity.
   Drawing on the result of focus groups and interviews with
   seventeen-to-eighteen-year-olds, it examines how regional, national and
   global identities emerge in talk about US and UK popular culture. This
   empirical focus is set against the background of existing research into
   the various dimensions of popular culture's relationship to politics.
   The authors conclude that popular culture can act as a device in the
   construction of collective, political identities, albeit indirectly, by
   way of young people's assessment of the source, authenticity and
   legitimacy of multiple media representations.},

Abstract = {We investigate theoretically and experimentally the crisis bargaining
   model, a dynamic game of two-sided incomplete information with player
   types drawn from a commonly known distribution. Little work has been
   done to analyze whether and how players update their beliefs in such
   games. Within the experiment we elicited beliefs from players about
   their opponent's type using a proper scoring rule. We implement two
   treatments that vary the cost of backing down to the first mover after
   initial entry, generating sharp comparative static predictions in both
   beliefs and strategies. We find that players do update their beliefs in
   the predicted directions after observing some of the action choices.
   However, we highlight evidence of conservative updating relative to
   rational expectations.},

Abstract = {This article examines the impact of European integration on the balance
   of power within national political parties. It does this by drawing on
   the results of a survey of key actors in up to 55 parties in the 15
   pre-2004 enlargement member states. The analyses show that, when they
   are involved in EU-level decision-making, party elites are relatively
   powerful vis-a-vis their national parties and that in a number of
   instances their intra-party power has also increased over time. National
   parties have, to some extent, attempted to constrain their elites but
   appear to be fighting a losing battle. Although there are some minor
   differences by country and by party, the empowerment of party elites is
   a general phenomenon. This research provides an empirical dimension to
   the existing research on the Europeanisation of national political
   parties and presents an important substantiation of the widely discussed
   democratic deficit that exists within the EU system of governance.},

Abstract = {The paper is dealing with manifestations of radicalism and extremism in
   the Slovak Republic. The ethnic, national and other minorities and the
   clashes of their identities represent the main threat in the horizontal
   competition of societal security sector in Slovak Republic. These
   manifestations of extremism are obvious not only in Slovak society but
   also within the broader European area. Slovakia has no historical
   tradition or precedent in the existence of extremism, it is interesting
   to see how and why groups formed on our territory, and therefore the
   paper is covering this issue. In conclusion those main legislative
   standards and commitments to promote human rights and freedoms are
   listed and described who seek to eliminate discrimination and extremism.
   In particular, for the most important documents related to the fight
   against extremism we consider Concept of the fight against extremism for
   2006-2010 and Criminal Law, which are likewise addressed in the paper.},

   the increasing dominance of English, both within Europe and worldwide.
   One dimension of this injustice can be characterised in terms of unequal
   dignity. In order to address linguistic injustice in this sense, the
   most promising strategy consists in implementing a linguistic
   territoriality regime, i.e. a set of legal rules that constrain the
   choice of the languages used for purposes of education and
   communication.},

Title = {From nation-building to desecuritization in Bosnia and Herzegovina},
Journal = {SECURITY AND HUMAN RIGHTS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {21},
Number = {2},
Pages = {127+},
Abstract = {The international community increasingly considers (territorial) group
   rights to be an impediment for the development of a democratic and
   well-functioning state in Bosnia and Herzegovina (Bosnia). Group rights
   are the organizing principle of the Dayton Peace Agreement (1995) which
   established Bosnia as a federal state consisting of two entities, the
   Bosniak and Bosnian Croat-dominated Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina
   (hereinafter, the Federation) and the Bosnian Serbdominated Serb
   Republic. The Federation is further subdivided into ten Cantons.
   Governmental power became concentrated in the entities rather than in
   the weak central state-level institutions. A power- sharing arrangement
   ensured that all of the three so-called constituent peoples were
   protected against decisions that might harm their vital interests.
   Although power-sharing arrangements are often considered to be a viable
   way of governing deeply-divided societies, international actors have
   regularly called for a reform of the Dayton constitution. They have
   argued that the predominance of group rights would need to be replaced
   by political, civil and social rights and stronger central state-level
   institutions. This was, and still is, thought to be necessary in order
   to stabilize the country and to move forward with Bosnia's integration
   into the European Union (EU).Therefore a nation-building programme was
   launched which aimed at stimulating a civic nationalist political
   culture in which Bosnian Croats, Bosnian Serbs and Bosniaks would
   develop a collective `Bosnian' identity. A collective Bosnian identity
   would serve to legitimize and strengthen the central state-level
   institutions.
   In this article I analyze the value and impact of the nation-building
   policy of the international community. The analysis shows that the
   nation-building effort has failed in the sense that the ethnic
   nationalist political culture has persisted and that a collective
   Bosnianidentity is absent. Bosnian politics continued to be dominated by
   ethnic nationalist political parties and ethnic group interests. I argue
   that this can be explained by the continued securitization of ethnic
   identity. In other words, each ethnic group considers its vital
   interests to be existentially threatened by the other ethnic group(s).
   Therefore, I conclude that when it comes to inter-ethnic cooperation,
   achieving good and effective government in Bosnia is not so much about
   nation-building, but about desecuritizing ethnic relations.},

   complication of social reality. Today's absence of a unitary and

   one, by and large, to adopt critical attitude toward the paradigm of

Journal = {INSIGHT TURKEY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Pages = {23-36},
Month = {WIN},
Abstract = {Despite repeated calls and promises, Turkish Cypriots live in economic,
   political and humanitarian isolation. This paper tries to address one
   aspect of it and elaborates on the legal basis of these isolationist
   practices imposed on one side of the island. It challenges the
   international legal validity of the de facto sanctions. Furthermore, it
   claims that lifting economic isolation will also serve as a confidence
   building tool between Greek and Turkish Cypriots as well as between
   Turkey and the Republic of Cyprus represented by the Greek Cypriots
   since such an act will lead to Turkey's reciprocation and the
   normalization of relations with the Republic of Cyprus. It also argues
   that neither the UN, nor the EU has ever imposed any sanctions on
   Turkish Cypriots and the policy of isolation, as such, has only been
   practiced by the Greek Cypriots and the Greeks. This paper intends to
   clarify the distinction between sanctions and non-recognition. It also
   highlights the promises made by the EU to the Turkish Cypriots, in
   particular, the one made on April 26, 2004, when the Council of the EU
   proclaimed its commitment to end the isolation of the Turkish Cypriot
   community.},

Abstract = {Scholars continue to grapple with the question of the relationship
   between economic development and democratization; prominent recent
   research has focused on the effects of economic inequality. Boix
   suggests that democratization is likelier when inequality is low,
   whereas Acemoglu and Robinson argue that democratization is likelier
   when inequality is at middling levels. Both assume that democratization
   is a function of autocratic elites' fear of the extent to which a future
   median voter would redistribute under different levels of inequality.
   Drawing on contractarian political theory, the authors suggest that
   democratization is instead a function of demands by rising economic
   groups for protection from the state. This alternative approach suggests
   that land and income inequality affect democratization differently:
   Autocracies with equal land distribution are indeed more likely to
   democratize, but contrary to the conventional wisdom, income inequality
   is more likely to promote democratization.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article was to analyze the formative role of
   Paidopolis's radio program and its impact in the learning process of the
   students from two high schools in Bucaramanga: Escuela Normal Superior
   de Bucaramanga and Instituto Santa Barbara. Data for this thesis was
   obtained from focus groups, non-participant observation, and structured
   and in-depth interviews. Also, documents were analyzed. Results from the
   data analysis showed the need to keep working in improving Paidopolis's
   radio contents to build more meaningful relationships between this radio
   program and its main receivers: the students. Moreover, it is important
   to gain recognition among professors and high school's staff to persuade
   them about the advantages that this program offers in educational
   based-settings. As a conclusion, findings offer avenues for future
   research about the impact of computer mediated technology - CMT,
   especially the radio as a non-traditional way that virtual communities
   use to interact and to learn.},

Abstract = {Single-member plurality is often thought to facilitate a two-party
   system of alternating single-party majority government. However, no
   party secured an overall majority in the 2010 UK election, which was
   followed by the formation of the first peacetime coalition government
   since the 1930s. This article assesses whether this outcome was a
   one-off occurrence or was symptomatic of longer term changes in voting
   patterns in the UK that have reduced the likelihood of singe party
   majorities. To do so it charts trends in the level of third party
   support and representation, the incidence of marginal seats, and bias in
   the treatment of the two largest parties.},

Volume = {40},
Number = {4},
Pages = {759-779},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This article utilizes the statistical analysis of an original dataset of
   African legislative seat volatility levels and three case studies to
   demonstrate that the size and configuration of politically salient
   ethnic groups bear a strong relationship with patterns of legislative
   seat volatility in Africa. Legislative scat volatility is highest in
   countries where either no social group is large enough to form a
   majority on its own, or a majority group contains within itself a second
   smaller majority group; it is lowest in countries where one, and only
   one, group forms a majority. In contrast, most standard explanations for
   volatility, including variations in economic performance, democratic
   period of origin and democratic duration, do not appear relevant in the
   African context.},

Abstract = {This paper hypothesizes that analyzing the geo-economic and energy
   security characteristics of gas supplies to Europe may help in
   understanding the features of regional and international relations with
   regard to selected countries. The paper highlights the significance of
   natural gas in the New Energy Order, and points to the importance of
   supply security for the EU. It looks at Russia, Azerbaijan,
   Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Iran, Iraq, Egypt, Libya and Algeria as
   suppliers and Turkey as a transit country in an emerging gas corridor to
   Europe. It examines supply-side opportunities, which promote new fields
   of international cooperation based on gas trade, and addresses certain
   restraints that may reduce the likelihood of further regional
   cooperation. Economic and geographic factors create new opportunities
   for regional trade and international relations. This geoeconomic aspect,
   however, takes place with international security issues varying from
   case to case.},

Abstract = {Given America's widespread contempt for Islamic extremists, Obama's
   Muslim-sounding moniker could have cost him electoral support.
   Consequently, anecdotal evidence suggests that Obama played a ``name
   game{''}in which he deflected suspicions about his religious background
   by avoiding use of his middle name (Hussein) and minimizing the
   frequency with which his opponents used it. Did the presentation of
   Obama's name affect how voters evaluated him? Results from a web-based
   experiment suggest that the answer varies by political orientation.
   Among Republicans and conservatives, Obama's favorability ratings are
   generally lower when his middle name is present. Name presentation had
   little effect on Democrats and liberals, and moderates and independents
   rated the president more favorably when his middle name appeared.
   Regardless of party identification or political ideology, name
   presentation had no effect on the probability of voting for Obama.},

Abstract = {Turkey is facing a tough choice: if it wants to emerge as a ``first
   world'' economy and a liberal democracy, it needs to protect its
   interests in the West and expand ties with the United States. Such a
   choice would dictate both internal and foreign policy priorities,
   different from policies aimed at becoming a leader of the Muslim/Middle
   Eastern world. If, instead, Turkey prefers to be a ``Sultan{''} in the
   East, it will continue to emphasize the priorities that are now in
   place: attack Israel, develop ties with radical Islamists from Tehran to
   Gaza to Khartoum, and irreversibly change the nature of the country.},

Abstract = {This commentary studies the results of the constitutional referendum
   that took place on September 12, 2010. It argues that the results
   underscore the Turkish people's determination to do away with the
   current constitutional order created by the military regime following
   the 1980 coup and to write a new constitution that responds to the needs
   of contemporary Turkey. The commentary situates the positioning of the
   political parties in the constitutional referendum in the background of
   the structural changes that Turkish society has been going through in
   recent decades. It thus argues that the main cleavage in Turkish
   politics is no longer the traditional left-right ideological axis.
   Rather, the main line of division is between the static and reactionary
   forces comprising the old elites who seek to maintain their conventional
   privileges, and the progressive forces from the periphery who seek to
   gain political representation commensurate with their newly acquired
   wealth.},

   Campaigns},
Journal = {PARTY POLITICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {16},
Number = {5},
Pages = {608-628},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The concept of policy transfer (or `lesson-drawing') has been used by
   theorists of public policy to explain how programmes developed in one
   context emerge in another. This article explores how far the insights of
   policy transfer can be used to understand better how campaign strategies
   move cross-nationally in cases where lender and borrower campaigns can
   be identified. Drawing on the policy transfer literature, it puts
   forward the following hypotheses: (1) transfers are from incumbent to
   opposition parties; (2) transfers are between parties with similar
   ideological positions; (3) the US is the dominant lender country; (4)
   party leaders, party staff and consultants are the agents of transfer;
   and (5) campaign strategy transfer is increasing over time. Based on a
   set of 32 election campaigns from the UK, USA, Israel and Germany, the
   article finds high levels of support for hypotheses 2-4 but more limited
   support for hypotheses 1 and 5. Like policy transfer, campaign strategy
   transfer involves a range of personnel from like-minded parties, with
   the United States as the predominant lender. However, campaigners appear
   more willing than policy-makers to learn `negative lessons' (Dolowitz
   and Marsh, 2000: 12), and there is no evidence that campaign strategy
   transfer is becoming more prevalent over time.},

Abstract = {This article discusses the impact of European integration on minority
   policies in Greece and Turkey. The history of minorities and the
   evolution of state policies in Greece and Turkey are examined. The paper
   argues that minority policies have rested upon the logic of
   marginalization, intimidation and reciprocity in both countries.
   However, European integration has provided policymakers in Athens and
   Ankara with a framework to legitimize their reform policies. Thus,
   significant improvements in minority policies have taken place in the
   last two decades, even though shortcomings remain.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {49},
Number = {1},
Pages = {75-96},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Terrorism is an instrument for groups that cannot achieve their
   political goals legally. One important strategic function of terrorism
   is to weaken the government - either directly by attacking
   representatives or supporters of the government or indirectly by causing
   a political response that is unpopular among the population. Often,
   however, political stability of the home government is buttressed by
   foreign powers. In this case, the terrorists can have a strategic
   interest in attacking nationals of these foreign countries. This article
   analyses this logic by looking at international alliances as a proxy for
   international support. If the friend of my enemy is my enemy, then
   terror entrepreneurs, which seek to overthrow their home country's
   government (the enemy), may find it attractive to target nationals of
   the foreign allies of their country (the friends of the enemy). The
   theory in this article predicts that attacking nationals of a foreign
   ally is particularly attractive if this ally is militarily more powerful
   than the home country. Moreover, the combined effect of alliance and
   relative power differentials becomes stronger the more democratic the
   ally and becomes weaker the more democratic the terrorists' home
   country. Empirical support for the hypotheses in this article is found
   in an analysis of a directed country dyad sample of international
   terrorism.},

Abstract = {The new Parliament will be asked at some point to make critical
   decisions about the BBC's future at a time when it is facing
   full-frontal assaults from competitors who view the BBC as a major
   barrier to their own advancement. Whether it be newspaper groups seeking
   to monetise their online activities, commercial children's channels,
   terrestrial competitors or the owners of music radio stations, media
   conglomerates rail against the BBC's size and public funding with
   increasing regularity. Our aim is to remind our legislators of the vital
   contribution this institution makes to British life: from a journalism
   inscribed with values of fairness, integrity and impartiality-and valued
   throughout the world for its professional engagement with foreign
   affairs-to its creative commitment to British story-telling, music,
   comedy, arts and children's programmes, the BBC's contribution to our
   democratic and cultural welfare is immense. It is a beacon for Britain,
   which provides social glue for its citizens at a time of fragmenting
   audiences and identities, within a uniquely non-commercial space,
   accountable to both Parliament and its licence payers. It may distort
   the market, much as the National Health Service distorts the market for
   health care, but is held in high esteem by the British public and is
   admired throughout the world. This article explains why the BBC is a
   national treasure that underpins our creative economy as well as our
   cultural vitality, and argues that it must be protected from those who
   argue self-interestedly for its diminution.},

Abstract = {Micro and small firms in retail industry are also involved in technology
   enabled business practices. Being an important market segment for
   consumer goods suppliers operating under Supply Chain Management
   principles, retail formats such as ``the corner store{''} or ``Pop \&
   Mom store{''} and others of the kind as pharmacy, clothes boutiques,
   stationery, etc, have enter in electronic business processes and
   operations for inventory management, sales register, electronic payments
   and shelf management because their competitiveness and sometimes
   survival is at stake due to the aggressive competition of other formats
   as the convenience stores and mega stores. Generating Mexico's 23\% GNP
   and being employment source for 79\% of the country's Economic
   Population, learning about the technology position of the Micro Stores
   (MS) and is a key issue and the identification of technology use best
   practices could be a useful input to define supportive polices at
   industry level. In this MS world, suppliers problems originated by the
   scattered distribution channel are visible due to the high dispersion of
   the Point of Sales (POS) being an example the state of Tamaulipas with
   14 032 Micro Stores and 137 in the Mega Store format. Commercial
   activities in the Mexican-USA border zone (TamaulipasTexas) also
   reflects a specific competitive pattern due to cultural habits in which
   Mexican consumers do shopping in the North American side of the border,
   enhancing their shopping span. To identify technology enabled best
   business practices in the MS both sides of the border, a research
   project was developed analyzing data collected from 86 firms using
   technology enabled processes. Results reveal that the Mexican business
   model (planogram, shelf distribution, marketing mix and technology use)
   has evolved and updated in the North American side of the border where
   Information technology is used to gain efficiencies in operational
   processes as inventory control, to enhance customer service (electronic
   payments, money transfer, ATM services, and store and parking internal
   security), as well as information source by the means of store
   allocation maps presented in a structured web page. Results provide a
   wide scenario of the Micro Stores technology platform and present the
   main components of the best business practice identified which are
   feasible to adopt by the Mexican MS or by business of the kind in other
   countries, to be competitive.},

   The more music from Weinberg's pen becomes known, the more clear it
   becomes that this Soviet composer of Polish-Jewish origin was not only
   one of the most productive but also one of the most creative of the 20th
   century. He completely mastered the mediums of music and drew on its
   wealth of folkloric and artistic sources for his work. The power of his
   music can make life better. The question is raised all the more: How
   could it take so long for this music to come into its own?},

Abstract = {Social justice it's always refer to a subject conception, and related to
   that, to what is consider to be a fundamental demand towards society.
   Being the base for the construction of practices and theories around
   justice, this conception takes part in the ways in how it's concibed
   redistribution laws, solidarity policies, economic models, forms of
   understanding human development, economic crisis and the ways to get
   through them. Invariably, it determines what is `fare' -and, as a
   consequence, the field of the public and personal duty- since the idea
   of what have to be unconditionally respected for the human being, that
   also defines the content of the public subject. This paper analyses this
   juxtaposition between the anthropological and the normative spheres,
   taking as starting point the analysis of the critique dimension of
   Emanuel Levinas's moral philosophy. The Levinas's critique to the
   ``empty hands{''} moral, allow us to reconstruct the most important
   elements of the public subject and subjectivity notions, that, in modern
   history, derive in the several justice concepts, and, as a consequence,
   in different ethical and political understandings of poverty.},

Abstract = {Pre-electoral fiscal manipulation-spending more or taxing less prior to
   an election-is an important tool that governments possess to enhance
   their chances for reelection. Existing explanations of pre-electoral
   fiscal manipulation focus primarily on domestic characteristics. We
   extend this line of inquiry by examining international influences on
   governments' decisions to engage in pre-electoral fiscal manipulation.
   We find that international scrutiny of the economy and international
   scrutiny of elections affect pre-electoral fiscal manipulation in
   cross-cutting ways. Using data from 1990 to 2004 for 94 developing
   countries, we show that pre-electoral fiscal manipulation is more likely
   when international election monitors make direct election manipulation
   more difficult, and it is less likely when governments are subject to
   international economic scrutiny resulting from an IMF agreement.},

Abstract = {I present five theses on the common within the context of the
   transformations of capitalist social relations as well as their
   contemporary global crisis. My framework involves ``cognitive
   capitalism,'' new processes of class composition, and the production of
   living knowledge and subjectivity. The commons is often discussed today
   in reference to the privatization and commodification of ``common
   goods.'' This suggests a naturalistic and conservative image of the
   common, unhooked from the relations of production. I distinguish between
   commons and the common: the first model is related to Karl Polanyi, the
   second to Karl Marx. As elaborated in the postoperaista debate, the
   common assumes an antagonistic double status: it is both the plane of
   the autonomy of living labor and it is subjected to capitalist
   ``capture.'' Consequently, what is at stake is not the conservation of
   ``commons,'' but rather the production of the common and its
   organization into new institutions that would take us beyond the
   exhausted dialectic between public and private.},

Abstract = {In the last 20 years, the idea that the social realm is under threat of
   decline or collapse has been a central theme in academic literature and
   political analysis. In this short paper I explore the meaning of social
   decline and its relationship to multiculturalism and diversity. Using
   the twin notions of participation and trust as two key measures of
   social decline, I argue that participation has not so much declined over
   the last 40 years (as Robert Putnam, for example, has argued) as it has
   changed because of what I call the politics of the us's groups
   historically oppressed (including women, ethnic and racialized
   minorities and gay, lesbian and disabled citizens) who have created new
   kinds of advocacy organizations in order to change the norms of civil
   society itself. I also argue that such changes (while often perceived as
   negative in relation to a transcendent ``us{''}) are positive to the
   extent that they have made society more inclusive, respectful of
   diversity and just. Trust, on the other hand, has declined but, 1 argue,
   this is also due to the politics of diversity as the us's fought for
   change and other groups responded by defending traditional norms and
   values, often in the name of a transcendental us, creating a vicious
   circle of distrust as each side feels betrayed by the other's victories.
   Thus, I conclude, to understand social decline, in terms of
   participation and trust, we must pay attention not only to the us but
   also to the us's in civil society. The tendency, therefore, to champion
   a transcendent us in order to reverse social decline, as many scholars
   and politicians seem prone to do in recent years, not only ignores the
   us's but may foreclose on their hope for a future free from
   discrimination and hate.},

Abstract = {Many hypotheses in U.S. state politics research are multi-level,
   positing that state-level variables affect individual-level behavior.
   Unadjusted standard errors for state-level variables are too small,
   leading to overconfidence and possible false rejection of null
   hypotheses. Primo, Jacobsmeier, and Milyo (2007) explore this problem in
   their reanalysis of Wolfinger, Highton, and Mullin's (2005) data on the
   effects of post-registration laws on voter turnout. Primo et al.
   advocate the use of clustered standard errors to solve the
   overconfidence problem, but we offer an alternative solution:
   randomization tests. Randomization tests are non-parametric tests that
   do not rely on comparisons to theoretical test statistic distributions.
   Instead, they use distributions tailored to the data, created by
   randomly scrambling the data many times to simulate what would be
   observed under the null hypothesis. Unlike with clustering, with the
   randomization test, U.S. state-level reforms generally fail to be
   significant both as additive effects and as interactions with individual
   characteristics.},

Abstract = {The authors address the puzzle of why governments have implemented
   methods of early voting when those methods appear not to have an effect
   on turnout. Using an aggregate analysis, the authors find that early
   voting seems to produce a short-lived increase in turnout that
   disappears by the second presidential election in which it is available.
   They also address whether the additional costs to government are worth
   the negligible increase in participation. They conclude that these
   reforms merely offer additional convenience for those already likely to
   vote.},

Abstract = {Since coming to power in 1997 New Labour has introduced an enormous
   number of constitutional changes. Yet one aspect of change that has been
   frequently overlooked are those made to electoral administration, which
   had previously been largely unaltered since the 1918 Representation of
   the People Act. This article outlines the changes made, seeks to explain
   the forces behind these changes and offers a theoretical model capable
   of explaining these and other broader constitutional reforms. It argues
   that `modernisation', social change and declining political
   participation were important forces for change, but that ultimately it
   was party interest that guided the actions of Labour Party elites. As
   such, it is fruitful to consider the reform process as elite statecraft
   by using the theoretical model developed by Jim Bulpitt. British

Journal = {PUBLIUS-THE JOURNAL OF FEDERALISM},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {40},

Month = {SUM},
Abstract = {Canada is generally recognized as having more decentralized federalism
   than the United States. Even though the content of tobacco control
   policy in the two countries has been similar, the United States has had
   a more decentralized process, with policy usually led by the state
   level, while Canada has had a centralized process, with most initiatives
   coming from the federal government. This article examines this anomaly,
   utilizing two different approaches to intergovernmental relations,
   Kelemen's ``comparative federalism{''} and Hooghe and Marks'
   ``multi-level governance{''} (MLG). Overall, MLG is a better explanation
   for tobacco control policy in both countries, especially in the U.S.
   Discretionary implementation from the central level in parliamentary
   systems, unitary or federal, may be more broadly applicable than the
   legalistic implementation of separation-of-powers systems.},

Abstract = {This article examines the challenges to the ideological basis of
   Vietnam's one-party state and the state's responses to these challenges
   in the period from 1986 to the present. First, a brief historical
   overview of Vietnam's political system since formal reunification in
   1976 is presented. Next, the article considers six major challenges to
   the political legitimacy of one-party rule mounted by southern war
   veterans, communist intelligentsia, nonparty elites, peasants, retired
   senior generals, and pro-democracy activists. Taken together, the
   regime's legitimacy was challenged in three main areas: ideology,
   economic performance, and political reform. The article concludes with a
   discussion of regime responses to each of these challenges. Although the
   regime's normal default position has been repression, the regime also
   has accommodated and adjusted its policies in response to criticisms
   from below. In sum, Vietnam's one-party state rests on multiple sources
   of legitimacy and party elites are negotiating the pace and scope of
   political change.},

Abstract = {Political scientists commonly draw on history but often do not read
   actual historians carefully. This limited engagement with historians,
   and with contextual information more generally, contributes to a loss of
   historical knowledge that can undermine the validity of quantitative
   analysis. This article makes this argument by means of an examination of
   the qualitative evidence underlying the important quantitative arguments
   about the origins of electoral systems advanced by Caries Boix and by
   Thomas Cusack, Torben Iversen, and David Soskice. The article explores
   how their respective attention to historical knowledge affects the
   quality of their data, the plausibility of their hypotheses, and,
   ultimately, the robustness of their statistical findings. It also
   analyzes how such knowledge sheds new light on the causal direction
   between institutions and their economic effects.},

   between productive and unproductive labor in the economy. I discuss the
   explanations according to which the Panic and subsequent Second Great
   Depression are blamed on neoliberal ideology. I critically examine the
   call for a Keynesian solution of government regulation and stimulus,
   counterposing it to a Marxian strategy of class transformation.},

Journal = {COMPARATIVE POLITICS},

Volume = {42},

Pages = {253+},

Abstract = {Countries around the world have established quotas for women and
   minorities in electoral politics. The normative arguments often made to
   justify such measures generate three hypotheses selection, hierarchy,
   and competition which do not account for empirical patterns in how,
   where, and when groups receive guarantees. Working inductively, this
   article proposes an alternative explanation highlighting the importance
   of two types of repertoires of group representation: historical
   practices with regard to group recognition and transnational influences
   in the form of international pressure and information sharing. These
   hypotheses are evaluated via case studies of four countries where
   proposals have been made for both women and minorities, revealing that
   quotas are the product of vivid struggles over what kinds of identities
   deserve recognition.},

Abstract = {Brazilian presidents have expanded the authority of the Supreme Court
   since democratization to improve governance and facilitate the policy
   pursuits of electoral winners. This conclusion contradicts insurance
   theories of judicial reform, which argue that incumbents promote
   judicial power when they foresee an electoral defeat in order to
   constrain future majorities. In contrast, analysis of judicial reform in
   Brazil suggests that powerful courts are not antithetical to the
   interests of elected governments, and that even politicians who expect
   to remain in office may find it beneficial to support and promote
   independent judicial authority. As observed in Brazil, a court that is
   institutionally subject to politics may provide incumbents with benefits
   that exceed the costs usually associated with judicial review.},

Abstract = {Though sociological approaches to European Union (EU) studies are
   diverse, most share a distinctive conceptual and methodological core.
   Their novel project is to set aside most of the theoretical dichotomies
   that have organized earlier EU literature - like national/supranational,
   state/society, objective/subjective, ideational/material - and to
   attempt to pose open-ended questions about the spatial and interpretive
   `fields of action' that actors in the European Union perceive around
   themselves. Behind this project looms the figure of Pierre Bourdieu,
   even if he is invoked to varying degrees by the members of this emerging
   school. The strength of Bourdieu-inspired approaches is that they cut
   through analytic dichotomies to offer nuanced, concrete accounts of
   practical action. Their weakness is that their rejection of old
   dichotomies leaves them unwilling to state how much they are distinctive
   from other approaches. This essay suggests that a re-engagement with old
   distinctions will allow these scholars to unpack, recombine and so
   strengthen their aspirations to a novel synthesis. Comparative European

Abstract = {Whereas state actors from new EU member countries receive formal
   representation and voting rights that safeguard against their
   marginalisation in the system of EU governance, civil society
   organisations from new member states find it much harder to gain access
   to decision-making processes at the EU level. However, as many of them
   work on issues that are now (at least partly) decided at the EU level,
   participation in EU governance should become an integral part of their
   strategy. Based on a quantitative assessment of membership data for
   European umbrella organisations and on case studies for which interviews
   with leading civil society actors were conducted, this article gives a
   first comparative assessment of the actual participation of civil
   society organisations from the Central and East European member states
   in EU governance. Acta Politica (2010) 45, 229-246. doi:

   because only observational data has been available, demonstrating a
   cause-and-effect relationship has proven to be difficult. I use original
   experiments to verify that there is a small but significant causal link
   between elite polarization and voter consistency. These findings have
   important normative implications for our understanding of the
   consequences of elite polarization, the role of political parties in a
   modern democracy, and the standards scholars use to assess citizen
   competence and participation.},

   the Transatlantic Alliance is about to face. The article consists of
   four parts. The first part contemplates upon the term ``success{''} in
   Afghanistan and evaluates the efforts of the Transatlantic Alliance. The
   second part focuses on the lessons learned in the war on terror leading
   to the third part where NATO's new approach in Afghanistan is explored.
   The final chapter discusses the future of NATO in relation to the

Title = {Ending the liberal hegemony: Republican freedom and Amartya Sen's theory
   of capabilities},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {5-24},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {While being generally appreciative of Sen's theory of capabilities, the
   point of this paper is to raise some conceptual challenges that arise in
   addressing entrenched conditions of power and domination from the
   capability paradigm. The enhancement of people's capability prospects
   with regard to education, employment, decent living standards and
   political participation can empower them to challenge various dominating
   conditions in society. It can also bestow a sense of self-confidence in
   people to stand up against discriminating practices. Yet, the objectives
   of the capability theory remain less secure as long as citizens'
   capability prospects are dependent on and subjected to arbitrary power
   and domination. I argue that Sen's theory of capabilities can be
   strengthened and developed as an effective antidote to the liberal
   hegemony in political theory by drawing on resources from Pettit's
   republicanism particularly by accommodating the robustness condition of
   freedom and by envisioning individual freedom as intimately tied to the
   common good of the polity. Contemporary Political Theory (2010) 9, 5-24.

Title = {INCREASED URBAN GROWTH RESULTS IN INCREASED VULNERABILITY: HUMAN/HAZARDS
   INTERACTIONS IN THE UNCONTROLLED KATHMANDU VALLEY URBAN CONURBATION},
Booktitle = {NEPAL IN THE 21ST CENTURY},
Series = {Global Politcal Studies},
Year = {2010},
Pages = {259-284},
Abstract = {This chapter analyzes how rapid urban growth in the Kathmandu Valley has
   increased urban vulnerabilities. This study uses aerial photos,
   cartographic maps, satellite images, and aspatial data on GIS platforms
   to evaluate vulnerabilities associated with the Valley's extremely rapid
   urban spatial growth from 1955 to the present- 2008. We also analyze
   urban population growth dynamics and rapid infilling of open spaces,
   vehicular congestion, and severe problems of accesses for emergency
   vehicles to provide both general and emergency services. Our spatial
   analyses using GIS/Remote Sensing(RS) technologies suggest that urban
   spatial growth has been haphazard within the core area and rural-urban
   fringes; with unsafe building structures increasing in and around the
   Valley's many urban cores and along the side of transportation routes.
   While much of the Valley's agricultural land has been converted to urban
   uses, the infilling of open spaces has further damaged the regional
   balance and threatened its overall environmental quality. In addition, a
   proliferation of poorly constructed housing in spontaneous squatter
   settlements, which are sited in marginal locations throughout the
   Valley, has only exacerbated the vulnerability of their populations to
   seismic disturbances, flooding and landslides. Further analyses of high
   resolution aerial and World View-1 images reveals that unplanned
   infrastructure developments, narrow streets and the lack of accessible
   passages, increasing air and water pollution, and problems of waste
   disposal have made the Valley- once known for the harmony of its
   architecture and supporting fertile lands-more vulnerable than ever
   before. Taken together, these GIS/RS analyses lead us to the conclusion
   that considerable urban restructuring is desperately needed, under the
   management, GIS/RS monitoring and guidance of a much better informed and
   stricter regulatory regime than is presently in place, to ensure the
   sustainability of this historic city, and reverse, or at least hold up,
   the current dysfunctional slide into a heightened state of vulnerability
   and urban crisis.},

Abstract = {The appearance or imminent arrival of a `new federalism' has been a
   repeated theme in the study of federal-provincial relations in Canada
   and in the pronouncements of Canadian governments. At the same time,
   there clearly is a strong path dependency effect that acts as a check or
   limitation on the scope of change that federal governments can
   accomplish, leaving Canadian history littered with the corpses of `new
   federalisms' that have never been realized. While there is much that
   separates recent scholarly interventions on the new federalism, all
   recognize the need to restore a greater measure of political legitimacy
   and functionality in federal-provincial relations by building consensus
   on rules and norms of behavior. This paper surveys the history of `the
   new federalism' as a political strategy and program, and analyzes the
   competing interpretations of the concept that are currently on offer. I
   conclude that policy challenges looming on the horizon will demand a
   coordinated and multilevel response from governments, making it likely
   that whatever new federalism emerges will continue the trend toward
   shared jurisdiction and policy-making, rather than disentanglement.},

Abstract = {Formal modelling is a methodological tool in expansion Within Current
   political science. Its use is based on a deductive strategy that allows
   LIS to obtain propositions, prediction or results from a series of
   assumption, through the use of mathematical methods. To do so, the
   scientists have to convert the informal model into a mathematical one,
   resolve it analytically or numerically and empirically asses the
   results. This validation will determine the usefulness of the model and
   the extent to which generalize the findings. Both possibilities and
   limitations of this methodology are determined oil the basis of the
   specific properties of the mathematical techniques used.},

Pages = {31-50},
Abstract = {This article explores the potential links and contradictions between
   conservatism and feminism in the light of the British Conservative
   Party's recent claim to `ideological renewal' under David Cameron. It
   identifies a number of long-standing, significant and sometimes
   unexpected overlaps and resonances between some conservative ideas as
   these have developed in the party over time, and some elements of
   feminist thought. However, the article also argues that no strand of
   conservative thought supports the robust analysis that would be needed
   to tackle entrenched gender inequalities and injustices, while many of
   the party's underlying assumptions are deeply anti-feminist. This means
   that Cameron's pro-feminist rhetoric is likely to be both divisive and
   incapable of realization, so that a focus on feminism highlights the
   hazardous nature of his attempt at ideological renewal.},

Abstract = {In this paper we aim to shed some light on networks of international
   solidarity that are willing to accept convergence with the voiceless
   subaltern groups of the Global South without trying to teach them a path
   to salvation (in this respect, they differ from the old ``proletariat
   internationalism{''} that ultimately served the state) or intervening in
   their activities in order to lead them to a ``revolutionary haven{''}.
   We shall also reflect on the transnational networks that bridge the gap
   between social organizations of the Global North and South more
   directly. At the present time, however, the Global South has not been
   constituted as such; in our opinion, there are only processes of
   articulation. We shall attempt to explore the lines of regional
   articulation of the Global South in the globalization processes. We
   consider that in many ways these do not happen fortuitously or in the
   abstract, but are shaped around fields of geographical proximity and/or
   cultural affinity. Along these same lines, we shall examine how
   Iberian-American geopolitical representation, promoted by the
   governments of the Spanish-speaking Latin American republics, plus
   Portugal and Spain - especially the latter - could become a space of
   counter-representation thanks to the work of ``translation{''} of social
   activists in the field of cultural affinity; indeed, it is a space that
   links two countries from the Global North (once again, Spain in
   particular) and their social organizations, with one of the political
   articulations of the Global South.},

Abstract = {We examine spatial patterns of mass political participation in the form
   of volunteering and donating to a major statewide election campaign.
   While these forms of participation are predictably associated with the
   political and socioeconomic characteristics of the precincts in which
   the participants reside, we find that these statistical relationships
   are spatially nonstationary. High-income neighborhoods, for example, are
   associated with stronger effects on participation at some locations more
   than at others. By using geographically weighted regression (GWR) to
   specify local regression parameters, we are able to capture the
   heterogeneity of contextual processes that generate the geographically
   uneven flow of volunteers and contributors into a political campaign.
   Since spatial nonstationarity may well be a rule rather than an
   exception in the study of many political phenomena, social scientific
   analyses should be mindful that relationships may vary by location.},

Year = {2010},
Volume = {18},
Number = {2},
Pages = {195-223},
Abstract = {This survey aims to analyze the state of intra-party democracy (IPD) in
   Thailand. IPD is defined as a characteristic of the distribution of
   decision-making power among members and leaders within a political party
   along the two principal dimensions of inclusiveness and
   decentralization. The amount of organizational details that could be
   used to describe parties' procedures with regard to all aspects of their
   internal life is placed into three generalizable categories: candidate
   selection, setting party policies, and coalition formation procedures.
   In addition, this survey provides some background on the territorial
   spread, membership developments and funding practices of political
   parties. The overall finding is that the degree of internal democracy of
   political parties in Thailand is quite limited. Thai political parties
   tend to be `electoral parties' with weak organizations, low policy
   capacity and vague ideologies. The development of political parties
   since 1997 (and before the 2006 coup) can best be described as a process
   of party centralization without institutionalization. This has produced
   significant consequences for the realization of internal democracy
   within political parties: weak internal organization decision-making
   remains largely informal and is controlled by a limited number of party
   elites. This general result has important implications regarding the
   prospects of party politics in Thailand and democratic consolidation.},

Abstract = {This work performed a comparative analysis of the labour markets and its
   relationship with the social spending in Latin America using indicators
   of labour market from tabulated of the Permanent Survey in Homes in 18
   countries of the continent and data of the Commission for analysis of
   public expenditure of ECLAC. The paper argued that, there are two
   welfare models in Latin America and are structured from the interaction
   between occupational model and the specific characteristics of labour
   market. The difference in both groups lies in the ways that the
   population are integrated.
   The article conclude that the role of the informal sector in economic
   growth and in the processes of social stratification, makes the
   informality a differential factor because produce that the social
   exclusion appears in two levels; first in terms to stay inside or
   outside of the occupational structure; second to stay incorporated in a

Abstract = {On May 2007 there was held the eight democratic local elections in
   Spain. Considering the significative importance acquired by these types
   of elections in all democratic systems, the aim of this article is
   identify its main characteristics, in order to explore the relations
   between parliamentary and local elections in Spain. We would tests the
   nature of local elections called second-order national elections. In
   fact, the results of second-order elections are often interpreted as an
   indication of the current balance between national political forces.
   Because this, some voters may choose to give observers a signal of their
   current national concerns, rather than cast a vote based upon
   consideration of the issues facing the second-order arena. That can led
   to lower the level of participation; brighter prospects for small and
   new political parties, and finally, losses for government parties. We
   ask whether the local elections can be better understood as national,
   rather than local, contests. It deals with some attempts to explain some
   systematic differences between behavior at different types of elections
   in the same political system.},

Abstract = {Nuclear arms control is high on the international agenda again. With
   START expired, the US and Russia have been taking more time than
   envisaged to negotiate a START follow-on treaty. The agreed further
   reductions are far from impressive. As regards future nuclear arms
   reductions, much will depend on the politicalstrategic climate between
   the US and Russia as well as on the regional (NATO) and global (nuclear
   non-proliferation) levels. Instead of fixating on the end-goal of a
   nuclear weapons free world, international attention should focus on the
   small but concrete legal steps towards meaningful nuclear arms
   reductions. The new START should be only the beginning.},

Abstract = {This paper draws a map on the perceptions of the Basque citizens in
   relation to science and technology. It intends to analyze the overall
   assessment of the scientific activity and its results. To this aim, the
   perception of the social role of science in general (contribution of
   scientific knowledge, consideration of the scientific profession) and
   narratives on scientific systems in particular (from complementary
   perspectives on the funding of research and risk management) have been
   distinguished. The results show that science and scientist deserve a
   positive assessment, while, on the contrary, the way of governing
   science and technology is questioned.},

   fails to consider seriously enough the role of passions and collective

   make it ultimately futile. More precisely, it will be argued that such a

   is built upon some anthropologically pessimistic assumptions that, in
   the final analysis, are theoretically abstruse.},

Abstract = {This text, having as a departure point the proposals from the social
   model of disability, tends to a theorethical framework beyond them. To
   comprehend disability as a social phenomenon it is neccesry to develop
   an historical genealogy of its current dimensions, and also an
   analithical explanation of the daily inscription of this historical
   structures in the experience of disabled people. These implies the
   consideration of disciplinary technologies proposed by Foucault, in
   connection with the Theory of Practice developed by Bourdieu. Upon this
   conceptual fremework, emerge the social model ``great omission{''}: the
   body; body as recipient of opressive social structures that experiment
   disabled people. Take in consideration this embodiement as key reflexion
   issue will provide, in the future, the oportunity to overcome
   limitatinos that constrict the three perspectives on disability
   evaluated: the one concerned with handicap, the one concerned with
   disability, and the other one which, as a critical not consolidated
   proposal, talks about functional diversity.},

Abstract = {This paper explores some of the ways the question of antisemitism
   figures in the political writings of Jurgen Habermas It pays tribute to
   Habermas determination to confront the legacy of European antisemitism
   in his re constructive politics especially in relation to his vision of
   the postnational constellation It also addresses the limitations of an
   approach to antisemitism which grants key analytical status to a
   national postnational dichotomy The last part of the paper concerns the
   transmutation of the content of postnational theory from offering a
   critical engagement with the legacy of European antisemitism into a
   standard of judgment that contrasts an idealized image of Europe as a
   postnational political community with a particulansed image of Israel as
   the incarnation of the defects of nationalism I argue that this is an
   uncritical turn It is not the product of any change in Habermas own work
   but of a misappropriation of his theory that nonetheless has roots in
   what it misappropriates The paper calls for more attention to be given
   to the symbolic universe through which antisemitism functions},

Title = {Measuring Variance in Subnational Regimes: Results from an Expert-Based
   Operationalization of Democracy in the Argentine Provinces},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS IN LATIN AMERICA},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {2},
Number = {2},
Pages = {13-52},
Abstract = {This paper presents an expert-based operationalization strategy to
   measure the degree of democracy in the Argentine provinces. Starting
   with a mainstream and ``thick{''} definition of regime type, I assess
   each of its aspects using a subjective or perception-based approach that
   taps the knowledge of experts on the politics of each province. I
   present and justify the methodological design of the resulting Survey of
   Experts on Provincial Politics (SEPP) and conduct a preliminary analysis
   of its results. Some aspects of the provincial regimes appear to be
   clearly democratic, while others are mixed or even leaning towards
   authoritarianism. Moreover, some show little interprovincial variance,
   while others vary considerably from province to province. An analysis of
   the central tendency and dispersion of the survey items allows for a
   general description of the Argentine provincial regimes. Inclusion is
   the most democratic dimension, while the effectiveness of institutional
   constraints on the power of the Executive is the most deficient.
   Electoral contestation is generally free of traditional forms of fraud,
   but incumbents often command far more campaign resources and media
   attention than do their challengers. Physical repression is rare, but
   opponents in some provinces face subtler forms of punishment. While the
   survey does not uncover any clear cases of subnational authoritarianism,
   stricto sensu, provincial regimes do vary significantly from basically
   democratic to clearly hybrid.},

Abstract = {The Naga intra-community dialogue is one of the most distinctive
   community-based dialogue processes in the world for the prevention,
   management and resolution of violent ethnic conflicts. Ongoing since the
   1950s, the Naga dialogue has gained strong momentum since 2000 as a
   result of its growing capacity to address issues of violence and
   security in Naga-inhabited areas in India. The dialogue enjoys popular
   support as the formal ceasefire agreements between the Union Government
   and the Naga militant actors have failed to address issues of
   inter-factional violence and civilian deaths. The article argues that
   the Naga intra-community dialogue enjoys legitimacy in Naga society due
   to its representative character and visible impact in controlling the
   `escalation' of violence in society. The article also argues that the
   formal Naga peace negotiations between the Government of India and the
   National Socialist Council of Nagalim-Isak-Muivah-NSCN (IM) will become
   more effective and inclusive in character if it is firmly rooted in the

   2009 Election},
Journal = {POLITIKON},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {37},
Number = {1},
Pages = {3-23},
Abstract = {This article analyses South Africa's 2009 general election, the fourth
   of the democratic era. It contends that while the pre-election period
   created a number of opportunities for the principal opposition parties,
   the outcome was a disappointment for them, at least in terms of
   seriously eroding the national electoral dominance of the ruling African
   National Congress (ANC). The article seeks to offer a number of
   explanations for the ANC's fourth consecutive victory while also
   recognizing that 2009 did not provide it with an unambiguously positive
   mandate. The outcome might best be characterized as one of qualified
   hegemony in which the ANC may now have passed its electoral high water
   mark. The 2009 poll has created some useful bridgeheads for the
   opposition from which they can make further advances if they can
   demonstrate the tactical flexibility, the political acumen, the
   organizational skills, and the staying power to do so.},

Title = {Governance for Sustainable Development at the Inter-subnational Level:
   The Case of the Network of Regional Governments for Sustainable
   Development (nrg4SD)},
Journal = {REGIONAL AND FEDERAL STUDIES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Pages = {127-149},
Abstract = {Subnational entities increasingly exert agency in multilateral decision
   making. Since they are often not recognized as actors in multilateral
   bodies, they use several mechanisms to gain representation. An example
   of an extra-state mechanism is the participation in inter-subnational
   networks. This article is about the Network of Regional Governments for
   Sustainable Development (nrg4SD), a network that focuses on sustainable
   development and that has a unique global scope, addressing the UN
   institutions above all. A first part of our analysis shows that,
   although it is a relatively young initiative, nrg4SD has evolved into an
   institution with a permanent character, but subsequently went through a
   period of stagnation and criticism. It also demonstrates that, besides
   offering subnational entities an extra-state route to multilateral
   decision making, it entails an important internal dimension as well,
   through the promotion of policy learning and bilateral co-operation. The
   second part of the article offers a comparative analysis of three of the
   network's members (Flanders, the Basque Country and North
   Rhine-Westphalia), which shows that they have diverging views on nrg4SD
   and its functioning and use their participation in very different ways
   and with different results.},

Abstract = {The article is interested in the main reasons for the emergence and
   enforcement of party bans in sub-Saharan Africa. While the introduction
   of legal provisions that allow for the banning of particularistic
   political parties is the standard on the African continent, few
   countries actually use these provisions and actually deny registration
   or ban existing parties. We use qualitative comparative analysis to
   compare the introduction of party bans and the patterns of
   implementation across all sub-Saharan countries. Our analysis shows that
   structural conditions do matter. Countries that did not introduce legal
   provisions to ban political parties combine a British colonial
   background and a stronger tradition of multi-party democracy. With
   regard to the decision to actually use these provisions our analysis
   shows the interaction of two conditions to be decisive: Countries which
   have experienced ethnically motivated violence in the past and which are
   at the same time `liberalizing' their regimes rely on party bans to
   restrict political party competition.},

   systems influence both the supply of news and citizens' awareness of
   events in the news. Public service-oriented media systems deliver hard
   news more frequently than market-based systems. It follows that for
   citizens living under public service regimes, the opportunity costs of
   exposure to hard news are significantly lowered. Lowered costs allow
   less interested citizens to acquire political knowledge. Our analyses
   demonstrate that the knowledge gap between the more and less interested
   is widest in the US and smallest in Scandinavia.},

Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {14},
Number = {5},
Pages = {573-588},
Abstract = {This article seeks to show that liberal law continues to justify and
   legitimize displacements of minority populations, even in an age of
   universal human rights. As demonstrated by the Israeli court's 1988
   decision legitimating the deportation of Mubarak Awad, citizenship and
   immigration laws provide juridical justifications for contemporary
   ethno-national settler projects. In the aftermath of a territorial
   conflict that defines or redefines the bounds of the state, native
   minority populations are vulnerable to being legally recast as `aliens'
   or `virtual immigrants'. National conflict may thus be transformed by
   legal formalism into a question of immigration law, allowing the power
   relations that produce state sovereignty to slip into the background.},

Journal = {CRITICAL STUDIES ON TERRORISM},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {3},
Number = {1},
Pages = {83-98},
Abstract = {This paper deploys a discursive approach to the `scripting' of the
   November 2008 Mumbai `terror attacks' and their aftermath, including
   ensuing debates about counter-terrorism in India. It explores the
   perspectives of a range of actors who participated in very different
   ways in the social construction of the attacks, including media
   consumers and producers, key participants in public debates, and even
   the masterminds of the attacks. Important insights into the planning and
   implementation of the attacks are drawn from phone conversations
   intercepted by Indian intelligence, between the gunmen and their
   `controllers'. The Mumbai attacks were scripted and staged in a
   conscious effort to obtain maximum media coverage, which also made the
   masterminds dependent on the media. The war story created by the media
   featured violence simply as a means of `fighting a battle', obscuring
   the significant role of violence as a display of force by both security
   forces and `terrorists'.},

Abstract = {The paper focuses on the impact of addressing the communist past
   (decommunization) in the evolution of the Civic Forum and in the
   formation of the Civic Democratic Party at the beginning of 1990s. The
   author discusses the explosive potential of removing the communist
   cadres from public administration and state enterprises, the issue of
   banning the communist party or lustration. Special attention is paid to
   disputes over how radical and thorough decommunization should be. The
   paper shows that the agenda of decommunization became a significant
   divisive factor within the Civic Forum and served as one of the key
   issues through which the Civic Democratic Party defined itself.},

Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},

Volume = {14},
Number = {2},
Pages = {185-201},
Abstract = {This paper offers a normative argument for reconfiguring borders that
   rests on a critique of intersecting logics bearing on security,
   incorporation, agency, subjectivity, encounter, and citizenship.
   Especially important to my critique is the mutually reinforcing
   relationship between border security and prevalent assimilationist and
   integrationist forms of incorporation associated with the dominant
   single-citizenship model. I offer instead an alternative framing of
   incorporation I call enfoldment, which is anchored in the contingent and
   negotiated agency and subjectivity of mobile persons and a multiversal
   understanding of societies. As I argue, one avenue for opening the
   possibilities of migrant agency and subjectivity is via what I term
   `mediated passage'. It entails shielding migrants and travellers from
   the direct control of movement by states at borders, allowing for
   passage across borders mediated by civil society organizations
   possessing independent power and authority.},

Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},

Volume = {17},

Abstract = {Regional multilateral regimes have become important instruments for
   promoting and defending democracy around the world. The novel nature of
   these regional instruments has generated a cottage industry in social
   science scholarship. Yet, none of these works compare the democracy
   promotion and defence regimes of the Organization of American States
   (OAS) and the African Union (AU). This article is designed to fill this
   gap. We argue that the unique constellation of actors that are members
   of each respective organization have reinforced two distinct democracy
   promotion and defence paths. The state-driven regime evolution
   characteristic of the Americas contrasts with Africa's expert-driven
   process of regime construction. The state-centric process of the OAS
   regime has bolstered a narrow interstate multilateralism that upholds
   traditional sovereign state prerogatives and minimizes the role for
   non-state actors in the promotion and defence of democracy in the
   Americas. The expert-driven process of AU's regime construction has
   fostered a legalistic approach to democratic promotion and defence in
   Africa and opened up space for non-state actors to play a central role
   in the development of regional democracy promotion and defence norms.},

Abstract = {Recent theories argue that decentralization induces party system
   denationalization because the transfer of financial resources and
   administrative responsibilities renders sub-national governments more
   relevant. The effect only holds if: a) voters can judge sub-national
   policies but the institutional environment prevents them from voting for
   different parties in election for offices of different level; or b) if
   sub-national party organizations have incentives to prioritize
   sub-national competition. A comparative analysis of four highly
   decentralized Latin American countries and a closer look at the
   Argentine case confirm the validity of this interpretation. The results
   suggest that decentralization may alter territorial patterns of
   political competition depending on how evolves, for other reasons, the
   relationship between arenas of different level. In order to analyze more
   conclusively the relationship between decentralization and party
   nationalization it is necessary to refine existing theories and apply
   improved estimation techniques that allow for the identification of
   endogenous effects.},

Abstract = {During times of violent conflict, states may closely scrutinize the
   loyalty of those who lead minority religious communities. November 2005
   saw elections for Islamic councils in Thailand's three southern border
   provinces. The Muslim-majority subregion had experienced escalating
   political violence since January 2004. Allegations of electoral
   manipulation were rife; the elections were proxy struggles between the
   Thai state and potential opponents. This article positions these
   elections within wider debates about the nature of the relationship
   between Islam and the state, in Thailand and beyond. It argues that
   politicizing Islamic organizations may be a dangerous game for states
   and elite actors to play.},

Abstract = {The following article offers a primary approach to the elaboration of a

   definitional problem the word ``terrorism{''} has originated in academic
   forums. It does so by identifying the source of this problem and its
   main consequences. Finally, the document proposes a comprehensive
   definition of terrorism, which aspires to be useful as a frame of
   reference for the future development of research in the field, as well
   as raw material for the formulation of public policies and anti and
   counter-terrorist strategies.},

Abstract = {In the context of integration of immigration and asylum policies,
   associations mobilizing around these issues have progressively
   Europeanized through different paths: some ``from above{''}, privileging
   a cooperation with European institutions; others ``from below{''},
   privileging protest; others, finally, have mixed both dynamics. This
   article explains these different modes of Europeanization and shows that
   they are determined by the alliance strategies of associative actors as
   well as by the logics guiding inter-institutional negotiations at the EU
   level. Moreover, in a comparative perspective, it shows that
   associations coming from different national contexts (France and
   Germany) follow similar paths of Europeanization. In doing so, it shows
   that the rise of EU competences leads to the construction of a
   diversified European space of mobilization that goes beyond national
   specificities.},

Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},

Volume = {33},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1167-1186},
Abstract = {In recent years more and more studies have pointed to the limitations of
   demand-side explanations of the electoral success of populist radical
   right parties. They argue that supply-side factors need to be included
   as well. While previous authors have made these claims on the basis of
   purely empirical arguments, this article provides a (meta)theoretical
   argumentation for the importance of supply-side explanations. It takes
   issue with the dominant view on the populist radical right, which
   considers it to be alien to mainstream values in contemporary western
   democracies-the `normal pathology thesis'. Instead, it argues that the
   populist radical right should be seen as a radical interpretation of
   mainstream values, or more akin to a pathological normalcy. This
   argument is substantiated on the basis of an empirical analysis of party
   ideologies and mass attitudes. The proposed paradigmatic shift has
   profound consequences for the way the populist radical right and western
   democracy relate, as well as for how the populist radical right is best
   studied. Most importantly, it makes demand for populist radical right
   politics rather an assumption than a puzzle, and turns the prime focus
   of research on to the political struggle over issue saliency and
   positions, and on to the role of populist radical right parties within
   these struggles.},

Title = {Rethinking Citizenship and Identity: `What it Means to be German' since
   the Fall of the Wall},
Journal = {GERMAN POLITICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1},
Pages = {72-88},
Abstract = {Twenty years after the Wall's collapse, East and West Germans have yet
   to achieve a sense of `inner unity'. To forge a common national identity
   not only among those citizens but also among Germans of migrant descent,
   policy-makers need to grasp the ways in which their respective identity
   trajectories have diverged over four decades. This article revisits
   western, eastern and `foreigner' identities prior to 1989; it examines
   changing opportunity structures along three generational axes, resulting
   in different degrees of identification with the homeland since 1990. It
   then reviews efforts to redefine national belonging based on recent
   legislative reforms, pushing West Germans to give up their Leitkultur
   claims along new paths to citizenship. Finally, the article reflects on
   why the nation's first woman Chancellor, Angela Merkel, could
   successfully blaze a trail through perilous territory all previous
   leaders had feared to tread.},

   Health Care Reform Debate},
Journal = {FORUM-A JOURNAL OF APPLIED RESEARCH IN CONTEMPORARY POLITICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Both Bill Clinton and Barack Obama struggled to overcome widespread and
   persistent myths about their proposals to reform the American health
   care system. Their difficulties highlight the influence of factual
   misinformation in national politics and the extent to which it
   correlates with citizens' political views. In this essay, I explain how
   greater elite polarization and the growth in media choice have
   reinforced the partisan divide in factual beliefs. To illustrate these
   points, I analyze debates over health care reform in 1993-1994 and
   2009-2010, tracing the spread of false claims about reform proposals
   from Bill Clinton and Barack Obama and analyzing the prevalence of
   misinformation in public opinion. Since false beliefs are extremely
   difficult to correct, I conclude by arguing that increasing the
   reputational costs for dishonest elites might be a more effective
   approach to improving democratic discourse.},

Abstract = {The reported reduction in the prevalence level of the Human
   Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) in Zimbabwe has been represented as one of
   the most significant and rapid declines within any population since the
   epidemic emerged as a public health issue. This paper explains how this
   development has been reported, challenged and eventually owned by many
   of the diverse stakeholders who constitute Zimbabwe's overall AIDS
   response. The Zimbabwean government has claimed that the decline was
   brought about due to its own efforts and resources. However, while the
   country has received considerably less AIDS funding than its neighbours,
   external donations still account for the vast bulk of AIDS spending in
   Zimbabwe. In addition, instead of collapsing, as some predicted, the
   Zimbabwean state can also claim that it has presided over increased
   availability of antiretroviral therapy. In this paper we examine how
   various internal and external stakeholders deployed strategic
   explanations in an attempt to take credit for `the decline'; this is an
   important case study of how epidemiological data can be used to
   construct and contest political legitimacy.},

   the Iraq War},
Journal = {IRISH POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {25},

Pages = {1-21},
Abstract = {This article focuses on the contest that defined Irish political
   discourses on the Iraq war (2003). It supplies a different angle to
   current research on international political discourses on the war, as
   Ireland's official position diverged from that adopted by pro-war
   governments (e. g. Britain, Spain, Eastern European states and
   Australia) and anti-war governments (e. g. France, Germany and Russia).
   This position was a more nuanced, or ambivalent, one that neither
   explicitly supported nor opposed the US-British decision to launch the
   war in March 2003. Principally, this article presents a discourse
   analysis of the session of Dail Eireann on 20 March 2003 which debated
   the controversial government decision to provide over-flight and landing
   facilities to the US military during the war. This analysis traces the
   ways in which both government and opposition parliamentary actors sought
   to achieve resonances between their arguments and
   historically-established `master frames' of Irish foreign policy. This
   practice of constructing frame resonances emerges as a pivotal
   ideological resource relied upon by parliamentary actors to win the
   argument regarding Ireland's response to the Iraq crisis.},

Abstract = {The problem of ontology in the work of Michel Foucault is discussed.
   First, ontology is defined as the layer of a social theory, encompassing
   the essential building blocks of the social world presupposed by that
   social theory. Second, three different ontologies in Foucault's work are
   identified, which roughly correspond to the chronological phases of his
   theorizing: the ontology of discourse (1960s), the ontology of power
   (1970s), and the ontology of the self (1980s). While it is not easy to
   bring these different ontologies together, an attempt at ontological
   synthesis is made via the concepts of productivity of power and
   governmentality. A single ``un-ontology{''} of aleatory power-politics
   is constructed as a result of that theoretical operation. Finally, some
   basic guidelines for political theorizing and research are drawn from
   that ontological world picture attributed to Foucault's theory.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the difficulties that liberal democracies face in
   accommodating a diversity of values, interests and identities in
   contexts of national pluralism (plurinational states). The first section
   analyzes the fallacy of abstraction and the distortions of the concept
   of pluralism that occur in enlightenment- based theories. The second
   section begins with a brief description of three classic institutional
   solutions for accommodating plurinational societies in liberal
   democracies: federalism, consociationalism and secession. A comparative
   analysis of nineteen decentralized federal or regional democracies is
   then discussed in order to evaluate the adequacy of federalism in
   regulating political recognition and accommodation in contexts of
   national pluralism. My conclusion suggests that these two objectives can
   only be achieved by means of plurinational federalism or partnership,
   which may also include consociational processes that regulate the
   possible secession of minority nations.},

Abstract = {This article deals with symbolic interpretations of contraception in
   context of the desire to have a child in advanced age. Based on a
   qualitative analysis of late motherhood, three empirical examples are
   being presented. They are discussed by drawing on an interpretative
   understanding of contraception as well as on approaches from family
   sociology. The first example is to interpret the first-time unprotected
   sexual intercourse as the partner's symbolic approval for having a
   child. The second example is to refer to taking a chance by
   discontinuing the use of contraception, which can be understood as a
   manifestation for the complexity of establishing a family. The third
   example is to resume taking contraceptives after a phase of an
   unfulfilled desire to have children, which may communicate a final point
   for this phase and gives information on the construction of age limits
   for motherhood.},

   reform in Russia is not finished yet and requires continuation based on
   new grounds. In order to accomplish real changes in the organization and
   activity of the judicial power, it is necessary to conduct core reforms
   not only within this very sphere, but also within other forms of

Journal = {QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Pages = {71-97},
Abstract = {We analyze democratic accountability in open economies based on
   different hypotheses about political evaluations and government
   responsiveness. Specifically, we assess whether citizens primarily rely
   on government policies or if they focus on economic outcomes resulting
   from these policies to evaluate governments. Our empirical analysis
   relies on Bayesian structural vector autoregression models for the
   British economy, aggregate monthly measures of public opinion, and
   economic evaluations from 1984 to 2006. We find that voters continuously
   monitor and strongly respond contemporaneously to changes in monetary
   and fiscal policies, but less to changes in macroeconomic outcomes.
   Voters also respond to policies differently when institutions change.
   When the Bank of England became politically independent, citizens
   shifted their attention toward fiscal policy, and the role of monetary
   policy in their evaluations decreased significantly. Finally,
   politicians respond to voting behavior by adjusting their policies in a
   sensible way. When vote intentions and approval decrease, the government
   reacts to the public by adjusting fiscal policy and, before the Bank of
   England became independent, also monetary policy.},

Journal = {CANADIAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {4},
Number = {1},
Pages = {24-41},
Abstract = {Since Confederation, the electorate responsible for the selection of
   Canadian political party leaders has progressively widened; by the end
   of the twentieth century, most parties were employing some variant of
   the universal ballot (thereby giving all party members a voice in
   leadership selection). Nevertheless, the 42 person executive of the Nova
   Scotia Progressive Conservatives rolled back this democratic tide by
   organizing a delegated convention to replace departing leader John Hamm.
   The Conservatives justified their decision by claiming that such a
   convention would be the most fair, the most equal, and the most exciting
   way to select their new leader. This article demonstrates, however, that
   these claims are difficult to substantiate. There was much drama on
   voting day, but the Conservatives were, in fact, very fortunate in that
   respect. Equality between constituencies was heightened, but only at the
   cost of introducing a substantial inequality between individual party
   members. As to fairness, it seemed entirely irrelevant to the
   proceedings. Ultimately, not even a majority of delegates approved of
   the change in process.},

Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE PEACE \& SECURITY},

Volume = {22},
Number = {3},
Pages = {261-274},
Abstract = {Previous studies nearly unanimously agree that civil conflicts are more
   likely to occur in semi-democracies than in either autocracies or
   democracies. Through multinomial regression analysis, this article
   re-evaluates this claim by testing the relationship between regime type
   and civil conflict for the post-Cold War period. Controlling for the
   material wealth of a country, the heterogeneity of the population,
   income inequalities and the size of the state, this research finds that
   the occurrence of minor intrastate wars (25 to 1000 deaths) and major
   civil wars (more than 1000 deaths) does not differ between hybrid
   regimes and auto-cracies. Only democracies have a significantly lower
   probability of experiencing intrastate fighting and warfare.},

Pages = {6-32},
Abstract = {The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, in particular the
   proliferation of nuclear weapons is one of the most discussed topics on
   different forums around the globe. The main issue remains unchanged
   already since the beginning of nuclear race in the 50s and that is the
   creation and functioning of mechanism that would limit and prevent
   countries from acquiring more and new kinds of these kinds of weapons.
   When the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) has been signed back in 1968 two
   categories of states were created, those who already possessed nuclear
   weapons, the so called nuclear powers and non-nuclear powers - states
   that committed themselves not to seek to acquire nuclear weapons in the
   future. This discrepancy persists even in 21st century, when the global
   situation has change significantly. The different perception of
   international community and different perception of threats leads some
   countries to seek to acquire nuclear weapons in order to secure their
   own security or existence, North Korea is one on these states. Besides
   the fact of undemocratic and isolated character of its regime the
   country perceives its nuclear program as a single guarantee of its
   security and also its sole existence.},

Title = {A neorepublican cultural citizenship: beyond Marxism and liberalism},
Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Pages = {259-274},
Abstract = {The idea of cultural citizenship is often associated with a present-day
   context of multiculturalism, and seen as a novel issue for political
   philosophy. Within political philosophy it has been mainly
   conceptualised within a liberal tradition focusing on (cultural) rights.
   The concept also features in cultural studies, to articulate the
   importance of artistic and media practices to citizenship. This article
   aims to orient the debate to wider theoretical concerns, and to a
   long-standing political-philosophical interest in the relation of
   politics and culture. It proposes a `broad view' of cultural
   citizenship, which moreover locates cultural citizenship in concerns
   about the public sphere. It revisits historical philosophical positions
   on the relation of politics and culture, viz those of Karl Marx and John
   Stuart Mill. The distinct conceptual models ensuing from their work both
   expound `broad views', which take the relation between politics and
   culture to impact on all citizens. The article subsequently discusses a
   recent Dutch policy report on cultural citizenship, which shows that
   these models still have topical relevance. Next, a fourfold grid is
   elaborated of weak and strong, positive and negative views on how
   citizenship is to be related to issues of culture. The article concludes
   by arguing for a neorepublican approach of cultural citizenship that
   adopts a `weak positive' view and may repair the conceptual drawbacks of
   both the liberal and Marxist views.},

Journal = {LATIN AMERICAN POLICY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {1},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {The Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) is the latest step in the
   process of construction of a new regionalism in this zone of the Western
   Hemisphere. The process began in 1993, when former Brazilian President
   Itamar Franco proposed the creation of a South American Free Trade Area
   (SAFTA). Fernando Henrique Cardoso continued the process by proposing
   the establishment of a South American Community of Nations (SACN) in
   2000. This was created in 2004 at the Summit of South American
   Presidents, held in Cusco, Peru. SACN was based on a strategy centered
   on three pillars: the trade convergence among the Andean Community, the
   Southern Common Market (Mercosur), Chile, Surinam, and Guyana; promotion
   of the South American infrastructure; and political cooperation. The
   increasing leadership of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and his
   criticism of the SACN project led to a change in South American
   regionalist strategy. The result was the formation of UNASUR in 2008.
   This article analyzes the process of construction of a new South
   American regionalism and the extent to which UNASUR could be a
   successful strategy.},

Abstract = {The language debate in President Aliaksandr Lukashenka's Belarus is a
   politically explosive topic. The struggle over how to interpret language
   history also concerns the point in time when Belarusian began its own

   present, two issues dominate: language policy since Lukashenka came to
   power and the competition between two varieties of Belarusian, a
   competition linked above all to orthography. All three discussions are
   of central importance for the self-understanding of the Belarusians as
   national and the political orientation of Belarus.},

Journal = {FRENCH POLITICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {8},
Number = {4},
Pages = {429-446},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This article aims to identify the dynamics that shape the interaction of
   national and foreign students in the French grandes ecoles (GE). It
   shows how contextual analysis and semi-directed interviews with students
   give different insights and understandings on the increasingly debated
   issue of the future and the survival of France's idiosyncratic model of
   elite selection and training in a globalizing and competitive higher
   education context. The study reveals that, unlike their French peers,
   international students attending the GE have difficulty developing a
   sense of belonging to these institutions. This finding emphasizes the
   limits to the internationalization of French GE, especially in relation
   to their comparatively restrained visibility on the international stage,
   their traditional vocation to train the senior branches of the civil
   service (grands corps de l'Etat), and above all the French concours
   (competitive exam) system for selecting the nation's elites. This
   cornerstone of the French republican ideal conveys a restrictive
   representation of merit and excellence that creates an
   established/outsider configuration between national and international
   students, respectively, that challenges the internationalization of
   these schools.},

Abstract = {The article considers the political process in raising the age of
   consent in Canada and its impact on gender and equality. The purpose of
   the legislation is the protection of children, but evidence reveals a
   gendered discourse that targets the sexuality of young women in
   particular within the context of a heterosexual family norm. The
   efficacy of this norm arises from a post-feminist policy climate in
   which neo-liberal refamilialization complements the remoralizing of the
   family by the Conservative Party of Canada and its supporters. This
   enables the characterization of the child as innocent and in need of
   protection and diverts attention from regulation of young people's
   sexuality. Conservatives manipulate this identity for political ends in
   what is termed the politics of generation. This precludes youth agency
   and reinforces inequalities of both gender and generation. Thus, moral
   regulation reaches beyond regulation of young people's sexuality to
   regulation of the broader society.},

Abstract = {The paper sheds new light on recent debates about governance and
   approaches contemporary problems of governing from the perspective of
   contemporary theories of power. The concept of ``soft governing{''} is
   developed in order to capture horizontal mechanisms of power
   intentionally used to govern beyond formalised hierarchies
   characteristic of processes of governance. The paper describes in
   particular the horizontal forms of governing through discursive
   practices, argumentation and symbols and the ways in which they
   interact. The example of campaigns against female genital mutilation is
   introduced in order to illustrate possible forms of governing beyond
   hierarchy.},

Abstract = {A common argument against flexible integration as a solution to
   increased preference heterogeneity is that a likely consequence for
   those member states opting out of the enhanced cooperation is a loss of
   status and influence generally in the European Union (EU). It has been
   argued, for example, that the decisions by Denmark, Sweden and the UK
   not to join the Euro is considered to be free-riding, which leads to a
   bad reputation and exclusion from informal networks. We test this
   proposed free-rider effect by comparing the network capital of
   Euro-outsiders with insiders in the Council of the EU, using survey data
   of more than 600 member state representatives. The findings speak
   strongly against the free-rider hypothesis, as the Euro-outsiders are
   highly ranked in terms of network capital.},

Journal = {BRITISH POLITICS},

Volume = {5},

Abstract = {From a communications perspective much of the commentary and analysis of
   the 2010 General Election focused on the possible influence of the first
   ever televised leaders' debates as well as the burgeoning range of
   online social networking sites. This article, however, concentrates on
   the role of that most traditional medium, the national press. The
   British newspaper industry has been a notable political actor; it has
   been as controversial as it has been overtly partisan. Arguably there
   have, however, been some changes to this in recent years arising from
   Labour's electoral successes and the resulting `Tony press', which was
   markedly less strident in its coverage and more supportive of the leader
   rather than his party. 2010 was interesting because there was a revival
   of the so-called `Tory press' in that these titles adopted a stridency
   not witnessed since the Conservatives last won an election in 1992.
   Consequently there is a discussion of why certain newspapers switched
   allegiances and how this impacted on their reporting. Attention is also
   given to the differences in campaign reporting by the three sectors of
   the press, and how the various newspaper readerships voted. British

Abstract = {Immigration of Turkish guest-workers to Western European countries in
   the 1960s and 1970s laid the ground for the emergence of various
   transnational religious organizations. This paper examines transnational
   organizations of Turkish origin that gained major support and membership
   in their host societies. Drawing upon a case study on Turks in Belgium,
   it shows that in the last four decades these organisations went through
   various transformations depending on the dynamics in their respective
   immigrant communities, host societies and countries of origin. This
   essay captures the role and self-adaptation process of Turkish Islamic
   organisations vis-a-vis the changing environment both in their host
   countries and countries of origin. It focuses on two Turkish
   transnational organisations in Belgium: The Islamic Federation of
   Belgium (IFB) and the Turkish Islamic Foundation of Belgium (TIFB). This
   essay concludes that political structure in the countries of origin
   constantly induces transnational organizations to further adopt and
   position themselves according to changing circumstances.},

Abstract = {Under the Communist dictatorships of Eastern Europe, room for
   independent action developed through self-publishing, samizdat. With the
   Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe
   (CSCE), human rights were enshrined in and legitimised by international
   law. The conflicts over the validity of human rights that arose the in
   Socialist countries and on the international stage constituted a new
   chapter in European politics. In retrospect, the human rights activists
   proved more foresighted and more realistic than the so-called realists.
   In this respect, the worlds of samizdat remain current.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {2},

Abstract = {In America and Western Europe, legislatures preceded democratization and
   contributed to the establishment and maintenance of democratic regimes
   in the late 18th and the 19th centuries. In Central and Eastern Europe
   in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, legislatures and democratic
   regimes appeared simultaneously. In the first 15 years of post-Communist
   transitions in 12 countries, attachments to the new regimes have been
   influenced by their institutional structures, their economic
   performance, and their records in protecting human freedom, while
   attachment to the new parliaments have been predominantly influenced by
   cultural factors related to early life socialization including
   education, age, gender, social status, and attitudes toward the former
   communist regime. Attachment to parliament was a product more than a
   cause of attachment to the new regimes, but the parliamentary system of
   government created a context that contributed to citizens' attachment to
   their new political institutions. In that respect, attitudes toward
   parliaments in Central and Eastern Europe played a role similar to the
   role that these attitudes played in an earlier stage of democratization
   in Europe and North America, the role of attaching citizens to new
   political institutions.},

Abstract = {This article examines the impact of intra-party politics on the
   coalition behaviour of political parties. The policy-seeking model of
   party behaviour is refined by differentiating between policy purity and
   policy influence, arguing that the distribution of power within
   political parties affects how inclined they are to abandon policy ideals
   to participate in coalitions and thereby gain influence on policy. Three
   contradictory hypotheses are tested in a multivariate analysis based on
   the legislative coalition behaviour of 11 Danish parties from 1953 to
   2004. The analysis shows that, among parties close to the government in
   policy terms, those dominated by the parliamentary party group more
   frequently enter binding legislative coalitions than do parties
   dominated by their national party organization. This implies that the
   ability of parties to convert parliamentary representation into actual
   influence on parliamentary decisions is conditioned by their internal
   distribution of power.},

Abstract = {Contact with the criminal justice system is greater today than at any
   time in our history. In this article, we argue that interactions with
   criminal justice are an important source of political socialization, in
   which the lessons that are imprinted are antagonistic to democratic
   participation and inspire negative orientations toward government. To
   test this argument, we conduct the first systematic empirical
   exploration of how criminal justice involvement shapes the citizenship
   and political voice of a growing swath of Americans. We find that
   custodial involvement carries with it a substantial civic penalty that
   is not explained by criminal propensity or socioeconomic differences
   alone. Given that the carceral state has become a routine site of
   interaction between government and citizens, institutions of criminal
   justice have emerged as an important force in defining citizen
   participation and understandings, with potentially dire consequences for
   democratic ideals.},

Abstract = {Reasonable accommodations, which in the framework of multiculturalism
   allow differential anti-discriminatory treatment in favour of religious
   minorities, are an important instrument in the ethnocultural integration
   policy in Canada However, the fear of excesses in the acceptance of the
   accommodations, in a context of fear of religious fundamentalism, has
   triggered an important crisis in Quebec, where the bases of
   multiculturalism and the protagonism of the law have been questioned
   This crisis, which shows the importance that delimiting the meaning of
   secularism has in our societies, led the Government of Quebec to create
   the Commission de consultation sur les pratiques d accommodement reliees
   aux differences culturelles for the purpose of knowing the in-depth
   causes of this crisis and to propose solutions to overcome it},

Abstract = {Due to public concern with undergraduate education and lack of
   government support for research, political science departments face
   important threats to viability. Scholars have proposed that the
   discipline respond by re-orienting itself to address
   publicly-acknowledged problems. I propose an alternative response: we
   should expand our service role, especially when we can engage
   undergraduates in providing public information. I have launched a
   web-based venture called the Michigan Policy Network, a student-led
   reporting and research program to report and organize information on
   Michigan state government. I describe the role of the network, propose
   similar ideas for extending the public reach of political science, and
   explain how the challenges facing the discipline look from a department
   at the state university in the state capital.},

Abstract = {This paper considers the manner and extent to which citizens'
   preferences regarding styles of political representation influence
   electoral choices, at both the nominating and the general election
   stages. Using unique survey data gathered for the purpose of examining
   this question, the authors focus on the 2008 presidential election cycle
   as an analytical case. They find considerable evidence that Democratic
   voters are more likely than Republicans to prefer a president who
   follows the wishes of the American public when it comes to making
   policy. Republicans, by contrast, are more inclined to expect a
   president to ignore public opinion, listening instead to his or her
   internal conscience. The authors speculate that this pattern helped John
   McCain capture the Republican presidential nomination, but diminished
   his chances of defeating Barack Obama in the fall.},

   contemporary crisis and change?},
Journal = {BRITISH POLITICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {5},
Number = {3},
Pages = {337-366},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This article provides a new reading of the crossover between youth
   subculture and drug consumption, and seeks to demonstrate that drug
   prohibition has entered a legitimation crisis in social and political
   policy (Habermas, 1975). This article argues that contemporary drug
   normalisation is at the centre of the apparent failure of drug
   prohibition to understand and respond to the growth in oppositional
   messages derived from digital communication and the use of drug
   representations by mainstream capitalism to sell everyday commodities
   for profit. At the same time, UK and US newspapers have questioned the
   validity of the `war on drugs' owing to political corruption and human
   rights abuses in Mexico, Afghanistan and Colombia. The article considers
   that drug normalisation has disrupted drug policy because intoxicants
   have become incorporated into everyday culture, and in particular youth
   subculture. Within the recent literature, young people's drug use has
   been theorised within a generalised framework of postmodernity. This
   article argues that drug normalisation theory is not a postmodern
   concept. It is a theory derived from the work of the Chicago School
   articulated by Alfred Lindesmith, Howard Becker and David Matza, who in
   turn influenced the UK National Deviance Conference and the subsequent
   CCCS theory of subculture. This created the theoretical opportunity to
   interpret substance consumption as a condition of normalisation separate
   from crime. British Politics (2010) 5, 337-366. doi:10.1057/bp.2010.12},

Journal = {ICELANDIC REVIEW OF POLITICS \& ADMINISTRATION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {6},

Abstract = {The aim of the paper is to examine the process of decision-making among
   public administrators and answer the question of whether this differs
   from the way decisions is arrived at in the private sector. Interviews
   were conducted at three private companies and three public institutions.
   The results indicate that the administrators of public bodies and
   private enterprises appear to use similar methods in their
   decision-making process. The differences which were revealed relate to
   the size of the companies or institutions in question, rather than to
   form of ownership; i.e. the larger the operation, the more people are
   involved in the decision-making process. An analysis of the interviews
   reveals that the administrators of public bodies have a weaker mandate
   to make decisions than is the case in private enterprises, especially
   with regard to matters involving strategy. Otherwise there is little
   difference between small private businesses and small public
   institutions - their management often apply the rational approach and
   bounded rationality model to solve problems. The decision making process
   is very similar in larger private businesses and public institutions.
   Decisions take longer to make in public institutions where more
   momentous issues are involved, such as the construction of new buildings
   and strategy formation, in which case the process is characterised by
   staged decisions, often resulting in compromises between parties with
   contrasting interests. It should also be mentioned that many kinds of
   state legislation, e.g. relating to equal opportunities, information act
   and public employees, as well as strategies of district councils, often
   restrict the decision-making authority of public administrators. Such
   restraints do not apply to the same extent to private sector management.
   The consequences of the economic collapse exercised a considerably
   stronger impact on decision-making among public administrators than was
   the case with their colleagues in the private sector, although the
   largest private company was significantly affected by the collapse.},

Abstract = {The restrictions imposed on the possibility for an individual to
   challenge European law measures and the restrictive interpretation of
   the notion of `individual concern' given by the European Court of
   Justice have been highly criticised by legal scholars and members of the
   European judiciary as being against the principle of effective judicial
   protection. This paper shows how the restrictive interpretation of the
   notion of `individual concern' developed in the case law of the European
   Court of Justice. Furthermore, the paper discusses possible improvements
   to the current system of judicial protection, such as the possibility to
   introduce a fundamental rights complaint procedure and the obligation of
   Member States to provide for effective judicial remedies before national
   courts. Finally, the impact of the modifications made by the Lisbon
   Treaty to the annulment procedure is assessed.},

Title = {The Road to Somewhere: Why Health Reform Happened Or Why Political
   Scientists Who Write about Public Policy Shouldn't Assume They Know How
   to Shape It},
Journal = {PERSPECTIVES ON POLITICS},

Abstract = {Why did comprehensive health care reform pass in 2010? Why did it take
   the form it did-a form that, while undeniably ambitious, was also more
   limited than many advocates wanted, than health policy precedents set
   abroad, and than the scale of the problems it tackled? And why was this
   legislation, despite its limits, the subject of such vigorous and
   sometimes vicious attacks? These are the questions I tackle in this
   essay, drawing not just on recent scholarship on American politics but
   also on the somewhat-improbable experience that I had as an active
   participant in this fierce and polarized debate. My conclusions have
   implications not only for how political scientists should understand
   what happened in 2009-10, but also for how they should understand
   American politics. In particular, the central puzzles raised by the
   health reform debate suggest why students of American politics should
   give public policy-what government does to shape people's lives-a more
   central place within their investigations. Political scientists often
   characterize politics as a game among undifferentiated competitors,
   played out largely through campaigns and elections, with policy treated
   mostly as an afterthought-at best, as a means of testing theories of
   electoral influence and legislative politics. The health care debate
   makes transparent the weaknesses of this approach. On a range of key
   matters at the core of the discipline-the role and influence of interest
   groups; the nature of partisan policy competition; the sources of elite
   polarization; the relationship between voters, activists, and elected
   officials; and more-the substance of public policy makes a big
   difference. Focusing on what government actually does has normative
   benefits, serving as a useful corrective to the tendency of political
   science to veer into discussions of matters deemed trivial by most of
   the world outside the academy. But more important, it has major
   analytical payoffs-and not merely for our understanding of the great
   health care debate of 2009-10.},

Title = {Fighting Corruption in Croatia with the Prospect of European Union
   Membership On the non-sustainability of EU conditionality in policy
   fields governed by the soft acquis communautaire and lessons
   learned from the previous enlargements to Slovenia, Bulgaria and Romania},
Journal = {ROMANIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Abstract = {Lately Croatian officials have received positive signs with regard to
   the progress of their country towards the EU membership. Nevertheless
   Croatia still needs to fulfil a number of conditions as required by the
   EU pre-accession conditionality method. This method is considered to be
   among the most successful foreign policy instruments the EU has
   implemented so far. During the last two enlargement processes, it proved
   itself to be able to align the post-communist candidate countries with
   the EU acquis communautaire. However EU conditionality has not been
   exempt from criticisms, many of them being related to its post-accession
   sustainability. The strength of the instrument lies primarily in the
   conditional membership incentive. Hence doubts arose with regard to the
   compliance of the new Member States with the EU acquis once the
   enlargement would be effective and the membership lever would disappear.
   Studies on post-accession compliance suggest that the dreaded `eastern
   problem' remains rather theoretical and has not been observed in
   practice. Nevertheless in specific areas resting on the EU soft acquis
   the ` eastern problem' actually occurred. Empirical evidence backed up
   by international organisations' reports notably demonstrated that the
   fight against corruption has experienced some backsliding in newly
   integrated Member States. The comparative study of the Slovene,
   Romanian, Bulgarian and Croatian experiences advocates for a distinction
   between hard acquis and soft acquis and establishes that a ` Croatian
   problem' similar to the ` eastern problem' is likely to occur as things
   stand at the present. Although the fight against corruption remains
   mostly under the scope of the Member States competences, the EU can have
   a substantial impact on the persistence of anti-corruption measures in
   Croatia and elsewhere if the organisation adjusts its current approach.},

Abstract = {According to national and international press report, the present Awami
   League (AL) government in Bangladesh has been oppressing opposition
   political party leaders and their supporters as a means of revenge
   against them since it assumed in power in January 2009. So far it has
   killed more than 200 people extra-judicially and arrested more than 1200
   leaders and supporters of Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh (Jamaat) and Shibir
   without any valid reason and they are being oppressed in detention since
   February 2010. This paper mainly focuses on the war crimes trial issue
   in Bangladesh for war crimes committed in 1971 during independence
   movement in Bangladesh. Descriptive and analytical research methodology
   has been applied in this paper. It is an empirical research. It
   critically explains the mala fide intention of the AL government in
   prosecuting and arresting some of the opposition political party leaders

Abstract = {Many actors have been interested in probing the approach that enabled
   Turkey to transform the country into a model of success within a few
   years. Ironically, this model is at the same time both a source of
   encouragement and apprehension for Islamic parties and the West.
   Although it presents an inspiration to Islamic parties and provides them
   with moral support and hope for change, this article investigates the
   considerations preventing them from reviewing their approaches to
   imitate the Turkish model. It assesses the Western interests and
   concerns over this model and discusses to what extent the West is
   interested in promoting such a democratic process elsewhere. Prior to
   analyzing these responses, it discusses the structure and elements
   constituting the Turkish model.},

Abstract = {During recent one hundred years, all Iranian governments accused the
   ethnic groups on the secessionist aims, but the ethnic groups rejected
   these accusations. Simultaneous to the increase in the ethnic conflicts
   in the period of hard-liners in the past five years (mostly in
   non-violent form), accusations were strengthened. Through analysing the
   data collected by certain in-depth interviews with the Iranian ethnic
   groups' elites; this article tends to verify the existence of
   secessionist aspires in the ethnic groups while they pursue their right
   of self-determination. Collected data emphasize that the ethnic groups
   have not pursued secessionist aims, and they seek their right on
   self-determination in the context of Iran. According to the data, almost
   the entire ethnic movements even two autonomists republic which were
   established in 1945-1946 in Kurdistan and Azerbaijan had no secessionist
   aims.},

   This project extends Baum's contention that justices' goals are

   both speak about their legal policy preferences and win by being members
   of the majority voting coalition. An analysis of the Burger and
   Rehnquist Courts' concurring behavior illustrates that members of the
   Court are both authoring and joining concurrences in ways previously
   undocumented. Specifically, justices have become comfortable not only
   authoring concurrences but regularly joining others' separate opinions
   as well-a trend the authors call choral-Court decision making.},

Abstract = {Despite the central role the media play in the domestic and foreign
   policy-making processes, very little research examines the influence of
   international factors on media openness. This article investigates the
   impact of coercive diplomacy (in the form of economic sanctions) on
   press freedom. It is argued that foreign economic coercion will likely
   deteriorate press freedom by (1) restricting a sanctioned country's
   interactions with the outside world, thereby allowing the target regime
   to have greater control over the free flows of information, and (2)
   inflicting significant economic damage on the sustainability and
   development of independent media outlets. Using time-series,
   cross-national empirical data over a large number of countries for the
   period 1980-2000, the findings confirm economic sanctions' negative
   effect on media openness. Extensive sanctions, in particular, have a
   greater negative impact on press freedom than more selective sanctions.
   Furthermore, multilateral sanctions will likely have a greater corrosive
   impact on media openness than unilateral sanctions.},

Abstract = {Activists and scholars argue that the election and presence of Black
   mayors increase Black political engagement; however, later research
   suggests that this diminishes over time. Furthermore, a body of research
   suggests that homogenous racial contexts and contextual poverty decrease
   political participation. In this article, we ask one question: How does
   demographic context and length of Black mayoral tenure influence Black
   political participation? Using a national data set of Black respondents,
   we find that participation increases as cities become ``Blacker.{''}
   However, simultaneously we find diminishing returns to Black political
   empowerment, particularly compared with new Black empowerment contexts.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the institutional patterns of eight young
   democracies in Asia. The analysis originates from Lijphart's
   majoritarian-consensus framework. It illustrates that neither Lijphart's
   two-dimensional democracy pattern, nor an alternative pattern exists in
   Asia. Instead, the review of possible causes for the lack of conformity
   between Lijphart's patterns of democracy and the reality of the
   situation in Asia support the criticism in existing research literature
   regarding some of Lijphart's main assumptions and major conclusions.
   Furthermore, Asian realities provide only partial support for Lijphart's
   advice that the consensus option is the more attractive option for
   countries that designed their first democratic constitutions.},

Abstract = {This article begins with a rather forceful defense of the explanatory
   role of formal institutions-and, in particular, constitutions-in the
   study of democratization. Important aspects of constitutions play a
   significant part in shaping the quality, type, and survival of
   institutional arrangements in new democracies. With this assumption, the
   article turns seriously to theories of constitutional design, any of
   which must grapple with the overwhelming prima facie evidence of
   constitutional diffusion. It is well known that constitutional ideas
   travel easily across contexts. However, scholars until now have lacked
   even basic empirical evidence regarding the patterns of constitutional
   similarity across time and space. This article introduces exactly this
   sort of evidence in the context of 19th-century Europe, employing a new
   data set expressly designed for such a purpose. The analysis uncovers a
   number of new insights regarding the spread of constitutional ideas in
   Europe, insights that disturb some of the classic narratives of
   democratization in these cases.},

Abstract = {In contrast to many other countries, the Finnish open-list proportional
   representation (PR) system with its mandatory preferential voting
   provides an opportunity to study gender-based voting empirically. Using
   the 2007 Finnish national election study, the article presents an
   analysis of the grounds for same-gender voting, including motivations
   related to descriptive and substantive dimensions of representation.
   None of the motivations is able to account men's higher propensity to
   vote for a candidate of their own gender. The motivations linked to
   securing the descriptive and substantive representation of one's own
   gender in politics play a more decisive part on women's vote choice of
   same-gender candidates. Voting for a same-gender candidate is connected
   to younger age among both women and men, while the propensity to vote
   for female candidates increases with support for the Social Democrats,
   the Greens and the Swedish People's Party. Finally, gender, party
   choice, and descriptive and substantive motivations seem to be related
   to gender-based voting for both parliamentary and presidential
   elections.},

Abstract = {Researchers face two major problems when applying ideal point estimation
   techniques to state legislatures. First, longitudinal roll-call data are
   scarce. Second, even when such data exist, scaling ideal points within a
   single state is an inadequate approach. No comparisons can be made
   between these estimates and those for other state legislatures or for
   Congress. Our project provides a solution. We exploit a new comparative
   dataset of state legislative roll calls to generate ideal points for
   legislators. Taking advantage of the fact that state legislators
   sometimes go on to serve in Congress, we create a common ideological
   scale. Using these bridge actors, we estimate state legislative ideal
   points in congressional common space for 11 states. We present our
   results and illustrate how these scores can be used to address important
   topics in state and legislative politics.},

Abstract = {Presidential candidates frequently tout their political experience on
   the campaign trail, telling voters that it has prepared them to deal
   with complex problems, make weighty decisions, and show leadership. The
   value of that argument was put to the test in the 2008 presidential
   campaign by Hillary Clinton against her opponent, Barack Obama. This
   paper uses a multilevel model to analyze the value of national and state
   political experience on overall presidential greatness, as judged by
   seven surveys of academic experts. Overall, there is no evidence that
   political experience improves the likelihood of strong presidential
   performance, and even some weak evidence that political experience in
   certain political positions, most notably mayor and member of Congress,
   leads to poorer performance. In the end, great presidents are not great
   simply because they have spent their lives in politics and learned
   important lessons. Other personal and historical factors are likely to
   be more important.},

Abstract = {From the nineteenth century, with the formation of the national states
   in Latin America, have promoted an integrationist projects unfinished.
   Nowadays, the need of the integration is highlighted between countries
   in different aspects: economic, political, military man, diplomat.
   The first intention is to analyze historically the projects of
   integration in Latin America, and to give a look to the concept ``Pan
   Americanism{''}, which arose in 1890 after the International American
   Conference: examining the ``Pan Americanism{''} as concept and as
   politics that was closely linked to the emergence of The United States
   as world power, and the ``Pan Americanism{''}, from the Latin-American
   position, understood as the effort on the part of the North American
   government for controlling politics and militarily to the different
   nations of the continent to promote its eventual economic expansion
   (Bobbio, Matteucci and Pasquino, 2002).
   The final intention is to emphasize the attempts of integration in the
   twentieth century, specially, from the projects appeared in the decade
   of sixty up to the formation of the Common Market of the South
   (Mercosur) in 1994. Likewise, to observe the difficulties that the
   regional community has had historically, and to analyze the experience
   of the Mercosur as the most serious Latin-American process of
   integration -in force in the beginning of the twenty-first century- in
   the economic area and, enclosedly, political.},

Abstract = {The experimental literature on voter mobilization establishes the
   efficacy of canvassing as a tool of voter mobilization. However, the
   current literature gives scant attention to the question of whether some
   types of canvassers may be more effective than others. This article
   takes the first step toward developing a positive theory of effective or
   ineffective canvassing. Using descriptive, qualitative data from 10
   focus groups conducted in 2006, I find that voters have preferences for
   the types of campaign representatives they want to visit them. The
   results of these focus groups lay the groundwork for further
   experimental study and provide guidelines for practitioners instituting
   get-out-the-vote (GOTV) efforts.},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This article considers the process by which local economic news coverage
   influences individual evaluations of the economy. We improve on prior
   research by capturing a wider range of news sources (including national
   network news, national newspapers, local television news, and local
   newspapers) and connecting the effects of this coverage on individual
   level attitudes. We find that current personal financial evaluations,
   personal financial expectations, and short-term (12-month) expectations
   for the U.S. economy are related to national network coverage. Local
   television coverage of the economy is related to personal financial
   evaluations but not short-term economic expectations and local print
   news is important in structuring expectations of future business
   conditions. Overall, the findings illustrate important differences in
   economic coverage across media outlets and the effects of these
   differences on economic expectations. Exposure to different sources of
   economic information have significantly different effects on economic
   perceptions-suggesting a more complicated and nuanced role for the news
   media in shaping economic perceptions than indicated by previous
   research.},

Abstract = {Composers from the United States and Israel define the Holocaust genre
   in music. In their works, they express admonishment, indictment, and
   remembrance through twelve-tone technique, atonality, and expressive
   rhythm. Jewish melodies do not play a central role. It is different in
   the Soviet Union: Mieczyslaw Weinberg and Dmitrii Shostakovich used
   numerous Jewish musical elements as one of the few possibilities to
   commemorate the victims of the Holocaust and to take up a position
   against anti-Jewish sentiments in their own country. Weinberg encrypted
   his own examination of the trauma instead of admonishing and accusing.},

Abstract = {For years Distrito Federal in Mexico not covered by the model of city
   public space as a priority.
   The basis for creating public space is the ground and in Distrito
   Federal this is a serious problem. We face a privatized land which no
   treatment is given public good. There are great inequities in the
   distribution of public space in the city. Already City Government
   recognized the importance of the problem although it is essential to
   landing that concern specific projects, but more so to develop some
   tools to execute the necessary works. What public space? Which social
   groups affected? What urban function? There are key questions that are
   in the trunk of policy formulation. Doing nothing does not seem the best
   option given the scale of the problem, and therefore it becomes
   necessary to resize the problem from the very definition of a city model
   giving the issue a territorial perspective to discharge social function,
   the establishment providing a clear and current land policy processing
   and preservation, financial instruments, and a leadership capable of
   overcoming special interests.},

Abstract = {Only recently has music research addressed the persecution of musicians
   under Stalinism. Western publications had already published information
   about this after the Second World War. But these writings revealed more
   about Cold War patterns of thinking than the mechanisms of music-related
   repression in the Soviet Union. Some of what was dismissed at the time
   as the anti-Communist propaganda of Soviet emigres turned out to be
   true. Once determined by an entrenched means of interpretation, the view
   to the facts is now free.},

Abstract = {Federations exist to divide power and to promote diversity. Nonetheless,
   in federations interdependence requires degrees of policy coordination
   across governments. We examine two means of coordinating policies in the
   U.S. and Canadian federations: administrative and jurisdictional
   federalism. The former, with its centralized coordinative mechanisms, is
   thought to produce more uniform national policy outcomes; the latter,
   operating in the context of non-hierarchical relationships, greater
   policy variation. An analysis of cases in three policy areas in both
   countries indicates that despite contrasting coordinative practices,
   outcomes in actual policies implemented in the two federations are
   relatively similar. Hierarchical administrative federalism in the United
   States does not always produce the degree of coordination one might
   anticipate while a decentralized non-hierarchical system in Canada can
   achieve surprising degrees of coordination.},

Abstract = {In the tumultuous final months of the Suharto regime, few predicted that
   in 2010 Southeast Asia would have one successful democratic nation
   marked by political openness, social stability, and steady economic
   growth-and that that nation would be Indonesia. The success of the
   world's third largest democracy is all the more remarkable because it is
   also the world's largest Muslim country. Secular democracy and Islam are
   widely thought to be antithetical. It is commonly believed that either
   secularism or democracy might prevail in Muslim-majority states but not
   both together. Indonesia's democratic transition challenges this
   assumption and draws attention to the generally positive and substantial
   contribution of Islamic leaders and Islamic civil society movements to
   reform and democratization. And poor polling by Islamist parties
   suggests that for the vast majority of Indonesians, secular democracy
   and Islam are absolutely compatible and that the main source of
   legitimacy is good governance and its fruits.},

Abstract = {The article documents a panel debate held at the Kiel congress of the
   German Political Science Association (DVPW) in September 2009. With its
   Lisbon judgment passed in June 2009, the German Federal Constitutional
   Court delivered a groundbreaking decision on Germany's involvement in
   the European integration process. The Court ruled that the German
   accompanying law (Begleitgesetz) violated the national constitution
   because it did not guarantee sufficient parliamentary involvement.
   Furthermore, the Court announced its intention to intensify the
   constitutional control of the national applicability of European legal
   acts (the ultra vires control and the identity control). Stephan
   Leibfried, M arcus Horeth, Martin Hopner, Fritz W. Scharpf and Michael
   Zurn discuss the judgment with respect to its implications for the
   further integration process, for the national and supranational
   capacities to act, for the democratic quality in the European multilevel
   system and for political-economic problems.},

Abstract = {Prior studies search for evidence that distributive spending influences
   Congress members' vote shares but find limited evidence. The authors
   argue that Democratic and Republican members each benefit from different
   types of distributive projects. Democrats benefit from delivering
   spending projects (what most people think of as ``pork{''}) to their
   constituents, while many Republican members benefit from delivering
   contingent liabilities (in which the federal treasury underwrites a
   private entity's financial risk). Empirical tests using data from U.S.
   House elections between 1984 and 2002 generally confirm these
   hypotheses, with one exception: only Republicans in relatively
   conservative districts gain from contingent liabilities. This result is
   further explored in the text.},

Abstract = {The 2009 Armenian-Turkish protocols on the establishment of diplomatic
   relations and the opening of borders could mean a new start in the
   historically burdened bilateral relations between these two peoples. But
   the old matters of dispute stand in the way of ratification and real
   rapprochement. Erivan insists that Turkey recognize the genocide against
   the Armenians in 1915-1923. Ankara continues to demand that Armenia
   withdraw its troops from the occupied territories of Azerbaijan, a
   Turkish ally. That the protocol was signed at all is owed to Turkey's
   interest in establishing itself as a regional power and Armenia's need
   extricate itself from dependency on its strategic partner Russia.},

Abstract = {The long and successful marriage between high capitalism and modern
   authoritarianism in the case of Singapore poses a legitimacy puzzle.
   While the authoritarian regime has enjoyed and continues to enjoy
   broad-based support, the depth of its legitimacy appears to be shallow.
   This puzzle is generally explained by the primacy of an exchange
   relation between the regime and the people where the regime provides
   security and prosperity in return for legitimacy. Although the regime
   and the people are bound by mutual interests, they do not share a common
   good. This article argues that institutionalization of market-based
   compensation for ministers and top civil servants in the case of
   Singapore entrenches instrumental rationality and elitism, which
   reinforces the exchange relation between the regime and the people.
   While the relationship is stable, it requires constant attention by the
   regime to the people's perceptions of being disadvantaged, which if left
   unaddressed could weaken the legitimacy of the regime.},

Title = {THE IMPLICATIONS OF HIGH COURT DOCKET CONTROL FOR RESOURCE ALLOCATION
   AND LEGAL EFFICIENCY},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL POLITICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {22},
Number = {2},
Pages = {247-268},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {A key source of institutional variation across judicial systems is the
   degree of control that the highest court has over its docket. Despite
   this variation, the consequences of various institutional designs in
   judicial hierarchies remain relatively unexplored by the theoretical
   literature. In this article, we develop a formal model of high court
   resource allocation. We analyze the model under two institutional
   designs: (1) the Court must allocate at least some minimum effort to all
   cases; (2) the Court has complete discretion over which cases to hear.
   We analyze the model to identify the optimal allocation of resources
   across cases as the institutional design varies. We then consider the
   conditions under which the various institutional rules increase or
   decrease the legal efficiency, or performance, of the judicial system.
   Our analysis reveals the complex relationship among the institutional
   rules governing high court dockets, the design of the judicial
   hierarchy, and the performance of the legal system. We find that the
   effect of institutional design on legal efficiency is conditioned by the
   performance of the lower courts and the incentives for judicial
   `shirking' at the High Court. While requiring some per-case effort by
   the High Court may marginally increase aggregate efficiency, such a
   requirement causes the High Court to divert resources away from the most
   difficult cases toward relatively easier cases. The consequence is that
   more difficult cases are less likely to be decided correctly, while
   relatively easier cases are more likely to be decided correctly. The
   model substantively informs policy debates among judicial reformers and
   scholars concerned with institutional design as well as disciplinary
   debates about case selection and judicial decision making.},

Abstract = {This article discusses the issue of EU-oriented attempts to empower the
   role of civil society in the realm of public policy in new Member
   States. The process of including the Third Sector in the formulation,
   implementation and evaluation of public policies is analysed using the
   case of civil society organizations in the role of social partners in
   the field of regional (development) policy in Poland, supported by EU
   structural funds. On the one hand, provisions provided by the framework
   of structural funds constitute an opportunity for
   political-administrative elites to increase the efficiency and
   legitimacy of the policy by admitting in its perimeter actors
   representing the Third Sector. On the other hand, it turns out that
   Polish civil society organizations have difficulties both in playing the
   role of social partners and in taking advantage of this opportunity to
   articulate and pursue their interests. Because of several external
   blockages and internal weaknesses, both their legitimacy and capacity as
   social partners vis-a-vis the other stakeholders included in the arena
   of regional development appears limited. Acta Politica (2010) 45,

Title = {From hobbyhorse to mainstream: Using sport to understand British
   politics},

Abstract = {The academic study of sport and politics has long been seen as a `hobby'
   on the margins of the mainstream of political studies. The sport policy
   community has been, traditionally, a `weak' area of policy. The last two
   decades, however, have seen the political salience of sport rapidly
   increase and, given that politics and sport are inextricable bound up
   with one another, it is surprising that so few political scientists
   study sport politics and policy. This article sets out to do two things:
   first, it makes the case that sport is very much about politics - and
   always has been - and for this reason is worthy of study by those
   concerned about power, resource allocation, policymaking, governance,
   political identity, race, gender and the like. Second, and more
   importantly, it contends that while the study of sport and sport policy
   per se is worthy, it can and should be also used as a prism through
   which to understand the wider machinations of politics and policy in
   Britain and in international relations. British Politics (2010) 5,

Abstract = {The rise of state-mandated standards in public education have allowed
   legislators to answer the question of what constitutes a proper civic
   education, a debate that has existed in the United States since the turn
   of the twentieth century. Through the content they employ in their
   standards, states may indirectly influence the type of citizenship
   education students receive in the classroom. The present study focuses
   on the Virginia Standards of Learning for two courses, civics and
   economics and U.S. and Virginia government, which are commonly taught to
   eighth graders and high school seniors, respectively. A content analysis
   of the essential knowledge found in the standards for these courses
   categorizes instructional content into seven forms of citizenship: civic
   republicanism, character education, deliberative, social justice,
   participatory, transnational, and cosmopolitan. Although the results are
   specific to the Virginia Standards of Learning, the nature of how
   citizenship is portrayed within the standards may transfer to other
   states with similar forms of standards-based education within their
   social studies curricula.},

   revolutionary way for Argentina. Very belatedly and despite their
   arguments, the MLN ended up imprisoned for defending their own
   contradictions and practice of armed propaganda, which became massive

Abstract = {The subject matter of Comparative Politics is fundamentally in flux due
   to changing forms of statehood and of policy-making practices within
   complex governance processes. Apart from changes inherent within the
   field of Political Science, this is also having significant effects upon
   the research process. We will therefore discuss related methodological
   and theoretical challenges, as well as possible solutions, such as
   multi-level analysis and diffusion research. After briefly outlining
   research-relevant subject areas, we will conclude by addressing two
   elements of a progressive research strategy, namely an orientation
   towards governance and a stronger cooperation of inter- as well as
   intra-disciplinary aspects.},

Abstract = {Do parliamentary regimes outperform presidential ones in reducing
   democratic breakdown? Given the relatively higher breakdown rate of
   presidential regimes as compared to that of parliamentary regimes, which
   factors can explain the breakdown of presidential democracies? Using an
   original global dataset covering 85 countries from 1946 to 2002, this
   study shows presidential democracies are not intrinsically more likely
   to collapse than parliamentary ones. The study also reveals the
   oft-cited ``military legacy{''} cannot explain breakdowns of
   presidential democracies. Instead, a less effective legislature and
   unfavorable U.S. foreign policy, two neglected factors in the extant
   literature, can robustly explain the breakdown of presidential
   democracies. This research confirms more effective legislatures are more
   likely to achieve oversight of the military and reduce the latter's
   threats to democratic survival than less effective legislatures. A test
   for simultaneity bias indicates the type of political regime does not
   exert a causal effect on legislative effectiveness.},

Abstract = {The transfer of rules, such as in the European Union's recent
   enlargements, requires well-functioning institutions of government as
   well as societal actors ready to engage with the new rules. Officials of
   the European Commission and other practitioners highlighted the need for
   both in the run-up to enlargement, whereas critics of the 2004 and 2007
   rounds have faulted the state-centric approach employed by the EU for
   undercutting societal actors in the new member states. This article
   examines data from the World Values Survey and World Bank Governance
   Indicators and shows that state capacity and organized interests do
   indeed go hand in hand: Among the 27 EU member states, countries that
   score high on good governance also have citizens engaged in interest
   organizations, volunteering for a broad variety of causes and ready to
   participate in acts of protest. By the same token, in countries where
   governments struggle to deliver results, organized interests are
   insufficiently established and rarely in a position to perform
   governance functions. The data show systematic and statistically
   significant differences between old and new member states, with Eastern
   Europe lagging behind most of the older democracies on both dimensions,
   that is, state capacity and civil society. Considerable variation within
   each block does not negate this basic gap, though it highlights the need
   for nuance and cautions against determinism. The article seeks to set
   the stage for the case studies contained in this special issue. Acta

Volume = {72},
Number = {2},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This study introduces split population binary choice models to address
   the issue of irrelevant dyads in the dyadic analysis of conflict with
   binary dependent variables. The advantage of employing a statistical
   model instead of directly identifying relevant dyads manifests itself in
   the selection of relevant dyads: rather than researchers making
   take-it-or-leave-it decisions, covariates are used to estimate relevance
   as a latent variable. An application of the model to the trade conflict
   debate shows that the unconditional probability of conflict, the
   quantity of interest for traditional binary choice models based on all
   dyads, is nonmonotonic with respect to trade when generated by the split
   population model. This finding provides one explanation for why trade is
   found either to increase or decrease the probability of conflict in
   existing research, as monotonicity by chance is imposed on an underlying
   nonmonotonic relationship.},

Abstract = {This article engages with the Pakistani government's tendency to
   negotiate peace settlements with Taliban militants as a primary element
   of their counterinsurgency (COIN) policy. These peace settlements have
   consistently broken down, exacerbating a causal spiral of violence, as
   elaborated by an analytical matrix by the author. This COIN strategy has
   been seen by many, particularly in the United States, as a beacon for
   militants to regroup, with a consequent renewal of insurgency and terror
   attacks. This article attempts to contextualize the peace processes
   reached by negotiations of the Pakistani government with the militants,
   with projections for a successful COIN policy being articulated at the

Abstract = {This paper starts from the assumption that historical institutionalism
   has much to offer in order to address important questions raised in the
   literature on comparative federalism. Historical institutionalism is a
   useful approach to enhancing our understanding of both the origins that
   drive federal system dynamics and the dynamic patterns which federal
   systems unfold over time. The paper conceptualizes federalism as a
   multi-layered political order, comprising an institutional and an
   ideational layer. It then introduces two models of political change, the
   model of path dependence and the process sequencing model, and asks how
   each model can contribute to explain the emergence of the federal order
   in Canada and Germany. I conclude that while the model of path
   dependence lends itself well to capturing federal system dynamics in
   Germany, the process sequencing model, in contrast, is better suited to
   explaining sources and patterns of change in Canada.},

Abstract = {As Indigenous peoples we have found it necessary both to react to and to
   differentiate ourselves from the beliefs, values and practices that have
   been imposed upon us through colonization. To make our resistance
   effective, we sometimes use the tools of the dominant society. The Unity
   Flag in the incarnation that is commonly known as the `Mohawk Warrior
   Flag' is one example of this phenomenon. Flown all over the world, it
   serves as a symbol for the unity of Indigenous peoples, illuminating our
   discordant relationship with a world that remains dominated by beliefs
   and values that are alien to us. This paper will introduce a
   Kanienkehaka perspective on the Flag, reconstructing its symbols and
   history and illustrating how it carries the message of
   unity-in-resistance for the various peoples who have turned to it for
   support in their ongoing struggles with colonialism.},

Abstract = {We make use of a novel forecasting technique based on the Hotel
   ling-Downs spatial framework to project vote outcomes in the second
   round of the two-round French presidential election system. In doing so
   we take advantage of the high degree of bimodality in the distribution
   of voter preferences to predict which candidates will make it into the
   second round. While our principal focus is on the 2007 election, we also
   look at the seven previous presidential elections in the French Fifth
   Republic, from 1965 through 2002.},

Title = {Personality and Civic Engagement: An Integrative Framework for the Study

Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {104},
Number = {1},
Pages = {85-110},

Abstract = {People's enduring psychological tendencies are reflected in their
   traits. Contemporary research on personality establishes that traits are
   rooted largely in biology, and that the central aspects of personality
   can be captured in frameworks, or taxonomies, focused on five trait
   dimensions: openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion,
   agreeableness, and emotional stability. In this article, we integrate a
   five-factor view of trait structure within a holistic model of the
   antecedents of political behavior, one that accounts not only for
   personality, but also for other factors; including biological and
   environmental influences. This approach permits attention to the complex
   processes that likely underlie trait effects, and especially to possible
   trait situation interactions. Primary tests of our hypotheses draw on
   data from a 2006 U.S. survey, with supplemental tests introducing data
   from Uruguay and Venezuela. Empirical analyses not only provide evidence
   of the value of research on personality and politics, hut also signal
   some of the hurdles that must be overcome for inquiry in this area to be
   most fruitful.},

Abstract = {Multi-issue activists are sorely understudied, despite their
   acknowledged importance as bridges between social movements and issue
   domains. In this article we explore multi-issue activism, beginning with
   a large sample of AIDS activists and charting the degree and nature of
   overlapping issue involvement, the key role of ``initiator{''} issues,
   and individual characteristics that promote multi-issue activism. We
   demonstrate that the great majority of these AIDS activists had sizable
   prior and ongoing participation histories in. otherissues, suggesting
   that movement across issue areas may be the norm rather than the
   exception. We also show that involvement in specific past issues served
   as gateways to later involvementin AIDS, that psychological engagement
   in politics prompted cross-issue activism even among these already
   activated individuals, and that unique personal characteristics (in this
   case gender and sexual orientation) led to more issue
   interconnectedness.},

Journal = {GOVERNMENT AND OPPOSITION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {45},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Politics and gender scholarship is increasingly seeking to understand
   the relationship between the presence of women in politics and gendered
   policy outcomes - the substantive representation of women (SRW). Yet its
   focus remains squarely on the activities of `critical actors' in
   parliaments and women's policy agencies and on `feminist' rather than
   `mainstream' policy areas. In contrast, this article investigates the
   impact of feminist actors in a range of institutional settings on recent
   processes of welfare reform in the UK. It finds that the gendered
   welfare reform introduced by New Labour was initiated and pushed through
   by a coalition of committed feminist actors across a range of
   institutions. Crucially, the reforms relied on the existence of
   `strategic actors' and `gate openers', defined as feminist actors in
   positions of significant institutional power. It makes a contribution to
   the actor-centred SRW scholarship, develops an institutionalist approach
   to this research and identifies the need for a political economy
   perspective to understanding how women can shape policy outcomes.},

Abstract = {This article questions the meanings and expression of ``citizenship{''}
   in the context of new Latina and Latino migration into the southeastern
   United States-a region long marked by legally policed racial systems and
   now experiencing the varied shocks of globalization. Focused on a
   legislative campaign that won access to a state-issued driver's licence
   for undocumented migrants in Tennessee in spring 2001, the article
   explores some of the tensions that emerged on the road to this unlikely
   victory and raises questions for the immigrants' rights movement in the
   US about the costs and gains that may follow from different ways of
   framing its demands. The dominant frame this particular campaign adopted
   was a pragmatic and politically acceptable call to improve traffic
   safety, one that reflected a conscious choice to downplay issues of
   rights, justice or global perspective. Yet the article also reports that
   the campaign in fact created and used opportunities for activists to
   raise issues related to migrant rights. It also made a dramatic, albeit
   temporary, improvement in the daily lives of migrants in the state. The
   article then sketches three citizenship norms that current struggles
   might prefigure. These three norms are: the full right to international
   mobility of human beings; the right to identity; and duties of
   citizenship in a globalizing world.},

Abstract = {By most objective metrics, Brazil is the least imposing of the ``BRICs
   countries{''}-less populous than China and Indio, slower-growing in
   recent years than China, India, or Russia, and the only member of the
   group locking nuclear weapons. We argue that Brazil material
   capabilities are more significant than commonly supposed. Moreover
   Brazil democratic transition in the mid-1980s, along with that of its
   neighbors, has for the first time enabled Brazil to realize its promise
   of becoming a regional leader in South America. On the basis of its
   democratic and regional prominence, Brazil has become on effective
   political entrepreneur at the global level, initiating and participating
   in multilateral fora as diverse as the trade G20, the financial G20, and
   now the BRICs club. On issues of style, inclusion, and distributive
   justice, Brazil reliably sides with the ``South.{''} Yet its core public
   policy instincts embrace familiar ``Northern{''} preferences: liberal,
   and mixed-capitalist, democracy. Polity (2010) 42, 14-37.

Pages = {209-225},
Abstract = {The proliferation of studies into corruption over the past decade has
   highlighted its widely differing manifestations and causes. This article
   applies the notion of institutional corruption to the case study of the
   Lennon government's approval of the Gunns pulp mill in Tasmania. A
   multidisciplinary framework is developed to explain why the approval
   process became embroiled in widespread allegations of commercial
   favouritism. It is argued that the institutional corruption involved in
   this process was an outcome of the interaction of the political economy
   of Tasmania, its political culture and the political psychology of Paul
   Lennon as leader. The implications of such a multidisciplinary approach
   for a study of corruption are discussed.},

Abstract = {This article compares the scientific publication output and
   international academic visibility of Swiss political science
   departments, using three indicators (number of publications, number of
   citations, and the h-index) and publicly available data from two
   sources: the Web of Knowledge and Google Scholar. We also examine
   whether the publication output of political science professors and
   postdoctoral researchers in Switzerland varies as a Junction of academic
   age. We observe rather strong variations both across and within
   departments. The analysis also shows that the most prolific professors
   tend to be those who completed their Ph.D. about 10-20 years ago and
   that some postdocs are on a very promising publications trajectory. We
   derive some benchmarks for publication output that might be useful for
   hiring decisions or promotions.},

Title = {Cultural politics: disciplining citizenship},
Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Pages = {331-343},
Abstract = {Demands for cultural citizenship within western democracies identify the
   shifting needs that arise from culturally diverse and multicultural
   societies. These demands are increasing while simultaneously, many
   western societies are re-evaluating their commitments to official
   policies and discourses of multiculturalism. In the Canadian context,
   where official multiculturalism has been celebrated since the 1970s, the
   challenge to the continuity of multiculturalism has been greatly
   affected by the discursive framing of the `war on terror' since 11
   September 2001. In this article I investigate how the cultural has been
   constituted as a disciplinary discourse that has relied upon an
   ontologically fixed determination of ethnic difference. I make this
   argument by investigating the public media, policy and legal discussions
   that erupted during the `Sharia Law' debates that took place in the
   province of Ontario, Canada in 2003. I explore how the influence of
   Mahmood Mamdani's concept of `culture talk' acts as a pervasive
   authorising discourse in these debates and the impact that this has on
   the conceptualisation of cultural citizenship.},

   Important Are Variations in Constituency Size?},
Journal = {PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {63},
Number = {1},
Pages = {4-21},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {It is frequently canvassed by some politicians and political
   commentators that the current British electoral system is biased against
   the Conservative party because of variations in constituency size: seats
   won by the Conservatives at recent elections have been larger than those
   won by Labour in terms of their registered electorates, thereby
   disadvantaging the former. As a consequence, it is argued that
   equalisation of constituency electorates by the Boundary Commissions
   would remove that disadvantage. The validity of this argument is
   addressed in two ways. First, we demonstrate that the rules and
   procedures applied by the Boundary Commissions when redistributing seats
   in the UK preclude the achievement of substantial equality in
   constituency electorates. Secondly, we use a recent adaptation of a
   widely-used procedure for establishing electoral bias in three-party
   systems to show that variations in constituency electorates had only a
   minor impact on the outcome of elections after the last two
   redistributions. The geography of each party's support base is much more
   important, so changes in the redistribution procedure are unlikely to
   have a substantial impact and remove the significant disadvantage
   currently suffered by the Conservative party.},

Abstract = {What meaning do the ideas of ``kitsch,'' and the paradigm of high and
   low culture, have when considering art produced by contemporary African
   American artists? Using examples by artist Michael Ray Charles, I argue
   that both are sustaining mechanisms of racial hierarchy and apartheid.
   Charles's work suggests that all visual culture-high and low, no style
   or subject excepted-maintains racist dialogues, and that all images
   speak race differently to various audiences. The distinctions between
   the high and the low in American culture seek to verify a fiction of a
   unified culture; as a result, the idea of kitsch sustains a system that
   imagines racially ``good'' or ``bad'' imagery instead of appreciating
   the role of all visual culture in the production of a racist society.},

Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Pages = {85-96},
Abstract = {In their debate about whether Cultural Studies is helpful for
   understanding public ignorance, Chris Wisniewski and Mark Fenster view
   ignorance as inevitably plaguing the public in mass democratic society;
   and they see ``the public'' as an abstract entity. However, Pierre
   Bourdieu's sociology rightly contests these positions. A thorough
   investigation of the concrete social conditions of political ignorance
   reveals that ignorance is unevenly dispersed throughout social space and
   that its relevance depends on social position, such as that of the
   advantaged and disadvantaged. Such a comprehensive approach to public
   ignorance is required for advancing political participation among the
   least advantaged.},

Abstract = {This article is about the relationship between the film industry,
   society, and the state, in the context of economic reforms. I first
   provide an overview of current writings on the field and then explain
   the film industry's structure since 1949. I also examine policy changes
   over the past 30 years. What exactly did the state change? And why did
   it change? By way of analyzing Chinese cinema, this article examines the
   relationship between the market, the state, society, and transnational
   capital. Although the government has increasingly been in favor of a
   market economy, it has never given up its official ideology over films.
   Moreover, the domestic film industry did not collapse after the entry of
   transnational capital; instead, the state successfully co-opted the
   ``wolves{''} not only to save the film industry but also to enable the
   state to accumulate both economic and political capital.},

Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE PEACE \& SECURITY},

Number = {2},
Pages = {213-229},
Abstract = {This paper argues that Beiijing's handling of the Xinjiang and Uyghur
   issues at the domestic, regional and international levels is
   characterised by a number of contradictions. Domestically, the July 2009
   unrest suggests that China's longstanding approach to Xinjiang is at
   risk of failure due to the contradictions inherent in the logic that
   underpins Beijing's strategy. Regionally, Beijing faces a contradiction
   between its growing influence on the governments of Central Asia and the
   ambivalent attitude of Central Asian publics towards China.
   Internationally, the major implication of the July unrest has been to
   signal the internationalisation of the Uyghur issue whereby it has
   become a significant irritant in Beijing's relations with a number of
   major Western states, including the USA and Australia. It has been
   Beijing's own approach to Xinjiang domestically and its handling of the
   Uyghur issue in its diplomacy that has contributed to the
   internationalisation of the issue.},

Title = {The twenty-first century Armed Forces of the Philippines: orphan of
   counter-insurgency or military geared for the long war of the century?},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY POLITICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {16},
Number = {2},
Pages = {153-171},
Abstract = {This article examines the factors that account for the Armed Forces of
   the Philippines's (AFP) never-ending involvement in many wars of the
   third kind. It discusses the essence of counterinsurgency warfare or
   low-intensity conflict in the Philippine setting. The article then notes
   that the disruption in the US military assistance after 1992, the AFP's
   inability to modernize, and its continuous campaign against communist
   and secessionist insurgents have adversely affected its structure and
   overall combat efficiency. It also analyzes the impact of the global war
   on terror on the Philippine military's counter-insurgency operations and
   the reforms undertaken by the Philippine defense establishment to
   address these issues. In conclusion, the article argues that reforms
   will not lead to a significant transformation of the AFP as it will
   continue to be an orphan of counter-insurgency in the near future.
   However, if wars of the third kind will persist, this situation will
   paradoxically make the AFP the only military in Southeast Asia aptly
   geared for the long war of this century.},

Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},

Volume = {17},

Pages = {1176-1201},
Abstract = {This study argues that individual parties and party competition in El
   Salvador and Cambodia today are still profoundly affected by the period
   of civil war that has long passed. The war-time origins of the main
   Salvadoran and Cambodian parties have left a deep imprint on their
   organizational structures and style of leadership, just as war-time
   political exclusion set the tone for unbalanced party competition after
   the war. Although El Salvador's party system is more institutionalized
   and pluralistic than Cambodia's, there have been clear cross-national
   patterns of unequal institutionalization and ruling party dominance that
   are a product of the war. International engagement ranging from election
   observation, election organization to party assistance has had some
   benefits, particularly for opposition parties. At the party system
   level, however, international support has only been of minor influence,
   with the possible exception of financial, economic and technical
   assistance to the government, which has served to accentuate the
   tendency towards dominance by the party in power.},

Abstract = {In this paper we offer a negotiation and cooperative game theory
   application to international water in the classroom. A simulation game
   was developed for the Aral Sea water dispute as part of a textbook
   prepared for teaching a diverse group of students a graduate-level
   International Water course. A condensed version of the Aral Sea Basin
   water dispute and hydrology was prepared. The game allows students to
   realize the complexity of hydrology and geography, the linkage between
   hydrology and conflict and cooperation, and the impact of external
   factors, such as climate change, on the extent of the conflict and its
   likely resolution. The game was used to simulate negotiations between a
   subset of the basin riparians, demonstrating the value of information in
   negotiation. Various cooperative game theory concepts were demonstrated
   and applied by students through a set of assignments representing a
   variety of likely states of nature and various development
   interventions.},

Abstract = {Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman were key figures in the creation of
   anarchist counterpublics in the US at the turn of the last century.
   Their work drew together immigrant subcultures, labor activists,
   progressive liberals, radical women, and international supporters to
   create a counterpublic within which anarchist ideals could achieve
   intelligibility. Their public words illuminate the dynamic relationship
   between the realm of ideas, the social imaginary, and the bodily habitus
   within which anarchism came to be in the United States. Viewing
   anarchism as a counterpublic highlights the significance of its
   temporalities, social locations, and textual practices. At the same
   time, reconsidering counterpublics in light of anarchist world-making
   practices suggests a more hybrid, fluid, non-linear conceptualization of
   radical counterpublics.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},

Abstract = {Drawing on recent research in the United Kingdom and the Canadian
   province of British Columbia, this article focuses on the politics of
   electoral reform:the strategic maneuvering by political elites to
   prevent and facilitate change. Through a comparative analysis of two
   highly majoritarian polities in which dominant executives have, since
   1997, adopted contrasting reform trajectories, the article suggests that
   previous analyses of this topic have underemphasized the role of
   political agency and ideational change. In order to demonstrate this
   argument, the article develops and refines a process-based approach by
   embedding it within a framework that recognizes the interplay between
   context, agency, and structure. Not only does this approach deepen our
   understanding of executive veto points, majoritarian modification, and
   aversive constitutionalism, but it also sensitizes scholars to the role
   and power of political cultures and dominant ideologies.},

Abstract = {This article reviews the sub-field of cleavage research-the sub-field
   within which this special issue fits. It assesses the strengths and
   weaknesses of the sub-field and characterises it as (with some shining
   exceptions) being prone to weak theorising, loose logic, and/or shaky
   methodology (sometimes all three at once). These three themes are
   pursued in three separate sections of the article, after which the
   contents of the special issue are themselves assessed in the same terms.},

Journal = {POLITICAL STUDIES REVIEW},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Pages = {3-14},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The financial crash of 2008 precipitated a major recession. It shattered
   the financial growth model that had dominated the previous twenty years
   and plunged the international economy into a period of economic and
   political restructuring of uncertain duration. The immediate origins of
   the crash lay in the lending practices associated with the sub-prime
   mortgages in the United States which produced the credit crunch in 2007,
   but the wider causes were the unbalanced character of growth in the
   international economy and the particular role played by finance. The
   crisis has been explained in a number of different ways, focusing on the
   behaviour of the financial markets, the institutional and policy
   conditions that made the boom possible and then undermined it,
   longer-term economic and policy cycles and the nature of uncertainty and
   risk in complex social systems. The political impact of the crash and
   the recession has not been uniform; it has been highly uneven, depending
   on the position of particular states in the international economy. The
   rapid interventions by governments to stave off financial collapse at
   the end of 2008 were successful, but at the cost of creating serious
   problems of adjustment for the future. The political debate around what
   were the causes, who should be blamed and what should be done is only
   just beginning, and the way this crisis comes to be understood will play
   a major part in determining how it is eventually resolved and how
   far-reaching will be the changes to the international economy and to
   domestic politics.},

Abstract = {The global financial - and now economic - crisis has demonstrated that
   markets, and particularly financial markets, are not self-correcting and
   that, if left unregulated, they will inevitably overreach themselves and
   lead to excess. Governments have a duty to regulate markets in the
   public interest but where (as in the case of recession) markets produce
   adverse outcomes, governments also have a duty to lean against market
   logic in order to minimise those outcomes. These lessons extend well
   beyond purely economic matters. Unregulated markets will inevitably
   produce social and environmental outcomes that reflect narrow and
   short-term individual and sectoral interests rather than those of
   society as a whole. The whole point of democracy is that it allows the
   less powerful majority to use the power and legitimacy of government to
   offset and counteract the economic power of a minority. If the market
   cannot be or is not challenged, democracy itself is weakened, loses its
   point and forfeits the confidence of the people it is meant to serve.},

Abstract = {Because Republican and Democratic elites have polarized in recent
   decades, American voters increasingly face choices between candidates
   who hold divergent policy positions. Such a development has potential
   implications for the way voters process information during campaigns and
   choose between candidates on election day. Drawing on research in
   political psychology and using a nationally representative
   survey-experiment, we argue and find that levels of candidate
   polarization-the convergence or divergence of candidates' issue
   positions-affect voter information consumption, recall of campaign
   information, and the balance of on-line and memory-based processing
   employed in the vote decision. In showing that voters faced with more
   similar candidates rely more heavily on memory-based processing, we
   provide further support for hybrid models of political information
   processing and suggest that candidate polarization has consequences for
   voter attitude strength and resistance to persuasion.},

Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},

Volume = {17},

Pages = {1132-1152},
Abstract = {Party assistance in Bosnia and Herzegovina has focused on encouraging
   multi-ethnic and moderate mono-ethnic parties by placing funding and
   political restrictions on ethnonationalist parties while providing
   technical assistance and public support to those parties with less
   nationalist agendas. However, multi-ethnic parties have met with very
   limited electoral success and moderate mono-ethnic parties have found
   electoral success primarily by radicalizing their political discourse to
   match that of nationalist parties. This study provides evidence for the
   effect of international intervention drawn from patterns of electoral
   support for multi-ethnic and moderate mono-ethnic parties in canton,
   entity and national elections from the 2006 general elections in Bosnia
   and Herzegovina. The analysis shows that even voters who are predisposed
   to vote for multi-ethnic parties are much less likely to choose
   non-nationalist parties in elections where parties representing other
   ethnicities also compete. As a result, there is a clear trade-off
   between promoting Bosnia's integration and promoting parties and
   candidates who refrain from using often incendiary nationalist rhetoric.},

Number = {91},
Pages = {53+},
Abstract = {Taiwan. The first case is located in the North of the island near
   Taipei. More than a thousand women are suffering from various sorts of
   cancer. They had been exposed to a wide range of organic solvents and
   other toxics when they were working for the US manufacturer of
   television sets RCA. The defendants in this trial are the current and
   former business owners, General Electric and Thomson. The second case
   occurs near Tainan, in the South of the island, where the largest
   concentrations of dioxin in the world has been left by a former chemical
   plant. In both cases, the plaintiffs think that they are being used as
   guinea pigs for the sake of science, but without benefiting from its
   results. They receive an important support from an original citizen
   mobilization and a network of lawyers. Although the hearings have just
   begun, the controversy and the speeches of the actors suggest that the
   scientific uncertainty can not but generate various forms of
   compromises, between `perhaps' and `probable', epidemiology and
   toxicology, humans and animals, and thus, all sorts of possibilities for
   a legal decision or a policy.},

Abstract = {For quite some time reforms within the framework of new public
   management have been especially conducted in German Higher Education
   Institutions (HEIs). These reforms are intended to strengthen HEIs'
   self-governance. The article presents a comparison of higher education
   governance of the sixteen German federal states.
   The currently used governance instruments are systemised and assigned to
   one of two governance-models: the bureaucratic-oligarchic model and the
   management-model. A classification of the compared FIE systems shows
   that instruments of the management-model-type are dominating.
   Nevertheless, there are clear-cut differences between the sixteen HE
   systems. Therefore it is not surprising that a dependence of the success
   of a federal states' HEIs on the legal codification of the
   management-model cannot be proved. This is illustrated by the so-called
   Initiative for Excellence.},

Title = {The Worst of All Worlds? Electoral Reform and Britain's 2009 European
   Elections},
Journal = {POLITICAL QUARTERLY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {81},
Number = {1},
Pages = {99-106},
Month = {JAN-MAR},
Abstract = {At the 2009 European elections, Britain again elected its MEPs under the
   `closed list' system of proportional representation (PR)-the third time
   it had done so since 1999. This article looks at claims that these
   elections vindicated PR by producing a `fairer' relationship between the
   parties' share of votes and their share of seats, a truer reflection of
   diverse political allegiance in modern Britain, and (thanks to
   multi-member constituencies) a more efficient and sensitive system for
   representing voters. However, the article will also inspect the idea
   that the case for electoral reform was gravely weakened by the 2009 Euro
   elections. It will recall how PR again failed to boost turnout, again
   employed a method of counting that most voters did not understand, and
   again involved constituencies too large for meaningful representation.
   Furthermore, it will recall that PR allowed the election of two MEPs
   from the far-right British National Party. (With just 6\% of votes, it
   is unlikely that the BNP would have secured seats under Britain's
   traditional electoral system.) The article will argue that, as a result,
   PR has had a centrifugal effect on the British party system and,
   potentially, a polarising effect on our political culture. Consequently,
   the article will assert that, owing to the success of the BNP in 2009,
   arguments about PR for Westminster have been `ideologically
   neutralised'. The article will thus suggest that we can now take a more
   objective view of hung Parliaments and coalitions (the likely effects of
   PR at general elections), free from the assumption that they entrench
   centrist governments and progressive politics.},

Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},

Volume = {14},
Number = {4},
Pages = {395-410},
Abstract = {The citizenship literature now renders blurry the boundaries between
   `private' and `public'. Feminist analyses of caregiving have contributed
   to this evolution. But while feminist circles widely depict caregiving
   to be on par with employment as a social aspiration and obligation of
   citizenship, the literature has stopped short of recognizing that
   caregiving can also represent political citizenship. The author argues
   that some caregiving for identity should be afforded this status. This
   recognition has implications for multiscalar approaches to environmental
   and queer citizenship studies; feminist visions of citizenship that
   imply a right to time for care; and multicultural citizenship.},

Journal = {BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES OF TERRORISM AND POLITICAL AGGRESSION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {2},
Number = {3},
Pages = {179-197},
Abstract = {Three studies examine how al Qaeda terrorists are perceived by Polish
   participants and how these perceptions are related to emotional
   reactions to terrorism and support for counter-terrorism measures, such
   as the installation of the American National Missile Defence (NMD)
   system in Poland. In study 1 we combine qualitative and quantitative
   approach to test the terrorist perception and identify four images of al
   Qaeda terrorists: psychopathic criminals, strategists, ideologues and
   desperate combatants. The results of study 2 indicate that two images
   attributing irrationality to al Qaeda terrorists and unpredictability to
   their actions (psychopathic criminals and ideologues) are related to
   high perceived risk of future terrorist attacks, fear of terrorism and a
   tendency to catastrophize terrorism. Results of study 3 show that these
   two images are related to opposition towards NMD in Poland. Fear of
   terrorism mediates this relationship. The image of terrorists as
   rational strategists is not related to fear of terrorism and is related
   to positive attitudes towards installation of the NMD in Poland.},

Abstract = {If the European policy about historical research and teaching begins to
   be questionned, the mobilisations of historians within the community
   institutions rarely are. By studying the case of European Liaison
   Committee of Historians, this article tries to point out its active role
   and to examine the interactions its members build with the European
   officers. Far from contenting with replying to a request, these
   historians coming from the international relations take advantage of the
   affinity of their researches with the Commission's view of the European
   construction to ``enter the European area{''} and get a privileged
   access to the community archives and to the financial and symbolic
   resources (Jean Monnet Chairs, subsidies for Thematic Networks under the
   Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development, etc.).
   These mobilisations take place in the context of intra and
   inter-disciplinary rivalries. They are the subjects of permanent
   balances of power with the Commission officers.},

Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {22},
Number = {4},
Pages = {427-447},
Abstract = {In five works spanning a decade, Philip E. Tetlock's interest in
   counterfactuals has changed. He began with an optimistic desire to make
   social science more rigorous by identifying best practices in the
   absence of non-imagined controls for experimentation. Soon, however, he
   adopted a more pessimistic analysis of the cognitive and psychological
   barriers facing experts. This shift was brought on by an awareness that
   experts are not rational Bayesians who continually update their theories
   to keep up with new information; but instead are affected by political,
   cognitive, and psychological heuristics, including hindsight bias,
   cognitive conservatism, and the fundamental attribution error. But
   techniques of computational simulation-involving the rigorous production
   of large numbers of counterfactual worlds-make it possible to mitigate
   both problems that Tetlock identifies: that history, produced only once,
   is a lousy teacher; and that humans, with their collection of
   non-Bayesian heuristics, are lousy pupils. Tetlock was wrong to reject
   this approach as theoretically promising but rhetorically and
   practically impractical.},

Journal = {CONTEMPORARY POLITICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {49-61},
Abstract = {This article examines how and why India, the world's largest democracy,
   remains sceptical about the idea of promoting its own political order
   abroad. It first lays down the historical background of India's long
   abstinence from promoting democracy and describes the country's more
   recent shift in foreign policies towards greater (though still cautious
   and selective) support for international democracy promotion. On a
   conceptual level and as a thought experiment, the article then compares
   in what ways three prominent schools of thought in international
   relations (neo-realism, neo-institutionalist liberalism, and social
   constructivism) are capable of contributing to an explanation of Indian
   reticence in democracy promotion. While they emphasize different aspects
   and dimensions of India's hesitance to engage in democracy promotion,
   all three contribute analytically to such an explanation.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes a new understanding of political stability. In doing
   so, it reviews and critiques previous definitions, outlines five
   operational concepts, and identifies implications important to the
   practice of stability operations, current US government policy, and
   academic research.
   It finds political stability to be the degree to which formal roles and
   structures coincide with informal roles and structures within a
   political object. The wider the `gap,' the greater the instability.
   Uniquely, this view sees stability and instability as statements of
   potential, not occurrence.},

Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},

Volume = {33},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {This article applies a public policy instrumentation approach to two
   instruments of EU security policy - civilian crisis management and
   enlargement conditionality. Both have come to be portrayed, by
   policy-makers and observers alike, as deliberate and efficient responses
   to specific policy challenges. Our analysis of the processes behind
   their adoption challenges such claims. In a complex institution like the
   EU, and in a sensitive sector like security, the development of new
   policy instruments requires negotiation within dense institutional
   settings. The resulting instruments do not necessarily match the initial
   intentions of their creators. The focus on unanticipated - albeit in
   retrospect not necessarily undesired - consequences in the development
   of the instruments of EU security policy also contributes to the broader
   research agenda on policy instruments, which problematises the selection
   of policy instruments yet nevertheless tends to perceive them as part of
   a deliberate strategy of policy change.},

Pages = {248-268},
Abstract = {In February 2010, the Australian government released its second
   Counter-Terrorism White Paper, claiming that terrorism continues to pose
   a serious security challenge to Australia. The article critically
   re-examines the terrorist threat to Australia and explores the threat
   posed by the traditional Al-Qaeda leadership, by regional organisations
   like Jemaah Islamiyah and by so-called `home-grown' terrorists. Arguing
   that it is imperative to differentiate clearly between the threat to
   Australia and Australian interests abroad, the article identifies the
   sources of threat in the Australian context. It concludes that neither
   Al-Qaeda nor Jemaah Islamiyah nor home-grown terrorism poses any
   significant objective threat to Australia. At the same time it is
   acknowledged that the subjective perception of the terrorist
   necessitates the government to develop an effective counter-terrorism
   strategy. However, given that the terrorism threat is objectively low,
   policy measures addressing the threat ought to be carefully designed to
   meet the requirements of proportionality and (potential) effectiveness.},

Abstract = {Apart from issues of representation, the new Scottish Parliament
   resembles Westminster more than its founders had hoped. It was
   influenced by the same reform agenda that has animated debates on reform
   of the Commons. The most significant changes from the Westminster model
   are evident in the voting system, though less than anticipated.
   Westminster continued to reform itself, albeit in limited ways, after
   1997 while Holyrood has rarely addressed some of the same issues.
   Significant changes appear more likely at the outset of an institution's
   establishment than after it has come into being when practices, styles
   and interests are established and reform relies on either an exogenous
   shock or slow, incremental change.},

Abstract = {Exile in Colombia has constituted a socio-spatial dispositive of
   domination and control, which, in the last decade has plundered around
   four million people, most of them Afro-descendants and natives. For the
   Afro-descendant peoples, exile is associated with the kidnapping of
   slaves, the racial discrimination and the violence which has subalterned
   and geo-situated them as losers and defeated in the contemporary war.
   The Afro-descendants, wandering and rootless, bear exiled memories which
   incarnate invisibilized knowledges in the national identity and are
   relegated from the geopolitics of knowledge production and circulation.
   In this work we will explore how the experience of Afro-descendant exile
   in Medellin produces the re-existence of political subjects who
   endeavour to survive physically and to manage spaces of social
   inclusion. To re-exist from the Afro-Colombian condition implies: to
   articulate different knowledges and practices in order to encourage
   solidarity; to display creative ways of being/thinking; and, to produce
   spatialities in the middle of the urban precariousness.},

Abstract = {Indonesia's post-Suharto regionalism is a response to the nation's
   former centralist governance, and to real or perceived socio-economic
   disadvantage. Islands in the eastern archipelago illustrate this well,
   because there-far from the national capital Jakarta- local and national
   interaction is being redefined as regions seek improved social,
   economic, and political environments. Whilst in most cases not defying
   national integration, people in these regions no longer wish to be
   dependent upon the central authority of Jakarta, and look beyond
   previously restricted boundaries for new opportunities. This article
   explores some of the territorial realignments and key geopolitical
   networks that have been formed as a result of this. These include new
   provinces and trans-regional collaborations in which leaders claim to
   offer greater protection for local interests. In case studies from the
   eastern zone, this article examines some of the cooperation and
   competition generated in the process of forming the new locations and
   alliances. It evaluates benefits for local communities, and seeks to
   understand how the new regionalism may influence established concepts
   and patterns of power in the nation.},

Abstract = {By challenging the state's prerogative to distinguish between insiders
   and outsiders, citizens and non-citizens, political movements by and in
   support of migrants and refugees are forcing questions about what
   criteria, if any, can and should be used to determine who can claim
   membership in the political community. To illustrate the complexity of
   this politics this article analyzes the major demand that underscores
   every campaign undertaken by non-status refugees and migrants in Canada:
   a program that would allow them to ``regularize{''} their status.
   Notably, these campaigns are being directed at both the state and city
   levels of governance. Together, these are two sites in which claims and
   counter-claims about community, belonging, and citizenship are being
   made by, for, and against non-status immigrants. In each case, migrant
   political agency is asserted in places meant to deny, limit, or repress
   it. The article argues that the significance of these sites is that they
   allow for non-status refugees and migrants themselves to act as
   mediators or translators between the city and nation, between polis and
   cosmopolis.},

   often employed as a deux ex machina to explain almost every African woe.
   Contrary to this mainstream analytical approach, we contend that
   institutional failure or weakness itself needs explanation. In this
   paper, we attempt to provide some explanations for the growing
   ineffectiveness of the Nigerian internal security apparatuses by
   unraveling how being embedded in a corruption complex not only
   undermines the security system but also spawns a web of insecurity in
   the entire country, as evident in the rampant cases of armed robbery,
   ransom kidnapping, ritual killing, assassination, ethnic militia, and
   sectarian violence.},

Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {14},
Number = {2},
Pages = {221-236},
Abstract = {There is an interesting debate about democracy and citizenship in the
   EU. Views diverge about the features of democratic deficits currently
   facing the EU and accordingly, about the scope for Union citizenship.
   The paper suggests an analytical distinction between asymmetric and
   symmetric normative models of dual - national and Union - citizenship.
   Moreover, it proposes an alternative model of dual citizenship that puts
   emphasis on the responsiveness of citizens vis-a-vis phenomena that
   undermine democratic governance and the claim for equal respect and
   concern. One of the main ideas of responsive citizenship is that
   effective democratic control should complement procedural legitimacy in
   the EU as a means to prevent phenomena of political domination and
   guardianship. This is possible through the combination of competences
   ascribed on citizens through national and Community legislation
   vis-a-vis national and Union executive bodies.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to further our understanding of the
   directional nature of left-right scores. I suggest that a party's
   ability to modify its perceived position is conditional on whether
   parties adopt their manifestos to alter their perceived position and on
   whether voters are persuaded by parties' attempts to relocate in
   political space. As voters' knowledge of political parties is a major
   determinant of where parties are perceived to be located, new parties or
   parties with weak identities are more likely than old parties to modify
   their perceived positions, and for two reasons: they are neither willing
   nor able to adopt an identity-based platform and their freedom to move
   in political space is not constrained by what voters know about them.
   The results of statistical analyses show that while Italian voters
   modified their perception of party positions in the light of party
   manifestos, this was not the case in the other countries under study,
   where parties had longer histories than their Italian counterparts.},

Abstract = {Tools of direct democracy, such as the citizen initiative, are available
   at both the state and local levels in the United States, yet models of
   the process typically do not consider these institutions in tandem. In
   this article, I develop a model of local fiscal policy that incorporates
   the impact of a statewide as well as a local initiative process. I posit
   that the statewide initiative process leads to lower levels of state
   spending, additional spending mandates on the local level, and reduced
   deadweight costs of taxation, with these three factors leading to an
   increase in local spending. I then show that the ability of interest
   groups to secure particularistic spending through the local initiative
   has a similarly pro-spending impact. Subsequently, I explore data from
   the year 2000 in over 600 cities with a population greater than 25,000
   and find that the spending-enhancing effects of the local initiative are
   strong when signature requirements are low, leading to a 12-14 percent
   increase in spending compared to local governments without such an
   initiative process in place.},

Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {17},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {235-250},
Abstract = {This article is concerned with the relationship between democracy and
   violence. The first section argues that the way in which that
   relationship is characterized depends on how violence is defined. Some
   definitions extend the ordinary understanding of violence as an act of
   direct physical coercion. Variously, they draw attention to indirect
   forms of violence that are the result of failures to act by governments,
   and to institutional and structural violence embedded in the normal
   functioning of `peace-loving' democracies. This, together with liberal
   democrats' occasional readiness to resort to violence of a direct and
   physical kind, counters the idea that violence is inherently anathema to
   democracy. In this view violence and democracy may go hand in hand. The
   second section explores one way in which democracy and violence do seem
   to be mutually exclusive. When democracy appears to be threatened by
   violence and that threat is portrayed as exceptional, democratic
   governments may show an alarming readiness to resort to violence and to
   jettison democratic principles and values in proportion to the perceived
   threat.},

Title = {Adaptive Decision-Making and the Vote: The Case of Spain},
Journal = {POLITICA Y GOBIERNO},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {17},
Number = {2},
Pages = {321-349},
Abstract = {The normative focus of the study of political behaviour assumes that
   voters are rational and that all apply the same method of reasoning when
   they have to choose. Given the limitations of the normative view of
   voting theory, some authors have chosen to explain the voter's decision
   from a descriptive perspective. In this paper, we develop an adaptive
   model to describe the different decision-making processes that voters
   apply. Our ultimate goal is to identify rules that characterize the
   political behaviour of individuals. To achieve this, we use a
   classification technique from the field of automatic learning: decision
   trees. At the empirical level, we have discovered that Spanish voters
   apply different decision processes that are guided by the heuristic
   criterion of cost saving of information about the incumbent, the
   government's actions and the future of the country's economy. The
   decision trees obtained enable us to classify voters into four
   categories: ritualists, voters influenced by affective factors, those
   influenced by government performance and forward-looking voters.},

Title = {Politicians in the Publicity Trap? On the Mediatization of Domestic
   Political Negotiations},
Journal = {POLITISCHE VIERTELJAHRESSCHRIFT},
Year = {2010},
Number = {44},
Pages = {416+},
Abstract = {Politicians in modern negotiation democracies are confronted with a
   twofold challenge On the one side, they need to be (more) open to
   compromise in order to avoid political deadlock On the other side, this
   willingness should not be taken as political weakness by their target
   group(s) and the public Thus, we explore what impact the media might
   have on the performance of politicians participating in domestic
   political negotiations By focussing on institutional factors we suggest
   a typology of mediatized negotiations which can be related to the
   research on governance and political communication Taking into account
   the issue and the institutional setting of political negotiations we
   argue that politicians can pursue a publicity-avoidance or a
   publicity-instrumentalization strategy Both of them imply the use of
   specific tactics of neglecting, controlling or mobilizing the public,
   all of which affects interactions among negotiators and their chances to
   find a compromise},

Title = {Democracy Despite Government: African American Parading and Democratic
   Theory},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {32},
Number = {4},
Pages = {485-499},
Abstract = {This article engages a double exploration of the political meanings of
   African American parading in New Orleans and the significance of those
   meanings for understandings of democracy, especially those theories that
   look beyond elective representative democracy and aim, even under
   existing conditions of inequality, to include all voices. African
   Americans in New Orleans have a long tradition of parading that lays
   claim to public streets for pleasure, articulations of community, modes
   of remembrance, and protest. In parading, residents craft a public
   sphere for cultural, social, and political expression and fashion the
   streets into a distinctive, relatively egalitarian public square that
   exists regardless of and sometimes in opposition to the government and
   its formal, institutionally political spheres of action. The authors
   characterize this parading as ``democracy despite
   government.{''}Democracy despite government involves open and public,
   relatively egalitarian, informal political practices beyond the
   institutional boundaries, rational deliberative processes, and
   instrumental actions of representative government. Such democracy gives
   expression to the values and interests of the politically marginalized.
   It does not necessarily directly challenge or replace formal democratic
   or quasi-or un-democratic institutions, processes, and policies. Still,
   the parading, as an instance of democracy despite government, creates
   and expresses freedom and community and gives scope for the marginalized
   to express their own values, identities, and interests in civil society.},

Title = {Three cultural turns: how multiculturalism, interactivity and
   interpassivity affect citizenship},
Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Pages = {293-306},
Abstract = {Conceptions of citizenship in modern liberal political theory have
   always, implicitly or explicitly, been affected by dynamics of political
   culture. Rawls' theory of justice, a paradigm of modern liberal
   political theory, implicitly presupposes a political culture of
   emancipation and of welfarist policies. This contribution distinguishes
   three `cultural turns' that make explicit how citizenship has been
   affected by political culture in the last several decades. First, the
   notion of `access to one's own culture', as advocated by
   multiculturalist liberalism, is shown to be merely a belated recognition
   of the fact that political culture always already was a decisive factor
   in liberal political theory. Second, it is argued that the `switch' from
   private to public argument, as it figures prominently in liberal theory,
   presupposes a political culture that supports and encourages the
   practice of such a kind of switching between private and public
   identity, and reasoning. Third, the political culture of emancipation
   has, ironically, produced a counter-emancipatory turn from interactivity
   toward `interpassivity': the inability to act on norms that one
   subscribes to oneself. It is argued that this interpassive turn - a new
   kind of `dialectic of Enlightenment' - may explain typically
   (post)modern forms of dissatisfaction with democratic life.},

Title = {On the Road to Extinction: Agrarian Parties in Twentieth-Century Ireland},
Journal = {IRISH POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {25},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {581-601},
Abstract = {Four main explanations have been offered to account for the absence of a
   major agrarian party in post-independence Ireland and for the minor
   status and transience of those agrarian parties that did appear. For
   contextual reasons associated with nationalism and modernity, two of
   these suggest that there was no real need for a major agrarian party to
   begin with. Two other explanations point to the inability of the three
   main agrarian parties that did emerge to transcend the class divisions
   that prevented farmers becoming a coherent political class, and to
   counter the inadequacies that left them organisationally and tactically
   disadvantaged vis-a-vis their political rivals. The author's reading
   emphasises how the difficulties generated by class and political
   divisions were mutually reinforcing and how these difficulties in turn
   impacted on organisational and tactical prospects.},

Abstract = {The objectivist truth claims traditionally pressed by most political
   scientists have made the use of ethnographic methods particularly
   fraught in the discipline. This article explores what ethnography as a
   method entails. It makes distinctions between positivist and
   interpretivist ethnographies and highlights sonic of the substantive
   contributions ethnography has made to the study of politics. Lamenting
   the discipline's abandonment of a conversation with anthropology after
   Geertz, this review also insists on moving beyond the anthropological
   controversies so powerfully expressed in the edited volume Writing
   Culture (1986) and other texts of the 1980s and 1990. I contend that
   interpretive social science does not have to forswear generalizations or
   causal explanations and that ethnographic methods can be used in the
   service of establishing them. Rather than fleeing from abstractions,
   ethnographies can and should help ground them.},

Title = {Malaysia - towards a topology of an electoral one-party state},
Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {17},
Number = {5},
Pages = {920-949},
Abstract = {For the first time in 51 years of independence, Malaysia's ruling
   coalition Barisan Nasional (National Front, BN) under the weak
   leadership of Abdullah Badawi was denied its customary parliamentary
   two-third majority in the 2008 elections. The three major opposition
   parties, which formed the Pakatan Rakyat (The People's Alliance, PR)
   after the elections, increased the number of opposition-held state
   governments from one to five. The opposition had never held more than
   two state governments at any one time.1 For many practitioners and
   students of Malaysian politics, the 2008 poll means the birth of a long
   overdue `two-party system', where two multi-ethnic coalitions contest
   for power and alternate in running the country. After all, two similar
   attempts to build a Malay-dominated second coalition to rival the ruling
   coalition dominated by the ethno-nationalist United Malays National
   Organisation (UMNO) were made in the 1990 and 1999 elections by former
   UMNO leaders who lost in their party in-fighting. Sadly, the coalitions
   built did not survive even the next elections. We argue that such
   optimism may be misplaced due to a failure to appreciate the `electoral
   one-party state' nature of Malaysia.2 Despite having held 13 national
   elections without failure, and having almost no incidence of in- or
   post-election violence, neither a military coup nor `people's power',
   Malaysia has never been anywhere close to being a `consolidated
   democracy', 52 years after joining what Huntington called the second
   wave of democratization.3 For Linz and Stepan, a consolidated democracy
   requires not only a government with de facto authority to generate
   policy and exclusive de jure power, but also that `this government comes
   to power that is the direct result of a free and popular vote'. In other
   words, democracy has to become `the only game in town'.4.},

Abstract = {We consider the possibility for the parties to invest in negative
   campaigning - a behavior that, in our framework, involves blaming
   alleged insufficiencies of the rival concerning commonly shared values.
   Within a simple one-dimensional model, we deduce the hypothesis that the
   parties' incentive to ``attack{''} each other increases with the
   parties' proximity on the left-right space. We test our hypothesis on an
   Italian case, focusing on the emphasis placed by the Communist Party on
   political corruption issues during the government investiture debates
   that spanned from the postwar period until 1994, when the traditional
   party system abruptly collapsed. The statistical results are largely
   consistent with our theoretical insights. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {In the Latin American context, the Dominican Republic displays high
   levels of civic engagement and political activism, yet they have not
   translated into a civil society that is able to exercise considerable
   influence in reforming the political system or enhancing
   democracy.Building on this observation, this article explores two
   questions. The first is if there is tendency toward dual participation
   in civic and political organizations, which reduces civil society's
   ability to pressure political parties and the State. The second refers
   to the nature of the connections that civil society participants have
   with the State and with political parties. The analysis demonstrates
   that an important segment of the population that participates in civic
   associations also participates in political parties and in clientelist
   networks.},

Title = {Two of a kind? Voting motivations for populist radical right and

Abstract = {Over the last two decades a number of theoretical perspectives have
   emphasized the growing phenomenon of extremist political challenges.
   These challenges come from two main sources: largely secular radical
   right-wing populism and religious fundamentalism. Yet the relationship
   between the two is still theoretically and empirically limited.
   Researchers have usually limited their discussion to only one of the
   phenomena, ignoring the fact that despite the basic distinction between
   the two (i.e., secular versus religious orientation), the literature
   points to many commonalities. This article takes up the challenge by
   analyzing the predictive power of socioeconomic, ideological, and
   security threat factors on voting behavior for populist radical right
   (PRR) parties and for religious fundamentalist (RF) parties. Data
   collected following the Israeli parliamentary election of 2003 (N = 808)
   offer a challenge to the conventional, secular wisdom of right-wing
   extremism. The radical right party family is multifaceted with at least
   two flanks - a hawkish nationalist flank on the one hand, and a
   `faith-based' radical flank on the other. Implications of these
   distinctions for voting behavior scholars and radical right-wing
   scholars are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {I extend the standard spatial model of legislative voting to account for
   vote-specific party inducements and procedural differences. Focusing on
   voting in the 1999-2004 European Parliament, I find evidence of
   vote-specific party inducements in a large share of the roll call votes.
   Furthermore, MEPs position themselves differently across procedures. As
   most roll call votes are taken on non-legislative votes, these estimates
   may overemphasize voting pattern on these votes and downplay voting
   pattern on legislative votes. As such, these estimates may be a poorly
   suited for studying within party heterogeneity on legislative votes.},

Abstract = {Political jurisdictions have incentives to promote pollution spillovers
   to capture the benefits of economic production within their borders
   while exporting the environmental costs to their neighbors. The authors
   examine the extent to which U. S. states engage in this type of
   free-riding behavior. Studying enforcement of the federal Clean Air Act
   from 1990 through 2000, the authors employ zero-inflated negative
   binomial regression to predict the number of state-initiated enforcement
   actions conducted in counties bordering other jurisdictions. They find
   that states perform fewer enforcement actions in counties adjacent to
   international borders but no evidence that states conduct less
   enforcement in counties that border other states.},

Abstract = {Axel Honneth distinguishes between recognitive practices according to
   the social domain in which they occur and this allows him to theorise
   the relationship between power and recognition. `Love-based
   recognition', which suggests the centrality of recognition to the
   relationships that nurture us in the first instance, is located in the
   family. Honneth argues that relationships encompassed by this category
   are pre-political, thereby repeating the distinction between the public
   and the private common to much political theory. This article explores
   the structure of this delineation in his thinking. I argue that
   Honneth's analysis marginalises feminist concerns with how power
   functions through recognition in the private sphere. Honneth also robs
   himself of a rejoinder to recognition sceptics, who suggest that the
   desire for recognition is a condition of subordination. The article
   argues for an alternative approach to the analysis of `love' within
   recognitive theory. Contemporary Political Theory (2010) 9, 414-433.

Title = {Party Affiliation, Partisanship, and Political Beliefs: A Field
   Experiment},
Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {104},
Number = {4},
Pages = {720-744},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Partisanship is strongly correlated with attitudes and behavior, but it
   is unclear from this pattern whether partisan identity has a causal
   effect on political behavior and attitudes. We report the results of a
   field experiment that investigates the causal effect of party
   identification. Prior to the February 2008 Connecticut presidential
   primary, researchers sent a mailing to a random sample of unaffiliated
   registered voters who, in a pretreatment survey, leaned toward a
   political party. The mailing informed the subjects that only voters
   registered with a party were able to participate in the upcoming
   presidential primary. Subjects were surveyed again in June 2008.
   Comparing posttreatment survey responses to subjects' baseline survey
   responses, we find that those reminded of the need to register with a
   party were more likely to identify with a party and showed stronger
   partisanship. Further, we find that the treatment group also
   demonstrated greater concordance than the control group between their
   pretreatment latent partisanship and their posttreatment reported voting
   behavior and intentions and evaluations of partisan figures. Thus, our
   treatment, which appears to have caused a strengthening of partisan
   identity, also appears to have caused a shift in subjects' candidate
   preferences and evaluations of salient political figures. This finding
   is consistent with the claim that partisanship is an active force
   changing how citizens behave in and perceive the political world.},

Abstract = {Limitation riders, which allow the U. S. Congress to forbid agencies
   from spending money for specific uses, enable congressional majorities
   to exert greater influence over bureaucratic policy decisions than is
   appreciated by research on policy making in the United States. I develop
   a theory of limitation riders, explaining why they lead to policy
   outcomes that are preferable to a majority of legislators compared to
   outcomes that would occur if this tool did not exist. I assess this
   perspective empirically by analyzing the volume of limitation riders
   reported in bills from 1993 to 2002 and all limitation riders forbidding
   regulatory actions from 1989 to 2009. In addition to supporting the
   conclusion that Congress possesses more leverage over agencies'
   decisions than is currently appreciated, the findings have implications
   for advancing theories of delegation.},

Title = {RETHINKING INTERNATIONAL HISTORY, THEORY AND THE EVENT WITH HANNAH
   ARENDT},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {6},
Number = {2},
Pages = {117-141},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This paper reconsiders the event in International Relations (IR) through
   the writings of Hannah Arendt. The event has for too long been neglected
   in IR; international events are overwhelmingly conceived as mere
   happenings that have meaning only within the process and temporal
   structure of the theory from which they are understood, and as holding
   no or only limited meaning in and of themselves. In her work on
   political theory and her reflections on totalitarianism, however, Arendt
   elaborates a rich view of the event and its relationship to history, one
   that offers an alternative way of thinking about international
   relations. Arendt urges us to remain open to the possibility, however
   difficult, of conceiving of the event as meaningful outside of the
   processes within which our established mode of thoughts would have us
   subsume it. This requires on the part of the historian a commitment to
   judgement, to a recognition of the importance of imagination and
   impartiality that gives meaning to the event for others. In explicating
   Arendt's complex notion of the genuine political event, the paper aims
   not merely to demonstrate the intrinsic interest of this conception of
   the event to her thought, but to add to the small but growing number of
   works in IR that have found fruitful new avenues of thought in Arendt's
   various writings, and also to recent discussions on the proper
   relationship between history and IR theory.},

Abstract = {The emergence of new information and communication technologies in the
   1990s offered governments opportunities to deliver public services more
   effectively to their citizens. Yet national and subnational authorities
   have employed such technologies in highly uneven ways. Drawing on a new
   data set of technology policy adoption by Indian states, the author
   argues that political calculations drive variation in the timing and
   scope of technology policies. Politicians weigh the expected electoral
   benefits from providing new goods to citizens against the expected
   electoral costs of reduced access to corrupt funds because of increased
   transparency. The author shows that the level of bureaucratic corruption
   in a state is the best predictor of both when states implement policies
   promoting computer-enabled services and the number of services made
   available. This finding contrasts with arguments that posit economic or
   developmental conditions, or alternative electoral and institutional
   characteristics, as the major drivers of technology investment.},

Volume = {34},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {As far as the bourgeois revolutions were concerned, Antonio Gramsci used
   the term `passive revolution' to contrast the form taken by the Italian
   Risorgimento and comparable `revolutions from above' with that of the
   French Revolution, where the main dynamic had come `from below': The key
   era of passive revolution in this sense lies between 1859 and 1871. From
   the closing decades of the 17th century, however, a different set of
   circumstances had already led to a comparable revolution in Scotland
   which, although little known, is one of the decisive turning points for
   the transition in Western Europe. The context for this transformation
   was the global inter-systemic conflict between England and France, in
   which Scotland was one of the main battlefields. The process had four
   key moments: first, a subsistence crisis at home and imperial failure
   abroad, the combined effects of which sent Scottish capitalist
   development into reverse. Second, and in response to the first, was the
   Anglo-Scottish Union of 1707, which dissolved the Scottish state while
   leaving the feudal jurisdictions of the Scottish lords intact. Third,
   the failure of a French-backed attempt at counter-revolution in 1745-6,
   which led to the military suppression and juridical abolition of feudal
   social relations north of the border; and fourth, the imposition of
   capitalist social relations in the Scottish countryside by an alliance
   of former feudal landlords, `improving' tenant farmers and Enlightenment
   intellectuals, who then theorised the entire process in their discussion
   of `civil society'.},

Abstract = {The 2010 general election result was so finely balanced that only a
   combination of the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats together could
   command a workable majority in the House of Commons. However, this
   combination meant that the Liberal Democrats had to abandon their
   centre-left positioning and, accepting the arithmetic conclusion of the
   election, help form a centre-right administration. This article explores
   how each of the main parties, in the days immediately following the
   election, worked through the potential political outcomes, and how they
   viewed the conflicts they posed between ideological traditions and
   instincts, personal relationships and party interests. It assesses the
   ideological, strategic and organisational aspects of the coalition and
   makes an interim assessment of the impact the arrangement may have on
   the British political landscape.},
