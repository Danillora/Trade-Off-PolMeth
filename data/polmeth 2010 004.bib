Abstract = {The newly elected Hatoyama administration has launched several projects
   on the Internet to facilitate interactions with the public. Politicians
   use Twitter to tweet their political activities and interact with other
   users. Government agencies have launched several new Web sites, such as
   hatomimi and jukugi kake-ai, and integrated video-steaming sites, such
   as ustream. com. Notwithstanding these efforts, however, the new
   administration has not yet been able to apply these forums to resolving
   hard political issues.},

Abstract = {This article examines the main aspects of the UK's foreign and security
   policy across the 2005-2010 Parliament. It begins by discussing the
   highpoint of foreign policy during the period, and goes on to consider
   the evolution of the UK's foreign policy doctrine, looking in particular
   at whether Brown established a world view that was distinctive from his
   predecessor. The analysis then turns to the key foreign policy actors in
   the period and in particular the extent to which changes of foreign
   secretary impacted on the UK's foreign and security policy. The article
   assesses the foreign and security policy issues that predominated from
   after the 2005 General Election, through Brown's anointment as Prime
   Minister in 2007 and until the 2010 General Election. The final part of
   the article considers the minimal role that foreign policy played in the
   2010 General Election campaign. There was a considerable convergence of
   views between each of the three main political parties in their foreign
   policy platforms. Labour faced criticism for its resourcing of the war
   in Afghanistan, rather than objection to continuing engagement. The
   renewal of the Trident weapons system was one of the few substantive
   issues dividing the Conservatives and Labour from the Liberal Democrats.},

Abstract = {The 2010 election was one of the most competitive campaigns of recent
   decades. The first televised leaders' debates along with the rise of
   online social networking led to renewed speculation about the potential
   influence of the media in campaigns. By contrast the press appeared to
   revert to pre mid-1990s form with strong support for the Conservatives
   and personal attacks on their opponents. This article concentrates on
   three main areas: the influence of the leaders debates on the campaign
   and outcome of the election; whether and how press endorsements made
   much difference; and finally, the hype surrounding the notion of an
   internet election and whether e-campaigning made any difference to the
   campaign.},

Abstract = {Fethullah Gulen is a moderate Turkish Muslim scholar, a prolific writer,
   philosopher, and leader of a self-named movement. His critics accuse him
   of undermining Turkish secular values, while his followers claim that he
   is a moderate religious scholar that is a victim of baseless and
   recurring attacks. Gulen and his Movement promote interfaith dialogue.
   The purpose of this essay is to examine Gulen's relations with the
   Jewish community inside and outside Turkey, and analyze whether this
   dialogue is used as a tool to empower the Movement or to disseminate
   Islam, as Gulen's critics claim, or whether it is based on a genuine
   desire to appeal to the Jewish community and carry out a real dialogue.},

Abstract = {The political economy literature investigates the determinants of
   foreign direct investment (FDI) based largely on aggregate data,
   ignoring the actual decision makers. The authors conduct a survey of
   U.S. chief executive officers-the actual decision makers-of corporations
   that have investments in Latin America to understand FDI inflows. The
   authors find that investment risk related to property-rights protection,
   adherence to rule of law, and an effective court system weighed most
   heavily in U.S. firm preferences. The results suggest that rather than
   stress democracy itself as a determining factor, researchers might
   better focus on the institutions found within democracies.},

Title = {Social Classes in the Process of Capitalist Landnahme On the
   Relevance of Secondary Exploitation},
Journal = {SOCIALIST STUDIES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {6},
Number = {2},
Pages = {43-74},

Abstract = {So far, growing social insecurity and inequality have not led to a
   revival of classconscious labour movements in the centres of capitalism.
   This article builds upon Rosa Luxemburg's concept of Landnahme to
   attempt to explain this phenomenon. In contemporary Germany, as in other
   developed countries, a transition from a society pacified by Fordist
   methods to a more strongly polarized class society is taking placethough
   characterized by a peculiar `stabilization of the unstable'. An
   `interior' Landnahme set in motion by financial capitalism has also
   severely aggravated secondary exploitation and the precarization of
   labour. Trade unions and the segment of the working class represented by
   unions often react by closing their ranks in exclusive solidarity. Faced
   with the prospect of downward social mobility, they develop defensive
   strategies to preserve their remaining social property - even at the
   expense of precarized groups. Such a disciplinary regime can only be
   broken if precarized groups and their forms of working and living are
   integrated into new structures of inclusive solidarity.},

Abstract = {The concept of the obligation criminal (Pflichtdelikte) was first
   proposed by Professor Roxin, but the crime nature of the obligation
   criminal is still being largely disputed in the criminal law theory
   circle, and someone thought it was the legal interest violation, and
   others thought it was the violation of positive obligation which has
   been recognized by the criminal law. As viewed from the obligation, the
   criminal law regulates two obligations, i.e. the positive obligation and
   the negative obligation, and the former is embodied in the obligation of
   ``not to harm others{''}, and the latter is embodied in the obligation
   of ``establish the common worlds with others{''}. The positive
   obligation not only contains ``not to harm others{''}, but requires
   people to unify others, so the positive obligation can not equal to the
   negative obligation. As viewed from the criminal law, it is advisable to
   identify the behavior of violating negative obligation with the legal
   interest violation. But it is not correct to identify the behavior of
   violating positive obligation with the legal interest violation, because
   the crime nature of the obligation criminal is the violation of positive
   obligation which has been recognized by the criminal law.},

Abstract = {Advocates of trade liberalisation that include the Bretton Woods
   Institutions (BWIs) and their adherents in the third world encourage
   foreign direct investment as a means of stimulating economic development
   in these economies. The arguments in favour of foreign investments are
   that it provides among other benefits, the required capital for
   development, facilitates technology transfer, and improve infrastructure
   development. Foreign direct investment is however criticised for its
   negative impact on the economies of the third world for a number of
   reasons. Multinational corporations (MNCs) that account for the highest
   contributors to FDI through private capital investment are accused of
   sharp practices that include exploitation, corruption, unethical
   business practices and environmental degradation. Through their
   activities, MNC engender loss of sovereignty and policy-making by host
   economies and loss of control over resources among other negative
   impacts. One instrument used by Foreign Capital to subjugate developing
   economies is the control of management of projects and programmes into
   which investments are made. Management control is therefore a primary
   objective of investors and this is usually accomplished right from the
   time agreements are reached between the host states and the investors.
   The study concluded that more often than not, the implication of
   management control over investment on developing economies include the
   desire to recoup capital invested at the shortest possible time, total
   dependence of the sector on investors for future development, reaping
   huge profits at the expense of local communities, damaging social
   networks and instigating political instability by the non-recognition
   and lack of respect for existing social conditions. Certain measures are
   therefore inevitable if FDI is to engender sustainable development.},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This essay considers W. E. B. Du Bois's Darkwater (1920) as a window
   onto Du Bois's political theory at an underexamined stage of his career
   and onto a challenge at the heart of black political thought: how to
   formulate a conception of collective life that regards the humanity of
   black women and men as a central concern. Exploring Du Bois's attempt to
   articulate what can be seen through the lens of an avowedly ``black{''}
   perspective and his creative juxtaposition of different modes of
   writing, the author suggests why Darkwater remains a valuable resource
   for democratic theory in an age misleadingly described as
   ``post-racial.'},

Abstract = {On October 12, 2000, the USS Cole was attacked by a small band of
   Islamic (global) insurgents. Why would sea insurgents attack a
   professional warship that did not appear to be related to
   counterinsurgency? When are such attacks successful, and when are they
   not successful? Three dimensions-value, vulnerability, and learning-give
   convincing answers to this puzzle. I trace two cases: the USS Cole
   bombing and the USS Ashland and Kearsarge missile attack. I find that
   when the navy is equipped with a fast learning process and this reduces
   its vulnerability, sea insurgents' attacks are less successful. This
   strategic interaction dynamic is strongly applicable to South Korea
   under three subdynamics: alliance, commitment dilemma, and enhanced
   naval capabilities. Thus, the Republic of Korea Navy needs to establish
   a flexible strategy in its effort to effectively deal with
   nontraditional threats as well as traditional threats, such as North

Abstract = {Some presidents facing term limits attempt - often successfully - to
   scrap tenure restrictions, while others step down when constitutionally
   required. Whether democratic, partly democratic or non-democratic, there
   is considerable variation among electoral regimes as to whether
   presidents respect term limits. This article focuses on what is at stake
   for a president required to leave the highest political office. It
   argues that for a given level of executive constraints, the value of
   holding political office in polities with large public sectors and
   prevalent corruption, combined with the probability of retaining assets
   and immunity after leaving office, influences whether presidents attempt
   to overstay their tenure.},

Abstract = {This article provides an overview of the institutionalization of the
   European Parliament. Quantitative analysis, based on the biographies of
   Members of European Parliament on the sixth term (between 2004 and
   2009), underlines the emergence of specialists who dominate the
   parliamentary space. First, we point out convergences in the modalities
   of political and social recruitment. The unattractiveness of the
   European Parliament (EP), compared to the national political space, has
   favoured the recruitment of actors who are less endowed with legitimate
   resources. For numerous members, the EP represents an opportunity for
   political professionalization. Second, we underline the emergence of a
   parliamentary elite with specific European resources and career types.},

   scholarly analysis of Jim Bulpitt's Territory and Power in the United
   Kingdom: An Interpretation. It first addresses the principal theoretical
   concerns and the historical interpretation that Bulpitt pursued in
   Territory and Power. It discusses the main lines of criticism that have
   been laid against the book and how in turn these have been rebutted. The
   article then assesses how the contributions made in this special issue
   provide fresh reflection on the book's contribution to the study of UK
   and comparative politics before suggesting how Territory and Power could
   shape the agenda of future research.},

Abstract = {The idea that policy makers in different states or countries may learn
   from one another has fascinated scholars for a long time, but little
   systematic evidence has been produced so far. This article improves our
   understanding of this elusive argument by distinguishing between the
   policy and political consequences of reforms and by emphasizing the
   conditional nature of learning processes. Using a directed dyadic
   approach and multilevel methods, the analysis of unemployment benefits
   retrenchment in OECD countries demonstrates that policy makers learn
   selectively from the experience of others. Right governments tend to be
   more sensitive to information on the electoral consequences of reforms,
   while left governments are more likely to be influenced by their policy

Abstract = {Misreporting is a problem that plagues researchers who use survey data.
   In this article, we develop a parametric model that corrects for
   misclassified binary responses using information on the misreporting
   patterns obtained from auxiliary data sources. The model is implemented
   within the Bayesian framework via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
   methods and can be easily extended to address other problems exhibited
   by survey data, such as missing response and/or covariate values. While
   the model is fully general, we illustrate its application in the context
   of estimating models of turnout using data from the American National
   Elections Studies.},

Abstract = {Courtesy of a little-noticed reform in the autumn of 2006, Westminster's
   legislative process has been revitalised. Changes to the House of
   Commons committee stage of the consideration of bills, have made
   legislative scrutiny more effective. The reform also has the potential
   to contribute to a cultural shift in the attitude of all Members of
   Parliament to accepting the importance of holding the government to
   account. With encouragement and further modification, it is a reform
   which can bring important changes to the balance of power between the
   executive and parliament in this country. It is a change that should be
   welcomed.},

Abstract = {Understanding the relevancy that acquires the victory of the ex
   clergyman of the Catholic Church Fernando Armindo Lugo Mendez in
   Paraguay, implies realizing a revision (brief but conscientious) of the
   political recent life of the above mentioned country, to understand the
   characteristics that the Party Colorado -opponent to the ex-bishop in
   the 2008 elections-had during 61 years before; 35 of which shaped a
   dictatorship (led by Alfredo Stroessner).
   Making a brief characterization of the political history of Paraguay,
   starting with the Patriotic War, continuing with a description of the
   Colorado governments that presided between 1947 and 2008 and deepening
   the analysis the years of transition to democracy (begun in 1989), this
   article will attempt to give an interpretative approach to the factors
   that came together to achieve electoral victory of former priest
   Fernando Lugo in 2008, who overthrew the Colorado Party (Asociacion
   Nacional Republicana, ANR).
   Accordingly, it will be to characterize the conformation of the
   legislative and judicial powers, in order to observe continuities and
   discontinuities in these institutions during the transition and now.
   Finally, a brief comment will be referred to the country today, two
   years after he established himself as a former president bishop.},

Abstract = {In recent years a growing literature on biopolitical governmentality,
   prompted by the work of Michel Foucault, presents subjectivity as the
   decisive locus of both the rule of neoliberal capitalism and the
   production of the common. While sharing its central focus of
   subjectivity, we are concerned with what this literature leaves out (due
   to what we discern to be certain implicit tendencies of behaviorism):
   the constitutive role that subjective investments and ``enjoyment''
   (jouissance) play in the crisisridden formations of capitalism and in
   the constructive turns to communism. We proceed from the premise that
   there is no balanced relation to jouissance and that class antagonism is
   irreducible. From this perspective, we propose to approach capitalist
   and communist subjectivities in terms of two different ``forms of the
   commune'': that is, as two distinct subjective orientations toward
   enjoying the impossibility of instituting the common once and for all.},

Abstract = {Commissions of inquiry play an important role in the aftermath of
   crisis, by serving as instruments of accountability and policy learning.
   Yet crises also involve a high-stake game of political survival, in
   which accountability and learning pose a serious threat to incumbent
   politicians. The political decision of whether to appoint a commission
   of inquiry after a crisis thus provides a unique prism for studying the
   intense conflict between politics, accountability and policy learning.
   Using data from the United Kingdom, this study develops and tests a
   choice model for this political decision. The results show that the
   political decision to appoint inquiries into public crises is strongly
   influenced by short-term blame avoidance considerations, media salience
   and government popularity.},

Abstract = {While democratic countries have been concerned about a ``trust
   crisis{''} since the 1960s, China surprisingly displays a very high
   level of public trust in institutions. Why do people trust institutions
   and to what extent does institutional trust in China differ from that in
   democracies? Using the 2004 China Values and Ethics Survey, this article
   explores three different dimensions of institutional trust in China:
   trust in administrative institutions, trust in legal institutions, and
   trust in societal institutions. The analysis shows that institutional
   trust is more than a product of traditional values in China. Rather, it
   is more of an individual rational choice based heavily on the
   evaluations of the institutional performance, and it is also a result of
   government-controlled politicization. Trust in administrative
   institutions, in particular, mainly comes from satisfactory
   institutional performance. Institutional trust has a great impact on the
   development of democracy and legal participation in China.},

Abstract = {Turkey and Russia have signed an agreement committing Russian
   Atomstroyexport to build a nuclear power plant with a capacity of 4.8
   GWe on Turkey's black sea coast. Russia will operate and fully own the
   facility. Politicians and businessmen present the deal as a step into a
   bright Turkish energy future while keeping silent to the public about
   the dangers and downfalls nuclear power holds. Yet, Germany has a
   longstanding history of a diverse and strong anti-nuclear movement that
   offers many interesting lessons to every Turkish citizen interested in
   health, the environment and peace. This article elaborates on the German
   movement's arguments and forms of protest.},

Abstract = {Current attacks on pensions can be seen as part of the neoliberal
   project to undermine welfare provision; but this paper argues that such

   ideologies first touted in the 1940s being reused in the present period.
   This paper identifies those arguments that were misleading or false in
   the past, thus allowing us to see through them in their current forms.},

Abstract = {This article uses British Household Panel Survey data to estimate the
   effects of divorce and widowhood on political attitudes and political
   behavior. In contrast to previous research, which mostly relied on
   cross-sectional data, a matched propensity score analysis does not find
   any effects of transitions out of marriage on policy preferences, party
   identification, or vote choice. The results also show that divorce (but
   not widowhood) substantially reduces electoral participation. Some
   preliminary evidence suggests that this effect of divorce on turnout is
   partially attributable to the increased residential mobility that
   accompanies divorce. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {By measuring U.S. term limits dichotomously, investigators ignore the
   vast differences among laws limiting state legislative service.
   Furthermore, this measurement problem increases the risk of false
   negatives and confounds the effects of term limits with those of the
   citizen initiative. To address this, I propose two sets of continuous
   measures of term-limitedness. The first set compares mandated turnover
   after term limits to turnover in the 1980s, the decade before term
   limits began sweeping elected officials from office. A second set
   adjusts the first set to reflect the potential for legislators to cycle
   repeatedly between legislative chambers when only their consecutive
   years of service are limited. These continuous measures outperformed a
   dichotomous designation of term limits in two tests, suggesting that the
   proposed measures can reduce the risk of false negatives about term
   limits in U.S. multi-state research and that they are more robust in the
   face of confounding effects from the citizen initiative.},

Abstract = {This article examines government power over elementary and secondary
   education policy in Canada and the United States. The study
   distinguishes between federal government policy and national policy that
   results from subnational governments adopting similar policies
   voluntarily. The analysis identifies factors that encourage development
   of national education policy. Federal policy appears to have greater
   potential for success than national policy due to federal resources and
   enforcement authority. However, there are constitutional constraints on
   federal power over education in Canada, and political and technical
   constraints in both countries. Subnational governments in both countries
   actively safeguard federalism and protect their autonomy. The study
   indicates that subnational commitment is essential for the success of
   both national education policy and federal education policy.},

Abstract = {The prevention of armed conflicts is stated as the priority policy of
   various international organizations, among which the EU and the OSCE.
   Based on the semi-structured interviews with high bureaucrats and
   civilian experts, who are engaged in conflict prevention policies within
   the two international organizations, the article compares the
   development and implementation of EU and OSCE strategies to prevent
   armed conflicts. With the support of the second method, the analysis of
   primary and secondary sources regarding the prevention of armed
   conflicts (legal acts, e. g. declarations, resolutions, action-plans and
   other documents the EU and the OSCE have adopted), the author tries to
   answer the research questions through three domains: (1) what are the
   connecting points between the conflict prevention policies led by the EU
   and those led by the OSCE ; (2) what are the differences among them; and
   (3) what are the lessons learned/good practices and what could be done
   in order to make the EU and the OSCE (as well as other subjects of
   international relations) more effective in preventive action. The
   analysis has shown both international organizations rely mostly on
   ``structural{''} (long-term) prevention, meanwhile they lack the
   capacities to enforce hard(er) power. However, each of them has a set of
   comparative advantages that can be maximized only if the coordination
   and cooperation among them (and other subjects of international
   relations) improve. The major obstacle for more effective prevention is
   the lack of political will, and not the lack of capacities/resources.
   Therefore, the only way forward is to promote the concept of conflict
   prevention and all levels of international relations, aiming towards
   turning it into a norm in international relations (and not ``a noble
   idea{''} of lonely Don-Quixotes only, as it is today).},

Abstract = {Political relations between racial/ethnic groups in America have (a)
   been commonly examined in terms of the degree of ``cooperation{''} or
   ``conflict{''} and (b) have most frequently been studied in the arena of
   urban politics; this has been especially so in the case of
   Hispanics/Latinos and African Americans. This article represents the
   first effort to pose and to systematically assess the question of inter
   minority group relations in Congress by examining roll call behavior in
   the U.S. House of Representatives. Using Black and Latino interest group
   ratings and associated roll call votes from the 104th to 108th
   Congresses as indicators of Black and Latino interests, we show that
   Black representatives have voting records very supportive of the most
   salient concerns of Latinos and that Latino representatives have voting
   records at least modestly supportive of the most salient concerns of
   Blacks. At minimum, the findings suggest that Black and Latino
   representatives support the ``other{''} group at the same level (or
   higher) than party affiliation alone would suggest and also indicate an
   absence of conflict that is found in locallevel studies.},

Abstract = {In this article we take advantage of newly available data provided by
   WomanStats to suggest (1) a quantifiable approach to scaling the
   prevalence of interpersonal violence; and (2) a model of those factors
   that account for different levels of interpersonal violence
   cross-nationally. We specifically draw from the human rights literature
   to determine which economic, cultural, and political factors explain
   different levels of interpersonal violence globally today. We find that
   increasing levels of democracy has a dampening effect on interpersonal
   violence, while increasing levels of economic inequality increases
   interpersonal violence levels. However, other common explanatory
   factors, notably women's empowerment through workforce and political
   inclusion, and various cultural factors show little to no effect.},

Abstract = {It is widely argued that global imbalances are the cause of the
   financial crisis. Political imbalance (the United States as dominant
   world force) mirrors economic imbalance (the debt-financed consumption
   sprees of the past three decades). There is, however, a missing (third)
   term-/gender, which is constitutive of the economy both discursively and
   materially. Gender, in this sense, is a governing code that feminizes
   women as well as economically, racially, and culturally marginalized
   men. The feminization of labor made the consumption patterns of the
   elite possible and naturalized the type of hegemonic masculinity that
   characterized the international finance system.},

Abstract = {Ethnopolitical expression spans three primary forms: electoral politics,
   non-violent protest and violent rebellion. Previous literature has
   studied these strategies in isolation from one another. Using original
   data on the seventeen autonomous communities of Spain, this article
   combines a new method for operationalizing contentious strategies with
   Gurr's ethnopolitical conflict model to explain communities' movements
   between categories of the full range of nationalist political behaviour.
   The findings confirm that organizations acting within a community
   respond to altered incentives and changing political contexts by moving
   up and down the `ladder of contention', they suggest an under-explored
   `strategic dynamism' in ethnonational communities. Capturing this
   dynamic movement allows for a better understanding of which features of
   a group's environment have an `escalatory' impact on conflict and which,
   conversely, have an `ameliorative' effect.},

Abstract = {The main arguments for and against workplace democracy (WD) are
   analyzed, with a particular stress on cooperatives. Firstly, two
   historical approaches to WD are presented (section 1) and the agent,
   content and forms of decision-making in a democratic firm are briefly
   defined (section 2). The remainding sections tackle the main arguments
   for and against WD regarding its feasibility (section 3) and efficiency
   (section 4), along with three well known arguments against it-the
   epistemic argument (section 5), the propertarian argument (section 6)
   and the libertarian argument (section 7). The paper closes by discussing
   some pragmatic alternatives to WD (section 8).},

Abstract = {I discuss J.G. Fichte's theory of property and its implications in
   relation to the claim made by C.B. Macpherson that, by broadening the
   meaning of the term `property', it becomes possible to reconcile two
   principles of liberal democratic theory that seem to be at odds with
   each other: the right to property, understood as the right to exclude
   others from the use or benefit of something, and the right to use and
   develop one's capacities. I argue that Fichte's broad conception of
   property can be viewed as an example of how this might be done. I also
   show, however, that Fichte demonstrates that a political reconciliation
   of these rights is demanded by the conceptual reconciliation of them,
   and that such political reconciliation may demand placing considerable
   limitations, in the form of state regulation and the redistribution of
   resources, on human freedom.},

Abstract = {Democracy and the state are two political notions that have come under
   considerable duress in late modernity. This paper considers a prominent
   critic of both, Sheldon Wolin. The paper examines three elements that
   figure in Wolin's analyses of democracy and the modern state in a
   central way: community, memory, and the culture of history. A
   theorisation of these elements can illuminate what is at stake in the
   articulation of political conceptions that yield communal forms through
   the constitution of political space. Wolin's analyses of democracy, the
   state, and modern power can be of help, first, in elucidating the
   political valences of the three elements themselves; second, in
   specifying relationships of mutuality among them; and third, in
   theorising what is at issue in the transposition of these elements from
   the domestic sphere to the international. The paper speaks mainly to the
   first and second concerns. A path is explored for thinking what is at
   stake in the third, namely, locating in and then transposing from the
   domestic sphere a `we' which does not enjoy a precise ontology, but
   which is nonetheless capable of giving collaborative efforts in
   world-political spheres another political ground.},

Abstract = {A key element of Labour's response to the Pensions Commission's
   recommendations for `a new pension settlement for the twenty-first
   century' is a system of `personal accounts' that will be administered
   and invested by the private sector. The contrast with 50 years ago, when
   Britain faced similar pressures, is striking. Then, Labour presented to
   the British public proposals for a state-run scheme embodying
   redistribution between higher and lower-paid workers and the
   accumulation of a very large fund that would be directly invested in
   stock markets by the state to promote faster growth. Today's scheme
   embodies neither redistribution nor collective control of the scheme's
   assets, and investment and risk-taking will be the responsibility of
   individuals rather than the state. This article explores the differences
   between Labour's proposals in 1957 and the scheme it proposes today. It
   considers what these differences tell us about the party's changing
   conception of social democracy, and highlights the irony that, with
   consumers' faith in financial markets shattered by the most severe
   financial crisis since 1929, New Labour's embrace of a private sector
   solution on the grounds that `what matters is what works' now seems
   badly mistaken. British Politics (2010) 5, 41-64. doi:10.1057/bp.2009.27},

Abstract = {In this paper, we argue that the greater accountability of democratic
   leaders to their citizens creates powerful pressures on leaders to
   reduce the human costs of war. In an analysis of a new dataset of
   fatalities in interstate wars (1900 to 2005) we find that highly
   democratic states suffer significantly fewer military and civilian
   fatalities. We argue that democracies limit their war losses primarily
   by adopting four specific foreign and military policies. First,
   democracies generate higher military capabilities than nondemocracies in
   times of war. Second, democracies are more likely to augment their
   national capabilities by joining more powerful coalitions of states
   during war. Third, democracies are more likely than other states to
   utilize battlefield military strategies that minimize their fatalities.
   Finally, democracies are more likely to fight wars on battlefields that
   are not contiguous to their home territories, thereby shielding their
   civilian populations from the fighting.},

Title = {EU Issue Voting: Asset or Liability? How European Integration Affects
   Parties' Electoral Fortunes},
Journal = {EUROPEAN UNION POLITICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Pages = {89-117},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This study develops and tests arguments about how political parties'
   electoral fortunes in national elections are influenced by voters'
   preferences regarding the European Union (EU). To date, there is
   increasing evidence demonstrating the impact of EU issues on vote choice
   in national elections - a process commonly referred to as EU issue
   voting. Yet little is known about which parties actually gain or lose as
   a result of EU issue voting. Using a two-step hierarchical estimation
   procedure, I first estimate an individual-level model of vote choice
   estimating the impact of EU preferences for individual parties. The
   first stage of the analysis reveals that the extent of EU issue voting
   varies substantially among political parties. In the second stage, I
   utilize party characteristics to account for this variation across
   parties by using an estimated dependent variable model. The analysis
   demonstrates that the inter-party variation in EU issue voting is
   largely a function of two factors: parties' intrinsic positioning
   regarding the EU and strategic considerations. The empirical analysis
   employs data from UK, Danish, Dutch and German elections between 1992
   and 2002.},

Abstract = {This article discusses on the remedies available to the injured
   employees under the Employees' Social Security Act 1969 (ESSA 1969)
   (Note 1). Remedies are the means given by the law for the recovery of a
   right, or of compensation for the infringement thereof (Note 2). Since
   employees covered by ESSA 1969 are not eligible for workmen's
   compensation, they are only eligible for benefits administered by the
   Social Security Organisation (SOCSO) (Note 3). The relevant issues in
   this article pertain to the curtailment of the employees' rights to a
   claim under SOCSO as once an employee is injured, the employee must know
   what to do, what are the benefits and remedies available, the laws
   applicable, how to withdraw the contributions and so on. The article
   introduces a discussion on ESSA 1969, that is, the purpose of the Act,
   the requirements for eligibility of the benefits and the contributions.
   As the object of ESSA 1969 is to provide, through SOCSO, social security
   to employees and their dependants in the event of injury or death
   arising in the course of employment under the employment injury
   insurance scheme and the invalidity pension scheme, the study then
   examines the two SOCSO's schemes. This article also discusses the
   various benefits available under the insurance schemes focusing on
   benefits that are directly related to employees.},

Abstract = {While there is no shortage of research on national parliaments and
   European integration, empirical studies on the impact of EU on domestic
   legislatures are lacking. This article contributes to the literature by
   discussing the challenges involved in measuring the Europeanisation of
   national parliaments and through suggesting several hypotheses and
   indicators - EU-related national laws, the use of control instruments
   (confidence votes and parliamentary questions) in EU matters, and the
   share of committee, plenary and party group meeting time spent on
   European matters - that can be used in subsequent comparative research.
   Evidence from Finland shows the differentiated impact of Europe: while
   the share of domestic laws related to EU is smaller than often argued,
   particularly committees are burdened to a much larger extent by European
   matters.},

Abstract = {While studies typically find that women know less about politics than do
   men, feminist scholars have argued that these findings reflect
   gender-biased measures that underestimate women's political knowledge.
   This article evaluates the feminist critique by taking a more expansive
   view of what constitutes political knowledge. Using data from a large
   Canadian urban sample, we show that gender gaps close or even reverse
   when people are queried about more practical aspects of political
   knowledge, such as government benefits and services. Our results also
   demonstrate that this type of knowledge is more equally distributed than
   its conventional counterpart, though the women who are the most likely
   to need government services and benefits are often the least likely to
   know about them. Finally, we show that knowledge of government services
   and benefits has a significant effect on women's intended vote choice.
   This article thus shows that more practical types of political knowledge
   might serve as meaningful additions to existing definitions and measures
   of political knowledge.},

Title = {Constitutional Game - An Analytical Framework of Constitutional Law and
   Constitutional Politics},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS AND LAW},

Abstract = {Most lawyers have a doctrinal understanding of constitution. They are
   skeptical of any political understanding of a constitution, feeling that
   this may taint the sacredness of the legal paradigm. Political
   scientists view things differently. They offer three approaches to
   understanding a constitution from the political paradigm perspective:
   the attitudinal approach, the institutional approach and the strategic
   approach. The author argues that the incorporation of the political
   paradigm into one's analytical framework is unavoidable if one wants to
   have a comprehensive understanding of the constitution.
   After arguing that different paradigms can be integrated if alternative
   epistemological presuppositions are being adopted, the legal and
   political paradigms and approaches are integrated into an analytical
   framework of constitutional game illustrating how law and politics may
   interact in the constitutional development of a country-state. Under
   this analytical framework of constitutional game, the constitutional
   processes in which decisions on the making, interpretation,
   implementation, adjudication and amendment or change of the constitution
   are made can be understood from features borrowed from the concept of
   game including players, rules of the game, winning goals, game
   resources, game actions, game field, interaction, strategy, and the end
   of the game.},

Abstract = {To what extent do vice presidential candidates affect individual-level
   vote choice for president? The accepted wisdom is that vice presidential
   candidates are of minor importance to most voters. Yet much energy was
   spent discussing the potential impact of Biden and Palin as vice
   presidential candidates. Here, the impact that attitudes toward Palin
   and Biden had on vote choice in the 2008 election are compared with the
   role of vice presidential candidates historically. Although feelings
   about vice presidential candidates typically play little role in vote
   choice, there are exceptions. When vice presidential candidates draw
   media attention, feelings about them become much more important to vote
   choice. Whereas Biden represents the general rule of vice presidents
   garnering little media attention and having relatively little impact on
   vote choice, Palin's candidacy drew an abnormally high level of media
   interest, and feelings about her exerted a stronger impact on vote
   choice, especially among Independent voters.},

Abstract = {Ukraine is in a demographic crisis. The number of inhabitants is
   sinking, life expectancy has been in decline for five decades, the
   number of births does not even guarantee the reproduction of the
   population. The over-aging of society is the consequence. On top of
   that, there is the emigration of labour. Because the decline in
   population cannot be slowed, all efforts should be directed towards
   improving the quality of life of the people.},

Title = {Consolidating democracy in Ghana: progress and prospects?},
Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Pages = {26-67},
Abstract = {In the light of the successful and peaceful outcome of the December 2008
   elections in Ghana, inclusive of the second transfer of power between
   political parties since the return to democratic rule in 1992, this
   paper considers whether Ghana can now be regarded as a consolidated
   democracy. To undertake this assessment, Linz and Stepan's
   multidimensional framework of democratic consolidation is adopted, and
   their three dimensions and five arenas of democratic consolidation are
   explored. Findings demonstrate that although significant progress has
   been made towards democratic consolidation in Ghana, there are aspects
   of consolidation that remain weak. Thus it would be premature to state
   that democratic consolidation has been achieved in Ghana. With regard to
   the prospects for sustained consolidation, the closeness that Ghana came
   to political violence during the fraught election period is highlighted,
   indicating a latent threat to future democratic stability. Additionally,
   a number of constraints and challenges are identified in various arenas
   of consolidation, inclusive of the limited policy influence of civil
   society organizations, the marginalization of women, excessive
   executive/presidential powers, the adverse impact of external actors on
   democratic sovereignty, and the implications for democratic
   sustainability of a continued failure to address gross socio-economic
   inequalities. Without addressing such issues, Ghana's democratic gains
   may turnout to be a rather hollow triumph.},

   paper of the same title that the author presented in 2009 to obtain the
   Advanced Studies Diploma in Peace Conflicts and Democracy from the
   Institute of Peace and Conflicts of the University of Granada.
   The Zapatista Army of National Liberation (Ejercito Zapatista de
   Liberacion Nacional, EZLN) announced its intentions the Mexican society
   and the international community on 1 January 1994, when it declared war
   on the Mexican Government and army, with the taking of four important
   towns and cities in the southern state of Chiapas and the ensuing spread
   of the armed conflict to other municipalities in the area. The bloodiest
   fighting took place in the city of Ocosingo. The insurgent group
   subsequently went underground for more than a decade.
   The present essay reflects on the Zapatista movement and its peace
   construction process, paying special attention to paradoxes faced its
   historical conduct, since to the extent that these are overcome, both
   the EZNL and Mexican society as a whole will have moved forward along
   the path towards longed for peace.},

   agrarian production system, and they finished originating a new way of
   tourism known as ``sustainable{''} in Spain. Firstly it was understood
   as a tool to develop rural areas, but this model of turism has some
   peculiarities that make it not just a way to guarantee the development
   of run-down areas, but an aim in and of itself that consumes a big
   amount of resources and that can cause negative effects where it

Title = {The Rise and Fall of Minor Parties in Ireland},
Journal = {IRISH POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {25},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {503-538},
Abstract = {Minor parties (defined as those outside the three-party core of the
   party system) have been a distinctive feature of Irish political life
   since independence in 1922. Of the approximately 50 such parties to
   appear since then, though, only a few have become politically relevant,
   and even these parties have tended to go through a short life cycle.
   This paper describes the profile of parties of this kind, seeking to
   place Irish minor parties in categories that have emerged in the
   comparative literature, and classifying them in respect of origin,
   electoral performance, strategic self-placement, and ideological
   orientation. The paper concludes with an effort to explain the rise and
   fall of minor parties in Ireland in the light of generalisations in the
   comparative literature, where institutional factors (including, but not
   confined to, the electoral system) and social psychological
   considerations (including in particular the issues of declining party
   identification and disillusionment with existing parties) have played a
   particular role.},

Abstract = {Working within a selection model of economic voting we propose
   explanations for the cross-national and dynamic variations in the
   magnitude of the vote that have puzzled students of comparative voting
   behavior. Our theory suggests that unexpected shocks to the economy
   inform the economic vote which implies that voters are able to resolve a
   signal extraction problem: determine the extent to which these shocks
   are the result of incumbent competency as opposed to exogenous shocks to
   the economy. We assume that voters have information on the overall
   variance in shocks to the macroeconomy and that they use this signal to
   weight the importance of economic shocks in their vote decision. Voters
   are also hypothesized to recognize that higher exposure to global trade
   influences reduces the magnitude of the incumbent competency signal. We
   provide empirical evidence demonstrating that voters are able to discern
   significant variation in macroeconomic outcomes in order to perform this
   signal extraction task: We analyze a six-nation survey conducted by the
   authors that was designed to assess whether voters are attentive to
   variance in economic outcomes and whether these in fact conditioned
   their economic vote. Secondly we examine economic time series from 19
   countries over the 1979-2005 period, demonstrating that variances in the
   macroeconomic series explain contextual variations in the economic vote
   as our theory hypothesizes. Finally, the essay demonstrates that open
   economies, which are more subject to exogenous economic shocks, have a
   smaller economic vote than countries with economies less dependent on
   global trade.},

Abstract = {This article demonstrates that candidate positions on the ballot measure
   to ban gay marriage had an effect on gubernatorial voting. With exit
   poll data from three states in 2006, we find that the effect of support
   for the ban is at least twice as large when the candidates adopted
   divergent positions. Support for the ban has a smaller but significant
   effect on vote choice when the candidate positions converge, which
   suggests an indiscriminate priming effect. These findings are supported
   with aggregate data from 45 gubernatorial races in 2004 and 2006. The
   analysis reveals that Republican candidates benefited if candidate
   positions diverged, with the Democratic candidates expressing opposition
   to the gay marriage ban.},

Title = {Ties that bind? The rise and decline of ethno-regional partisanship in
   Malawi, 1994-2009},
Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},

Abstract = {In the first three elections following Malawi's return to democracy in
   1993, voting patterns displayed a clear ethno-regional pattern. Then in
   2009 the regional pattern broke down in dramatic fashion, with the
   incumbent President, Bingu wa Mutharika, attracting majority support
   across all three regions. This article first examines whether ethnic
   identities were at the root of Malawi's ethno-regional electoral
   pattern. Our tests show that while ethnic identities were associated
   with partisan attachments in some areas, regional patterns were more
   consistently related to other factors, particularly views of the
   government's performance and the inclusiveness of the ruling party. We
   then examine the breakdown of the regional pattern, drawing on trend
   analysis of public opinion data from 1999 to 2008. We show that by 2009
   the majority of Malawians in all three regions had come to hold positive
   views of Mutharika's performance and had come to see his government as
   inclusive. We conclude, therefore, that shifts in patterns of
   partisanship had more to do with political factors-Mutharika's symbolic
   and substantive policies during this first term-than ethnic identities.
   Malawi reminds us that incumbents, when faced with incentives to
   construct multi-ethnic support bases, can use the power of the state to
   reach out across ethnic political boundaries and re-order supposedly
   entrenched patterns of partisanship.},

Title = {Rabies in France: Old Preoccupation, New Crisis},
Journal = {POLITIX},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {23},
Number = {90},
Pages = {169+},
Abstract = {In August 2004, for the first time, France experienced a public health
   crisis triggered by the entry of a rabid dog within its border. In the
   past, similar events had remained confined within the professional
   community. To shed light on the onset of this first public rabies
   crisis, this paper shows how the transformation of a
   ``business-as-usual{''} professional problem into a bona fide public
   health crisis may be interpreted as a sudden renegociation of the
   historical compromise which previously existed around the management of
   rabies. Public health changes and reorganizations which had occurred
   prior to this episode allowed human health authorities to reposition
   themselves at the centre of the rabies management programs, when they
   used to remain at their periphery. By reformating crisis perception and
   allowing the emergence of new specific rabies-related expertise, a
   series of health-related crises, from the 2003 heat wave to various
   rabies alerts, triggered the transformation of a rabies alert into a
   public health crisis. Furthermore, confronting various action frameworks
   played a part in modifying the perception and analysis of the August
   2004 alert, thus contributing to the radicalization of implemented
   management decisions. Thus, to understand the August 2004 rabies crisis,
   it is necessary to consider it both within the history of rabies as a
   public concern, as well as within the larger moving landscape of health
   crisis management as a whole.},

Abstract = {This article argues that corruption and the efforts to curb it can be
   explained in terms of some elements of complexity thinking. The authors
   find that corruption is comparable to a social virus that continuously
   mutates and adapts to new environments to counter anti-corruption
   strategies. On the basis of its omnipresence, myriad manifestations,
   causes and impacts, corruption is found to be a complex, dynamic and
   ever-changing social phenomenon. It is impossible to totally eradicate
   it, and one can only strive to consistently reduce its intensity and
   scope over time. A holistic anti-corruption policy approach that
   continuously empowers all sectors of society (starting at the level of
   the family) and all levels of administration has to be encouraged},

Abstract = {This article focuses on German pension and health care reform politics
   under the Grand Coalition. All rich democracies face functional
   pressures to reform these sectors but are confronted with political and
   sometimes also institutional obstacles. This holds in particular for the
   German party system, where traditionally two large centre parties
   compete for votes and power is shared with the Bundesrat, and often -
   informally - with the social partners. We hypothesise that a formal
   grand coalition provides a promising configuration for radical reforms
   as it neutralises these obstacles. This is done by analysing in some
   depth the major reforms of the Grand Coalition, the rise in the legal
   retirement age to 67 and the 2007 health care reform, and by comparing
   them with the main reforms of the preceding government, in particular
   the Red-Green coalition. We find that, although a Grand Coalition is not
   necessary for paradigmatic reform, it makes significant reform more
   likely, be it paradigmatic in the levels-of-policy-change literature or
   electorally costly as conceived in the welfare state literature.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Pages = {51-68},
Abstract = {Humanitarianism and anti-Semitism are explored here, as representing two
   special kinds of `Kampfbegriffe' that I propose to call magnetic
   concepts, since they are not only difficult to retort in the political
   field but also exert strong forces on society as a whole. The first
   concept constitutes an example of `positive magnetic concepts', as it is
   irresistibly attractive whereas the second one may be considered a
   negative magnetic concept, as it is unmistakably repulsive. These
   concepts are opposites and therefore tend to function differently. Their
   main differences stem from their moral posture, the positive ones being
   positioned within the field of what could/should be done whereas the
   negative ones are positioned outside it. However, both of them draw
   their force from the values they carry. Though these values may seem
   universal and timeless, they vary according to time, history and
   ideology. Therefore, if humanitarianism and anti-Semitism nowadays act
   as magnetic concepts, it is merely because they coincide with current
   Western values.},

Journal = {AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {45},
Number = {3},
Pages = {457-474},
Abstract = {Historically, Indigenous Australians have been marginalised, both
   economically and politically, in mineral development processes in
   Australia. The Australian state structures the interaction between
   Indigenous people and mining companies through general legislation and
   policies, and is therefore a key determinant of the mineral negotiating
   environment. This paper examines the state's role in the negotiations
   for the Century Mine in the Gulf of Carpentaria, and argues that recent
   neo-Marxist theories offer the most cogent theoretical explanation of
   the state's behaviour. It contends that, despite a noted tendency to
   consign Marxist theorising to the history books, analysis of the
   behaviour of the state in the Century negotiations provides critical
   evidence of the continued relevance of neo-Marxist theories of the
   state.},

Pages = {99-118},
Abstract = {This paper looks at the impact of the `War on Terror' on political
   violence in Turkey. It begins by tracing the role of the North Atlantic
   Treaty Organization (NATO) in the management and support of Turkey's
   militarised government since Ankara joined the Alliance in 1952. Here,
   it is suggested that a triangular concert of agents from the Turkish
   state's intelligence and special-forces organisations, operatives from
   Washington, and right-wing activists and paramilitaries have been an
   important feature of regime formation and maintenance. By the mid-1990s,
   these covert structures came under increasing social pressure, leading
   to a period of considerable reform. However, the War on Terror and the
   West's subsequent turn towards a greater emphasis on security has, it is
   argued, begun to undo, enervate or obstruct the implementation of many
   of these reforms. The result, it is concluded, is that elements of the
   Turkish state unhappy with recent policies have been emboldened and,
   since the collapse of the Partiya Karkareni Kurdistan's (PKK) unilateral
   ceasefire in 2004, have started to exert a growing influence.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to extend the leadership-discussion by setting the focus
   on the European Commission as a supra-national actor and taking into
   consideration the complexity of the European system. The EU is a
   multilevel governance system with a variety of actors on different
   political and social levels who all participate in the political
   processes. By considering political leadership as a participatory
   process it is possible to better understand the mechanisms, contexts and
   processes which help identify the way in which the European Commission
   exercises leadership.
   In a first step it is both described and analysed in how far the
   European Commission contributes in a distinctive manner to a discourse
   about lifelong learning. Further-more the paper examines the mechanisms,
   contexts and processes whereby the European Commission is able to assume
   competence over an issue through strategic and conceptual influence as
   well as knowledge-management. It does so in a participatory process
   about the topic in question.},

Abstract = {The republican tradition seems to have a blind spot about global
   justice. It has had little to say about pressing international issues
   such as world poverty or global inequalities. According to the old, if
   apocryphal, adage: extra rempublicam nulla justitia. Some may doubt that
   distributive justice (as opposed to freedom or citizenship) is the
   primary virtue of republican institutions; and at any rate most would
   agree that republican values have traditionally been realized in the
   polis not in the (oxymoronic) cosmopolis. The article sketches a
   republican account of global non-domination which suggests that duties
   of distributive justice are not bounded to the institutions of a single
   society. In particular, it argues that republicans have good reasons to
   seek to curb those global inequalities which underpin what I call
   capability-denying domination.},

Abstract = {This article examines the formation of the Grand Coalition in the
   context of the German party system and draws upon a synthetic analytical
   framework derived from formal coalition theory. It argues that both the
   SPD and CDU/CSU would have anticipated that the Grand Coalition would
   have generated relatively high levels of inter-party conflict as well as
   significant electoral costs. The article demonstrates that the CDU/CSU's
   motives for entering a Grand Coalition were quite evident but those of
   the SPD were more questionable. The SPD's course of action is only
   explained by a number of specific policy objectives, a desire to
   minimise co-ordination costs, and through the concept of pure time
   preference, in which SPD elites demonstrated a preference for an
   established coalition model over new and untested coalition options. The
   article concludes that, whilst it is not possible to demonstrate that
   the Grand Coalition increased the rate of party system fragmentation, it
   failed to stabilise the declining vote share for the two Volksparteien.},

Title = {The politics of financial value. Banking stress tests between
   indeterminacy and struggles},
Journal = {POLITIX},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {23},
Number = {89},
Pages = {173+},
Abstract = {Whereas the neoclassical theory of finance has always claimed that
   financial assets had a ``fundamental value{''}, keynesian arguments
   about radical uncertainty as well as arguments drawn from a spinozist
   approach in political economy rather lead to the opposite conclusion of
   a fundamental indeterminacy in financial value. This indeterminacy is
   lifted through social processes, such as the building up of collective
   beliefs. These processes however may take a more overtly political tone,
   whenever arise situations where the value has to be ``decided{''}.
   Agents or groups may then strive in a conflicting way to set the value
   in their best interests. It is typically the case during financial
   crises where indeterminacy, suddenly returning, gives way to multiple
   valuation conflicts. US banking stress tests straightforwardly show
   these struggles such as they are part of what could be called a
   ``politics of value{''}.},

   accommodation to the established game, which can be a consequence of

Journal = {AFRICAN JOURNAL ON CONFLICT RESOLUTION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {10},
Number = {3},
Pages = {101-122},
Abstract = {This article interrogates the role of indigenous legal tradition (ILT)
   in contemporary African transitional justice initiatives. It departs
   from the assumption that most African cultures put emphasis on
   communality and the interdependence of the members of a community.
   Indigenous legal traditions, which include mechanisms for
   acknowledgement, truth telling, accountability, healing and reparations,
   continue to assume a prominent role in the lives of African societies
   and individuals. However, little attention has been given to the role of
   African indigenous legal tradition in terms of its contribution to
   post-conflict transformation. Several African societies have deeply
   rooted social and communal values of conflict resolution which can serve
   as a reservoir of wisdom in future transitional justice initiatives. In
   furtherance of the main theme, the article discusses an example of ILT
   from Eritrea, and calls for a continued engagement and critical
   assessment of these values in promoting peace and justice in Africa.},

Abstract = {Modern macroeconomic models have been widely criticised as relying too
   much on rationality and market efficiency. However, their predictions
   about this crisis are being borne out by events. `Crashes' are an
   integral part of an `efficient market' capitalism and are brought on by
   swings in the news about productivity growth; this time nearly two
   decades of strong computer-based productivity growth were brought to a
   crashing halt by raw material shortages. This presages a slow recovery
   until innovation in material use frees growth up again as it did in the
   1990s after the shortages of the 1970s.},

Title = {Terrorist profiling: human rights concerns},
Journal = {CRITICAL STUDIES ON TERRORISM},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {3},
Number = {2},
Pages = {295-312},
Abstract = {Post-9/11, law-enforcement agencies have expanded the processing of
   personal data for terrorist profiles; this is actually among the very
   reasons why personal data are processed in the first place. De facto
   terrorist profiles tend to be based predominantly on the use of such
   criteria as `race', colour, religion, or ethnic and national origin to
   single out persons for enhanced scrutiny. Terrorist-profiling practices,
   therefore, raise the question as to their conformity with the right to
   privacy, the protection of personal data, and the principle of
   non-discrimination. This article critically examines to what extent, if
   any, terrorist-profiling practices may be regarded as compatible with
   the principle of non-discrimination and the fundamental rules pertaining
   to the protection of personal data. For this purpose, it looks at
   various approaches to defining profiling in the context of countering
   terrorism, as well as describing de facto manifestations of
   terrorist-profiling practices. The conclusion is that
   terrorist-profiling practices all too often fail to comply with the
   fundamental requirement that any restrictions on the right to privacy
   and the protection of personal data are adequately regulated, necessary
   and proportionate. The so-called ethnic profiling gives rise to
   particularly serious problems. It tends to assume the nature of `racial'
   profiling and, accordingly, entail discriminatory effects that can
   result in feelings of humiliation and stigmatisation among the targeted
   groups. Since the risk of further marginalisation and even
   radicalisation within those groups also appears to be a very real
   consideration, the whole necessity of ethnic profiling in the name of
   countering terrorism must be called into question in a contemporary
   democratic society built on the principles of pluralism and respect for
   different cultures.},

Abstract = {Collective mobilisation in the streets and the countryside was a
   recurrent feature in 19th Century Portuguese politics. An anonymous part
   of the population, both men and women, and regardless of their social
   status or the rights the law recognised them as citizens, acted
   politically. Constitutionally speaking, and despite its real power, the
   mobilized multitude was an ``alien political body{''} that competed with
   representative assemblies. In this work I analyse the changes in the
   repertoire of political collective contention in Portugal: some of its
   features were an inheritance of older traditions, while some others
   reflected the reception of the French Revolution and the affirmation of
   popular sovereignty. Tradition and innovation melted during the
   political conflicts of Liberal Portugal and a new repertoire of popular
   contention, the one characteristic of the Social Movement, took shape
   and became institutionalised.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is not to describe the political class and to
   explain its characteristics, but to reflect how the political class
   ought to be After some thoughts on the epitemological status of such a
   question and an introductory look at the varieties of the political
   class in past and present, the seemingly most important sources are
   presented from which standards for value judgments on politicians'
   personality and actions might be derived The argument starts with
   theories on representation and principal-actor-relations, then classical
   catalogues of `political virtues' and Machiavelli's advices are taken
   into consideration After a brief reflection on the normitive
   implications of functional requirements, thoughts of politicians
   themselves about the normative aspects of their role are discussed Some

Abstract = {Participatory democracy is not yet a reality in Brazil. Citizen
   participation in political decisions has been reduced to a mere choice
   of political representatives. However, the legitimacy of these decisions
   comes from processes of discussion where citizens should be required to
   participate effectively. It is shown that the best way to improve
   popular participation in Brazil is through local governments, where
   problems and solutions are closer to citizens. Hence one has examined
   mechanisms of direct democracy and their respective contribution to
   enhance citizen participation in decisions of the municipality.},

Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},

Volume = {17},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1024-1049},
Abstract = {This article investigates the impact of international efforts to
   cultivate effective and authoritative local governing institutions in
   the Western Balkans, a prime testing ground for democratization aid to
   post-war states. It explores three hypotheses, each of which argues that
   a particular approach of international actors toward domestic officials
   best improves the quality of local governance. The study's gathering of
   interview and survey data from field-based actors enables it to evaluate
   local government reforms' impact on domestic communities. This
   investigation arrives at three findings. First, in the view of Western
   Balkan peoples, local governance reforms do not produce benefits when
   they are either imposed or ignored by international authorities.
   Secondly, reforms produce benefits for local communities when they are
   designed to meet domestic concerns. More specifically, reforms valued by
   local communities are designed in ways that respond to domestic, rather
   than international, concepts of good local governance that emphasize
   socioeconomic aspects and produce tangible benefits. Well designed
   reforms also include significant aid targeting local governance that is
   coupled with the promise of a larger political settlement that is
   attractive to powerful domestic elites and contingent on clearly
   articulated local governance reforms. Thirdly, such aid best
   characterises European Union efforts only in Macedonia.},

Abstract = {In the article, the authors are discussing the problem of the perception
   of Russia's image inside the country and in the world. The problem of
   the formation of Russia's image takes today an important place in the
   system of the country's priorities. The character of the development of
   international cooperation in the economic. in the political. and in the
   social sphere depends on how Russia is seen in the world - as a partner
   or as an opponent. On the other hand, the country's positive image
   inside Russia is the pledge of stable and steady internal development,
   of averting civil conflicts, of citizens adopting more objective view of
   the internal policy. In the article, preliminary results are presented,
   of researches in the following directions: the Image of Russia in the
   Perception of Russian Elites: Russia's Image in Mass Perception:

Abstract = {Comparative politics textbooks play an important role in scientific
   socialization within political science. Thus, textbook reviews should
   take their role in this process into account. Analytical review criteria
   have to be based on understanding the different potential roles
   textbooks may play within tertiary education and of the goals they may
   fulfill. The argument about different strategy patterns of comparative
   politics textbooks is illustrated here on the example of relatively
   recent textbooks by Daniele Caramani and Alan Siaroff. Such an analysis
   may serve not only to identify reasonable criteria to assess comparative
   politics textbooks, but it also utilizes the findings of Thomas Kuhn
   about the ``discipline-forming{''} role of textbooks. Textbooks also
   play an important role as a space for meta-reflective analysis of
   comparative politics as a field of. To study textbooks therefore also
   means to study authoritative texts about comparative politics.},

Abstract = {The approach to abortion recently adopted by Spanish law has important
   gender implications. It articulates the transit to a system that prefers
   prevention over repression, information over criminalisation and the
   harmonisation over the confrontation of the interests of pregnant women
   and unborn life. While the Report issued by the Spanish Consejo de
   Estado on the new legislation assumes the logic of prevention, it
   remains committed to the logic of confrontation that lies behind
   repressive approaches to abortion. The new preventive strategy requires,
   however, that the confrontational logic be abandoned and that the
   interests of pregnant women and unborn life be harmonised. This requires
   that the state alleviates the burdens pregnancy and parenthood place on
   women and distributes them among men, women and society at large.},

Abstract = {Comparing eight post-communist semi-presidential systems (Bulgaria,
   Croatia, Lithuania, Moldova, Poland, Romania, Ukraine and Russia),
   comprising a total of 65 instances of intra-executive coexistence
   between 1991 and 2007, this article asks to what extent and in what ways
   president-cabinet conflicts increase the risk of cabinet instability.
   Previous studies of intra-executive conflicts in semi-presidential
   regimes have mainly been occupied with explaining why conflicts occur in
   the first place, and have neglected the question of how such conflicts
   are actually related to political outcomes. The present empirical
   investigation demonstrates that the occurrence of intra-executive
   conflict in transitional semi-presidential systems is likely to produce
   high rates of cabinet turnover.},

Journal = {AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Pages = {437-455},
Abstract = {According to recent international research, political mobilisation at
   the local level no longer reflects socioeconomic divisions in society,
   but is instead based on a post-material oriented `politics of choice'.
   This proposition is applied to group politics within six Sydney
   communities. We broaden the examination of political activity undertaken
   by local groups to include lobbying, advocacy and community organising.
   This leads us to find that the primary variance among communities is in
   the type of activities undertaken rather than the level of group
   activity. In more privileged areas of Sydney, local groups are more
   likely to be constituted as traditional interest groups, including those
   that focus on post-materialist concerns. However, group activity remains
   substantial in less affluent areas, but manifests in different forms,
   including hybrid groups that combine service provision and advocacy.},

Abstract = {Being attentive to initial reconstruction of identities in post-conflict
   environments is critical because robust group images are absent and
   there remains time and space for shifts in policy. Applying theories of
   social psychology, overlooked in literature on ethnic violence,
   peace-building, and reconciliation, this article examines
   characteristics and consequences of the emerging socio-psychological
   trend of `defensive nationalism' in post-conflict Serb narratives. The
   article argues that the proceedings of the International Criminal
   Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) have contributed to an
   identity crisis among the Serbs, and identifies the issues of
   `individual versus collective' guilt and `legal versus political' trials
   as major factors. The destabilization of the Serb self-image on the
   global scene has instigated new, and furthered old, forms of
   defensiveness, leading to the dismissal of the tribunal's proceedings in
   favor of contradictory and conspiracy accounts. The point of conducting
   fair and effective prosecutions is undermined if reconciliation
   opportunities are simultaneously diminished.},

Abstract = {The notion of political class{''} has emerged in recent years as a
   central analytical tool for the study of professional politicians in
   modern democracies In this contribution, Gaetano Moscas original theory
   of the political class is reconstructed and related to the current usage
   of the concept As a result we find that Moscas deliberations provide
   useful insights into the class character of today's political personnel
   in spat., of their old age and their quite apparent inconsistencies It
   is especially Mosca's emphasis on the material and habitual basis of
   this class that is still to become common place in political and social
   analysis},

Abstract = {The qualitative change in the political system in Slovakia after 1989
   could but reflect both on the position of churches and clerical
   societies and on the internal focus and intuitional accomplishment of
   ecclesiastic policy of the state under the conditions of democratic
   organization of social relations. It turned out that the fundamental
   question of the post-November ecclesiastic policy of the state would be
   the problem of shaping the new approach to churches and ecclesiastic
   societies, the problem of their financial and material support, respect
   of their autonomous positions and operation, etc. Or, put differently,
   the democratic transformation of the Slovak society brought the need for
   a new definition of how the state and church should coexist in a plural
   democratic system. Therefore, quite logically, the fundamental topic of
   a multitude of discussions and statements of competent ecclesiastic and
   political actors became the problem to work out the principles and
   methods for the accomplishment of various models of coexistence; the
   most popular being the separation of churches from the state. This
   liberal model, answering the needs of modern democratic state for
   mutually settled relations between them, due to various, mostly
   subjectively determined factors, did not find support from either
   clerical or political subjects. This, therefore, predetermined, to quite
   a large extent, the character of development and orientation of the
   state, weakened its laic essence and at the same time, fortified the
   clericalization of the political and public life in our country.},

Journal = {POLITIKON},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {37},
Number = {2-3},
Pages = {251-268},
Abstract = {Institutions utilizing projects for policy implementation and service
   delivery initiatives should make provision for adequate institutional
   arrangements for the governance of projects. Governance includes
   authoritative decisions regarding resource allocation, performance
   monitoring and oversight, powers of the project manager, accountability
   issues and the establishment of structures to facilitate clear
   interfaces between municipal leadership and project teams. Governance
   arrangements typically include the establishment of mechanisms such as a
   steering committee and/or a project management unit to facilitate
   decision-making. This article explores the governance arrangements of
   projects and the challenges they represent to the political and
   administrative leadership of municipalities. Leadership challenges
   centre specifically on political and administrative interfaces, the
   physical organizational placement of project governance structures, and
   the monitoring and oversight of projects. For this purpose, research was
   conducted at several local and district municipalities in North-West
   Province to explore existing practices and leadership challenges. The
   challenges identified can lead to further research into the underlying
   issues causing service delivery failures in municipalities.},

Journal = {AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {45},
Number = {1},
Pages = {45-58},
Abstract = {The article reviews the history of Australian representations of Asia
   from the mid-19th century to the present. It argues that there are
   instructive continuities between recent references to `Asia literacy'
   and to injunctions to know Asia that date from the late 19th century. It
   examines representations of Asia that stress fluidity and
   unpredictability, and argues that fluid Asia has been assigned
   characteristics not unlike those attributed to women and the crowd. The
   implications of this analysis for recent discussions of the threat posed
   by political Islam are also referred to. In such discussions `the proper
   treatment of women' is commonly represented as both an established
   Australian value and one now under threat. The article ends by
   suggesting that the Howard government sought to marginalise `Asia
   literacy', replacing it with `Australia literacy'.},

Journal = {GLOBAL SOCIAL POLICY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {10},
Number = {3},
Pages = {315-335},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This exploratory study assesses the experiences of medical travelers
   seeking out of country health care in four destination countries: India,
   China, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates. It aims to identify the
   source countries of medical travelers, to understand their reasons for
   seeking out-of-country care, the type of services they obtained, and
   their level of satisfaction with the experience. Cost, physician and
   facility reputation and hospital accreditation were ranked as the most
   important factors in choosing out-of-country care. Wait times at home or
   lack of access to care were important motivations for international
   medical travel. Patient assessment of treatment outcomes is as high as
   might be found in similar assessments in high-income country facilities.
   Certain forms of treatment sought by respondents (i.e. organ
   transplantation) raise specific ethical concerns. Also of concern is
   that the present health systems in all four countries fail to adequately
   meet the health needs of their population (notably poorer groups).
   Evidence and inference strongly suggest that access to health care for
   poorer groups will worsen in these countries as medical tourism
   increases, at least in the short term, raising generic ethical and
   policy challenges over the extent to which access to essential health
   care by poorer persons is compromised by the public subsidization or
   promotion of medical tourism.},

Abstract = {Women are greatly underrepresented in elected office. A large literature
   on the subject has considerably advanced our understanding of this
   phenomenon, but many questions remain unanswered. Using original
   aggregate and individual-level data, the authors explore the interplay
   of candidate gender, partisanship, incumbency, and campaign spending in
   a multimember preferential voting system. This setting allows
   unparalleled exploration of the heterogeneous nature of voter decision
   making. The authors find little evidence for an independent effect of
   candidate gender on voter choice. Voters do not discriminate against
   women even in an electoral environment that affords them this
   opportunity without any cost to their partisan preferences.},

Journal = {POLITICAL RESEARCH QUARTERLY},

Volume = {63},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {Social desirability effects make it difficult to learn voters' racial
   attitudes. List experiments can tap sensitive issues without directly
   asking respondents to express overt opinions. The authors report on such
   an experiment about Barack Obama as the first black president, finding
   that 30 percent of white Americans were ``troubled{''} by the prospect
   of Obama as the first black president. The authors examine policy and
   emotional underpinnings of these responses, finding that expressed
   emotions of anxiety and enthusiasm condition latent racial attitudes and
   racial policy beliefs especially for those exhibiting a social
   desirability bias. The results suggest that Obama's victory despite this
   level of concern about race was at least in part a result of intense
   enthusiasm his campaign generated. This enthusiasm for Obama may have
   allowed some white voters to overcome latent concerns about his race.
   The research suggests emotions are critical in understanding racial
   attitudes.},

Abstract = {Are member states less likely to transpose a European Union directive
   correctly if they disagreed with the directive at the decision-making
   stage? Existing research provides mixed answers to this question. Most
   of this research does not consider the role of the enforcement agent,
   the European Commission, and uses aggregate measures. By contrast, this
   study considers the impact of the Commission, and focuses on specific
   provisions in directives. It combines detailed information on states'
   disagreement with each provision at the decision-making stage and the
   quality of national transposition of each provision. The descriptive
   analysis shows that protracted non-compliance in national transposition
   is a rare event. The explanatory analysis indicates that states' policy
   preferences significantly affect the likelihood of transposition
   problems, and that this is conditioned by the behaviour of the
   Commission.},

Abstract = {Are Muslims especially prone to large-scale political violence? From
   Montesquieu to Samuel Huntington, prominent modern analysts of politics
   have regarded Muslims as unusually inclined to strife. Many other
   observers have portrayed Islam as a peace-loving faith and Muslims as
   largely pacific. Yet scholars still lack much hard evidence on whether a
   relationship between Islam and political violence really exists.
   Precious few studies adduce empirical evidence on whether Islamic
   societies are actually more or less violent. This article assesses
   whether Muslims are more prone to large-scale political violence than
   non-Muslims. The authors focus neither on terrorism nor on interstate
   war. Instead, they investigate large-scale intrastate violence. The
   article makes three contributions. First, it offers useful data on Islam
   and political strife. Second, it investigates whether Muslims are
   especially violence prone. Relying on cross-national analysis, the
   authors find no evidence of a correlation between the proportion of a
   country's population that is made up of Muslims and deaths in episodes
   of large-scale political violence in the postwar period. Third, the
   authors investigate whether Islamism (the ideology), as opposed to
   Muslims (the people), is responsible for an inordinate share of the
   world's large-scale political violence. They find that Islamism is
   implicated in an appreciable but not disproportionate amount of
   political violence.},

   and individual users of the Internet and online services, its
   application will be consolidated over the next few years.
   In relation to Internet users, cloud computing has many connections with
   the web 2.0, and for companies it is closely linked to outsourcing of
   ICT services.
   This article identifies and analyses the major questions regarding
   binomial cloud computing and private data protection.},

Abstract = {This narrative demonstrates how public and private power interacted
   during the post-World War II era to create America's unique health care
   system, a system based on a high-cost, corporate model financed and
   managed by insurance companies. The article compares the divergent
   political, organizational, and economic strategies of the American
   Medical Association (AMA), which represented physicians, and the Health
   Insurance Association of America (HIAA), which represented for-profit
   insurance firms. Even after the defeat of President Harry Truman's plan
   for a universal, government-managed system, policymakers in both parties
   attempted to reform the health care market, because most observers
   recognized that the embryonic insurance-company-funded model had
   inherent cost problems. In order to defeat numerous reform proposals,
   AMA and HIAA leaders allied to rapidly develop the market around
   insurance-company financing. Insurers and physicians constructed
   overlapping institutions to manage their increasingly close financial
   relationship, thus creating a pseudocorporate arrangement. In an attempt
   to control costs, insurance companies expanded their function beyond
   simply underwriting the risks associated with medical services
   consumption to also assuming a supervisory role, albeit distant, over
   health care delivery. When policymakers designed Medicare, they adopted
   the organizational framework that private health interests had already
   created, thereby legitimizing the previously contested high-cost model.},

Abstract = {We develop a scaling model to estimate U.S. Supreme Court opinion
   locations and justice ideal points along a common spatial dimension
   using data derived from the citations between opinions. Citations from
   new opinions to precedent opinions usually apply and endorse the
   doctrine of the precedent opinion; however, sometimes they implicitly or
   explicitly dispute the precedent opinion. We collect original datasets
   classifying citations from search and seizure and freedom of religion
   opinions written between 1953 and 2006 into these different types and
   develop a model relating the similarity of the doctrine embodied in the
   citing and cited opinions to the relative probability of these different
   types of citations. The resulting spatial estimates of opinion location
   are used to evaluate theories of Supreme Court bargaining and opinion
   writing. We find empirical support for theoretical models that predict
   the majority opinion will fall at the ideal point of the median member
   of the majority coalition. Given the centrality of theories of judicial
   policymaking to various substantive problems in political science, the
   method of scaling opinions developed in this article can facilitate a
   range of future research.},

Abstract = {While determining their area of responsibilities, companies, attempt to
   develop their operations by taking opinions and expectations of all
   stakeholder groups in their complicated business networks into
   consideration. One of the questions here to answer is whether the
   companies exist to meet the expectations and needs of the community and
   the individuals or the community and the individuals exist for meeting
   the needs of the company. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)
   implementations, which develop within this framework, are especially
   worth to pay attention in the context of developing countries as these
   countries inherit a high potential in terms of market dynamics while, at
   the same time, do have a highly volatile market structure. Basing on
   this notion, this study first argues the conceptual framework and
   importance of CSR as a concept; then attempts to explain some important
   theoretical foundations coming from ``Institutional Theory{''},
   ``Stakeholder Approach{''} and ``Strategic Perspective{''}; and finally
   presents a brief look on certain implications of the issue in developing
   country context.},

Abstract = {This article examines the making of monetary policy in the United
   Kingdom between 1997 and 2008 by analysing voting behaviour in the Bank
   of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC). It provides a new set of
   measures for the monetary policy preferences of individual MPC members
   by estimating a Bayesian item response model. The article demonstrates
   the usefulness of these measures by comparing the ideal points of
   outgoing MPC members with their successors and by looking at changes
   over time in the median ideal point on the MPC. The analysis indicates
   that the British Government has been able to move the position of the
   median voter on the MPC through its appointments to the Committee. This
   highlights the importance of central bank appointments for monetary
   policy.},

Abstract = {Scholars of judicial politics have long speculated that the factors
   influencing judicial decision making operate to varying degrees at
   different levels of the judicial hierarchy. We investigate what we term
   the ``hierarchy postulate'': that the effect of judges' policy
   preferences on their decisions increases as one moves up the judicial
   hierarchy. Using original data on cases decided at each level of U.S.
   federal courts, which allow us to evaluate the impact of policy
   preferences on judicial decision making while holding constant the
   influence of case-specific factors, we find robust support for the
   contention that ideological and policy-related influences on federal
   judges' decisions are larger at higher levels of the judicial hierarchy.},

Abstract = {In this article. I argue that Louis Rid l is a necessary invention for
   the production of Canadian sovereignty. The argument builds on the work
   of Giorgio Agamben. I see Riel as a Canadian version of homo sacer,
   ``who inay be killed but not sacrificed,{''} and thereby serves as the
   exception that proves the rule of Canadian sovereignty. I carry out this
   argument in three stages, focusing first on Riel's exile in 1870 after
   the Red River Rebellion. I then bring Againhen's insights into an
   examination of the tensions between French and English Canada over
   Riel's execution in 1885. Finally, I look at the contemporary exaltation
   of Riel, focusing on the two statues that have occupied the legislative
   grounds in Winnipeg, which, when considered in tandem, serve as a
   metaphor for the relationship between liberal and colonial dynamics in
   Canada political history. The liberal colonial relationship is key to
   Rich's ambivalent standing in contemporary Canadian political life.},

   Democratic women, receive a boost in campaign fund-raising compared to
   their male counterparts, whereas women not supported by these networks
   receive significantly less. The ideological leanings of congressional
   donors also advantage Democratic women. Substantial partisan gender
   differences in this area of campaign finance persist, and this
   fund-raising gap may contribute to the growing partisan gender gap in

Abstract = {This study tests the theory of politicized ethnic identity's shaping
   Latino political behavior. The authors consider whether candidate
   quality moderates the effects of political ethnic attachments on
   co-ethnic candidate preferences. Ordered logistic regression models are
   developed to predict Latino voter preferences for co-ethnic candidates
   with varied degrees of qualification. Candidate quality significantly
   mitigates collective ethnic political behavior, yet the authors find
   Latinos with strong ethnic attachments remain inclined to prefer a
   co-ethnic even when less qualified than a non-Latino candidate.
   Political ethnic identity theory is useful in explaining minority
   political behavior, but there are boundaries to collective identity's
   shaping political preferences.},

Abstract = {The Finnish National Election Study of 2003 revealed that most voters in
   Finland do not identify with parties and are self-described as
   independents. In this article it is asserted that partisan attachments
   affect Finnish parties' optimal positions despite the large amount of
   independents. To show this, the article is divided in two parts. In the
   first part, voters' decisions are assumed to be deterministic. To show
   the effect of party identification under deterministic voting, two
   different types of simulations are conducted: the partisan type, where
   the partisans' voting behaviour depends on their distance from the party
   and on a degree of partisan attachment, and the apartisan type, where
   voting behaviour depends solely on policy issue distance. Results show
   that partisan attachments drive parties to adopt different `one-off'
   optimal positions than they would if party competition was solely based
   on policy issue distance. In the second part of the article, it is
   assumed that voters' decisions are probabilistic. Upon showing that
   party identification makes a voting model solely based on distance
   significantly more fit, the predicted probabilities of party choice are
   computed. Results indicate that the probability that a voter will vote
   for a party is higher when the party is located at its optimal position
   according to the partisan type of simulations rather than the apartisan
   one.},

Title = {Extending Citizenship to Emigrants: Democratic Contestation and a New

Abstract = {We argue that the growing literature on emigrant policies should be
   linked to more general theoretical discussions of the expansion of
   formal citizenship. State responses to emigrants' claims for membership
   and voting rights resemble patterns of citizenship extension to other
   previously excluded groups, such as those without property, racial
   minorities, and women, insofar as emigrant citizenship has developed as
   a consequence of competitive regimes and international norms. We assess
   the `global-norm hypothesis' (the idea that increasing emigrant
   inclusion has resulted from the emergence of a new international
   normative standard) and the `contestation hypothesis' (the argument that
   higher levels of regime competition make states more likely to extend
   citizenship to emigrants). The latter has two associated expectations:
   the `window-of-opportunity sub-hypothesis', which holds that regime
   transitions provide an especially propitious context for implementing
   emigrant citizenship, and the `democratic-endurance sub-hypothesis',
   which posits that competitive regimes are likely to extend emigrant
   citizenship in a gradual process over time. We use a combination of
   statistical analysis and case studies of Armenia, Mexico, Spain, and the
   USA to evaluate these causal hypotheses as well as some plausible
   alternatives found in the literature on expatriate policies.},

Abstract = {The goal of this article is to present an analytical reconstruction of
   the everyday practices of the moto bikers in Metropolitan Area of Buenos
   Aires (AMBA). In that reconstruction three practical ways linked to
   political dimension are spotted. The first one, which I named
   politicity, is held between agency and everyday life and, despite its
   opacity, is close to the individual actions. Another one, which is set
   in occasion of disputing for political power and more accurately for
   union achievements, is the one which I have called political action. The
   third one, related to representations and individual paths and
   biographies and which emerges particularly from those union
   participants, is the one I have entitled (political) interpretative
   historical frame.
   The outcomes of my field research are organized following a description
   of their practices in different contexts, taking in account the elements
   and situations in each case. In the end I take over the presentation in
   a theoretical level, in order to put the research in forthcoming
   exchanges.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {49},
Number = {1},
Pages = {25-52},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The expansion of women's formal political representation ranks among the
   most significant trends in international politics of the last 100 years.
   Though women made steady political progress, substantial country-level
   variation exists in patterns of growth and change. In this article,
   longitudinal theories are developed to examine how political factors
   affect women's political representation over time. Latent growth curve
   models are used to assess the growth of women in politics in 110
   countries from 1975 to 2000. The article investigates how electoral
   systems, national-level gender quotas and growth of democracy - both
   political rights and civil liberties - impact country-level trajectories
   of women's legislative representation. It is found: first, national
   quotas do affect women's political presence, but at a lower level than
   legislated by law; second, the impact of a proportional representation
   system on women's political representation is steady over time; and
   third, democracy, especially civil liberties, does not affect the level
   of women's political representation in the earliest period, but does
   influence the growth of women's political representation over time.
   These findings both reinforce and challenge prior cross-sectional models
   of women's political representation.},

Abstract = {Publication bias occurs when the probability that a paper enters the
   scholarly literature is a function of the magnitude or significance
   levels of the coefficient estimates. We investigate publication bias in
   two large literatures in political behavior: economic voting and the
   effects of negative advertising. We find that the pattern of published
   estimates is consistent with the presence of publication bias and that
   bias is more prevalent in the most influential and highly cited outlets.
   We consider the possible causes and find some evidence that papers
   systematically employ one-sided hypothesis tests in response to failure
   to meet the more demanding critical values associated with two-tailed
   tests, a practice that leads to misleading reports of the probability of
   Type I errors.},

Abstract = {Improvement of regulatory quality has become one of the most important
   items on the European Union's (EU) Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs.
   In this context, the European Commission has sought to influence the
   regulatory reform policies of the Member States, focusing on the
   implementation of better regulation principles and tools. This article
   explores the interactive nature of Europeanization, viewing domestic
   institutions as `users' of European policies according to their
   strategies. The author performs a within-case study based on a bottom up
   research design, analysing the impact of EU better regulation on Italy.
   The results show that the effects of Europeanization relate more to
   agenda setting than to implementation the latter is still, prevalently,
   determined by domestic factors.},

Abstract = {In the West/North, there have been two dominant models for understanding
   community and its associated bonds of solidarity. One is preindustrial
   and invokes the notion of the village with its `organic' ties of
   neighborliness and so on. The other is industrial and views community in
   terms of the shared situation of exploitation that is the basis of the
   constitution of the industrial working class. Neither model applies any
   longer in the West/North: in most places the village has become a
   dormitory suburb, and industrial production has increasingly been
   deproletarianized. This paper will pose the question of an alternative
   conception of social solidarity. Indispensable for the formation of
   community is its ability to function as a center of meaning for its
   members, and the question of how our new forms of production
   (informatically driven and globalized) allow these new centers of
   meaning to be developed. This paper will consider two models for this
   alternative conception. One is derived from Raymond Williams and takes
   `experience' as its organizing category; the other is taken from Gilles
   Deleuze and Felix Guattari and uses `desire' as its key category.},

   informational theory of legislative committees, the most important
   factor affecting the EP's opinion is the policy position of the median
   MEP, not a characteristic of the rapporteur. Nonetheless, the evidence
   shows that rapporteurs influence the EP's opinions when legislative
   proposals are subject to early agreements under the co-decision
   procedure and when the consultation procedure applies. Rapporteurs'
   influence is motivated primarily by national interests, rather than by
   the interests of their EP party groups.},

Abstract = {This research deals with the stages of development of the political
   order of Florence, focusing on the changes of the republican order.
   Starting from Machiavelli's Florentine Histories, which set forth a
   criticism of the first period of republican government until the
   establishment of the Medici seigniory, the author also analyses the
   other two stages of republican government in Florence. He thus puts
   together a periodization of three republican models of Florence during
   the Renaissance, which he refers to as the First, Second and Third
   Republics. The period of the First Republic stretches from 1250 to 1434,
   until the establishment of the first Medici seigniory. The period of the
   Second Republic, which lasted from 1498 to 1512, is assessed here as the
   period of a mature republic, which also witnessed a clear-cut defining
   of the theory of civil republicanism, primarily through the works of
   Machiavelli and Guicciardini. The Second Republic ended with the Medici
   restauration, when the republican government was once again suspended,
   and the republican institutions were abolished, although the state
   formally retained the designation of republic. After the fall of Rome in
   1527, the Medici rule in Florence also collapsed, and the period of the
   Third Republic began; it lasted from 1527 to 1530. This short stretch of
   time saw a radicalisation of the Florentine republicanism, but the
   social antagonism within the city-state was also radicalised. For this
   reason, the Third Republic did not manage to withstand the internal
   tensions and conflicts, and thus to face a deteriorated international
   state of affairs. The republican government collapsed again and made way
   for the second Medici restauration. The author describes and analyses in
   the text the republican institutions and their metamorphoses from the
   First Republic to the Third Republic, as well as the attempts to
   stabilize the republican government and realize Machiavelli's theory of
   the mixed form of government. The Florentine political order is
   therefore outlined as a development from communal democracy to civil
   republicanism with strong democratic elements, which, as a result of
   historical circumstances, was superseded by oligarchic forms of
   government.},

Abstract = {Democratic leaders confront a core dilemma in international relations.
   They favor democracies but know that the legitimacy of stable
   nondemocratic states is guaranteed under principles of state sovereignty
   and nonintervention. They therefore seem forced to either one extreme or
   another-to a de facto accommodation with nondemocracies that seems
   amoral, or to a missionary zeal for democratic change that seems
   perversely imperialistic. In this article we argue that these positions,
   the ``realistic{''} and the ``idealistic,{''} represent a false
   dichotomy generated by what we term the first and second moments of
   legitimacy, respectively. These moments-the first resting on
   international stability, the second on democracy-have been in historical
   contest for centuries. We argue the need for a third moment-of
   legitimacy as justice-to surmount the limitations of these options and
   the false choice they present, making room for the exercise of a prudent
   international leadership.},

Abstract = {The article explains ways of political control in Venezuelan mayors,
   implemented by President Chavez to ensure adherence to values of change
   postulated from 1999. At the beginning, these were diffuse; they were
   progressively declaring the socialist model of the constitutional reform
   in 2009. This was denied, but accomplished through decrees and enabling
   legislation remaining resources and competences to the mayors and
   Governors, dismantling existing decentralization devices since 1989, as
   well as centralizing power and economic resources in the central
   Government. Findings show the formation of political control circuits,
   between the Government and local councils, according to the political
   parties' affiliations of mayors, which catalyze award/punishment
   mechanisms, according to adherence o rejection of such values,
   consistent action and capacity of local governments to develop
   initiatives autonomous.},

Abstract = {We explore the role of sex in judging by addressing two questions of
   long-standing interest to political scientists whether and in what ways
   male and female judges decide cases distinctly-{''}individual
   effects{''} and whether and in what ways serving with a female judge
   causes males to behave differently-{''}panel effects.{''} While we
   attend to the dominant theoretical accounts of why we might expect to
   observe either or both effects, we do not use the predominant
   statistical tools to assess them. Instead, we deploy a more appropriate
   methodology semiparametric matching, which follows from a formal
   framework for causal inference. Applying matching methods to 13 areas of
   law, we observe consistent gender effects in only one sex discrimination
   For these disputes, the probability of a judge deciding in favor of the
   party alleging discrimination decreases by about 10 percentage points
   when the judge is a male Likewise, when a woman serves on a panel with
   men, the men are significantly more likely to rule in favor of the
   rights litigant These results are consistent with an informational
   account of gendered judging and are inconsistent with several others.},

Abstract = {The present argument focuses on part of Augustine's defense of
   Christianity in The City of God. There Augustine argues that the
   Christian religion did not cause the sack of Rome by the Goths in 410
   CE. Augustine revised the definitions of a `people' and `republic' found
   in Cicero's De Republica in light of the impossibility of true justice
   in a world corrupted by sin. If one returns these definitions to their
   original context, and accounts for Cicero's own political teachings, one
   finds that Augustine follows Cicero's republicanism on several key
   points. First, civil rule differs from mastery over slaves. Second,
   political life is indeterminate, so a republic could be any regime
   suitable for governing free human beings. Third, the prudent man may not
   abstain from public service. For Augustine the duty to public service is
   connected to his tragic portrayal of life and suffering in society after
   `the fall'. Augustine's contribution to the republican tradition is not
   to be found in the concept of a natural order, but in an explanation of
   why that order fails.},

Abstract = {We consider a government for which success requires high performance by
   talented ministers. A leader provides incentives to her ministers by
   firing those who fail However, the consequent turnover drains a finite
   talent pool of potential appointees The severity of the optimal fitting
   rule and ministerial performances decline over tune the lifetime of an
   effective government is limited. We relate this lifetime to various
   factors, including external shocks, the replenishment of the talent
   pool, and the leader's reputation. Sonic results are surprising: an
   increase in the stability of government and the exogenous imposition of
   stricter performance standards can both shorten the era of effective
   government, and an increase in the replenishment of the talent pool can
   reduce incumbent ministers' performance.},

Abstract = {Using data from a randomized field experiment within a Deliberative
   Poll, this paper examines deliberation's effects on both policy
   attitudes and the extent to which ordinal rankings of policy options
   approach single-peakedness (a help in avoiding cyclical majorities). The
   setting was New Haven, Connecticut, and its surrounding towns; the
   issues were airport expansion and revenue sharing the former highly
   salient, the latter not at all. Half the participants deliberated
   revenue sharing, then the airport; the other half the reverse. This
   split-half design helps distinguish the effects of the formal on-site
   deliberations from those of other aspects of the treatment. As expected,
   the highly salient airport issue saw only a slight effect, while much
   less salient revenue-sharing issue saw a much larger one.},

Journal = {AMERICA LATINA HOY-REVISTA DE CIENCIAS SOCIALES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {54},

Abstract = {The high incidence of party switching has generated a lot of interest in
   Guatemala, something that has not happened in the rest of the Central
   American countries. Traditionally, party switching has been considered
   as something negative with serious repercussions overrepresentation,
   political parties, and democracy. This article proposes an alternative
   to the common normative or prescriptive study of party switching. The
   argument is that switching is a strategic decision by congressmen in
   order to maximize their utility function; ambitious members of Congress
   will evaluate their own resources, the resources political parties are
   willing to offer, their association costs and their transaction costs.
   After a preliminary analysis of party unity, electoral volatility and a
   few case studies, the article suggests that switching in Guatemala is a
   function of parties' monopoly over private and collective goods, of high
   association costs and low transactions costs.},

Abstract = {Facebook's decision to invoke its obscenity clause to bar users from
   posting pictures of breastfeeding ignited a controversy. Members
   protested against the ban both offline and online. The controversy
   raised various issues between our lived offline experiences and the
   rules of engagement in social networking sites. Image economies on the
   Internet present new problems and challenges. Although they are crucial
   in the construction of profiles and identities in social networking
   sites and may therefore function as a referent of social values and
   norms, there may be disparities in the ways they are gazed at and
   interpreted as published content online. This paper examines the salient
   issues which emerged in the breastfeeding controversy with relevance to
   the image economy in social networking sites. In particular; it
   discusses the politicisation of the image, users' notions and
   construction of public and private spaces in social networking sites,
   and the use of the image as symbol of dissent and activism in such
   online communities.},

Abstract = {A generation of scholars has evaluated landmark Supreme Cowl rulings
   like Roe v. Wade with the assumption that counter-majoritarian judges
   are able to impose their will on elected legislators. Much recent
   scholarship on the courts has shown, however, that the assumptions about
   institutional power that underlie the counter-majoritarian model of
   judicial review are wrong. Judicial capacities to strike down laws are
   not fixed by constitutional design, but are largely the result of
   choices made by elected officials. As a result, scholars need to make
   careful empirical investigations into choices by elected officials that
   empower judges before declaring that a judicial decision thwarts the
   will of those elected officials. This article argues that in addition to
   looking at instances where legislators take overt steps to empower
   courts, scholars also have to consider whether legislators have
   defaulted to the courts. Examining the case of abortion after Roe v.
   Wade, we argue that there is little basis for the belief that the
   court's decision was necessarily ``final.{''} A constitutional barrier
   to bans on pre-viability abortions has developed largely because
   majorities among elected officials in the federal government and most
   states have supported (or declined opportunities to challenge) that
   policy Rather than being an illustration of judicial supremacy Roe v.
   Wade represents a ``legislative default,{''} that is, a case where a
   majority of legislators either favor the policy instituted by the courts
   or prefer to allow the courts to assume responsibility for resolving a
   divisive policy question. Polity (2010) 42, 210-243.

Abstract = {We propose a framework for understanding how the Internet has affected
   the U.S. political news market. The framework is driven by the lower
   cost of production for online news and consumers' tendency to seek out
   media that conform to their own beliefs The framework predicts that
   consumers of Internet news sources should hold more extreme political
   views and be interested in more diverse political issues than those who
   solely consume mainstream television news. We test these predictions
   using two large datasets with questions about news exposure and
   political views Generally speaking, we find that consumers of generally
   left-of-center (right-of-center) cable news sources who combine their
   cable news viewing with online sources are more liberal (conservative)
   than those who do not. We also find that those who use online news
   content are more likely than those who consume only television news
   content to be interested in niche political issues.},

   a potential to remedy the problems caused by the war against terror. To
   expect that a problem which has become a menacing trouble for the past
   25 years to be solved in just one or two years can only be a dream. Only
   if full harmony can be achieved among all state institutions, including
   the TSK (Turkish Armed Forces), can we see satisfactory solutions
   sprouting in the next three or four years.},

Abstract = {Using a question-order experiment, half the respondents in a national

   Presidential Primary election were primed to think about President Bush
   and the war in Iraq before making their candidate choice. Results show
   that the priming had a significant effect on their candidate choice, and
   that priming individuals to think about the war significantly aided the
   candidacy of eventual Democratic nominee Barack Obama, more than
   doubling his support, and hurt then Republican front-runner Rudy
   Giuliani, cutting his support almost in half.},

Abstract = {With the help of a grant from the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust, the
   de Borda Institute and the New Economics Foundation did some research
   into decision making. The binary majority vote is often inadequate and
   inaccurate, and it was thought that perhaps a multi-option procedure of
   preferential voting would be more suitable for a modern, pluralist
   society. As part of that project, an experiment was conducted on the
   web, based on a Modified Borda Count. The subject of discussion was the
   UK controversy about how to fund the political process. After a critique
   of dichotomous decision making and an introduction to consensus voting,
   this article describes the experiment, analyses the vote and makes
   recommendations for any future exercise.},

Abstract = {One attraction of ``choice{''} feminism has been its refusal to judge
   the diverse desires of women. Yet for feminism to retain its political
   vision as a quest for social justice, we must continue difficult
   conversations concerning how acting on our individual desires impacts
   the lives of others. In this essay, I argue that feminists can
   acknowledge women's diverse desires while forging a meaningful feminist
   community. I make this argument by considering feminism's relationship
   to time, and particularly how women's diverse desires are read in each
   moment in time. If we abandon the generational model, wherein each new
   generation of feminists improves upon the last, for a genealogical
   perspective where women recognize our feminist origins and empathize
   with the diverse struggles of other women, we might reaffirm social
   justice for the community as central to feminist politics. To articulate
   this possibility, I turn to the work of Simone de Beauvoir to explain
   her discovery of how her embodiment as a woman and her relationship to
   femininity becomes a way of grounding a feminist politics. Recognizing
   the ``demands of femininity{''} in other women's lives allows us to
   affirm feminist community while retaining the capacity to make judgments
   that realize social justice as a feminist goal.},

Abstract = {This article explores the use of podcasts in the learning and teaching
   of Politics and International Relations in a UK Higher Education
   institution. The article has three main sections. The first explores the
   pedagogic issues associated with the use of podcasts. The second
   highlights examples of good practice for using podcast material in
   lectures/seminars. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, it outlines
   student attitudes to the use of podcasts within learning and teaching.},

Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {104},
Number = {1},
Pages = {189-207},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This article presents an interpretation of Sayyid Qutb's political
   theory based on a prominent feature of his thought: the claim that
   Islamic law and human nature (fitra) are in perfect harmony, and that
   the demands of Islamic law are easy and painless for ordinary human
   moral capacities. I argue that Qutb is not only defending Islamic law as
   true and obligatory, but also as a coherent ``realistic utopia{''}-a
   normative theory that also contains a psychological account of that
   theory's feasibility. Qutb's well-known fascination with the earliest
   generation of Muslims (the salaf) is an integral part of this account
   that serves two functions: (I) as a model of the feasibility and realism
   of an ideal Islamic political order, and (2) as a genealogy of the
   political origins of moral vice in society. Qutb's project is thus an
   account of exactly why and how Islam requires politics, and how modern
   humans can be both free and governed.},

Abstract = {Ukraine has great potential in the production of agricultural products
   and their export. After a steep decline, agricultural production, since
   2000, has once again been on the increase. For some products, such as
   barley, Ukraine is already the world's leading exporter. However, up to
   now, its agricultural potential has only been realised in a rudimentary
   way. The greatest handicap of Ukrainian agricultural is that its
   singular climatic and geographic advantages are not being fully
   exploited, the result of inadequate technological expertise and
   management skills as well as a shortage of reliable framework conditions
   in farm policy.},

Title = {Approaches to and tools for managing environmental conflicts in coastal
   zones in Africa: Challenges and prospects in relation to Integrated
   Coastal Zone Management (ICZM)},
Journal = {AFRICAN JOURNAL ON CONFLICT RESOLUTION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {10},
Number = {2},
Pages = {31-47},
Abstract = {Conflicts in coastal zones arise as a result of the variance between
   divergent interests, within limited and dynamic socio-spatial and
   ecological dimensions, with little effort at critical consensus. Coastal
   zones worldwide exhibit three classical internal trademarks -high
   pressures for development, management weaknesses to protect coastal
   ecosystems and the deterioration of environmental conditions -all of
   which exacerbate conflicts over use and access of coastal zones. These
   conflicts are further expected to intensify against the backdrop of
   global climate change, with their location specific manifestations and
   impacts. Coastal zones in Africa are particularly vulnerable, as
   burgeoning population increases and rapid economic growth compound
   pressures on and intensify conflicts over scarce/stressed resources.
   Furthermore, the situation is particularly acute as deteriorating
   environmental conditions impede social and economic development, and are
   linked to the pervasiveness of hunger, poverty and disease, which engage
   in a vicious cycle of environmental conflicts. As coastal environments
   become excessively anthropocentric, ecological dimensions cannot obviate
   the impact of human behaviour. Integrated approaches present powerful
   frameworks for analysing human-environmental conflicts, understood as
   ecological change, together with human knowledge and practice. Efforts
   at conflict resolution should be aimed at improving environmental
   conditions in tandem with improving the level of technical skill and
   capacity to mitigate environmental degradation. The challenge is to
   balance the need for short-term gains with long-term integrated resource
   management, heralded as Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM). This
   article examines the challenges and prospects for approaches and tools
   to manage environmental conflicts in Africa's coastal zones.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE EDUCATION},

Volume = {6},
Number = {4},
Pages = {336-352},
Abstract = {Education policy in England has been criticized for an overemphasis on
   narrow performance targets and the adoption of private sector
   principles. Universities and colleges have increasingly been viewed in
   terms of their value for the U.K. economy. This article argues that
   there are sound ethical (philosophical), political, and pedagogical
   reasons for a more rounded approach. To reassert a broader vision of
   education we require an ethical base, which we argue is provided by
   political philosophy in the writings of John Dewey. For Dewey, education
   must be viewed in the context of its role in democratic society. The
   article identifies basic principles that relate to Dewey's belief in
   democratic education and develops general indicators to test these
   principles. These indicators are then used to evaluate higher education
   and political science education in England.},

Abstract = {This article reflects on religious non-governmental organisations
   (RNGOs) at the United Nations and their engagement with the Millennium
   Development Goals (MDGs) within the UN system. It also situates this
   engagement within the wider context of contemporary global civil
   society. It aims to give an introduction to the contemporary situation
   of religious NGOs at the UN and some of the related and critically
   debated issues, making use of in-depth interviews with key actors,
   relevant literature and other documentary materials, as well as selected
   examples of three major RNGOs engaging with the MDGs. An improved
   understanding of the work of religious NGOs at the UN and the historical
   context in which their work takes place can make valuable contributions:
   it can inform UN agencies and government agencies' policy
   recommendations and planning decisions, it can enhance self-reflection
   by civil society organisations, and it can help to identify common
   ground for all these actors as they seek to develop multi-stakeholder
   partnerships aiming to meet the MDGs.},

Pages = {429-443},
Abstract = {This article analyzes the recent changes in naturalization policies in
   three Nordic countries, Norway, Denmark and Sweden. Considering the
   homogeneity of the region in terms of culture, social structure and
   polity, the discrepancy in current citizenship regulation is remarkable.
   Similar problem definitions have generated diametrical opposite
   solutions. This is even more striking as the three countries, hailing on
   perceived ideas of common interests and various experiences of shared
   rule in different political constellations for the best part of the last
   500 years, also cooperated closely in forging their national citizenship
   legislation from the 1880s up till 1979. The article gives perspective
   to this novel variation, analyzing the interplay between aims and means
   in the naturalization policies. Basic questions like citizenship rights,
   the social and cultural cohesion of the nation state, national ideology
   and questions of identity will be addressed.},

Abstract = {In this article, we summarize a cross-national research programme, the
   Living-inHistory Project, investigating the impact of war, terrorism and
   natural disaster on the organization of autobiographical memory. More
   specifically, the aims of this project were: (a) to develop a method for
   assessing the impact of public events on autobiographical memory; (b) to
   determine whether there are systemic group differences in the
   relationship between these two types of knowledge; and (c) to identify
   factors that are present when personal memory and historical memory
   become intertwined. This method was used to collect data from 18 samples
   located in nine countries. We conclude that wars (e.g. the civil war in
   Bosnia; World War II) and natural disasters (e.g. the Izmit Earthquake)
   spawn Historically defined Autobiographic Periods (H-DAPs), but
   terrorist attacks (e.g. 9/11, the Second Intifada) and nonviolent
   political upheaval (the fall of the Soviet Union) do not. We also
   conclude that autobiographical memory and historical memory are
   interrelated only when public events dramatically alter the fabric of
   daily life, for a population, for an extended period.},

Pages = {257-270},
Abstract = {Implementing the budget of the Supreme Audit Institution (SAI) has
   recently become quite a serious problem in the Czech Republic. Thus this
   study focuses on parliamentary control of budget implemetation, and
   control of SAI budget implementation especially. First, it analyses the
   function of parliamentary control generally as it has already been
   elaborated in the existing theoretical literature and comparative
   studies. Then it focuses on parliamentary control of the SAI's budget
   implementation in chosen EU member states. It compares the legislation
   (especially the Constitution and Acts on SAI) of individual countries
   and comes to the conclusion that in spite of significant differences in
   names, position, competencies and duties of the SAI in individual
   states, most SAIs have a relation of close responsibility to Parliament.
   The study also examines Czech legislation about the SAI and compares it
   with the Lima declaration and praxis in other EU member states. On the
   basis of this analysis, it strives to give some recommendations to
   improve Czech legislation and parliamentary control of SAI budget
   implementation.},

Abstract = {In an interesting essay published in this journal Jonathan Floyd has
   recently argued (2009) that, contrary to widespread opinion, political
   philosophy is not too a-historical, for historical facts cannot ground
   timeless political principles. In the following I would like to reply to
   his theses showing that the authors he criticises aim in fact to show
   that our historical situation gives us a decisive clue as to the tasks
   that philosophical theory has to address; that philosophical
   argumentation rests on normative beliefs that we expect our audience to
   take for granted, and that these beliefs are historically embedded.
   Finally, although the historicity of normative beliefs has been often
   used to reject universalism, current scholarship includes important
   attempts to combine historicity and universalism.},

Abstract = {Egalitarians claim that inequality in society is only justified to the
   extent that it results from choices freely and responsibly made.
   Inequality resulting from brute bad luck is not justified. I argue that
   luck, and therefore responsibility, are defined in terms of the reward
   structure. Luck and responsibility are epiphenomena of the incentives
   that people have to choose from the opportunity sets available. To that
   end egalitarians should look more directly at the degree of inequality
   that is acceptable and examine more closely the classes of actions they
   want to leave to individual responsibility even though these will lead
   to greater inequality. State action should concentrate upon reducing
   inequality between classes of people; it cannot be expected to reduce
   all inequalities between people even though many of these will have only
   peripheral relationships to responsibility.},

Abstract = {The study of Colombian, Dominican and Mexican immigrant organizations in
   the USA shows that variations by nationality are not only the result of
   differences in the demographic characteristics of the immigrant
   populations. Immigrant organizations are immersed simultaneously in two
   civil society/state dynamics: that of the sending country and that of
   the receiving country, and both shape immigrant organizations. I argue
   that the patterns of civic and political association in the immigrants'
   countries of origin and the continuous relations immigrant organizations
   maintain with institutions, organizations, political parties and/or the
   state of the country of origin contribute significantly to defining
   national differences among immigrant organizations.},

   theoretical aspects of democracy Building on this, we formulate
   hypotheses about political actors communicative behaviour and its impact
   on the image of politicians A qualitative-quantitative content analysis
   of all articles on agriculture policy in five nationwide German quality
   newspapers 2000-2005 serves to test the hypotheses Confirming our
   behavioural assumptions, the data show high prominence of staged and
   mediatized events, a strong standing, but no dominance of the political
   centre, much self-acclaim, many negative statements about political
   competitors, and the naming of victims who refer to hazards to the
   audience or enjoy its sympathy The image of political actors is
   substantially framed by their own statements},

Pages = {353-369},
Abstract = {The global recession of 2008-09 brought Keynesian countercyclical
   budgeting back into vogue-conveniently for governments of the Left such
   as the incoming Rudd Labor government in Australia. This paper reviews
   some of the key moments of 20th century macroeconomic policy to assess
   the reasons and rationale for this revival and concludes that the
   lessons of those experiences are not always what they seem to be. The
   paper argues that: (1) Keynesianism is often confused with a narrow
   focus on fiscal, rather than monetary, policy and an emphasis on full
   employment at any cost; (2) the return of Keynesianism in Australia has
   only been made possible by an unusual, if not unprecedented, convergence
   of conducive conditions; (3) the `automatic stabilisers' significantly
   reduce the necessity for discretionary fiscal policy; and (4) policy
   achievements must be seen in the light of Australia's external economy.},

Abstract = {The dominant approaches dealing with professionalization in politics
   suggest that incentives stemming from institutions and determinants of
   the parliamentary system of government usually result in the recruitment
   of professional politicians This hypothesis is reviewed using eleven new
   Central Eastern European (CEE) democracies as a testing ground According
   to theory, we should expect two findings First, we should find a large
   proportion of professional politicians in CEE cabinets Second, we should
   observe an increase in the size of this group over time The empirical
   results only confirm the first assumption Consequently,
   professionalization-related hypotheses are not sufficient explanations
   to account for ministerial recruitment patterns in CEE countrie},

Abstract = {Philip Tetlock underestimates the import of his own Expert Political
   Judgment. It is much more than a critical scientific evaluation of the
   accuracy and consistency of political pundits. It also offers a
   blueprint for challenging expertise more generally-in the name of
   scientific advancement. ``Thinking the unthinkable{''}-a strategy
   Tetlock employs when he gets experts to consider counterfactual
   scenarios that are far from their epistemic comfort zones-has had
   explosive consequences historically for both knowledge and morality by
   extending our sense of what is possible. Thinking the unthinkable might
   also put into question contemporary assumptions about the legitimacy of
   science.},

Journal = {GERMAN POLITICS},

Volume = {19},
Number = {3-4, SI},

Abstract = {Germany's constitutional order places considerable emphasis on the
   protection of civil liberties. As in other liberal democracies, the
   events following 9/11 have increasingly led to critical questions about
   the relationship between the protection of civil liberties and
   collective security needs. The article reviews the Grand Coalition's
   (2005-09) legislation in the area of internal security and immigration,
   investigating the extent to which the first Merkel cabinet departed
   significantly from the legislative status quo. The main finding for the
   areas of home affairs and internal security is that the Grand
   Coalition's policy is characterised by a continuous development of
   previous governments' policy agendas, its room for manoeuvre being
   circumscribed by some landmark rulings of the Federal Constitutional
   Court and its loss of a majority in the Bundesrat following the Bavarian
   state diet election of autumn 2008. The main characteristic of internal
   security policy is the stronger coordination of intelligence gathering
   and sharing both internationally and amongst various executive agencies
   at the national and regional level. By contrast, the Grand Coalition's
   policy agenda on immigration demonstrated a growing consensus amongst
   the two major German parties. As a result, a number of innovative
   policies could be developed, including the revised Immigration Act.},

Pages = {353-369},
Abstract = {Why have some European regions institutionalized participatory
   democracy? To answer this question, this article adopts a sociological
   approach and method which go beyond current political science narratives
   about regional democracies. To study how choices over participatory
   democracy are mediated, we locate an `observatory site'-the Regional
   Government Site-and examine interactions and strategies of actors
   therein. When applied to the institutionalization of citizens' juries in
   Rh (o) over cap nes-Alpes, our approach reveals how, through the
   resolution of contingencies, regional authorities become producers of
   participatory democracy. Organizational struggles combined with
   ideological struggles over visions of democracy transformed the region
   into a space for politics.},

   of Canadian citizenship. Using the phenomenon of Lost Canadians - people
   whose citizenship status is ambiguous due to conflicting laws,
   unfamiliarity with requirements to maintain citizenship and quixotic
   enforcement of these requirements - the paper offers evidence for the
   kinship basis of a contemporary liberal democracy and reveals the degree
   to which a Canadian ethnic identity is operative in this settler
   society. But the objective of the analytical exercise is not to rest at
   the observation that Canadian nationalism is ethnic. Rather, by
   examining the ways in which the complex rules of Canadian citizenship
   define or exclude people from citizenship, we see how thoroughly
   rule-bound the status of national belonging really is. It thus might be
   observed that Canadian nationalism, indeed, all nationalisms, are civic
   since they rest on rules for belonging. Once we notice the
   rule-boundedness of belonging it becomes possible to disentangle these
   rules - kinship rules - from their connections to nature and biology and
   thus to appreciate their social character. From this vantage we might
   begin to think about alternative, and potentially more democratic, forms
   of belonging.},

Abstract = {How do subnational authoritarian enclaves emerge (or survive) in a
   democratic transition at the federal level? How can they endure
   large-scale social protests, like the one that shook Oaxaca in 2006?
   While federal tolerance for subnational authoritarian practices is a
   necessary condition, it is insufficient in itself to explain why
   subnational political systems sustain and eventually reproduce
   authoritarian practices in the first place. In this article, therefore,
   I focus on the internal dimension of subnational authoritarianism. I
   argue that, because of its reliance on two distinct sources of
   legitimacy, Oaxaca's neo-patrimonial domination system was able to
   respond to the formal democratizing pressures emanating from the federal
   transition without losing its authoritarian nature. This process of
   hybridization transformed Oaxacan institutions, but left social
   structures and the political dynamics that emerge from them - the
   sources of subnational authoritarianism - almost intact. By exploring
   the evolution of neo-patrimonialism and hybridization in Oaxaca from a
   theoretical perspective, I address the issues of change and continuity
   in the emergence of subnational authoritarian enclaves, in Mexico and
   elsewhere.},

Abstract = {Many observers and scholars argue that primary elections contribute to
   ideological polarization in U.S. politics. We test this claim using
   congressional elections and roll call voting behavior. Many of our
   findings are null. We find little evidence that the introduction of
   primary elections, the level of primary election turnout, or the threat
   of primary competition are associated with partisan polarization in
   congressional roll call voting. We also find little evidence that
   extreme roll call voting records are positively associated with primary
   election outcomes. A positive finding is that general election
   competition exerts pressure toward convergence as extreme roll call
   voting is negatively correlated with general election outcomes.},

Abstract = {The dominant liberal democratic discourse maintains that its ideals and
   institutions mitigate recourse to political violence. ``The ballot
   replaces the bullet{''} is the largely unchallenged conventional wisdom
   that reflects a complex set of assertions and assumptions. This article
   critically examines the key contentions and conceptual building blocks
   of this discourse, with a focus on the Democratic Peace Thesis. The
   upshot is that liberal democracy's capacity to mitigate political
   violence may be significantly limited to that which is generally
   assumed.},

Title = {Discourses on Citizenship and Immigration in Europe: Universalism,
   Extremism and Education},
Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {47},
Number = {2},
Pages = {63-84},
Abstract = {In this article we analyse the fundamental changes in citizenship
   discourses which have taken place in the last 15 years due to the
   increasing cultural diversity in our societies. We explain which
   transformations have altered the different ingredients of this
   institution, designated to generate social cohesion in societies where
   the cultural difference is becoming progressively more visible: some
   elements of the ius soli have been widely adopted; as a set of rights,
   these have been enlarged and now include those of ethnic minorities; it
   is becoming different from belonging to a shared national identity, as
   used to be the case. All this, however, stands in sharp contrast with
   the fierce discourse on immigration of right-wing extremist parties
   which we briefly revise. They openly criticize multiculturalism and the
   extension of citizenship rights to non-national residents, and foster
   the harshening of requisites for granting citizenship and
   naturalization. Taking Europe as an example of a post-national
   community, we go on analysing which discourses on citizenship education
   have emanated from European institutions, and how they have evolved.
   European policies at this level have tried to extend a model of
   citizenship based on democratic values and linked to human rights'
   discourse, more than on a shared cultural identity. In the last part we
   try to see if and how all this has affected European citizens, in the
   sense that they may now share some of these democratic values as
   defended by the European institutions; or rather, they may have adopted
   some -if not all of the- premises on the immigration issue defended by
   the extreme right. We attempt to answer this question on which of the
   two opposing ideas on citizenship -one inclusive and democratic, the
   other one openly closed and exclusionary-is more entrenched among
   Europeans by looking at some data on political participation at the
   European level and some other empirical information as presented by the
   Eurobarometers. The evidence, however, is far from conclusive.},

Journal = {REGIONAL AND FEDERAL STUDIES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-18},
Abstract = {Approaches to disability policy have undergone a radical re-orientation
   across Europe and North America in the last twenty-five years. They have
   shifted away from a welfare-based model towards a rights model, which
   emphasizes the equality rights of persons with disabilities. This
   relatively rapid, cross-national paradigm shift, in the face of
   institutionalized mechanisms that one would expect to resist radical
   change, poses a puzzle. We argue, using the cases of Canada and the
   European Union, that the federal and supranational governments played a
   key role in encouraging the spread of the rights model of disability in
   their respective federal political systems and that this is crucial in
   explaining the timing of the shift. We find that reframing disability
   issues as a question of rights helped to expand the authority and the
   legitimacy of centralized governance.},

Abstract = {An emerging literature on civil and international conflict management is
   developing and testing insights from formal theories of conflict. Third
   parties may attempt to prevent or resolve conflict by providing material
   incentives or by providing or filtering information. Material incentives
   are the province of states, for the most part, while weaker third
   parties can provide information. There is considerable debate over
   whether threats of third-party intervention actually deter conflict,
   provoke conflict, have no effect, or have nonmonotonic effects on the
   likelihood of conflict. Providing information via mediation is seen as
   effective in preventing conflict, but questions remain about precisely
   how it works and about the appropriate characteristics of the mediator,
   such as whether mediators should be biased or unbiased.},

Abstract = {The Swiss party system has become strongly polarized over the last
   decade, following the rise of the Swiss People's Party and the electoral
   losses of center parties. This article suggests that these developments
   are, at least in part, a consequence of strategic behaviour among
   voters. As the government policy is the result of institutionalized
   multiparty bargaining, voters have incentives to compensate for this
   watering-down by supporting parties whose positions are more extreme
   than their own. This article empirically tests extent and conditions of
   compensatory voting in the 2007 National Council Elections using Selects
   survey data. Our results suggest that compensatory voting generally
   outweighs voting based on ideological proximity and increases with
   rising district magnitude.},

Abstract = {The article examines the extent to which the `Orange Revolution' could
   be considered a revolutionary event stimulated by civil society, or a

   opinion poll data and responses from focus groups. the author contends
   that what began as an orchestrated protest against election fraud
   developed into a novel type of political activity - a revolutionary coup
   d'iitat. It is contended that the movement was divisive rather than
   integrative and did not enjoy widespread popular support.},

Abstract = {In the post-Columbian age, we have to deal with a closed political
   system, and none the less that it will be one of worldwide scope, and we
   are for the first time in a position to attempt, with some degree of
   completeness, a correlation between the larger geographical and the
   larger historical generalizations. The pivot region of the world's
   politics is that vast area of Euro-Asia which is inaccessible to ships,
   but in antiquity lay open to the horse-riding nomads, and is to-day
   about to be covered with a network of railways. There have been and are
   here the conditions of a mobility of military and economic power of a
   far-reaching and yet limited character. Russia has replaced the Mongol
   Empire. Outside the pivot area, in a great inner crescent, are Germany,
   Austria, Turkey, India, and China, and in an outer crescent, Britain,
   South Africa, Australia, the United States, Canada, and Japan. From this
   point of view the real divide between east and west is to be found in
   the Atlantic Ocean. The oversetting of the balance of power in favour of
   the pivot state, resulting in its expansion over the marginal lands of
   Euro-Asia, would permit of the use of vast continental resources for
   fleet-building, and the empire of the world would then be in sight.},

Title = {Gender, family law and citizenship in Syria},
Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {14},
Number = {5},
Pages = {557-572},
Abstract = {This paper explores the impact of family law on the structuring of
   gendered citizenship in Syria where the state's family law accords male
   and female citizens different legal status, thus ordering the
   distribution of basic rights and duties along gendered lines. Partial
   centralization and fragmented secularization of judicial authority
   relates to the accommodation of religious groups, a policy which was
   continued after the establishment of territorial states in the 1920s.
   Family law maintained its religious tenets and was included as part of
   the state's jurisdiction. The impact of family law on citizenship is
   exacerbated in that membership in religious groups is mandated and
   monitored by the state. Citizenship is thus mediated through a citizen's
   membership in a religious group where the religiously based family law
   applies as state law. Seen in theoretical terms, family law plays a
   crucial role in structuring gendered citizenship in ways that limit the
   legal authority of female citizens as full members of the polity. Two
   questions are addressed: First, how and why does family law premise
   gendered citizenship in Syria? Second, what characterizes the debates
   regarding changes within family law that surfaced after 2003 following
   the political regime's liberalization efforts?.},

Abstract = {The creation of `regional' spaces for politics across national borders,
   and the role of national minorities in border regions therein, remain
   under-explored in regional studies. Based on an ontology that de-links
   `regions as spaces for politics' from formal boundaries and embraces
   territorial hybridity and de-territorialization of politics, this
   article explores how regional and minority actors in the Danish-German
   border region collectively mobilized to build cross-border capacity. In
   this process, national minorities emerged as key actors constructing
   anew an `old' border region through politicization of regional
   territory; re-framing ideologies of EU polity building; mobilization of
   intra-regional networks; usage of intra-state territorial politics.},

Abstract = {The burst of the Indians in front of the scene, claiming for an equal
   treatment, a recognition of their cultural specificities and repair
   (both symbolic and material) for the damages endured by five centuries
   of domination is one of the most significant change in South America.
   The conflicts, often seen as ethnic or racial matters, have also (and
   maybe above all) a social dimension.},

Volume = {54},
Number = {1},
Pages = {45-60},

Abstract = {Certain governments have been faster than others in relaxing their
   restrictions on the cross-border movement of capital. How can we explain
   the timing and extent of financial liberalization across countries since
   the 1970s ? We argue that IMF stabilization programs provide a window of
   opportunity for governments to initiate financial reforms, but that
   policy makers are more likely to seize this opportunity when welfare
   expenditures are high. Large loans from the IMF shield policy makers
   from the costs of financial reform, while welfare expenditures provide
   credibility to the government's ex ante promises of compensation to
   individuals who are harmed by the reforms. We test this hypothesis on
   data for 87 countries from 1975 to 2002. We employ a spatial
   autoregressive error sample selection model which accounts for the
   nonrandom participation of countries in IMF programs as well as the
   processes of international policy diffusion. The results provide strong
   support for the interactive effect of IMF programs and domestic welfare
   expenditures on financial liberalization.},

Abstract = {In recent years the assumption that democracy automatically generates
   peace has been critiqued. It has instead been suggested that the
   promotion of economic liberalism provides a much stronger basis for
   peace. In this paper, we examine and contest the normative claims of the
   `capitalist peace'. While there is a close association between extreme
   poverty and the onset of civil war, it is unclear whether economic
   liberalism will ameliorate conflict. A major reason for this ambiguity
   is because the emphasis of the `capitalist peace' literature has largely
   been on interstate relations rather than intrastate ethnonational
   conflict. A closer look reveals that neoliberal policies in divided
   societies can also, in some contexts, exacerbate conflict in violently
   divided societies.},

Title = {European Studies in the Czech Republic: A New Field Built on Communist
   Legacies and EC Support{''}},
Journal = {POLITIX},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {23},
Number = {89},
Pages = {125+},
Abstract = {This article offers a case study on the emergence of a sub-field
   specialised in European affairs within Czech political science since the
   early 1990s, as a result of the scientific investments of a few
   ``Entrepreneurs of Europe{''}. These scholars had a basic knowledge of
   European integration which was highly valued in a future EU member
   state. Their involvement in various forms of scientific cooperation
   sponsored by the European Commission has allowed them to further develop
   some cosmopolitan resources (knowledge of foreign languages, access to
   foreign literature and membership in transnational scientific networks).
   The impact of European integration on the Czech academic field is yet
   limited by the legacies of the past because these ``new{''} careers
   build on intellectual, academic and political capital acquired through
   previous work experiences some of which date back to the communist
   period. The proximity between political actors and scholars which is a
   common feature of European studies in many EU member states is also
   shaped in some of them by post-communist dynamics.},

Pages = {297-317},
Abstract = {The validity of the new Constitution and election of new state
   authorities should lead to the definitive closure of a long period of
   political instability in Ecuador. The strong support received by
   President Correa during his administration and his reelection in the
   first round could be interpreted as positive signs for achieving those
   goals. However, three aspects appear to be obstacles to the fully
   establishment of a new order able to ensure good governance and
   stability, in a context where progress has been made as to popular
   representation and participation. First, the permanence of negative
   aspects of institutional design that were not made part of the
   constitutional reform. Second, hegemonic leadership by the President
   which serves as an obstacle to the institutionalization of the process.
   Third, the notion of the process as a revolution, which encourages
   polarization and feeds a game of absolute winners and losers.},

Abstract = {The establishment of the US Joint Task Force for the Horn of Africa at
   Camp Lemonier in Djibouti at the end of 2002 heralded a strong intention
   that international terrorists would be sought in the east of the African
   continent. This paper has as its central focus first-hand investigation
   work carried out in Kenya in the aftermath of the Ethiopian invasion of
   Somalia at the end of 2006. It seeks to address the way in which the
   various countries in the Horn of Africa operated with one another in
   order to carry out a process of secret detention and rendition in a bid
   to keep suspects beyond the law. This paper examines the way in which
   men, women, and children were detained, questioned, and transferred to
   other countries with the complicity of various African states and the
   acquiescence and help of Western allies. Many of the processes that were
   implemented derived from measures already seen elsewhere in the world,
   including the use of detention without charge or access to legal
   recourse, the use of chicken wire fencing to house detainees as in
   Guantanamo Bay, and the application of the legal innovation `enemy
   combatant' to those rendered. This paper shows that the conduct and
   practices of the United States in the War on Terror have been extended
   to the treatment of detainees in the Horn of Africa.},

Abstract = {Russia's war with Georgia highlighted the weaknesses of its armed
   forces. Recent reforms have sought to redress structural problems, but
   the political will needed to give Russia a modern, professional army -
   able to fight limited, regional wars - is still insufficient. Moscow
   needs to fully embrace the end of conscription, the integration of
   state-of-theart military hardware and wider political reform.},

Title = {Entrepreneurship in Peace Operations},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CIVIL SOCIETY},

Volume = {6},

Pages = {1-21},
Abstract = {A central question guides this article: To what extent can
   entrepreneurship be a force for change and transformation in war-torn
   areas? To address the question, this article introduces the topic of
   social entrepreneurship and illustrates how social entrepreneurs are
   serving as change agents in rebuilding and reconstructing areas
   devastated by conflict. The social enterprise of Kiva, the brainchild of
   social entrepreneurs Matthew Flannery and Jessica Jackley, provides an
   example. It is notable for its innovative idea-a Web-based,
   internet-facilitated micro-loan process that attracts individual
   investors worldwide in support of business entrepreneurs in the
   developing world. As a counter example to top-down, mandate-driven,
   organization-centric intervention strategies that many organizations
   pursue in peace operations, Kiva's enduring legacy may very well be its
   bottom-up, entrepreneur-driven, network-centric model of change. Its
   most salient features are: a supply chain that `contractually' connects
   all the partners in the loan process to minimize coordination problems
   and ensure that each step in the workflow sequentially adds value;
   processes and systems that guarantee work is transparent, efficient and
   accountable; a model of learning that enables global and local partners
   to co-create a complex, worldwide community-based learning system in
   support of entrepreneurship; and a rich network of social relations
   built from face-to-face and online interactions to help generate social
   capital needed for development.},

Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {17},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {217-234},
Abstract = {This article sets out a number of central questions which should be kept
   in mind in any discussion of the relationship of democracy and violence.
   Democracy aims at the exclusion of violence, and theoretically should
   render violence unnecessary, since all groups and individuals should be
   able to express their views and interests through a process of rational
   deliberation. Yet this is obviously not always the case. The democratic
   state, like any other, uses violence when necessary to maintain itself
   in existence and to resist those violent movements that reject
   democratic processes. The danger is that such use of violence may escape
   democratic control and undermine foundational rights which are
   supposedly being defended. Some contemporary democracies are challenged
   by violent movements, but these are in many cases expressions of a
   demand for recognition and inclusion. The question thus has to be probed
   of how democratic societies should respond to such challenges. It is
   suggested here that institutional reform and a new discourse of politics
   should be important elements of such a response.},

Title = {How Much Power to Tax do Regional Governments Enjoy in Spain Since the
   1996 and 2001 Reforms?},
Journal = {REGIONAL AND FEDERAL STUDIES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {20},
Number = {2},
Pages = {157-174},
Abstract = {From 1979 to 1983, a new intermediate level of government was created in
   Spain. This article focuses on the financial aspects of political
   decentralization in Spain. How much power to tax do the new regional
   parliaments and executives enjoy? What other sources of income do they
   dispose of? Which rules have been settled for regulating their tax and
   non-tax sources of income? Has fiscal decentralization affected fiscal
   discipline? Are these governments now financially autonomous? These are
   the questions addressed. The article shows that, with the exception of
   the Basque Country and Navarre, regional governments were financed
   mainly through intergovernmental grants during the 1980s and 1990s.
   However, as a result of several recent reforms, their power to tax as
   well as their financial autonomy has increased substantially since the
   mid-1990s, mainly through their participation by law in the revenues of
   several central taxes (known as ceded taxes) upon which they also enjoy
   significant regulatory rights. As the ceded taxes mechanism is not a
   simple revenue-sharing formula in Spain, the article concludes that the
   Spanish model departs from both the more uniform and top-down German
   model and the more heterogeneous and competitive one characterizing the
   taxing rights of the States in US federalism.},

   influential Theory of the State, Sociology and Political Science's
   Spanish researcher all along the two last decades of the XIXth century

   firstly examine his intellectual training under the krausism's influence
   and particularly that of Francisco Giner de los Rios and Gumersindo de
   Azcarate. Next, I analize his fruitful activity between 1893 and 1904 as
   a Professor at the University of Oviedo, where he not only wrote many
   important books, such as the ``Tratado de Derecho Politico{''}, his more
   outstanding work, but also carryied out a relevant activity of cultural
   divulgation. The following pages deal with his activity in the
   ``Instituto de Reformas Sociales{''}, from 1904 until 1924, and in the
   University of Madrid, as well as his collaboration with the ``Partido
   Reformista{''}. I finish this study including a few words about his life
   and work from the proclamation of the Second Republic until his dead,

Journal = {JOURNAL OF GENOCIDE RESEARCH},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {12},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {149-172},
Abstract = {This article traces the rise of humanitarian interventionist ideas in
   the US from 1991 to 2003. Until 1997, humanitarian intervention was a
   relatively limited affair, conceived ad hoc more than systematically,
   prioritized below multilateralism, aiming to relieve suffering without
   transforming foreign polities. For this reason, US leaders and citizens
   scarcely contemplated armed intervention in the Rwandan genocide of
   1994: the US `duty to stop genocide' was a norm still under development.
   It flourished only in the late 1990s, when humanitarian interventionism,
   like neoconservatism, became popular in the US establishment and
   enthusiastic in urging military invasion to remake societies. Now
   inaction in Rwanda looked outrageous. Stopping the genocide seemed, in
   retrospect, easily achieved by 5,000 troops, a projection that ignored
   serious obstacles. On the whole, humanitarian interventionists tended to
   understate difficulties of halting ethnic conflict, ignore challenges of
   postconflict reconstruction, discount constraints imposed by public
   opinion, and override multilateral procedures. These assumptions primed
   politicians and the public to regard the Iraq war of 2003 as virtuous at
   best and unworthy of strenuous dissent at worst. The normative
   commitment to stop mass killing outstripped US or international
   capabilities-a formula for dashed hopes and dangerous deployments that
   lives on in the `responsibility to protect'.},

Abstract = {This article examines the increasing complex interdependence of China
   and the United State in an era of globalization. Deng Xiaoping's
   strategy of reform and opening requires a peaceful international
   environment. The normalization of relations with Washington was critical
   for China's move toward modernization. As China opens its door wider,
   Sino-American relations have matured to a much higher level. As the
   recent Strategic Economic Dialogue between Beijing and Washington
   indicate, bilateral relations have become truly interdependent.
   Interdependence creates both sensitivity and vulnerability. Lampton has
   described U.S.-China relations in terms of ``same bed, different
   dreams{''} (tongchuang yimeng). Considering the common challenges of
   global financial crisis and international terrorism, perhaps it is more
   appropriate to think of China and the United States as strategic
   partners sailing in the same boat (tongzhou gongji). The complex
   interdependence between the two countries is particularly critical in an
   age of global turbulence. This article analyzes the current challenges
   of China-U.S. relations in the context of turbulent globalization.},

Abstract = {Among economists, there seems to exist an unfortunate lack of
   understanding of the complexities of war and violence and the effects on
   economy and society. The cost of the 2008/9 world economic and financial
   crisis, for example, amounted to a world GDP decline of much less than
   one percent in 2009-far smaller than the cost that violence imposes.
   This lack of understanding has created problems in the design of
   preconflict-, conflict-, and postconflict policies, leaving a sometimes
   unrecognized legacy of violence and loss. This essay deals with some of
   the economic issues involved.},

Abstract = {In 2001, Joanna Rajkowska, a Polish contemporary artist, made a trip to
   Israel, after which she decided to make people aware of the significance
   of Warsaw's Jerusalem Avenue {[}Aleje Jerozolimskie], one of the Polish
   capital's main streets. She intended to point out the street's history
   in a vacuum, as she claimed, caused by the absence of Jewish community
   after World War II. She ``planted{''} an artificial palm tree-in her
   view a plant typical of Jerusalem streets-in the middle of a major
   traffic circle in the center ofWarsaw. Even though Rajkowska made a
   project based on ``just{''} one of the forgotten pasts, it revealed a
   whole new potential for ``other{''} pasts in that particular space,
   which suddenly became impossible to be taken for granted as they had
   been before. Furthermore, the artist opened a new social space in which
   pasts were brought back to interact with the present. The palm quickly
   became the object and symbol of much more contemporary Polish struggles:
   for gay rights, for nurses' wages, for liberal values, and the right to
   think differently. Rajkowska's palmtree managed to bring these andmany
   other issues to the general public, to make it aware of the everyday
   inhabited space, to make that space visible-with all its ambiguities,
   different layers of meanings, interpretations of the past, and visions
   of the future-while transforming that very public along the way.},

Abstract = {In December 2010, the European Commission presented a strategy for the
   Danube. region. The goal is to improve the working, living, and
   environmental conditions in 14 countries. It is unclear on what basis
   the macro-region Danube was construed and whether this area is able to
   handle such a strategy. The connection to other strategies in the
   eastern partnership and the Black Sea synergy has not been worked out.
   But the strategy represents an approach to a new form of European
   governance. Its effectiveness will depend on whether the strategy
   succeeds in realizing some of its numerous activities.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the federal government's concessions before the
   Supreme Court of Canada that its own laws are unconstitutional under the
   Charter of Rights, marking the first time that concessions have been
   analyzed empirically in Canada. Using data from 1984-2004, the author
   finds that full concessions of unconstitutionality are exceptionally
   rare but that partial concessions are not uncommon. There is weak
   support for the hypothesis that governments are more willing to concede
   laws passed by previous governments of a different party, but, on the
   whole, the federal government appears committed to defending its laws in
   court. The author explores the implications of this for the relationship
   between the judiciary and the executive, including judicial activism,
   Charter dialogue and government use of the courts to advance policy
   goals.},

Abstract = {In examining the management of the foreign policy process, scholars have
   determined that variations in management style have implications for how
   the policy process is organized and how policy is deliberated. The
   research has been less attentive to how management varies depending on
   the issue area. This study examines the decision making of the Bill
   Clinton administration and compares the management of foreign policy on
   concurrent international economic and security issues. I find that there
   is little variation between cases in management style, but important
   differences within cases resulting from advisor influence and contextual
   factors. By examining the potential variations between issue areas, it
   is possible to better understand the connections between decision-making
   process, context, and the effectiveness of certain management styles.},

Abstract = {Political science research on agenda setting has been focused on how and
   why political agendas change over time. This article addresses the
   different but equally important question about how agenda setting
   actually matters to the policy outputs of national policy making. Do
   changes in the political agenda foreshadow changes in public policies?
   And does the effect of changes in the political agenda depend upon the
   policy preferences expressed by the mass public? Integrating research on
   policy agendas with well-established ideas about re-election-oriented
   representation, this article offers a new approach to the study of such
   agenda effects. Furthermore, it demonstrates the empirical validity of
   this approach using a Danish dataset of public opinion, public policy
   and the national political agenda spanning a quarter of a century and

Abstract = {The Colombian case offers a rare opportunity to observe effects of
   electoral reform where districting remains constant. Only the formula
   changed, from extremely `personalized' (seats allocated solely on
   candidate votes) to `listized': seats are allocated to party lists,
   which may be either open or closed. Electoral reform has effects on both
   the inter-party dimension (the number of parties competing) and the
   intra-party dimension (the extent of competition within parties).
   Consistent with theoretical expectations, the inter-party dimension
   features an increased number of parties in the low-magnitude districts
   and a decrease in the high-magnitude districts. On the intra-party
   dimension, the impact ``mirrors{''} the inter-party: less competition in
   smaller districts, yet more in larger districts. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {During the last two decades in Latin America, there has been
   configurated different kinds of presidentilism that obey the
   transformations that happen into the systems of the political parties
   due to the institutional reforms. Those reforms have been given by the
   electoral setting with the objective of achieve a mayor flexibility in
   the democratic institutions changing the relationship between the
   executive and legislative powers caused by the political allies in the
   multipartisan systems. Taking into account the last decade in Colombia,
   it makes part of the political cooperation with the raising and
   consolidation of one alliance which aloud the executive to govern during
   two terms consecutives. It is pretended during the whole article to
   analyze the impact level of the executive power in the raising and
   consolidation of the political alliance of the national issue which
   established in this country in this country from 2002 to 2010.},

Abstract = {We seek to increase our understanding of the role that individuals'
   assessments of schools, both locally and in the nation as a whole, play
   within a political context. Relying on data from the Phi Delta
   Kappa/Gallup Poll, we investigate how individuals' ratings of schools
   relate to their attitudes toward policy alternatives and public
   officials. We find that the relationship concerning these assessments
   and political judgments differs between parents and those individuals
   without school-aged children. Perhaps, most striking is the weak
   relationship between assessments of the nation's schools and parents'
   support for policy alternatives; instead, these attitudes are tied to
   their assessments of their local schools. When considering how well
   political officials have worked to improve education policy, the
   attitudes of individuals appear related to the grades that they assign
   the schools locally and in the nation as a whole.},

Abstract = {The Kremlin is moving closer to Latin America, not to establish an
   ideological or military competition with the United States, but a
   competition guided by considerations not new in Russian foreign policy,
   considerations that will prioritize pragmatism and mutual advantage.
   Russia attempts to increase its presence in Latin America through the
   signing of commercial, energy, and military agreements. Russia also
   advocates for the end of the unipolar world and considers that the
   hegemonic power of the United States is in decline. Moscow is taking
   advantage of this situation and establishing alliances in regions far
   away from its vital interests, such as in Latin America. The Russian
   military presence in Latin America is a precise response, as well as a
   direct message, to the government of the United States, which intends to
   deploy an antimissile shield in Eastern Europe, and to NATO, whose
   military bases are moving closer to the borders of the Russian
   Federation. The plan consists of increasing the Russian military,
   political, and economic presence in the zone so as to counteract the
   clout of the United States, liberating itself from isolation and
   increasing its international power and clout by using a balance of
   powers that openly benefits it.},

Abstract = {Since the early 2000s, Turkish foreign policy has experienced a
   fundamental transformation. Turkey's regional and global position, its
   relations with the countries in surrounding regions, and its
   long-lasting disputes with its neighbors were reshaped through the
   adoption of the ``zero-problem-with-neighbors{''} policy. In line with
   this policy, Turkey has taken a pro-active stance and followed a
   multi-dimensional foreign policy approach to establish itself, first, as
   a conciliatory partner for peace with its neighbors, and second, as an
   agent of mediation between its clashing neighboring countries. 2009 was
   a year of foreign policy initiatives towards Syria, Armenia, and Iraq,
   including the Kurdish Regional Government. And it marked the beginning
   of more positive and constructive relations between Turkey and the
   United States. Turkey gained substantial ground in becoming a regional
   hub for energy by undersigning two critical energy deals. Yet, two major
   issues remain as challenges for Turkish foreign policy: a) the EU
   accession process, and b) the Cyprus dispute.},

Abstract = {Scholarship on distributive politics focuses almost exclusively on the
   internal operations of Congress, paying particular attention to
   committees and majority parties. This article highlights the president,
   who has extensive opportunities, both ex ante and ex post, to influence
   the distribution of federal outlays. We analyze two databases that track
   the geographic spending of nearly every domestic program over a 24-year
   period-the largest and most comprehensive panels of federal spending
   patterns ever assembled. Using district and county fixed-effects
   estimation strategies, we find no evidence of committee influence and
   mixed evidence that majority party members receive larger shares of
   federal outlays. We find that districts and counties receive
   systematically more federal outlays when legislators in the president's
   party represent them.},

Abstract = {The rise of the dissident movement in the Soviet Union fed on the
   protest against the interrupted de-Stalinism. At the same time, the mere
   existence of dissidents was an indicator for the extent of change that
   had taken place after Stalin's death. The relinquishment of mass terror
   represented a true revolution from above. Originally, representatives of
   different ideological currents were to be found among the dissidents.
   Gradually, ideological disputes within the regime-critical camp
   increased in acrimony. Two basic currents crystallised. These harkened
   back to the 19th-century debate between the ``Westernisers{''} and the
   ``Slavophiles.{''}},

Abstract = {Authors and bloggers who publish on the Russian Internet occasionally
   cast themselves in the tradition of samizdat. Some do it in order to
   ennoble their own work. Others stylise themselves as the defenders of
   freedom in the struggle against legal norms and state encroachment in
   the Internet. If one uses samizdat not as of self-attribution but as
   analytical category, the similarities and differences between historical
   and digital samizdat can be seen. Both distinguish themselves by means
   of a potential resistance to control and censorship. Where
   accessibility, production form, distribution, and reach are concerned,
   the structural differences prevail. RuNet offers a space for
   self-articulation. It is not per se a space for the counter-public
   sphere, social criticism, or counter-culture.},

Volume = {2},

Pages = {423-450},

Abstract = {A comparison of two referendum campaigns on Europe in France and Ireland
   shows two different patterns of mobilisation. Focusing on the perceived
   influence of the European treaties on national legislation on abortion,
   two different types of Euro-scepticism can be discerned. One is settled
   in a potentially universal project of `enlightenment' (fearing the
   `criminalisation' of abortion due to EU (European Union) regulations),
   the other is concerned with the defence of the nation's democratic
   sovereignty against the EU (and fears `liberalisation' of abortion due
   to the same EU regulations). A discourse analysis of these two different
   settings establishes the `discursive dynamics' of each campaign: How
   were actors constituted (into `legitimate' actors) and how could the
   (differing) interpretations of EU treaty provisions become plausible and
   constitute into different national discourses? Instead of perceiving
   social variables (norms, rules, identities) as `independent' factors
   that explain outcomes, the social process of their constitution is at
   the centre of this analysis. Understanding how and when certain actors
   and certain topics (or problematiques) come into being (are
   `constituted') may, in turn, allow some `reasoned claims' on the
   character of popular Euro-scepticism.},

Journal = {BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {40},

Abstract = {Some scholars use the `dynamic representation' approach to test how much
   current policy changes reflect past public preferences. This article
   tests hypotheses derived from this approach in a left-right context for
   the United Kingdom from 1976 to 2006. This shows that government policy
   on the left-right scale shifts as public preferences change ('rational
   anticipation'). Secondly, a public with right-wing preferences elects
   the Conservatives, who pursue right-wing policies in office (electoral
   turnover'). However, popular incumbents are less likely to adjust their
   policy position to the public. The Westminster system is criticized for
   its weak link between the rulers and the ruled, but dynamic
   representation on the left-right scale in the United Kingdom seems to
   have functioned admirably in this period.},

Abstract = {Can Rawlsian theory provide us with an adequate response to the
   practical question of how we should proceed in the face of widespread
   and intractable disagreement over matters of justice? Recent criticism
   of ideal theorizing might make us wonder whether this question
   highlights another way in which ideal theory can be too far removed from
   our non-ideal circumstances to provide any practical guidance. Further
   reflection on it does not show that ideal theory is redundant, but it
   does indicate that there is a need for a non-ideal theory that does not
   consist simply in an account of how to apply the principles which are
   yielded by ideal theory to non- ideal circumstances in the light of what
   is feasible and an assessment of the costs of implementation. Indeed any
   non- ideal theory that can adequately address this question will have to
   be partially autonomous, drawing on a notion of legitimacy that is
   rather different to the one which lies at the heart of Rawlsian ideal
   theory.},

Abstract = {The growing empirical literature on political corruption shows trust
   (interpersonal and political) to be both cause and consequence of
   corruption: a conclusion that largely builds on studies using
   cross-national measures of corruption based on perceptions of corruption
   rather than actual experience, raising questions of endogeneity. The
   lack of trust fed by corruption is considered critical in that it
   undermines government efforts to mobilize society to help fight
   corruption and leads the public to routinely dismiss government promises
   to fight corruption. After disaggregating the major concepts, this
   article empirically explores the relationship linking corruption and
   trust in Mexico based on data from the 2004 Americas Barometer survey.
   The authors discover a powerful mutual causality between perceptions of
   corruption and trust in political institutions that suggests that
   rooting out perceptions of corruption or shoring up trust in public
   institutions will be an extremely difficult project for anyone who takes
   on the task.},

Abstract = {Recent debates in philosophy and critical theory have focused on a
   renewed concern with the work of Martin Heidegger. Thus, Alain Badiou,
   Slavoj Zizek, and Fredric Jameson have all debated the nature of
   Heidegger's legacy, albeit with differing assessments of his continuing
   relevance for an emancipatory critical discourse. This essay begins by
   exploring the thesis that there are at least two possible appropriations
   of Heidegger's work. One is derived from the existentialist
   phenomenology of the early Heidegger and is exemplified by the recently
   published collection of Herbert Marcuse's essays entitled Heideggerian
   Marxism; the other foregrounds a ``posthumanist'' Heidegger and
   culminates in the ``aleatory materialism'' of the later,
   ``post-Marxist'' Louis Althusser. After examining the differentiated
   nature of Heidegger's philosophical legacy for Marxism, the essay
   focuses on the more ``local'' level of aesthetic theory in his essay
   ``The Origin of the Work of Art,'' which provides the basis for a
   ``re-ontologization'' of aesthetics, emphasizing the role of art as a
   ``dynamic of human activity.''},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This article develops, illustrates, and defends a conception of immanent
   critique. Immanent critique is construed as a form of hermeneutical
   practice and second-order political and normative criticism. The common
   charge that immanent critique is a form of philosophical conventionalism
   necessarily committed to value relativism and to the rejection of
   transcultural and cosmopolitan norms is denied. But immanent critique
   insists that meaningful and potentially efficacious criticism must be
   connected to relevant criteria and understandings internal to the
   culture or social order at which the criticism is directed. The
   complaint that this demand will likely limit political and moral
   criticism is also denied, and the ability of immanent critique to
   develop from convention unconventional thinking is defended and
   demonstrated.},

Abstract = {Northern Ireland's 2010 Westminster election saw the dramatic unseating
   of the First Minister, Peter Robinson, from his East Belfast seat by the
   cross-community Alliance Party. Beyond the headline scalp, the
   Democratic Unionist Party and Sinn Fein continued to dominate the
   Unionist and Nationalist electoral blocs, with Sinn Fein holding its
   five seats. This success raised the outside possibility of Sinn Fein
   providing the First Minister after the 2011 Assembly elections, although
   Unionists appeared likely to minimise such a risk through electoral
   pacts or even party mergers. The 2010 election highlighted the failure
   of the Ulster Unionist Party's (UUP) alliance with the Conservative
   Party, an association which cost the UUP its remaining Westminster seat.
   Meanwhile, despite some excitable chatter regarding amelioration of
   Northern Ireland's sectarian voting patterns and Alliance's unexpected
   success, aggregate constituency data suggest that the link between
   religion and party affiliation remains as strong as ever. The

Abstract = {Commonly countries around the world view nuclear development in a
   negative light; that is threatening to national security. The nuclear
   disaster that happened on August 1945 in Japan, sacrificing over 200,000
   lives and the explosion at Chernobyl nuclear plant in Ukraine on 26
   April 1986 has drawn the attention of world community on the consequence
   of nuclear as energy resource (Ku Seman Ku Hussain, 2005). In actual
   fact, nuclear is an energy source providing positive impact to economic,
   politics and progress of a nation. Unfortunately, nuclear resources had
   been misconstrued and have become one of the factors that led Third
   World countries development process rate to lag behind developed
   countries. The spread of nuclear energy resources to Third World
   countries especially countries in the Asia-Pacific region at the moment
   is as a result of world community's awareness with interest and concern
   in developing nuclear energy as an alternative energy resource. The
   successful of several Develop Countries such as Japan and Third World
   countries such as South Korea, Brazil, India and Pakistan who have
   developed their own nuclear power have change the perception of the
   other Third World countries about the importance of nuclear power. This
   scenario brought effect and provides an opportunity to Malaysia to start
   paying attention on nuclear energy resource development.},

Abstract = {Fiscal equalization is a key political issue in many federal countries,
   including Canada. Yet, relatively few scholars have paid systematic
   attention to the political dimensions of Canada's federal equalization
   program. Taking an historical and institutionalist perspective, this
   article explores the politics of equalization policy in Canada, with a
   focus on the mid-2000s, a period when equalization policy suddenly
   became a major source of intergovernmental conflict. The main objective
   of the article is to explain why and how such political struggles over
   equalization developed. The explanation focuses on four factors: (i) the
   importance of executive discretion over the equalization program; (ii)
   the ``inter-state{''} nature of Canadian federalism; (iii) the
   concentration of non-renewable natural resources in certain provinces;
   and (iv) the perceptions that surround the program.},

Journal = {POLITICAL BEHAVIOR},

Volume = {32},

Abstract = {Citizens generally try to cooperate with social norms, especially when
   norm compliance is monitored and publicly disclosed. A recent field
   experimental study demonstrates that civic appeals that tap into social
   pressure motivate electoral participation appreciably (Gerber et al., Am
   Polit Sci Rev 102:33-48, 2008). Building on this work, I use field
   experimental techniques to examine further the socio-psychological
   mechanisms that underpin this effect. I report the results of three
   field experiments conducted in the November 2007 elections designed to
   test whether voters are more effectively mobilized by appeals that
   engender feelings of pride (for reinforcing or perpetuating social and
   cultural values or norms) or shame (for violating social and cultural
   values or norms). Voters in Monticello, Iowa and Holland, Michigan were
   randomly assigned to receive a mailing that indicated the names of all
   verified voters in the November 2007 election would be published in the
   local newspaper (pride treatment). In Ely, Iowa voters were randomly
   assigned to receive a mailing that indicated the names of all verified
   nonvoters would be published in the local newspaper (shame treatment).
   The experimental findings suggest shame may be more effective than pride
   on average, but this may depend on who the recipients are. Pride
   motivates compliance with voting norms only amongst high-propensity
   voters, while shame mobilizes both high- and low-propensity voters.},

   2004 Brian Costar and Jennifer Curtin examined the rise of independents
   and noted that independents `hold an allure for an increasing number of
   electors disenchanted with the ageing party system' (p. 8). This paper
   provides an overview of the current representation of independents in
   Australia's parliaments taking into account the most recent election
   results. The second part of the paper examines trends and makes
   observations concerning the influence of former party affiliations to
   the success of independents, the representation of independents in rural
   and regional areas, and the extent to which independents, rather than
   minor parties, are threats to the major parities. There have been 14
   Australian elections at the federal, state and territory level since
   Costar and Curtain observed the allure of independents. But do
   independents still hold such an allure?},

Abstract = {This is a revised version of a talk I gave on 25 August 2009 to the
   Department of Government at Uppsala University when I received the Johan
   Skytte Prize. In it, I make a number of assertions about contemporary
   politics and those who currently practice the discipline of political
   science that I am convinced are correct, but have not documented with
   proper references. This will not please hardcore positivists, but either
   there exist no apposite quantitative sources of proof or the
   observations seem (to me) to be so qualitatively obvious as not to merit
   confirmation. Needless to say, I alone am responsible for all errors or
   omissions and welcome any assistance in discovering them.},

Title = {From consociational consciousness to majoritarian myth: Consociational
   democracy, multi-level politics and the Belgian case of
   Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde},

Volume = {45},

Abstract = {The Belgian federal system is consociational par excellence, most
   notably concerning the regional-linguistic cleavage where
   non-majoritarian conflict resolution through elite accommodation is
   institutionalised. Although they hold a majority in parliament,
   Dutch-speaking political parties have to compromise with French-speaking
   parties on issues of state structure and reform. However, in the case of
   the split of the electoral district of Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde,
   Dutch-speaking parties - after years of dealing with the issue in a
   typical consociational way - started to follow a majoritarian logic,
   first in their discourse, later also in their actions. While this
   threatened political stability, it did not bring a solution, because of
   the constitutionalised consociational logic. This raises the question of
   what brought these parties to act according to a logic of
   majoritarianism while they function in an institutional context of
   consociationalism. After outlining the core non-majoritarian features of
   consociationalism and their institutionalisation in the Belgian federal
   system, the article analyses the case of BHV in this light and attempts
   to explain the paradoxical behaviour of Dutch-speaking political
   parties. It notably concentrates on two core explanations: the perverse
   effects of the consociational logic itself and the disconnection of
   regional and federal election dates in Belgium. The article concludes
   that Belgium's specific combination of consociationalism and multi-level
   politics hinders the federal system's functioning. Acta Politica (2010)

Abstract = {Theories on committee power assert that legislators self-select to
   committees and therefore have preferences regarding the policy issues
   under the committees' jurisdictions that differ from the preferences of
   noncommittee members. 1 argue that preference outliers may be shaped
   both by processes of self-selection and by endogenous processes within
   committees. Contrary to previous examinations of committee member
   preferences, the study utilizes a dynamic approach to examine the
   development of preferences over time in order to separate self-selection
   from endogenous processes. Analyzing the development in the spending
   preferences of 859 Danish local politicians over three different
   election periods, I find that politicians increasingly prefer spending
   on their committees' jurisdictions over time, but their preferences do
   not change to the same extent on policy issues beyond their committees'
   jurisdictions. The findings point to the importance of endogenous
   processes in committees. Hence, committees may be outliers for very
   different reasons than those proposed by mainstream theory.},

Abstract = {This article examines the capacity of regional trade agreements (RTAs)
   to assist and foster democracy in their respective regions. While the
   principal raison d'tre of RTAs is to stimulate economic growth among its
   member states, several regional trade associations have embedded
   democratic requirements into their governance documents. These
   requirements elevate democracy to a fundamental value of the
   associations, and mandate (in most instances) that both current and
   candidate members possess and uphold democratic political systems and
   practices. This article examines the regional impact of democracy
   requirements in trade blocs by exploring four leading RTAs: the European
   Union, NAFTA Mercosur, and ASEAN. The article finds that the ability to
   promote democracy is impacted by three primary RTA characteristics: (1)
   the material benefits of membership; (2) the intensity of political and
   economic integration among member states; and (3) the level of
   democratic consolidation exhibited by member states.},

Abstract = {With data from census of the United States of America (US) and Spain,
   this article compares the occupational and household structures of the
   Dominican and Ecuadorianpopulation in both countries. The main purpose
   of this work is to investigate (I) if the differences in the degree of
   feminization of the migratory flows towards both countries are related
   to the job market demand and (II) if this has had implications in the
   household structures of these migrants. The results suggest that the job
   market characteristics of the country of destiny might be behind the
   gender composition of the migratory flows to Spain and the US. In
   relation with the households, the female presence in complex households
   without a core is bigger in the collectives with more female presence.
   These differences are maintained when control variables are introduced,
   such as age, years of residence and the educational level of the
   migrants.},

Title = {Exploring the Relationship between Video Game Ratings Implementation and

Journal = {POLITICS \& POLICY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {38},

Pages = {705-735},

Abstract = {Video game regulation is intended to lessen the potentially negative
   effects of games by limiting children's access to age-inappropriate
   games. Self-regulations, such as the current rating system, could also
   encourage manufacturers to reduce sexual and violent content in an
   attempt to avoid ratings that would limit their potential buyers. The
   purpose of this article was to determine if the implementation of the
   Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) was associated with changes
   in game content. A content analysis of video game magazine articles
   released before and after the establishment of the ESRB ratings
   determined that violent content and some sexual content increased
   nonsignificantly until 2004, when these elements became significantly
   more extreme. Other sexual content increased in early years but was
   stable after the adoption of the ratings system. Because manufacturers
   did not dramatically alter game content after the 1994 rating system
   came into effect, they may also be unlikely to change the content if the
   ratings system is modified in the future.},

Abstract = {Since the `industrial society', labor has become one of the structuring
   fundaments of society and social identity. Industrial capitalism
   consolidated a new labor relationship, the wage relationship. However,
   the year 1975 can be taken as the apotheosis of the wage labor society.
   The implementation of neoliberal model in Argentina has produced the
   crisis of the wage labor. In this context, the citizens have looked for
   new ways of subsistence in order to deal with this crisis. Then is when
   new associative ways concerning to work appear, and a particular one:
   the recovered companies.
   So we wonder: the rupture of wage labor as main vector of identity,
   implies a crisis of worker's identity? Can labor remain its centrality
   in the structuring of identity?
   We'll focus on the narrow relationship between new social identity
   constructions and new associative ways concerning to work. We'll take
   the recovered companies as paradigmatic case and analyze a test case.},

Journal = {POLITICS \& POLICY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {38},
Number = {4},
Pages = {653-676},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Although frequently invoked as a rhetorical tool in political
   discussions, ``political will{''} remains ambiguous as a concept.
   Acknowledging the centrality of political will to policy outcomes, the
   authors propose a pragmatic and systematic approach to definition. This
   approach facilitates analysis by identifying particular shortcomings in
   political will. This identification in turn permits the application of
   appropriate theoretical frameworks from various disciplines and the
   effective construction and use of ameliorative measures. The authors
   also address fundamental issues like the specification of contexts. The
   analytical approach includes a conceptual definition dissected into
   essential components, along with corresponding means of
   operationalization and targets for assessment. Among the major
   definitional components are requirements that a sufficient set of
   decision makers intends to support a particular initiative and that such
   support is committed. The latter condition is difficult to ascertain,
   but various signals, influences, and constraints on action are
   observable.},

Abstract = {The question of Judith Butler's `politics' and their normative
   justification has been raised by critics and supporters alike for some
   time. The number of recent texts dedicated to this topic suggests that
   it remains an unresolved and still pressing question. I argue that in
   order to identify and evaluate the political implications of Butler's
   work, we must first recognize the relationship and distinction between
   four vectors of her thinking: her diagnosis of the human condition, her
   expression of specific normative aspirations, her defense of a distinct
   ethical comportment and finally her theory of political engagement. 1
   conclude that Butler implicitly counsels the cultivation of certain
   ethical dispositions, including generosity, humility, patience and
   restraint, as part of a practice of preparing to engage in a kind of
   politics that breaks radically with the mastery- and sovereignty-seeking
   variety all too familiar to us in contemporary times. Contemporary

   deficits and expenditures, as well as weaker evidence that these effects

Abstract = {Inequality in Britain today is now so deep that the top 10 per cent own
   100 times more than the bottom 10 per cent, yet there is remarkably
   little public concern or anger about poverty. Indeed, compassion and
   concern for the poorest in society has actually declined in recent years
   due to the continued, and even increased, prevalence of the view that
   poverty is largely caused by laziness and lack of willpower, or is
   simply an unavoidable fact of modern life. Either way, many people
   tacitly accept that `the poor will always be with us'. Moreover, much of
   the British public believes that there are sufficient opportunities to
   succeed for those who try hard enough, and also that it is the middle
   class which actually struggles the most, economically or financially.
   These assumptions are highly conservative in their ideological and
   political implications because they limit public support for
   egalitarianism and extensive wealth redistribution from rich to poor.},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {To respond to the charge of context-insensitivity, discourse ethics
   distinguishes justification discourses, which only require that we
   consider what is equally good for all, and subsequent application
   discourses, in which the perspective of concrete others must be adopted.
   This article argues that, despite its pragmatic attractiveness, the
   separation of justification and application neglects the coconstitutive
   role that applicability plays for the meaning of normativity. Norms that
   do not, in a machine-like fashion, produce their cases, cannot already
   contain their appropriateness to the cases that nonetheless alone
   justify the existence of norms in the first place. The higher-order norm
   of appropriateness that enters normativity with the dependence on
   applications is one that remains implicit, and impossible to determine
   in advance. Thus, the justification of a norm is always incomplete for
   conceptual and not merely empirical reasons, as fallibilism typically
   has it.},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {An important disconnect exists between the current use of formal
   modeling and applied statistical analysis. In general, a lack of linkage
   between the two can produce statistically significant parameters of
   ambiguous origin that, in turn, fail to assist in falsifying theories
   and hypotheses. To address this scientific challenge, a framework for
   unification is proposed. Methodological unification leverages the
   mutually reinforcing properties of formal and applied statistical
   analysis to produce greater transparency in relating theory to test.
   This framework for methodological unification, or what has been referred
   to as the empirical implications of theoretical models (EITM), includes
   (1) connecting behavioral (formal) and applied statistical concepts, (2)
   developing behavioral (formal) and applied statistical analogues of
   these concepts, and (3) linking and evaluating the behavioral (formal)
   and applied statistical analogues. The elements of this EITM framework
   are illustrated with examples from voting behavior, macroeconomic policy
   and outcomes, and political turnout.},

   Results confirm that remittances will continue diminishing along 2011,
   showing a pro cyclical behavior, not finding evidence of a possible

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {72},
Number = {3},
Pages = {880-893},

Abstract = {When do government agencies invite public review for their policy
   decisions, and when do they maintain secrecy? Scholarship has long
   focused on procedures elected officials impose on bureaucrats to induce
   transparency and to encourage democratic participation in agency work.
   Yet, models of elected officials' decisions largely overlook
   bureaucrats' preferences and choices for public participation. Building
   on theories of bureaucratic reputation, I argue bureaucrats actively
   pursue publicity and public participation for tasks that risk
   implementation failure. I test these claims through models of FDA
   advisory committee agenda setting and subsequent policy implementation
   from 1985 to 2006. Consistent with bureaucratic reputation hypotheses,
   the FDA seeks public advice for its riskiest tasks. Such advice is
   associated with a lower probability of subsequent Congressional
   oversight and with a greater probability of subsequent agency
   information campaigns. Publicity, this suggests, complements secrecy as
   a source of bureaucratic power.},

Title = {Counting Congress In: Patterns of Success in Judicial Nomination
   Requests by Members of Congress to Presidents Eisenhower and Ford},
Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICS RESEARCH},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {38},
Number = {4},
Pages = {691-717},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The power to nominate and confirm federal judges is shared by Congress
   and the president, yet few works explicitly address the role that
   Congress plays in shaping the preselection pool for judicial nominees.
   In this article, we illuminate this debate by exploring judicial
   nomination requests from Members of Congress to the Eisenhower and Ford
   Administrations. In explaining who is nominated, the characteristics of
   the nominee matter more than the characteristics of the nominator, with
   the party affiliation of a nominee being the strongest predictive
   factor. Institutional characteristics are more prevalent at the
   confirmation stage, where the Senate relied more heavily on its members
   and the judicial experience of nominees than did presidents in
   nominating them. Given our results, partisanship appears to have
   mattered earlier than presumed in judicial nominations, with even
   ostensibly nonpartisan presidents such as Eisenhower understanding the
   importance of appointing like-minded individuals to lifetime positions
   on the bench.},

Abstract = {The proposals to develop the Western Economic Triangle (WET) region into
   the fourth growth pole in China are ambitious; realization will be
   problematic. Although the local governments are overwhelmingly
   optimistic regarding future development, it is very unlikely that this
   region can become as powerful and vibrant as the eastern growth engines
   in the near future. Implementation of the proposals faces at least two
   serious challenges. First, the WET region has historically suffered from
   poor accessibility due to backward interregional transportation
   facilities. Second, the WET region is governed by three different
   administrative municipalities. The inherent lack of regional integration
   and coordination will restrict industrial cooperation within this
   region.},

   hand, open seat elections historically have been close and less affected
   by retrospective considerations. Moreover, partisanship, ideological
   polarization, and contested nominations in both parties inclined the
   electorate to an even division. McCain's more centrist record and
   Obama's race also seemed to favor the Republicans. Taken together, these
   factors set the stage for a closely decided election. It was shaping up
   that way in the polls until the Wall Street meltdown hit in
   mid-September. It was the ``game changer{''} that tipped the election to
   Obama.},

Volume = {62},

Pages = {84-104},

Abstract = {The UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples now represents
   the minimum international standard on indigenous rights. A qualitative
   analysis of state responses to this emerging indigenous rights regime
   produces some curious results, including state compliance,
   noncompliance, under-compliance, partial compliance, and also a pattern
   of `over-compliance' in indigenous rights. Over-compliance, a
   counter-intuitive behaviour in international relations, occurs when a
   state's legal or policy behaviour exceeds its treaty or international
   normative commitments. New Zealand and Canada both demonstrate such a
   pattern of indigenous rights over-compliance. A comparative case study
   of these two over-compliant states demonstrates that over-compliance in
   indigenous rights occurs when several conditions develop and intersect
   to propel a state towards a state-centric model of reconciliation. The
   article argues that Canada and New Zealand are over-compliant in
   indigenous rights not because they are necessarily progressive in
   indigenous rights but because they are actually resisting the emerging
   indigenous rights discourse.},

Abstract = {Criticism of trends in political science centers on specific
   methodologies-quantitative methods or rational choice. However, the more
   worrisome development is scholasticism-a tendency for research to become
   overspecialized and ingrown. I define that trend more closely and
   document its growth through increases in numbers of Journals, organized
   sections in the American Political Science Association, and divisions
   within the APSA conference. I also code articles published in the
   American Political; Science Review to show a growth in scholastic
   features in recent decades. The changes affect all fields in political
   science. Scholasticism serves values of rigor. To restrain it will
   require reemphasizing relevance to real-world issues and audiences. To
   do this should also help restore morale among political scientists.},

Abstract = {Globalization and Americanization have often been intertwined and
   interchanged in the French political discourse. This article explores
   whether and how the election of Sarkozy, and then of Obama, are
   transforming this equation. The French obsession with globalization and
   Americanization was temporarily appeased at the time of the 2007
   election, which enabled Sarkozy to come to power. Yet the French
   rapprochement with the US, at least on economic issues, is not so clear
   as has often been portrayed. However, the past couple of years have
   shown that globalization no longer equals Americanization. This should
   help mitigate the strains put on the Franco-American relationship by the
   world financial crisis.},

Number = {2},

Abstract = {Although few studies have explored the link between emotion and
   political talk, here I argue that political disagreement depolarizes
   emotional reactions via information exchanged in social networks.
   Analyzing data from the ANES 2008-2009 Panel Study, several conclusions
   are drawn. First, disagreement increases negative emotions and decreases
   positive emotions toward the in-party candidate, and also increases
   positive emotions and decreases negative emotions toward the out-party
   candidate. In other words, disagreement depolarizes emotions toward
   political candidates. Second, the affective impact of disagreement does
   not vary with political knowledge. Finally, positive emotions toward the
   out-party candidate and negative emotions toward the in-party candidate
   reduce political interest, candidate issue placement accuracy, and
   political participation. Overall, this study develops important
   theoretical connections between affect and political talk that have
   implications for the value of political disagreement.},

Volume = {32},

Abstract = {Nearly a half-century ago, E.E. Schattschneider wrote that the high
   abstention and large differences between the rates of electoral
   participation of richer and poorer citizens found in the United States
   were caused by high levels of economic inequality. Despite increasing
   inequality and stagnant or declining voting rates since then,
   Schattschneider's hypothesis remains largely untested. This article
   takes advantage of the variation in inequality across states and over
   time to remedy this oversight. Using a multilevel analysis that combines
   aspects of state context with individual survey responses in 144
   gubernatorial elections, it finds that citizens of states with greater
   income inequality are less likely to vote and that income inequality
   increases income bias in the electorate, lending empirical support to
   Schattschneider's argument.},

Abstract = {The EU represents a new and complex political system which, according to
   numerous social scholars, suffers from the so-called democratic deficit.
   The basic argument behind this claim is that citizens lack control of
   the EU because, within its political system, national parliaments of
   member states possess only limited powers which have not been adequately
   compensated through steady empowerment of the European parliament (EP).
   Starting from this notion, the paper will explore the application of
   various concepts of democracy within the political system of the EU.
   First and foremost, it will analyse representative democracy in the EU,
   which stands as a foundation of all contemporary democratic systems.
   However, the paper will not stop at representative democracy, but it
   will also look at participatory, direct and deliberative democracy as
   applied within the political system of the EU. These concepts of
   democracy can only be viewed in relation and as an addition to
   representative democracy, but their application is very important for
   the EU due to limited possibilities for developing representative
   democracy at the supranational level. The paper will argue that, with
   regard to participatory and deliberative democracy, the EU can be viewed
   in many respects as a showcase for the national level, because it
   successfully developed various mechanisms related to implementation of
   these concepts. Particular attention will be paid to the Lisbon Treaty,
   which clarified many uncertainties that previously burdened the
   application of democracy within the EU. It will be argued that with the
   Lisbon Treaty the classic argument about the EU's democratic deficit
   lost some of its appeal, because this treaty transformed the EP from
   secondary to equal participant in the EU's legislative process.},

Abstract = {In Ukraine, there is no coordinated network of geriatric care. Old
   people are given medical care and welfare assistance within the general
   facilities of the health system. But in terms of organisation and
   personnel, they are inadequately set up to work with patients needing
   geriatric care. Especially in rural areas, older people suffer from a
   lack of care. It is necessary to strengthen the health of the older
   population through better care and rehabilitation so that they could

Title = {Anti-corruption Policy in Croatia: Benchmark for EU Accession},

Year = {2010},
Volume = {47},
Number = {5},
Pages = {69-95},

Abstract = {In this article the author analyses the anti-corruption policy in
   Croatia as part of a wider awareness-rising process in transition
   countries. After the collapse of Communism, corruption spread quickly in
   post-Communist countries as a result of exogenous factors such as the
   export of corruption by the most developed countries seeking to find new
   markets, and endogenous factors such as hasty privatization and the
   creation of new political elites caught in the web of various conflicts
   of interest. In Croatia the situation was exacerbated by the war itself
   and war speculations and profiteering, followed by a corruptive
   privatization and lack of anti-corruption standards in the political
   culture of the country. Croatia had to adopt, on its way to European
   Union membership, a set of concrete measures countering the spreading of
   political corruption throughout the society. An important role was,
   thus, played by European Union conditionality requesting an integral
   approach to the pathological phenomenon of corruption. The author argues
   that such an integral approach has not yet been achieved due to the
   reduction of political corruption mostly to bribe and graft, while more
   sophisticated forms of political corruption have not been tackled yet,
   such as party clientelism, cronyism, electoral fraud and trading in
   influence. Therefore the author invokes the results of a comprehensive
   approach to political corruption as done by contemporary political
   science in the world, and advocates the formulation of a comprehensive
   anti-corruption code that would eliminate the dispersion of
   anti-corruptive legislation in numerous acts and redundancy that
   obfuscate the action of political actors in combating corruption. Here
   the role of the European Union is tantamount because it sets very tough
   standards based on a wide investigation of political corruption in
   Croatia at all levels, especially in the highest echalons of political
   life. An anti-corruption strategy as well as concrete action plans in
   combating corruption became part of the benchmarks, a third generation
   conditionality standards elaborated by the EU, and Croatia had to comply
   to them and build the society's capacity to deal with political
   corruption in a more efficient way, thus eliminating ambiguity and
   hesitancy that could harm the political actors in power.},

Abstract = {We argue that citizens distinguish the tone of a campaign from the
   quality of information that it provides and that evaluations on each
   dimension respond differently to positive and negative political
   advertising. We test these claims using survey and advertising data from
   the 2000 presidential campaign and two 1998 gubernatorial races. In each
   race, citizens separate judgments about the tone of a campaign from
   judgments about the quality of information they have received.
   Furthermore, negative campaigning affects the former, but not the
   latter, set of evaluations. These results have implications for the
   debate over the impact of negative advertising and for how citizens
   perceive campaigns as political processes.},

Abstract = {How do NGOs affect political participation in weakly democratic
   settings? We know that NGOs can be an important part of moderate civil
   society by building trust, facilitating collective action, and
   encouraging voter turnout. This paper explores these relationships in
   weakly democratic settings. NGOs stimulate political participation by
   providing resources and opportunities for association. Where voting is
   seen as ineffective, new participation can take the form of political
   protests and demonstrations. This paper presents results from an
   original local level dataset from Bolivia on NGO activity, voter
   turnout, and political protest, showing a strong relationship between
   NGO activity and political protest in weakly democratic contexts.},

Abstract = {The empirical literature in comparative politics holds that social
   cleavages affect the number of candidates or parties when electoral
   institutions are `permissive', but it lacks a theoretical account of the
   strategic candidate entry and exit decisions that ultimately determine
   electoral coalitions in plural societies. This article incorporates
   citizen-candidate social identities into game-theoretic models of
   electoral competition under plurality and majority-runoff electoral
   rules, indicating that social group demographics can affect the
   equilibrium number of candidates, even in non-permissive systems. Under
   plurality rule, the relationship between social homogeneity and the
   effective number of candidates is non-monotonic and, contrary to the
   prevailing Duvergerian intuition, for some demographic configurations
   even the effective number of candidates cannot be near two. Empirical
   patterns in cross-national presidential election results are consistent
   with the theoretical model.},

Abstract = {Talking about pension policy, we may instantly mention a situation that
   is similar to this one: year after year, a professor asks the same
   question, but he changes the answer. The need for serious reform does
   not tell us anything about which reforms should be undertaken in a
   particular country. This article attempts to present the impact of the
   recent crisis on the pension system and briefly signify the main
   problems. The situation we encountered in recent years had already
   warned us of the instability of the pension system. Pension policy in
   this paper is used as an example because the crisis and pension policy
   of today have at least one thing in common - unstable foundation that
   eventually will lead to bigger problems. In the context of shock and a
   bad financial situation, the system will be confronted with financial
   loads in both short-term and long-term periods. Considering the presence
   of global crisis sentiment, that has assumed a higher proportion by now,
   many countries have begun to implement some unpopular measures of
   pension reform. It is necessary to emphasize the long-term results and
   consequences of these reforms, but also to eliminate the misconception
   that they can completely solve the current problems.},

Abstract = {Despite being the subject of much recent scholarly work, torture remains
   an ambiguous concept. As recent legal arguments have made clear such
   vagueness has important and immediate political consequences. This
   article makes a number of contributions towards resolving this
   ambiguity. First, it argues that the distinction between physical and
   psychological abuse is unwarranted. Second, it puts forward a logical
   basis for the distinction between torture and legally permissible
   punishments like incarceration. Third, it distinguishes between torture
   and related concepts like cruelty or sadism by stressing the
   instrumentality of torture. Ultimately torture is defined as the
   systematic and deliberate infliction of severe pain or suffering on a
   person over whom the actor has physical control, in order to induce a
   behavioral response from that person. Polity (2010) 42, 131-155.

Abstract = {This article focuses on the products of governance in Scotland and the
   UK, considering policy documents, public announcements and press
   releases and examines these outputs to consider the presence of
   Britishness within the institutions, agencies and other groups that
   govern in Scotland. It is our contention that Britishness, and the idea
   of Britain, is increasingly absent within the discussion, operation and
   outputs of governance in Scotland, despite the best efforts of the
   current British Government to entrench a sense of Britishness within the
   socio-political realm. By focusing on aspects of specific policy areas,
   such as citizenship in education and the railways within transport, this
   article will illustrate that the banal emphasis of governance within
   Scotland is not on Britishness but on Scotland and Scottishness. The
   end-result of such a focus, whether it be intentional or not, is the
   increasing differentiation of Scottishness from other British
   identities. Such findings pose serious questions for the political
   organisation and operation of the UK.},

Abstract = {When should burdened social practices be granted special accommodation?
   One issue of concern-raised by Okin and others-is that some social
   practices involve domination, and so the accommodation of those
   practices might (inadvertently, perhaps) support social injustice.
   Suppose one wants to take this concern very seriously. Starting from the
   assumption that freedom from domination is an especially important
   value, this article examines whether cultural accommodation would ever
   be advisable. Approaching the problem of multicultural accommodation
   from this point of view greatly clarifies the debate and yields some
   interesting results. In particular, the discussion concludes that there
   are circumstances under which the goal of minimizing domination itself
   would be furthered by policies of special accommodation.},

Abstract = {Civil war is usually examined from the perspective of commitment
   problems This approach provides considerable insight regarding which
   civil war agreement provisions reduce the chance of renewed fighting
   Yet, additional insight can be gamed by examining information
   asymmetries as a potential cause of civil war recurrence. We argue that
   significant uncertainty regarding military capabilities may persist
   after fighting ends and that this uncertainty may lead to the breakdown
   of peace However, carefully designed peace agreements can guard against
   renewed civil war by calling for in monitoring, making the belligerents
   submit military information to third parties, and providing for
   verification of this information Our empirical analysis of 51 civil war
   settlements between 1945 and 2005 shows that these provisions
   significantly reduce the risk of new civil war Encouraging the adoption
   of these provisions may be a useful policy in the international
   community's effort to establish peace m civil-war-torn societies.},

Journal = {PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {63},
Number = {2},
Pages = {266-285},

Abstract = {This article examines whether the promotion of British values is
   desirable, feasible or even permissible within Northern Ireland. Here,
   the advocacy of Britishness may be seen as threatening or offensive to a
   minority community whose political representatives desire the diminution
   of symbols of Britishness in order to encourage Irish nationalists to
   participate in political institutions. The promotion of British history,
   culture and belief systems may carry little remit among a nationalist
   community which more readily identifies with Irish versions of each of
   these features and may see the Irish, not British, government as the
   custodian of its interests. Moreover, the promotion of Britishness
   within Northern Ireland has historically been distinct from that found
   elsewhere in the UK. First, it has often been `bottom-up', marked by
   ostentatious symbolism in response to the constitutional uncertainty
   which has beset the region. Secondly, Britishness has often taken on
   particular characteristics, such as Protestantism and Orangeism. In
   examining how the Westminster government and Northern Ireland executive
   have responded to these challenges, the article explores the constraints
   upon the promotion of Britishness in Northern Ireland. Any such project
   is necessarily confined to one side of the binary divide, a unionist
   community hardly in need of the assertion of its British identity, while
   it risks antagonising those holding an Irish identity. Given this, it is
   unclear how, if at all, the assertion of British values can be
   formulated on a UK-wide basis, when Northern Ireland remains an area of
   exceptionalism.},

   features underlying the writing of Brazilian Jorge Amado in the first
   half of the twentieth century. Stresses that the most remarkable aspect
   of this production was in the construction of a new image of people and
   popular culture, the high proportion expressions that came from the new
   meaning that was beloved of the lumpen-proletariat class},

Abstract = {A number of Europeanization scholars maintain that accession to the
   European Union (EU) provides non-state actors with new opportunities to
   strengthen their position in the opportunity structure, even in areas
   where there is no clear EU policy or law-exerting pressure from above.
   However, to date there has been little research focusing on whether
   non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Central and Eastern Europe have
   been able to use the EU in this way. In order to address this gap, this
   article considers whether, how and to what effect Polish women's rights
   organizations have deployed four types of EU political resource: arenas,
   policy instruments, funding programmes and points of reference. The
   research question is analyzed through two different case studies: one on
   equality in the workplace, where there is a strong EU competence, and
   one on sexual and reproductive health and rights, where there is no EU
   competence. The case studies find that the use of EU resources did
   empower these organisations domestically, but to a lesser extent than
   expected, particularly where there was no EU pressure from above. In
   areas where the EU offers the greatest opportunities it also imposes
   constraints. Acta Politica (2010) 45, 136-157. doi: 10.1057/ap.2009.27},

Abstract = {This study aims to analyses the new social policy directions of the
   ruling Justice and Development Party (JDP). JDP which gained the power
   in the 2002 general election won also the 2007 general elections and the
   2009 local elections overwhelmingly. It is known that workers,
   wage-owners, peasants and the poor give important support to this party.
   At the beginning, it sounds strange that on the one hand the party has
   market-friendly and market-society approach and on the other hand it
   gains support from those who are victims of the market-friendly policy.
   JDP executes not only conventional social policy tools but also focuses
   on new kind social policy. Main features of this social policy are
   conservatism, philanthropy and charity. They have attracted electors who
   were ruined by market-oriented policies. Moreover, these aid mechanisms
   are irregular, and they can be open to malpractices and political
   corruption. Finally, they may create clientelistic relations between
   citizens and the power.},

Volume = {40},
Number = {1, SI},

Abstract = {This essay explores the relationship between the war on terror, the rise
   in presidential power, and the unprecedented nature of the Dick Cheney
   vice presidency, which is generally recognized as America's most
   influential vice presidency. Whereas historically the second office
   often had been dismissed as too feeble, the Cheney vice presidency
   sometimes was attacked as too robust. Although the events of 9/11 and
   the subsequent war on terror certainly contributed in important ways to
   the rise of presidential and vice presidential power during the
   presidency of George W. Bush, both developments were under way and would
   have occurred, although differently, had al-Qaeda never attacked the
   United States. The author attributes Cheney's influential vice
   presidency in large part to a confluence of factors relating to Bush and
   Cheney that predated 9/11. The essay suggests that these factors
   produced a unique vice presidency that, for most of Cheney's tenure,
   allowed Cheney to escape conventional sources of vice presidential
   accountability.},

Abstract = {I respond to the foregoing essays and take up an ambivalent defense of
   Hirshman's argument. While agreeing with various points the contributors
   make, I highlight the fact that women's choices are still made under
   conditions of oppression that shape not only the options women have, but
   the desires themselves that shape their choices. Recognizing oppression
   as a social phenomenon allows feminists to accept a wider range of
   individual choices than we might think acceptable under the feminist
   umbrella, but it also requires a distinction between making a feminist
   choice and offering feminist support for choice.},

Abstract = {The relation between poverty or distribution injustice and human rights
   is dimensional, but either the acceptance of this relation or the human
   rights, especailly socio-economic rights, themselves are problematic.
   Therefore we meet highly debateful area where various ideas and
   discussions come into being. In this article I tried to give, to some
   extend, some ideas about these debates and approaches as well as some
   problems in these discussions. For instance, in spite of huge
   discussions there are severe limitations of these debates on this
   extended and not well-defined problem. The considerable limitation is
   that most of the discussions do not refer the poverty to the current
   economic system and policies. Yes, meeting with the phenomenon like the
   increasing the poverty as well as the richness gives way the
   ``dicovering{''} of the poverty again, especially by the international
   organizations; however it is preferred not to see it as the problem of
   the globalized capitalism, or the neo-liberal policies. With this
   approach, ``human aid{''} becomes the essential remedy. Even for them
   who look at the problem as the violation of human rights, the main
   matter turns to the increasing of the international aids. In brief, I
   tried to emphasize in this article that the global poverty must be
   understood as the global economic injustice mainly caused by the
   dominant economic system and while the dominant understanding is far
   from coming to this point it is worty of remark to discuss the problem
   in this framework.},

Abstract = {Using survey data from three Polish parliamentary elections, we provide
   the first systematic micro-level test contrasting a standard
   incumbency-based model of economic voting with a transitional economic
   voting model in the post-communist context To do so, We introduce a
   novel temporal component to micro-level Studies of economic voting that
   supplements standard short-term retrospective economic evaluations (e g,
   ``do You feel the economy has improved in the past 12 months?{''}) with
   longer ``transitional{''} retrospective economic evaluations (e g, ``do
   You feel the economy has improved since the Collapse Of communism?{''})
   Our analyses reveal a nuanced picture Suggesting multiple paths for
   economic Influences Oil voting in Poland We find evidence Consistent
   With the standard incumbency-based approach, but only for the specific
   set of evaluations to which the theory is most appropriately applied
   short-term retrospective economic evaluations and the vote for
   Incumbent. parties By contrast. the transitional model is strongly
   supported by evidence that evaluations Of changes in economic conditions
   since the collapse of Communism ({''}long-term economic evaluations{''})
   have all effect oil the vote for a range of parties We demonstrate as
   well that these results are robust to model specification and

Title = {Why do small states have big governments?},
Journal = {EUROPEAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {2},
Number = {1},
Pages = {49-71},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Building on the literature on public finance, this article explores the
   consequences of political scale for government spending. The central
   argument is that the tendency for small political units to have big
   governments is not merely the result of economies of scale in the
   provision of public goods, but a reflection of the greater pressures for
   public spending faced by politicians in smaller and more homogeneous
   political units. The importance of such political pressures relative to
   other influences on spending is assessed on the basis of subnational
   data by comparing the relationship between size and spending under
   democracy and dictatorship. To the extent that government expansion is
   driven by citizen demands, the impact of size on spending may be
   expected to be more pronounced under democratic than authoritarian
   governance. Results from a time-series cross-sectional analysis of
   growth in government spending are consistent with this expectation.
   Government growth is shaped not only by the population size of political
   units but also by the interaction between regime and size. Analysis of
   spending patterns under democratic rule further indicates that size is
   an important determinant of spending even after controlling for
   variations in citizen preferences, political institutions, electoral
   competitiveness, and economic performance. The results have important
   theoretical implications for the study of fiscal policy and democratic
   governance around the world because they suggest that political scale
   conditions the linkages between citizens and the state, creating widely
   varying incentives for government growth across differently sized
   political units.},

Title = {Cross-cutting Cleavages and Ethnic Voting: An Experimental Study of

Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {104},
Number = {1},
Pages = {21-39},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Social scientists often attribute moderation of the political salience
   of ethnicity in ethnically diverse societies to the presence of
   cross-cutting cleavages that is, to dimensions of identity or interest
   along which members of the same ethnic group may have diverse
   allegiances. Yet, estimating the causal effects of cross-cutting
   cleavages is difficult. In this article, we present experimental results
   that help explain why ethnicity has a relatively minor political role in
   Mali, an ethnically heterogeneous sub-Saharan African country in which
   ethnic identity is a poor predictor of vote choice and parties do not
   form along ethnic lines. We argue that the cross-cutting ties afforded
   by an informal institution called ``cousinage{''} help explain the weak
   association between ethnicity and individual vote choice. The
   experimental research design we introduce may be useful in many other
   settings.},

Abstract = {Does ethnicity matter for explaining violence during civil wars? I
   exploit variation in the identity of soldiers who conducted so-called
   ``sweep{''} operations (zachistki) in Chechnya (2000-5) as an empirical
   strategy for testing the link between ethnicity and violence. Evidence
   suggests that the intensity and timing of insurgent attacks are
   conditional on who ``swept{''} a particular village. For example,
   attacks decreased by about 40\% after pro-Russian Chechen sweeps
   relative to similar Russian-only operations. These changes are difficult
   to reconcile with notions of Chechen solidarity or different tactical
   choices. Instead, evidence, albeit tentative, points toward the
   existence of a wartime ``coethnicity advantage.{''} Chechen soldiers,
   enmeshed in dense intraethnic networks, are better positioned to
   identify insurgents within the population and to issue credible threats
   against civilians for noncooperation. A second mechanism prior
   experience as an insurgent may also be at work. These findings suggest
   new avenues of research investigating the conditional effects of
   violence in civil wars.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes critically the appeal the unpolitical is enjoying
   among contemporary political philosophers who are democracy's friends.
   Unlike a radical critique of democracy, what I propose to call
   ``criticism from within,{''} takes the form of dissatisfaction with the
   erosion of an independent mind and impartial judgment per effect of the
   partisan character of democratic politics. This paper proposes three
   main criticisms of the actual trend toward unpolitical views of
   democracy: the first points to the strategic use of deliberation as an
   antidote against democratic procedures themselves (like voting and
   majority rule); the second to the negative conception of democracy that
   the unpolitical aspiration makes visible; and the third to the
   dissolution of political judgment within a model of judgment that is
   tailored around justice.},

Journal = {AFRICAN JOURNAL ON CONFLICT RESOLUTION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {10},
Number = {3},
Pages = {123-146},
Abstract = {The study examines the modalities for integrating traditional and modern
   conflict management strategies in Nigeria using an analysis of relevant
   documents as well as Black's Social Control Theory and Thomas-Kilmann's
   Model of Conflict Management. The successful amalgamation of diverse
   groups has radically shifted from being a platform for peaceful
   coexistence to an arena of violent conflicts due to the matrix of social
   inequality and the state attempts to undermine the power of traditional
   social control systems. The police and military have been used to
   suspend several violent conflicts in Nigeria, but they have been unable
   to build peace despite their coercive power. The social structure and
   deep-seated grievances that generate violence have not been addressed
   and the crowding out of traditional methods of social control from
   official policies has left room for escalation of violent conflicts. The
   most disturbing of these conflicts are ethno-religious and
   resource-control conflicts, which have both resulted in monumental
   destruction of peoples and properties and exposed different parts of
   Nigeria to crisis. It is argued that a policy-driven synergy of useful
   traditional and modern strategies for conflict management will result in
   lasting peace in Nigeria.},

Number = {1},
Pages = {1-18},
Abstract = {Political science students learn the fundamental principles and values
   about the American political system from American government/politics
   textbooks. Most of the major textbooks used in these courses utilize the
   traditional institutional and behavioral approaches to the study of
   American government and politics, which examines institutions and
   processes from a hegemonic perspective with emphasis being placed on the
   political actors who dominate these institutions. As a result, the
   struggles of nondominant groups are not treated as integral in American
   historical development or political experience. Situated in a literature
   review of similar studies, we use content analysis to examine
   visualizations of African Americans in 27 circulating introductory
   American Government/Politics textbooks to ascertain whether these
   illustrations reinforce or argue against traditional, hegemonic coverage
   of politics. To test our hypotheses, we sampled 27 circulating
   introductory American Government/Politics textbooks published from 2004
   to 2007. Our findings support previous studies to indicate continued
   hegemonic coverage of politics, but with lessening concentration.},

Abstract = {The publication of Small Worlds in 1980 constituted a landmark in the
   study of Canadian politics. This contribution re-assesses the central
   findings of regional similarity and convergence in opinion preferences
   on public policy as observed in the original chapter by Richard Simeon
   and Donald Blake. Using public opinion data from the past 30 years,
   three central findings emerge: the presence of non-trivial levels of
   regional variation in public policy preferences; policy preference
   heterogeneity tends to be comparable to or greater than differences
   based on other socio-demographic features of Canadian society, and;
   regional preference heterogeneity since 1980 has increased and remains
   prominent even when separating out the effects of the Quebec issue. As a
   result, the contribution concludes that region is an important source of
   heterogeneity in Canadians' public policy preferences.},

Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Pages = {307-316},
Abstract = {In the first decade of the twenty-first century, politics and everyday
   life in the Netherlands became polarized, under the influence of several
   conservative and populist movements that reflected a growing distrust of
   government and `politics as usual', and a xenophobic and cultural
   conservative attitude towards migrants and migration, more specifically
   of Muslims and Islam. Politics took on the shape of a cultural war. This
   article studies the ways in which Dutch government policy tried to cope
   with this polarized condition by reshaping its cultural policy. The
   article focuses on the reorganization of the Council for Culture that
   advises the government on issues of culture and the arts. In a series of
   advisory reports the Council introduced new conceptions of citizenship
   in which the cultural dimension is highlighted and the role of new media
   and of transnational cultural developments is put forward as crucial and
   unavoidable. It is shown how this new cultural policy tries to do
   justice to the new cultural condition by covering five changes in the
   field of cultural policy: the shift from edification to participation;
   the shift from an instrumentalist to an more intrinsic definition of
   culture; a shift from multiculturalism to a politics of difference and
   experiment; the transnationalization of national politics; and the
   redefinition of the concept of Dutch culture.},

Abstract = {The financial crisis that currently threatens the stability of global
   capitalism is the latest in a long line of similar episodes stretching
   back some 200 years. While many orthodox economists explain the crisis
   in terms of the failure of the proper operation of the market mechanism,
   radical accounts see crisis as an aspect of the constitution of capital
   and of the process of the accumulation of capital itself. This article
   explores the extent to which Marx's understanding of accumulation and
   crisis can provide the basis for a general theory of capitalist crisis.
   It concludes that the growing and chronic separation between financial
   (fictitious) accumulation and productive accumulation is the key to
   understanding the latest crisis of capital expressed as a global credit
   crunch. Furthermore, Marx opens the door to the development of an
   overtly `political' theory of crisis stressing the `capitalist use of
   crisis' as a means for the violent reassertion of the fundamental class
   relation.},

Abstract = {Although European reconciliation of work and family life policies were
   at the beginning driven by a clear compromise with equal opportunities
   between men and women, in the last decade they have been mainly
   developed as part of the European employment policy. The objetive of
   those policies has thus turn into the promotion of a ``dual earner{''}
   society, that is, a full employment society in which both men and women
   participate in paid employment. Given the diversity of countries which
   shape the European Union, this political objetive must have different
   implications for every country. It obviously demands a greater policy
   effort in the Mediterranean countries, whose welfare regimes have been
   characterized by the backwardness of their welfare policies, by their
   familiarism and by their low female employment rates. The aim of my
   article will be precisely to describe and assess the reconciliation of
   work and family life policies implemented Italy and Spain during the
   last decade, taking into account their defamiliarizing impact.},

   to success in this conflict: winning the support of the population there
   requires a combination of both approaches in a complementary way to

Volume = {4},

Pages = {36-55},
Abstract = {This article examines the use and impact of an array of established and
   emerging digital media on the 2008 Alberta provincial election. Based on
   data collected from a range of methods, we explore the application of
   digital media by candidates focusing on the role of digital media in
   overcoming the media access gap between the dominant political party and
   other oppositional parties (democratization). As a source of comparison,
   data from the 2008 national election is employed. The article argues
   that the evidence supporting democratization is weak. Although there are
   indications that digital media is one area of campaigning that suffers
   from the lowest gap in rates of adoption and use different political
   parties and actors, we identify structural, human and financial factors
   that advantage the dominant parties' access to both conventional and
   digital media. This appears significant given the electoral success of
   the ruling Progressive Conservative Party, and the continued decline in
   voter participation. The inability of digital media to reinvigorate
   Alberta democracy lies in political, historical, social, and economic
   factors.},

Title = {The Tasks of Keynesianism Today: Green New Deals As Transition Towards a
   Zero Growth Economy?},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {32},
Number = {2},
Pages = {173-191},
Abstract = {The world economy today is facing the juncture of two simultaneous
   crises: the deepest recession since the end of World War Two and an
   unprecedented world ecological crisis. Does Keynesianism offer viable
   ideas to face this combined crisis, alternative to the neoliberal
   policymaking that has prevailed during the last thirty years?
   Historically, if viewed from a longer-term perspective, the form of
   Keynesianism that has predominated, is military Keynesianism, defined as
   macro-economic policymaking by capitalist governments aimed at
   stimulating aggregate demand for goods. Thus deficit spending was
   already applied by the British government when it competed with other
   European states to gain world hegemony, in the late 17th and the 18th
   century. Again, whereas for a limited period of time after World War
   Two, a civilian type of Keynesianism has `coexisted' with military
   Keynesianism, especially in Western Europe, - the military form of
   Keynesianism has clearly prevailed in the era of globalization,
   especially in the US. Keynesianism offers possibilities for a shift from
   current policymaking, but only if its mode of application is radically
   different from its historical modes. An ecological Keynesianism needs to
   fulfil both a social criterion - promotion of employment - and an
   ecological standard - countering capitalism's inherent tendency to
   destroy its natural surroundings. Three examples of an ecological
   Keynesianism initially come to mind: the state's use of transfer and
   investment measures so as to accelerate the shift from reliance on
   fossil fuels towards reliance on renewable energy; state intervention to
   discourage incineration of waste, and to enhance reliance on recycling;
   and conversion of military production facilities into units which
   produce for the sustenance of life on earth. The significance of these
   shifts can be illustrated by employing a model of social reproduction
   that diverges from Marx's and Keynes'. Yet while an ecological
   Keynesianism does offer ample possibilities to address today's combined
   crisis, the given policymaking needs to be understood as transitional. A
   solution to the world's ecological crisis is only possible via the
   transition towards a stationary state - a zero growth economy at the
   world level which protects the interests of the global South.},

   Elections},
Journal = {AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {45},
Number = {3},
Pages = {425-436},
Abstract = {In November 2008, voters in Victoria participated in local government
   elections under a system that has been subject to significant reform
   since the 1980s. This paper seeks to discern trends from the outcomes
   and identify significant structural features of the reformed system.
   With regards to outcomes, the paper highlights the high success rate
   amongst incumbent councillors and the strong sense of successful
   candidates being independent of political parties. The paper argues that
   these outcomes have been particularly influenced by the proliferation of
   electoral districts with relatively small voting populations or by the
   use of multimember electoral systems in larger districts. The variety of
   systems used underpins a localised and `clientelist' politics that
   militates against the dominance of political parties over the contest.
   The paper also draws attention to the comparatively low rate of voter
   participation in an election in which compulsory voting applies. It
   argues that voter absenteeism was particularly noticeable in
   municipalities with large numbers of residents renting properties and
   might be explained as a form of `renters' illusion' impacting on voting
   behaviour.},

   genocide in Central America},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GENOCIDE RESEARCH},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {12},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {219-241},
Abstract = {This article analyses selected cases of mass killings and genocide
   during the civil wars in El Salvador and Guatemala in the 1980s and the
   way in which the truth commissions in both countries reframed locally
   grounded narratives to fit the state-centred language of human rights.
   Redefining wrongdoings as human rights violations produces stories that
   communicate poorly with local worldviews because the `truths' that human
   rights language proposes disregard local realities and transform local
   conflicts into a type of `modern', nationwide struggles. Thus, while the
   concept of genocide might capture well the horrendous nature of a mass
   killing, it will also ethnify the conflict. Comparisons between local
   readings and human rights-based reinterpretations reveal a `modernizing'
   or `Westernizing' bias of international law; the article argues for more
   awareness about such effects in analysis as well as in policy-making.},

Abstract = {The city-region is a relatively new concept for South Africa, although
   the model has been growing in other parts of the world for more than a
   decade. The concept cannot be separated from scalar restructuring in the
   context of neo-liberalizing globalization. This generates economic,
   social and governance contradictions which throw open new spaces for
   contestation. The logic of the Gauteng city-region is strongly shaped by
   the National Spatial Development Framework, which emphasizes economic
   agglomeration and concentrated investment in high potential nodes. While
   the model remains open to contestation from below, the lack of organized
   formations at the grassroots level means that it is taking the direction
   of bipartite arrangements between state and capital. As a result, its
   implementation threatens to reinforce inherited spatial patterns and
   inequalities.},

Abstract = {Better Government for Older People: this ambitious project to involve
   older citizens in the improvement of policies affecting them, celebrated
   its tenth anniversary in 2008. Then the Government decided to close it
   down, setting up an Advisory Forum as an alternative. BGOP's
   considerable achievements were widely recognised (and acknowledged in
   the DWP review by John Elbourne) but there were real shortcomings.
   BGOP's previous history is summarised, with special reference to its
   work with the Older People's Advisory Group. Some activists and
   observers believe BGOP's weaknesses could and should have been remedied,
   but the Government decided to start again. There are strongly opposed
   interpretations of why this happened. Former BGOP staff and OPAG members
   have since set up ChangeAGEnts, a Co-operative charity, to continue
   their work. The specific issue is intrinsically and demographically
   important, but it also throws light on consultation in many other policy
   areas.},

Journal = {POLITIQUE EUROPEENNE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {32},
Number = {3},
Pages = {99-123},
Abstract = {The diversity of expertise' situations in the European Commission's
   Directorate-General for Agriculture and Rural Development invites to
   keep off a normative conception of experts and expertise. From a deep
   fieldwork in two agricultural sectors, tobacco and beet, the article
   analyzes the functioning of two specific groups: experts committees and
   advisory groups, in the DG Agri. These groups are composed indistinctly
   of ``experts{''}, but their profile and their missions are completely
   different. In comparing the running of advisory groups, the article
   shows how these kinds of groups function as real socialization units.
   Experts internalize cognitive systems and suitable behaviors, which
   correspond to the way that public action must be at the European level.
   For ``sugar experts{''}, the technicity range is completely internalized
   whereas the tobacco experts are stigmatized, and refuse to adopt ``the
   good{''} norms and behaviors. The technicity and the scientificity of
   debates made it a rule and disqualify the others types of speeches. In
   other words, the European commission develops his capacities of
   production and of prescription of norms and standards of public action,
   by the functioning of experts groups.},

Journal = {CONTEMPORARY POLITICS},

Pages = {101-118},
Abstract = {This article argues that deliberate and unintentional external
   influences play both direct and indirect roles in advancing non-liberal
   democratic political rule. Specifically, it identifies four key external
   factors whereby Russia has strengthened Central Asia's authoritarian
   rule: the diffusion of ideas and norms; the growing use of economic and
   cultural power; the minimal but strategic use of hard power; and the
   development of regional organizations. The article shows how Russia has
   consolidated and further entrenched authoritarianism by mapping its
   impact on the strength of Central Asia's regimes2its management of
   political contestation, use of coercion, containment of civil society,
   and degree of legitimacy. Through `regional authoritarian learning',
   Russia has also strengthened its own autocracy. The conditions conducive
   to the advance of authoritarianism include the `receptivity' of ideas
   and practices, the provision of benefits (financial or legitimacy), and
   perceived threats to regime survival.},

Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},

Volume = {33},
Number = {1},
Pages = {118-135},
Abstract = {This article examines gender mainstreaming as a paradigmatic example of
   the EU's new modes of governance, which have involved a shift away from
   the classical method of integration (the `Community Method'). It
   considers the form and significance of this atypical policy instrument,
   introduced as a `new' instrument to revitalise a policy deemed
   inadequate since the beginning of the 1990s and as an alternative to the
   regulatory and corrective tools of equal treatment and equal
   opportunities. It also investigates the ambiguous impact of gender
   mainstreaming on the evolution of the gender equality policy. The
   institutionalisation of this soft and flexible instrument has induced
   profound changes in the content, scope and nature of the EU gender
   equality policy. From a specific regulatory policy on discrimination
   against women it has become a softer and more diverse policy ranged
   against a broader spectrum of discrimination.},

Abstract = {This article questions the claim that the way German governments have
   responded to Muslim demands for accommodating Islam fits a German
   national model. The empirical focus is on Islamic religious instruction
   in five German Lander. The evidence presented shows that there is not
   one but several German models. Lander with Christian Democratic
   dominance were more supportive of confessional religious instruction
   than Lander where the left was stronger. At the same time Christian
   Democrats initially were more reluctant to extend the privilege of
   religious instruction to Muslim groups. In Lander where Article 7 III of
   the German constitution applied, corporatist hurdles were an obstacle
   for Muslim groups, but this was less the case in Berlin. Religion-state
   institutions are important for understanding how European countries have
   dealt with the growing presence of Islam, but it is equally important to
   understand the politically contested nature of these institutions.},

Abstract = {The case study discusses Ottoman deportation policies against Armenians
   between April and September 1915 in the province of Aleppo and in the
   region of Zeitun. Focusing on the role of the provincial authorities,
   4th Army commanders, and the central government the article questions
   notions of an alleged Armenian revolt, claims about a coherent
   deportation policy according to a blue print, and assertions of a
   unified Committee of Union and Progress leadership. It will become clear
   that the first deportations were initiated locally and not by the
   central government. Moreover, later deportations met often with
   resistance by provincial and military authorities who followed own their
   agenda. Consequently, theses suggesting long-term genocidal planning and
   its coherent execution at all levels of government empire-wide need to
   be revised.},

Title = {WHEN AND WHY DO HEDGEHOGS AND FOXES DIFFER?},
Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {22},
Number = {4},
Pages = {415-426},
Abstract = {Philip E. Tetlock's finding that ``hedgehog{''} experts (those with one
   big theory) are worse predictors than ``foxes{''} (those with multiple,
   less comprehensive theories) offers fertile ground for future research.
   Are experts as likely to exhibit hedgehog-or fox-like tendencies in
   areas that call for explanatory, diagnostic, and skill-based
   expertise-as they did when Tetlock called on experts to make
   predictions? Do particular domains of expertise curtail or encourage
   different styles of expertise? Can we trace these different styles to
   childhood? Finally, can we nudge hedgehogs to be more like foxes?
   Current research can only grope at the answers to these questions, but
   they are essential to gauging the health of expert political judgment.},

Journal = {POLITIX},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {23},
Number = {92},
Pages = {167+},
Abstract = {The article starts with the following observation: in western
   democracies, ethnography of the place of politics in everyday life is
   unusual. Why is it the case? The given answer returns in the existence
   of the ideal picture of the ``good citizen{''} in social science
   literature: an individual who regularly forges in himself his own
   opinions and values from what he hears and sees. This norm explains at
   the same time that political scientists consider to be natural to
   question the people about the supply of ideas which they are supposed to
   have in mind, and the absence of direct observation: how to see thoughts
   without questioning the one who has them? In finale, the article tries
   hard to go up in what an ethnographic approach would allow to break with
   this perspective, that is to say to return their real places in
   indifference for politics as in social embedding of political
   participation.},

Abstract = {Since the nineties of the last century Spanish Public Administrations
   are embedded in a process of transformation that affected not only their
   internal structures but also their forms of action through the citizens.
   In this context of change, information and communication technologies
   (ICT) have emerged as fundamental references to design administrative
   modernization policies.
   This article analyzes the Municip@ Project, the latest multilevel
   cooperation initiative enhanced by the Community of Madrid (CAM) in
   order to promote and develop eGovernment in municipalities fewer than
   20,000 inhabitants. In particular, we will expose the different aspects
   of Municip@, the background and the implementation (phases, activities,
   implementation period and actors involved). Final aims are the detection
   of the key elements of the project, its degree of implementation in the
   different municipalities and the mismatch in its external dimension (the
   provision of electronic public services to citizens through the
   municipal websites) in the first year of operation of this innovative
   measure (2006-2007).},

Abstract = {British operations in Helmand province, Afghanistan, have been
   contextualised within the theory and practice of counter-insurgency. The
   theories of Sir Robert Thompson are held to represent the basis for
   successful counter-insurgency campaigning. This analysis takes the
   simple premise of posing the question as to whether British conduct in
   Helmand between 2006 and 2008 has represented the effective utilisation
   of Thompson's principles. Evaluating the evolution of British operations
   on the ground this analysis suggests that while the influence of
   Thompson's thinking can be clearly detected, in practice the
   implementation of his precepts have been undermined and negated by a
   variety of factors, most notably the weaknesses of the government of
   Afghanistan. The result has been an ever-greater focus on the
   prosecution of the military campaign to the exclusion of the
   multifaceted programme advocated by Thompson. In conclusion, it may be
   contended the campaign in Helmand does not resemble the ideals outlined
   by Thompson or, indeed, much of an effective counter-insurgency plan.},

Title = {The third sector and political ideologies: unpacking relations between
   organized civil society and the state},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Pages = {273-287},
Abstract = {In talking about ideologies, an outside view of Germanywill commonly
   resort to Nazism and/or Communism. However, in discussing the third
   sector, neither of thesewill offer adequate reasoning for the
   present-dayembeddedness of the sector. On the contrary, since both were
   destined to be historically surpassed, the former after only 12 years,
   they can present interesting case studies on the relationship between an
   independent sector and a totalitarian regime rather than put the sector
   in historical and societal perspective. The purpose of this paper,
   therefore, is to show that present-day analyses of civil society
   inGermany that do not embrace a longer term historical viewpoint of
   German society will not achieve an adequate explanation for the complex
   relationship between organized civil society and the state. This
   approach reflects a basic unhappiness with a ` boxing approach', i. e.
   the attempt to reach a `one nation-one civil society tradition' system,
   and therefore attempts to differentiate by using a critical historical
   methodology based on political theory rather than an empirical approach
   that would tend to blend out an historical viewpoint. Our central
   argument is that while at first sight corporatist embeddedness seems to
   exist, in fact, widely divergent role models and traditions of third
   sector organizations can be distinguished.},

Abstract = {This article is a study of political pragmatism in the American and in
   the Russian political thought. Political epistemology articulated. in

   governance of their country and putting an end to many intractable
   problems, including racial discrimination, poverty, and the paranoid
   logic of cold war policy. To understand why participatory democracy was
   so short-lived. the author argues that one must trace its intellectual
   origins to the pragmatists who in the late 19th and early 20th centuries
   laid the foundations for this ethos.},

Volume = {39},

Abstract = {Communicative competencies have always been essential resources for
   political leaders' success both in spheres of political negotiation and
   decision-making as well as in public arenas of political presentation.
   Exchanges with external reference groups and followers particularly ask
   for adequate strategies of political communication; all the more since
   mass media and new media have rapidly been expanding over the last years
   while ``classical{''} intermediary powers have been confronted with
   dealignment processes and alienated citizens. Against the backdrop of
   such fundamental transformations in the media and sociocultural
   environment political leadership has become more and more dependent on
   communicative and performative tasks. Yet, there are variations in the
   way such obligations are interpreted depending on political actors'
   personality and institutional contexts. Those contexts are somewhat
   special on the regional level. This becomes obvious when we empirically
   look at individual modes of regional political communication which this
   article offers for the first time. In addition to a typology it provides
   individual and institutional explanations for variations in the way
   political leadership develops in regional arenas of political publics.},

Abstract = {A growing body of research has noted the role of electoral governance as
   an increasingly important factor in facilitating credible electoral
   outcomes in newly democratized states. This article examines how public
   opinion of electoral governance institutions is shaped within a
   particular country and context. Using the data from the Mexico 2006
   Panel Study, I find that public opinion of Mexico's primary electoral
   governance institution, the Instituto Federal Electoral (IFE), is
   explained via individual assessments of the particular candidates for
   the Mexican presidency in the 2006 elections, partisan identification,
   citizens' views on democracy, and other socio-demographic variables.
   These findings raise important questions regarding citizens' views on
   the primary institution of electoral governance in Mexico.},

Abstract = {In this beginning of the xxist century, the trade unionism knows a
   paradoxical situation. On one hand, it is appearing as a central actor
   of the professional regulations and generating an abundant literature.
   On the other hand, all the countries know a slope of his affiliates for
   a decade. The mutations of the capitalism transform the sociological and
   cultural foundations of the trade unionism. Nevertheless, the crisis of
   the trade unionism is more important and more ancient in France where it
   is characterized by a serious and persistent weakness and by an extreme
   fragmentation of his organizations. But, in spite of an increasing
   difficulty to support and to renew his affiliates, the trade union forms
   differ according to the countries. They are influenced by the traditions
   and national experiences. In the international trade unionism, France
   plays a relatively singular score which putting in spatial and
   historical perspective to describe the first outlines. A brief
   presentation of the theories of the trade unionism makes clear that this
   diversity has influenced the way of theorizing the trade union fact.
   These approaches show up the specificities of the French case, the role
   plaid by the State, the peculiarities of his organization, the
   importance of his crisis of representation and his original
   participation both in the social dialogue and in the joint management as
   well as the new challenges that represent the transformations of the
   labor world and the European construction.},

   Zionist thought. A real intellectual revolution were achieved in the XIX
   th and XX th centuries, which returns up side down the antique,
   mediaeval, and even early modern paradigms of Jewish time perception. It
   is precisely this reversal that led to the political activism and the
   foundation of state of Israel.},

Title = {Political party assistance in transition: the German `Stiftungen' in
   sub-Saharan Africa},
Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {17},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1225-1249},
Abstract = {Despite the fact that the German Stiftungen (political foundations) were
   the first international institutions to work in the field of political
   party development, their party assistance has been neglected in
   political party research for a long time. Remarkably little is known
   about the approaches, strategies and results of their activities. This
   contribution explores the role of the Stiftungen and their party
   assistance approaches in the various stages of the democratization
   process. It explicitly traces the self-declared ambitions of the German
   Stiftungen, and it explores the extent to which their party assistance
   activities take account of the various stages of the democratic
   transition process and of the level of party institutionalization, or
   simply follow abstract, generalized and preconceived ideas. The study
   develops a `phase model of party assistance' in the transition process
   and examines the party assistance activities in two illustrative cases -
   the Friedrich-Ebert Stiftung (FES) in Kenya and in South Africa - in
   seven dimensions of party institutionalization: (1) level of
   organization, (2) internal party democracy, (3) political programme, (4)
   autonomy, (5) roots in society, (6) coherence, and (7) regional and
   international integration.},

Journal = {AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {45},
Number = {2},
Pages = {277-283},
Abstract = {This article explores the events before and during the 2009 Queensland
   election which saw the Bligh Labor Government returned far more easily
   than commentators and opinion polls had indicated. This election remains
   especially noteworthy for its groundbreaking firsts, including the first
   election of a woman state premier, and the first election for
   Queensland's single, merged Liberal-National Party. The article
   concludes that Anna Bligh's then-popular leadership, Opposition leader
   Lawrence Springborg's alleged poor grasp of economic realities, and
   fears of job losses during the global financial crisis were the prime
   motivators of swinging electors' vote choice.},

Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {17},
Number = {3},
Pages = {442-464},
Abstract = {In the September 2008 Legislative Council election, Hong Kong's
   democrats managed to retain their veto position in the political reform
   process. Now, the democrats face the dilemma of what to do with
   Beijing's 2007 plan for Hong Kong's democratization. According to the
   plan, the people of Hong Kong could see the direct election of the chief
   executive and the entire legislature in 2017 and 2020, respectively.
   Although the plan is not perfect, Hong Kong's pan-democratic camp may
   need to adopt a negotiated approach, given the current political reality
   and the balance of power between local democrats and Beijing. It is
   suggested here that there is room for negotiation in the latter's reform
   plan. If some moderate democrats are willing to pursue a negotiated
   strategy, Beijing's political reform plan for Hong Kong stands a
   significant chance of being approved. Recent developments in Hong Kong
   indicate that such a prospect could indeed materialize.},
