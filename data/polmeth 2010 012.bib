   FUNCTION},
Journal = {POLITICKA EKONOMIE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {58},

Pages = {774-794},
Abstract = {The submitted paper is focused on the evaluation of the Common
   Agriculture Policy impact on economic results of Czech organic farmers.
   The aim of the paper is a complex evaluation of the influence of subsidy
   on production, costs, profit and technical efficiency of organic farms.
   The partial aim is to evaluate different methods of subsidy rate
   calculation. The main methodological tool for achieving mentioned aims
   is an analysis using a production and a stochastic frontier production
   function. This approach has not been used in the Czech Republic yet. The
   previous. studies, analyzed subsidy of organic farming, were based on a
   comparison of especially family farm income, profit or costs of organic
   and conventional farming. The analysis was conducted on the basis of
   unbalanced panel data from 143 organic and 388 conventional enterprises
   - legal entities, obtained over the time period 2004 - 2008. The sample
   of organic farms represents 58\% of the entire population of organic
   legal entities. Results of the analysis indicate negative impact of
   subsidies on production, profit and technical efficiency of organic
   farmers and refer to the reality that actual level of subsidy
   discourages organic farmers from rational behavior and implicates their
   dependence on state support.},

Abstract = {In Adam Smith in Beijing, Giovanni Arrighi attempts to outline the
   possible consequences of the growth of China through a rereading of the
   work of Adam Smith and a critique of Marx. This article analyses and
   sheds light on the limits of this reading, upon which Arrighi bases his
   prediction of a possible peaceful growth in collaboration amongst the
   various nations within the world-market. It also seeks to identify what
   makes Marx's work so timely for the understanding of the contemporary
   phase of capitalist globalisation, with its escalation of the
   exploitation of ever more globalised labour-power, and of international
   competition.},

Volume = {3},

Pages = {171-192},
Abstract = {Many cosmopolitans link their moral defence of specific principles of
   justice to a critique of the normative standing of states. This article
   explores some conceptual distinctions between morality and justice by
   focusing on the nature of claims they entail, the obligations they
   generate and the distribution of agency that they require. It then draws
   out some implications of these distinctions so as to illustrate how
   states play a non-arbitrary role in the process of both rendering
   determinate the principles of global justice and allocating agency
   compatibly with strict rather than large obligations. Contrary to many
   existent defences of the state, it shows how a similar conception
   promotes rather than undermining the ideal of global justice.},

Journal = {ECONOMICS \& POLITICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {22},
Number = {3},
Pages = {498-518},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {While there is a large and growing number of studies on the determinants
   of corporate tax rates, the literature has so far ignored the fact that
   the behavior of governments in setting tax rates is often best described
   as a discrete choice decision problem. We set up an empirical model that
   relates a government's decision whether to cut its corporate tax rate to
   the country's own inherited tax and taxes in neighboring countries.
   Using comprehensive data on corporate tax reforms in Europe since 1980,
   we find evidence suggesting that the position in terms of the tax burden
   imposed on corporate income relative to geographical neighbors strongly
   affects the probability of rate-cutting tax reforms. Countries are
   particularly likely to cut their statutory tax rate if the inherited tax
   is high and if they are exposed to low-tax neighbors.},

Abstract = {In the middle of the 19(th) century three French mathematical
   economists, Jules Dupuit, Augustin Cournot and Gustave Fauveau, develop
   analyses of taxation which strongly dissent from these of their liberal
   contemporaries. By trying to give rational principles to public
   policies, these three authors each proposed a formalized study of
   taxation, what did no other European economist of that time. They
   provided different answers to the same questions raised by the French
   liberal economists; they mathematically proved that progressive and
   indirect taxes, which were firmly rejected by their contemporaries,
   could comply with efficiency and justice.},

Abstract = {Gender is a good place from which to start reflections on European
   history: gender history deliberately transcends borders and, at the same
   time, demonstrates the difficulties of writing European, or
   transnational, history. Focusing on recent syntheses of modern European
   history, both general works and those specifically devoted to gender,
   the article asks what kind of Europe emerges from the encounter between
   gender and history. It suggests that the writing of European history
   includes either Eastern Europe (and, sometimes, the Ottoman Empire) or a
   gender perspective, but seldom both. Thus, the projects of integrating a
   European dimension into gender history and gender into European history
   remain unfinished. The result is a history of a rather `small Europe'.},

Title = {The Politics of Hope and Despair: The Effect of Presidential Election
   Outcomes on Suicide Rates},
Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {91},
Number = {3},
Pages = {593-612},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Objectives. This article examines the effect of election outcomes on
   suicide rates by combining the theory of social integration developed by
   Durkheim with the models of rational choice used in economics. Methods.
   Theory predicts that states with a greater percentage of residents who
   supported the losing candidate would tend to exhibit a relative increase
   in suicide rates. However, being around others who also supported the
   losing candidate may indicate a greater degree of social integration at
   the local level, thereby lowering relative suicide rates. We therefore
   use fixed-effects regression of state suicide rates from 1981 to 2005 on
   state election outcomes during presidential elections to determine which
   effect is stronger. Results. We find that the local effect of social
   integration is dominant. The suicide rate when a state supports the
   losing candidate will tend to be lower than if the state had supported
   the winning candidate-4.6 percent lower for males and 5.3 percent lower
   for females. Conclusion. Social integration works at many levels; it not
   only affects suicide risk directly, but can mediate other shocks that
   influence suicide risk.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the role of political stability on fiscal policy in
   a time-series analysis over 158 years at the Swiss federal level. We
   argue that the fiscal commons problem of public finances is affected by
   the number of years a finance minister remains in office, because the
   incentives for an incumbent to maintain a good reputation with sound
   policy decisions are stronger. A finance minister who succeeds to stay a
   long time in office enjoys a politically powerful position towards the
   administration, parliament and interest groups. In contrast, frequent
   government turnover weakens the position of the finance minister.},

Abstract = {Massive protests shook South Korea through the summer of 2008. This
   political eruption which exhibited many novel and unexpected elements
   cannot be explained by pointing to basic political conditions in South
   Korea (strong labor unions, democratization, and so forth). Neither does
   the putative reason for them to protest the new President's decision to
   reopen South Korea's beef market to the U.S. - adequately explain the
   social dynamics at play. In this paper, we examine the political
   geography of the `candlelight protests' (as they came to be known),
   focusing in particular on their novel aspects: the subjectivities of the
   protesters, fierce ideological struggles, and differentiated geography.
   We argue that the deepening of neoliberal restructuring by the new
   conservative regime formed the underlying causes of these intense
   conflicts. In other words, the new protests should be seen as a response
   to the reinforced contradictions engendered by neoliberalization and a
   new alignment of social groups against the prevailing hegemonic
   conditions in South Korea. In this view, the huge demonstrations
   revealed vulnerabilities in conservative hegemony but failed to produce
   a different hegemony. To advance these claims, we examine three aspects
   of the protests: first, the neoliberal policies of the new conservative
   regime; second, the intense ideological conflicts around the media; and
   finally, the spatial materialization of the protests. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {At the conclusion of the American Civil War, the states of the former
   Confederacy rapidly added sections to their state constitutions and
   legal statutes to codify racial segregation and limit the social,
   economic and political options for their African American citizens.
   These laws became the foundation for the Jim Crow system of racial
   segregation. Although such laws have been found unconstitutional, some
   have survived in state constitutions and statutes as legal relicts.
   Using the traditionalist-modernizer model and Thomas Frank's concept of
   the Great Backlash, we examine the electoral geographies of two
   referenda in Alabama to delete Jim Crow era provisions from the state's
   constitution. Although 59\% of Alabama voters supported deleting the
   state's constitutional ban on interracial marriage in 2000, a slight
   majority supported maintaining the unenforceable constitutional sections
   requiring poll taxes and segregated schools in 2004. We find the
   geographic pattern of voting on both referenda was substantially
   associated with the traditionalist modernizer model and Great Backlash
   as they pertain to race, religious conservatism, and views towards
   public education and taxes. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The Internet and the Web have changed policy formulation processes. The
   Web has increased the potential for governments to use information to
   manage the policy process and direct policy outcomes. It is argued that
   understanding the macro impacts of web-based information and measuring
   the performances of online public sector information activities is vital
   to improving governments' web-based capacity. This paper examines
   government nodality, internationalization, and actor composition in nine
   virtual policy networks to explore similarities and differences in
   online policy activities across different regions. The nine networks
   analyzed are issue specific, focused on forestry and climate change in
   four western Canadian provinces (Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and
   British Columbia) and in five western U. S.states (Washington, Oregon,
   California, Montana, and Colorado). Discussion is focused on how
   specific contexts around governing priorities, political responses and
   issue-specific policy problems shape the nature of virtual web-based
   information networks.},

Abstract = {Are there systematic political economy factors that shape preferences
   for foreign aid, a key component of American foreign policy? We analyze
   votes in the House of Representatives from 1979 to 2003 that would
   increase or decrease foreign aid by considering the political, economic,
   and ideological characteristics of legislators and their districts. To
   understand who supports and opposes foreign aid, we utilize theories of
   foreign economic policy preferences. By examining different types of aid
   policy, we show that domestic politics and especially the distributional
   consequences of economic aid can matter. The economic characteristics of
   a district and its left-right ideological predispositions influence
   support for aid in a systematic fashion over the nearly 25-year period.
   Stolper-Samuelson models along with political ideology can help explain
   legislators' preferences toward aid.},

Abstract = {Objective
   The present study evaluates whether areas with high levels of social
   capital are likely to have better fire service performance.
   Method
   Utilizing Robert Putnam's 14-measure index of social capital, OLS
   regression techniques are applied to objective data on the rate of
   unintentional fire deaths in the U.S. states between 1980 and 2003.
   Results
   The findings show that social capital is associated with a low
   unintentional fire death rate, even when controlling for a range of
   important environmental constraints. However, the effects of social
   capital vary by its conceptual components.
   Conclusions
   The study supports the argument that social capital is likely to be an
   important determinant of fire service outcomes, and suggests that the
   political engagement and social trust components may be the most
   important focus for public policies seeking to build social capital in
   order to reduce fire fatalities.},

   focused heavily on stem cell research as a salient campaign issue. Our
   analyses are based on a statewide telephone survey (N = 508 in June-July
   2006) conducted prior to the midterm and gubernatorial elections in the
   U.S. State of Wisconsin. Results show that ideological predispositions
   and attention to both newspaper and online media best explain issue
   participation. In contrast with prior research, our findings show that
   religiosity did not influence issue participation on the stem cell
   controversy in Wisconsin. Implications of these findings and the
   importance of research on issue participation for the field of public
   opinion research and the future of political campaigns are discussed.},

Abstract = {Elinor Ostrom, the 2009 Nobel Prize winner in economic science, has made
   significant contributions throughout her career to the disciplines of
   political economy and public choice. This article focuses on her
   contributions to our understanding of how rules of self-governance can
   produce cooperation out of situations of conflict over resource use.
   Through the use of a multiple-methods approach to political economy,
   Ostrom has demonstrated in a variety of historical circumstances and
   within a diversity of institutional environments how individuals can
   craft rules so that they can live better together in their communities
   and realize the gains from social cooperation under the division of

Abstract = {Critical geopolitics began as a critique of Cold War geopolitical
   discourses that imposed homogenizing categories upon diverse regional
   conflicts and marginalized place-specific structural causes of
   instability and violence. This critique is still relevant. Implicit
   within it is the promise of a more geographical geopolitics that,
   arguably, has not been realized by research. Using Bosnia-Herzegovina as
   an example, this paper examines the challenges of developing a critical
   geopolitics grounded in the study of contested geopolitical regions and
   places. Reviewing anthropological and other place-sensitive studies of
   violent population displacement and post-war returns in
   Bosnia-Herzegovina, the paper considers some conceptual dilemmas and
   questions raised by attempting to create a grounded critical
   geopolitics. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Nineteenth-century French political theater censorship was fundamentally
   in the mainstream of continental European drama censorship, yet it also
   reflected unique French characteristics. As elsewhere, because theater
   was viewed as so important during this era of European history, stage
   censorship occupied a huge amount of the time and energy of French
   officials and especially focused on proposed texts that were feared as
   threatening the existing political, legal and class order. Moreover,
   given the especial fear of the poor and illiterate throughout Europe
   after the French revolution, and the far greater access of the `dark
   masses' to the stage as compared with print media, both French
   authorities and their European counterparts paid particular attention to
   productions presented in venues which especially attracted the lower
   classes. Although resistance to the theater censorship began earlier and
   was more intense in France than elsewhere, French resistance techniques
   were quite similar to those used elsewhere. However, French theater
   censorship reflected the unique characteristics of the country in three
   ways: (1) because the theater was probably even more important in France
   than anywhere else in continental Europe, censorship also seems to have
   been more important, and it clearly engaged the attention of both the
   authorities and the opposition more than elsewhere; (2) the
   centralized-authoritarian-bureaucratic nature of nineteenth-century
   French politics was reflected in highly centralized censorship decisions
   which were not subject to court appeal, unlike in several other European
   countries; and (3) the extraordinary instability of nineteenth-century
   French politics was completely and accurately reflected in French
   theater censorship history, which, to a degree unknown elsewhere in
   Europe, was repeatedly abolished, reinstated, tightened or loosened in a
   clear echo of broader political currents.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates post-taking procedures, a research area not yet
   fully explored. It discusses the economic implications underlying the
   landowner's `repurchase right (RR)' which can be invoked upon the
   occurrence of a so-called `change in use after taking.' RR is compared
   with the government's discretion regarding such changes. The lack of
   post-taking accountability tends to create power ripe for abuse, and RR
   appears to be an effective device for constraining Leviathan's
   opportunism. Finally, a parsimonious estimation supports that, under the
   overriding-RR regime, there exists the systematic post-taking
   opportunism whereby `original public projects are changed into
   inappropriate projects.'.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates whether multinational enterprises (MNEs) take
   into account both global and diplomatic political risks when investing
   abroad. Whereas global political risk is common to all foreign
   investors, diplomatic political risk is dyad-specific as it is related
   to the overall diplomatic climate between the home and host countries.
   The main result of this study is that both global and diplomatic
   political risks matter for U.S. MNEs investing in developing countries.
   Their required return on investment rises when the political risk faced
   by all foreign investors worsens or when diplomatic tensions arise
   between the United States and their host countries, presumably because
   in both cases uncertainty about future returns increases.},

Abstract = {We study the link between the political and institutional context and
   privatization sales prices. The latter serves as a measure for assessing
   the extent to which privatization goals have been met. Whereas this link
   has been studied theoretically, there are very few, if any, empirical
   papers on this relationship. We use data from 308 privatizations around
   the world and apply a cross-country approach, including instrumental
   variables. We find that while the overall political regime does not
   matter much for prices, the political processes beyond the basic regime
   do matter. Institutional context also produces a significant impact on
   prices. Both results are robust to changes in specification.},

Title = {EDUCATION AND ICT: KEY FACTORS TO IMPROVE THE DEVELOPMENT IN THE WORLD},
Booktitle = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2010},
Pages = {171-189},
Abstract = {The concept of economic development has different meanings; it's
   essentially, though, an aim for all countries in order to boost wealth
   and the welfare of their citizens. Nowadays, the Information and
   Communication Technologies (ICT) are becoming a key factor in allowing
   economic development to improve in the world. On the other hand,
   education itself contributes to development, while being the complement
   necessary to make good use of the ICT potential.
   The main aim of this chapter is to analyze, from different points of
   view, the role that such important factors, like ICT and education, may
   play in the world's development. Throughout the chapter, the different

Abstract = {Government systems of accounting are in the EU - as well as in other
   developed countries based on the GFS (national) reporting systems and a
   cash reporting. The presented paper aims to describe main systems of
   reporting tax revenues, analyse problem areas within tax accrualisation
   and review international and Czech approaches and experiences. Based on
   the experiences from the Czech Republic's and international environment,
   it is pointed out at some disputable features of accrualisation from the
   perspective of the simplicity of reporting and its transparency.
   Following the initial overview, the paper deals with a description of
   various approaches of how to report tax revenues. The main concentration
   is placed on a purely accrual, time adjusted, cash approach. Next is
   presented a review of the praxis and results in the Czech Republic and
   abroad, with examples of various results of a tax quota calculation
   using four different methods.},

Abstract = {Lars Lih's Lenin Rediscovered aims to overthrow what he labels the
   textbook-myth of Leninism through a comprehensive reconstruction of
   Lenin's relationship, both to the Kautskyite orthodoxy that dominated
   the international socialist movement, and more local polemics. While the
   resulting rereading of Lenin's early Marxism is a powerful counter to
   the `textbook-interpretation' of Leninism, Lih has perhaps `bent the
   stick' too far in an attempt to prove Lenin's orthodoxy. Importantly, he
   misconstrues Lenin's critique of `economism' through a too-narrow
   reading of `economism'. Lih would have been better served to recognise
   the importance of Lenin's polemic as an attempt, not simply to paint his
   opponents on the Russian Left as `economists', but, more importantly, to
   grasp the organic nature of reformism and thus the true scale of the
   difficulties involved in challenging its hegemony within the workers'
   movement.},

Abstract = {This article interprets the strategies that have been associated with
   the war on terror against the backdrop of historical geographies of
   colonial violence and dispossession. It joins those who argue that wider
   anxieties about the sources of danger, criminality, violence and terror
   have become intertwined. These reveal as much about sensibilities of
   race, class and `security' as they do objective dangers. Thus the
   article considers how, drawing on the British case, detentions and
   deportations marked by race are connected with and form part of an
   overlapping regime of `security', `immigration' and asylum. This is
   exemplified via an account of the trajectory British sovereign territory
   of Diego Garcia, leading to wider reflections on contemporary forms of
   sovereignty and the operation of `race' in geopolitics.},

Abstract = {Basic Downsian theory predicts candidate convergence toward the views of
   the median voter in two-candidate elections Common journalistic wisdom,
   moreover, leads us to expect these centripetal pressures to be strongest
   when elections are expected to be close Yet, the available evidence from
   the US Congress disconfirms this prediction To explain this
   counterintuitive result, we develop a spatial model that allows us to
   understand the complex interactions of political competition, partisan
   loyalties, and incentives for voter turnout that can lead office-seeking
   candidates, especially candidates in close elections, to emphasize
   policy appeals to their voter base rather than courting the median voter},

Abstract = {Excessive borrowing by subnational governments is considered to be one
   of the perils of fiscal decentralization On the other hand, fiscal
   decentralization might ensure the fiscal stability of the public sector
   by constraining Leviathan governments Since the impact of decentralized
   government on fiscal outcome s is therefore ambiguous from a theoretical
   perspective, we explore this question empirically with a panel of 17
   OECD countries over the 1975-2001 period Our findings suggest that
   expenditure decentralization significantly reduces public indebtedness,
   whereas tax decentralization and vertical fiscal imbalances are
   insignificant},

Abstract = {Scotland's impact across the world undoubtedly stretched to the
   Antipodes particularly, but not only, in the colonial era. Under the
   ``canopy of Empire{''}, Australia and Scotland were linked by migration,
   trade, capital movements and by cultural ties. But these were all
   two-way ties. They did not simply colour the ``Australian
   civilisation{''}. Rather there was a vital and shifting reciprocation
   between Scotland and Australia. The relationship between them has mainly
   been determined by their different economic trajectories. Today
   financial and skilled human capital move each way between the two
   countries with heightened velocity and efficiency. These flows, along
   with continuing cultural connections, enmesh two fully developed modern
   economies.},

Abstract = {This paper takes an initial step in integrating insights from two sets
   of literature which have focused on central aspects of development with
   unfortunate independence. It highlights politically valuable resources,
   which are identified in the political economy literature, and shows that
   the informal sector literature provides ample evidence that these
   resources in general are (i) scarcely available to informal entities,
   (ii) poorly valued in their possession, and (iii) more often
   collectively unexploited by them. Overall, there seems to be an
   important though neglected bias in how the political system in less
   developed countries formulates, crafts, and implements policy.},

Title = {``Atlantic Revolution{''} or Local Difficulty: Aspects of Revolt in
   Brazil, 1780-1880},

Volume = {56},

Abstract = {It has become commonplace to argue that the ideals of the Enlightenment,
   the American War of Independence and the French Revolution inspired
   revolutionary struggles on both sides of the Atlantic and even played an
   increasing role in the inspiration of slave revolts in the Americas.
   This paper tests this hypothesis against two kinds of upheaval, namely
   slave revolt in Brazil between 1780 and 1850 and artisan protest in the
   so-called Praiera Rising in Brazilian Recife in 1848/9, seen by Hobsbawm
   and others (including some Brazilian historians) as a South American
   variant of the Parisian upheavals of the same year. The analysis of
   slave revolts in this paper, on the other hand, concludes that they were
   rarely inspired by Western discourse, as they were overwhelmingly the
   work of African slaves, who relied on African - or to be more precise -
   Afro-Brazilian traditions, including local cults and African Islam. In
   so far as there was an ``Atlantic Revolution{''} in this case,
   therefore, it came from the South and not the North Atlantic. In the
   case of the Praiera the paper further demonstrates that the demands of
   free and freed Brazilian artisans for ``work for all Brazilians{''} and
   the ``nationalisation of the retail trade{''} were not inspired by the
   same kind of radical, anti-merchant ideology as their Parisian
   counterparts but were primarily driven by hostility to the competition
   of both slave artisans and an influx of Portuguese craftsmen. This
   difference it explains by the different meaning of labour in slave and
   non-slave society.},

Abstract = {Objective. This study assesses the pace of cultural assimilation of
   Mexican Americans by comparing changes in their gender-role attitudes
   over generations to the European-origin U.S. mainstream. Methods. Using
   cumulative data from the 1972 2004 General Social Survey, we examine the
   rate at which progressive generations of Mexican Americans approach the
   mainstream gender-role attitudes. We also employ a set of logistic
   regressions to assess the differences in gender-role attitudes between
   Mexican and European Americans. Results. For five out of the eight
   gender-role-related questions considered in the study, Mexican Americans
   of the third or later generations show more liberal or egalitarian
   gender-role attitudes than those of the first or second generations. A
   comparison between Mexican and European Americans suggests that Mexican
   Americans in the sample have more conservative gender-role attitudes
   than European Americans in terms of division of labor at home and
   women's participation in politics. Conclusion. Mexican Americans become
   more likely to adopt egalitarian gender-role attitudes as generation
   progresses. The differences between Mexican and European Americans in
   terms of gender-role attitudes are sensitive to the particular domains
   of attitudes under consideration.},

Abstract = {In recent years the use of private military contractors to execute
   national security tasks in the U. S. military has finally come under
   public scrutiny. The main policy question is in three parts: What is the
   proper division of labor between the public and private sectors? Who
   decides which sector performs a specific task? If private operatives
   perform tasks that typically fall on the public side (combat,
   interrogation), what is the public oversight over the private actors,
   and how can they be held accountable for wrongdoings? In this article
   these questions are addressed in relation to the privatization process
   in the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF). The article has four parts: the
   first suggests that the Israeli baseline is unique as the IDF has
   historically been entrusted with a wide array of national-civilian
   missions; the second explains the economic realities that probably lie
   behind the privatization efforts; the third describes the slow and
   cautious privatization process currently under way; the fourth suggests
   that while there is little public debate, there is civilian oversight,
   there are some publicly exposed rationales, and there is public support
   in letting the IDF, the most trusted part of the executive branch,
   control the process.},

Abstract = {The Great Strike of 1917 was, arguably, the greatest class confrontation
   in Australian history. For five weeks, the eastern states of Australia
   were paralysed by a mass strike, driven from below by a rank and file
   paying little heed to their reluctant leaders. Strike action involved
   nearly 100,000 workers and was only defeated by mass scabbing
   masterminded by conservative state and federal governments. Historians
   have tended to dismiss the Great Strike as mindless militancy. Central
   to this negative assessment has been the belief that the strikers could
   not win because ``there was too much coal at grass{''}. But this may be
   a wrong assumption to make. A careful investigation of the actual
   situation with coal stocks in 1917 demonstrates that the strikers came
   much closer to winning than generally has been accepted.},

Title = {Voter Turnout Among College Students: New Data and a Rethinking of
   Traditional Theories},
Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {91},
Number = {2},
Pages = {301-323},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Objectives
   Traditional theories of turnout are of limited applicability to college
   students: the concepts and measures associated with these theories were
   not designed with students in mind, and factors not considered by the
   traditional theories are relevant. We offer a new theoretical
   perspective for understanding college student turnout and test it using
   a new data set.
   Methods
   We conducted a phone survey of college students following the November
   2004 U.S. presidential election. We test our theoretical expectations
   using descriptive statistics and logistic regression models.
   Results
   We find that the usual demographic factors are of little relevance.
   Turnout is, however, related to the same motivational factors that
   stimulate older voters, as well as to mobilization by parties.
   College-specific factors, such as distance between home and college, are
   also relevant. Turnout was also higher for students whose hometown or
   college town was in a battleground state.
   Conclusion
   The results suggest new approaches to the study of young people and how
   and when they become part of the voting public.},

Abstract = {This article explores state and federal Australian cases from the past
   thirty years - legal judgments, inquiries and political scandals - which
   implicate the law and concept of electoral bribery. Specifically it
   examines deals involving preferences and arrangements made between
   politicians and ``third parties{''} such as lobby groups and the media.
   It shows that, defying assumptions that it died out a century ago,
   electoral bribery remains a thorny ethical and legal concept,
   particularly given evolving norms and electioneering practices. If
   bribery is to be a workable ethical or legal concept for judging
   contemporary electoral conduct then it needs to deal with horizontal
   relations between political actors rather than, as it traditionally has,
   to focus upon vertical relations between politicians and electors
   characterised by the former's efforts to buy the latter's votes.},

Abstract = {This paper provides an empirical investigation of electoral
   participation and communicative voting in 14 European countries. We
   estimate a multi-level voting process where individuals face a
   participation decision (whether to vote or abstain) and a voting
   decision (whether to vote strategically for a likely winner party or as
   communicating for a sure loser party). Our main findings can be
   summarized as follows. First, individuals who are either independent or
   uninformed are less likely to turnout. However, being both independent
   and uninformed does not have any statistically significant effect on
   electoral participation. Thus, our results question the empirical
   relevance of the swing voter's curse theory in large elections. Second,
   the probability of voting as communicating is positively related with
   the level of education and the degree of dissatisfaction with the
   political system. Finally, political preferences and institutional
   features characterizing the functioning of the political system and of
   the media market have a significant effect both on electoral
   participation and on the voting decision. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {This article analyses the effects of the voting assistance tool
   Manobalsas that was developed for the Lithuanian parliamentary elections
   of 2008 by three leading universities in Lithuania. Analytical voting
   assistance tools (or Voting Advice Applications-VAAs) assist voters by
   offering systematised information about candidates and parties, and by
   providing voting recommendation based on the congruence of political
   attitudes between a voter and a party. Voting assistance tools were
   mainly developed by academic institutions to inform voters about the
   policy positions of political parties, and to promote programmatic
   competition between parties.
   The analysis of the use of the Manobalsas voting advice application in
   Lithuania suggests that parties might be able to manipulate the results
   of the tool by adopting non-ideological (ideologically unconstrained)
   populist policy positions. The remarkable success of a non-programmatic
   party in the Lithuanian Manobalsas system demonstrates that VAAs might
   be advantageous to non-ideological populist parties which are most
   flexible to adjust to the attitudes of an ``average{''} voter.},

Abstract = {This paper uses a new panel dataset to perform a statistical analysis of
   political regimes and financial rectitude over the long run. Old Regime
   polities in Europe typically suffered from fiscal fragmentation and
   absolutist rule. By the start of World War I, however, many such
   countries had centralized institutions and limited government. Panel
   regressions indicate that political transformations toward centralized
   and limited regimes led to significant improvements in fiscal prudence.
   Dynamic estimations and structural breaks tests reinforce these
   findings. The results suggest that good financial housekeeping is one
   mechanism through which political reforms reduce sovereign credit risk.},

Abstract = {Objectives
   Are legislators' party affiliations or is district partisanship the
   greatest predictor of legislative support of the president? Do members
   of the U.S. House emphasize different policy positions when casting roll
   calls than when communicating their positions to constituents? We
   theorize that party is less important in legislators' district-oriented
   behavior than in roll-call voting. When casting roll calls, legislators
   are agents facing multiple principals, namely, political party leaders
   and their district constituencies. When engaging in district-oriented
   behavior, the only key principal is the legislator's constituency.
   Methods
   We analyze legislators' positions on roll calls and in platforms.
   Platforms are examined with a unique data set of franked mass mailings
   sent by House members. Linear and limited dependent variable models are
   employed.
   Results
   Our findings show that constituency preferences are a more consistent
   predictor of legislative support for the president when analyzing
   legislators' platforms, and that political party has a relatively
   limited effect. When analyzing roll-call votes, party is the key
   predictor.
   Conclusions
   Political parties may be interested in what legislators do as opposed to
   what they say. The platform findings are in contrast to most recent
   empirical work examining position taking, though consistent with the
   canonical works of Mayhew and Fenno. This has implications for theories
   of parties in Congress that tie party behavior in the legislature to
   partisanship in the electorate.},

Abstract = {When rating questions are used to measure attitudes or values in survey
   research a researcher might want to control for the effect of overall
   agreement with the set of items that is rated. The need for controlling
   for overall agreement arises when the set of items refers to conceptual
   opposite perspectives, when balanced sets of items are used, or when a
   researcher is interested in relative preferences rather than overall
   agreement. In this paper, we introduce a method for filtering out
   overall agreement when a researcher's aim is to construct a latent class
   typology of respondents, that is, a latent-class ordinal regression
   model with random intercept. With this approach segments in the
   population are identified that differ in their relative preference of
   particular items over other items in the set. Examples are given on the
   concepts of locus of control, gender role attitudes and civil morality.
   The examples demonstrate that when an overall agreement is present in
   the data, the method is able to detect it, and at the same time allows
   identifying latent classes of respondents that differ in their relative
   preference of the items being rated.},

Abstract = {Although fiscal policies of central governments sometimes provide modest
   insurance against regional income shocks, this paper shows that
   procyclical fiscal policy among provincial governments can easily
   overwhelm these stabilizing effects. We examine the cyclicality of
   budget items among provincial governments in seven federations, showing
   that own-source taxes are generally highly procyclical, and contrary to
   common wisdom, revenue sharing and discretionary transfers are either
   acyclical or procyclical. Constituent governments are thus left alone to
   smooth their own shocks, and we document the extent to which various
   restraints on borrowing and saving undermine their ability to do so. The
   resulting procyclicality of provincial fiscal policy is likely to have
   important implications in a world where demands for countercyclical
   fiscal policy are increasing but considerable fiscal responsibilities
   are being devolved to subnational governments.},

Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {91},
Number = {1},
Pages = {21-41},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Objectives
   This article is a test of general electoral theory in the case of
   Taiwan's 2008, postreform legislative election. In light of Taiwan's
   electoral reform, I test several hypotheses related to choice in
   electoral design and winning conditions, effective number of parties,
   proportionality, and regionalism.
   Methods
   I run a simulation of the new rules and districting using the previous
   (2004) election results and compare this to the actual results. By
   comparing simulated and actual outcomes, I can compare
   theoretically-driven, a priori expectations with election outcomes.
   Results
   Primary findings are that a dominant seat share for the Nationalist
   Party, decline in third-party representation, and disproportionality
   were largely predicated on the transition to a majoritarian system.
   Conclusion
   General electoral theory holds robust predictive power in the case of
   Taiwan.},

Title = {Mill's extraordinary utilitarian moral theory},
Journal = {POLITICS PHILOSOPHY \& ECONOMICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {67-116},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {D.G. Brown's revisionist interpretation, despite its interest,
   misrepresents Mill's moral theory as outlined in Utilitarianism. Mill's
   utilitarianism is extraordinary because it explicitly aims to maximize
   general happiness both in point of quality and quantity. It encompasses
   spheres of life beyond morality, and its structure cannot be understood
   without clarification of his much-maligned doctrine that some kinds of
   pleasant feelings are qualitatively superior to others irrespective of
   quantity. This doctrine of higher pleasures establishes an order of
   precedence among conflicting kinds of enjoyments, including moral as
   well as non-moral kinds. In particular, as he indicates in
   Utilitarianism, Chapter V, the higher kind of pleasure associated with
   the moral sentiment of justice, namely, a feeling of `security' for
   vital personal concerns that everyone has and that ought to be
   recognized as equal rights, is qualitatively superior to any competing
   kinds of pleasures regardless of quantity. Justice (more generally,
   morality) is conceived as a social system of rules and dispositions
   which has as its ultimate end the maximization of this pleasant feeling
   of security for everyone. The upshot is that an optimal social code that
   distributes and sanctions particular equal rights and correlative duties
   has absolute priority over competing considerations within his
   utilitarianism. The code seeks to prevent conduct that, in the judgment
   of suitably competent majorities, causes grievous kinds of harm to other
   people by injuring their vital personal concerns. To prevent the acts
   and omissions which are judged to cause such undue harm, the code
   assigns equal duties not to perform them, and authorizes due punishment
   of anyone who fails to fulfill his duties. Punishment is always
   expedient to condemn and deter wrongdoing. But it is properly a separate
   issue which particular ways of inflicting punishment are expedient in
   any particular situation. Given that feelings of guilt are a way of
   inflicting punishment, coercion is not necessary for punishment. Thus,
   Mill's claim that wrongdoing always deserves to be punished in some way
   does not imply that coercive legal sanctions and public stigma are
   always expedient for the enforcement of moral duties.},

Booktitle = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2010},
Pages = {41-53},
Abstract = {Multinational companies investing in communications, energy, transport
   and financial services, can have a differentiated effect in the host
   economy comparing with the one attributed to manufacturing investment.
   These companies are characterized by generation of an intermediate input
   aimed at practically the totality of an economy's sectors (intermediate
   input as well as a final good for consumers), reason why we have
   denominated the matter multinational transversal services. We have
   analyzed in this paper if inflow foreign direct investment in
   transversal services over economic growth and productivity is
   significantly higher to the effect caused by inflow foreign direct
   investment in manufacturing sector. During the period 1985-2006, the
   results obtained in owner analysis show a positive and very similar
   effect of inward manufacturing FDI (MFDI) and inward transversal FDI
   (TFDI) on labor productivity (LP).},

Abstract = {If the inapplicability of amnesty and statute limitation in the case of
   forced disappearance, torture and extralegal executions has indeed
   established itself as a dominant criterion of national jurisprudence,
   this consensus has not been attained as regards extracontractual
   responsibility derived from these crimes, nor in respect of the
   punishment dealt to those responsible.
   The developments brought about by judges, the dogmatic problems which
   have been avoided and the areas where swinging criteria still apply, can
   be analyzed from diverse perspectives, some of which have yet to be
   explored in depth by the doctrine. In this piece of work special
   attention will be paid to the problems set out by the legislative
   authority in order to develop general norms in this area and the
   consequences of their inactivity in dealing with the rights in question.},

Abstract = {By framing Lenin's thought squarely within the mainstream of classical
   Marxism, Lars Lih's Lenin Rediscovered acts as a powerful contribution
   to rescuing Lenin's Marxism from the condescension of the
   `textbook-interpretation' of Leninism. However, the power of Lih's book
   is weakened by a failure to grasp the slippage between what Kautsky
   wrote and the various ways in which his writings were interpreted within
   the Second International. While Lenin attempted to apply lessons from
   the German Social-Democratic Party to Russian conditions, so too did his
   opponents within the Russian socialist movement. The actual degree of
   difference between what Lenin did and what Kautsky wrote became fully
   apparent only after the events of 1914 and 1917.},

Booktitle = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},

Pages = {91-103},
Abstract = {With globalization and the concomitant appearance of new actors in
   international trade, competitiveness has come to play a key role in
   political discourse and to constitute an objective of economic policy in
   both developed and developing nations. The term competitiveness,
   however, can be interpreted in a number of ways and tends to be
   ambiguous. The present article focuses on international competitiveness.
   Its review of the chief ex-ante and ex-post indicators used to measure
   that concept is followed by a discussion of export base growth as an
   element of competitiveness, illustrated with a model applied to the
   Spanish economy. Finally, the competitiveness of Spanish manufacturing
   industries that compete with imports is shown to be related to their
   respective technology intensity.},

Abstract = {The paper is dealing with the problem of relationship between the rate
   of competition and final prices in the public procurement. This issue is
   analysed on the sector of infrastructure buildings in the Czech
   Republic. The main goal of the paper is to verify the relevance of the
   hypothesis, that there is a negative relationship between the number of
   bidders and the final prices.
   The paper is divided into five main parts. The main theoretical
   fundaments of the analyses are described in the first part, where the
   results of relevant sources are summarized as well. Next part highlights
   the system of financing the transport infrastructure in the Czech
   Republic and describes the main steps in the process of public
   procurement. Based on the theoretical analysis three hypotheses are
   formulated in the third part, which relevance is tested using the
   econometrics instruments. The results of the quantitative analyses are
   summarised in the fourth chapter. The last part, conclusion, summarises
   the main results and formulates the policy recommendations, which could
   increase the effectiveness of the public expenditure on the transport
   infrastructure.},

Journal = {POLITICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {27},
Number = {1},
Pages = {44-58},
Abstract = {Many citizens lack the political knowledge to make informed decisions
   partly due to the high costs of becoming informed. Previous scholars
   have argued that if individuals speak with political experts who share
   their preferences, they can vote as if they were informed without paying
   information costs. This view of citizens as single-minded seekers of
   low-cost information is unrealistic. Individuals often choose discussion
   partners for reasons unrelated to politics, and many communication
   networks have heterogeneous information levels and preferences as a
   result. This paper simulates the votes of hypothetical electorates with
   different individual and network information levels. It demonstrates
   that network expertise has an effect on vote choice, but this effect is
   not as large as the effect of individual expertise. Rather, the key
   contextual determinant of an individual's vote is the partisan
   composition of his or her discussion network.},

Abstract = {It is not necessary to look for reasons to justify our interest in one
   of the most complex topics in the history of Modern Spain At the
   beginning of the 21(st) century the Spanish emigrant may be a distant
   image in Spanish society, which gives good reason for an historical
   assessment. Historians, using the tools from social sciences, appear in
   a privileged position to analyze an historical phenomenon such as
   external emigration. The aim of this manuscript is to raise possible
   venues for future research in our historical knowledge of Spanish
   emigration starting from the belief that it is necessary to overcome the
   traditional division into different periods usually found in the
   literature. The article presents some of the problems that could be
   reconsidered once Spanish emigration is globally analyzed. In addition,
   the negative effects derived from the lack of academic dialog among
   different disciplines are also stressed.},

Abstract = {From both the macroeconomic and microeconomic or business perspectives,
   innovation is a path that can lead to sustainable success on today's
   current scene. In other words, the way innovation policy is posed is of
   great relevance. The existence of a market failure is often used as a
   justification for innovation policies. The scope of application for
   innovation policy is also a key point. Here we can find the idea of
   Regional Innovation Systems (RIS) and their evolution. The relationship
   between science policy and innovation policy is therefore important and
   often not sufficiently examined. It is important to analyse, in turn,
   the role of clusters and the policies relating them.},

   Monitoring Racial Discrimination of Hispanics},
Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {91},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1288-1311},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Objectives
   A primary justification for collecting U.S. racial statistics is the
   need to monitor racial discrimination. This article aims to show how
   analyses of Hispanics-who may officially be of any race-tend to miss
   discrimination based on racial appearance by relying on data that
   instead capture racial self-identification, a different aspect of race
   that often does not correspond.
   Methods
   The study analyzes 60 qualitative interviews with Dominican and Puerto
   Rican migrants in the New York metropolitan area. It employs multiple
   measures to represent theoretically distinct aspects of the lived
   experience of race.
   Results
   Respondents interpret the Census race question in different ways
   corresponding to different aspects of race, which often do not match one
   another. Although respondents experience discrimination on the basis of
   phenotype, their racial self-identification is a poor proxy for
   measuring their racial appearance.
   Conclusions
   Scholars need to develop a language of race that communicates the
   multiplicity of social processes involved. Social surveys must provide
   measures of these multiple components, including interviewer
   observations of racial appearance, to monitor discrimination on the
   basis of phenotype within Hispanic groups.},

Title = {Descriptive Representation and Latino Interest Bill Sponsorship in

Volume = {91},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {Objective
   This article examines dynamics related to the sponsorship of Latino
   interest bills in Congress. I focus particularly on the influence of
   Latino representatives.
   Methods
   I employ an original data set that includes all bills sponsored during
   the 109th Congress (2005-2006) and use negative binomial and standard
   OLS regression techniques to test hypotheses that Latino representatives
   are more active sponsors of Latino interest bills than non-Latino
   representatives.
   Results
   Findings demonstrate that both the size of Latino constituencies in
   congressional districts and descriptive representation significantly and
   positively predict Latino interest bill sponsorship. Descriptive
   representation appears particularly influential regarding sponsorship of
   bills that deal with Latino concerns explicitly.
   Conclusion
   The analysis establishes that descriptive representation enhances the
   substantive representation of Latinos in bill sponsorship. An important
   aspect of this phenomenon is a legislative style on the part of Latino
   representatives that more openly, actively, and specifically embraces
   the interests of Latino constituencies in policy proposals.},

Abstract = {This article characterizes politics, philosophy, and economics (PPE) as
   a substantive research programme as a flexible and analytic debate on
   the relations between the individual and society that incorporates both
   positive and normative analyses. This, in contrast to a view of PPE as a
   series of interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary topics. To this end, I
   sketch the general shape of the research programme, it boundaries and
   its features, before offering a slightly more detailed account of some
   aspects of the PPE programme. I also defend the claim that there is some
   value in recognizing PPE as a research programme, and after discussing
   the conditions required for the programme to thrive, suggest that there
   is some reason to be concerned for its future.},

Abstract = {We consider a two-period model in which politicians differ in their
   motivations, and show that a good politician may suboptimally provide a
   public good that gives an immediate payoff because if he provided one
   that gives a payoff only in the second term, the citizens would consider
   it sufficiently likely that he is a bad politician and, therefore, they
   would not reelect him. Quite surprisingly, such short-termism may be
   socially optimal: it increases the probability that the office will be
   held in the future by a good politician and induces a bad politician to
   act more in the public interest.},

Abstract = {This article discusses several aspects of an ongoing French educational
   reform aimed at introducing open enrollment in public secondary
   education. In light of the most recent theoretical and empirical
   evidence on this topic, we attempt to clarify some of the confusion that
   surrounds the heated debated on school choice by showing that its impact
   depends crucially on a number of key institutional features. After
   briefly describing the rules that govern the allocation of students to
   public and private schools in France, we provide an overview of the
   multiplicity of school choice policies around the world. We then discuss
   the potential costs and benefits of such policies and insist on the
   importance of several institutional parameters in determining their
   success or failure in terms of efficiency and equity. Based on the
   lessons that can be drawn from existing empirical evaluations of school
   choice reforms, we conclude with a number of suggestions regarding the
   future of school choice in France.},

Title = {Location of Public Goods and the Calculus of Voting: The Seattle
   Monorail Referendum},

Abstract = {Objectives. In this article we explore how the geographic location of a
   proposed public good on the ballot in a local referendum influences
   voting turnout. We argue that voters who live farther away from the
   good, and are thus likely to bear the cost of the good but have no
   access to it, would be more motivated to turn out in the election.
   Drawing on the cost-orientation hypothesis, or negativity effect, ``that
   people are more strongly motivated to avoid losses than to approach
   gains,{''} we expect these voters to derive higher expressive benefits
   from the act of voting relative to those of voters located closer to the
   good. Methods. We examine voting turnout in the 2002 referendum in the
   City of Seattle on the proposed construction of a monorail. We conduct
   our study at the precinct level using spatial tools of analysis. We
   evaluate the effect of accessibility on turnout by means of a
   curvilinear model that incorporates demographic and political variables.
   Results. We find that voting turnout is determined partly by
   accessibility. Turnout is higher in precincts located farther away from
   the monorail line than in precincts located relatively closer to the
   line. Partisanship conditions this effect. Conclusions. This study
   provides tentative support for linking voter turnout to the negativity
   effect via expressive benefits. Voters' location in relation to a public
   good may affect directly their political behavior by means of their
   perceived net gains or losses from the good.},

Abstract = {The rules-based fiscal framework of the EMU relies heavily on the
   development of medium-term fiscal plans by the EU governments. In this
   paper, I present an empirical analysis of the deviations from the plans
   presented in the annual Stability and Convergence Programs. I focus on
   projections for real GDP growth and general government balances,
   revenues and spending at different time horizons. I show that deviations
   from the projections presented in these Programs since 1999 can be
   explained by institutional factors, i.e., the form of fiscal governance
   and the stringency of fiscal rules.},

Abstract = {We explore the role that campaign expenditures play in determining
   electoral outcomes. We study a two-party contest where campaign funds
   can affect the preferences of voters regarding the saliency of two
   political issues. We show that an advantage in campaign resources, a
   pre-campaign partisan advantage, an advantage on every salient issue, or
   a combination of these indicators, do not always guarantee electoral
   victory. By contrast, electoral victory is guaranteed if the sum of the
   proportions of the electorate supporting a party on every salient issue

Abstract = {The Department of Defense (DoD) has contracted defense support
   operations to private U. S. and foreign firms in an ever-increasing
   manner in both Iraq and Afghanistan. Significant factors that have
   contributed to this outsourcing include the proliferation of military
   operations, the increased sophistication of U. S. weapons systems used
   in these operations, and a reduction in the size of the U. S. military
   after the breakup of the former Soviet Union. The concerns raised with
   this process have centered on contract management and oversight. Despite
   the fact that DoD has continually updated its written guidance to
   defense officials charged with oversight of contractor performance, DoD
   has faced continuing problems related to a lack of visibility over the
   totality of contractor support at deployed locations, a lack of adequate
   contract oversight personnel, and the failure to collect and share
   institutional knowledge on the use of certain contractors.},

Title = {The political economy of investment: Sclerotic effects from interest
   groups},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {26},
Number = {2},
Pages = {208-221},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {We investigate the relationship between interest group activity and
   investment by analyzing an unbalanced panel of observations on 126
   countries over three time periods. We find that the number of interest
   groups in a nation is negatively related to investment, consistent with
   a sclerotic effect due to rent-seeking by interest groups. Our findings
   are robust to the inclusion of a variety of additional common controls
   in the specification, to potential outlying observations, and to varied
   sample-selection procedures. We do find, however, that the sclerotic
   impact of groups on investment is stronger across developed OECD
   countries than for the developing non-OECD countries. Effects also tend
   to be stronger in democratic nations, but are dependent upon how strict
   a definition of democracy is used. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {In late modern war visuality plays a vital role in both the conduct and
   the rationalization of military violence. This essay explores the
   techno-cultural apparatus of US military operations and media briefings
   in occupied Baghdad from 2003 to 2007. It traces the visual
   reconfiguration of the city as a space of events rather than purely
   objects. These digital mappings were an intrinsic part of the US Army's
   counterinsurgency strategy, and their performances were punctuated by a
   dialectical interplay of geopolitical and biopolitical imaginaries that
   was focal to the abstraction and legitimation of American military
   intervention. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {We address the strengths and weaknesses of the main available measures
   of political regime and extend the dichotomous regime classification
   first introduced in Alvarez et al. (Stud. Comp. Int. Dev. 31(2):3-36,
   1996). This extension focuses on how incumbents are removed from office.
   We argue that differences across regime measures must be taken seriously
   and that they should be evaluated in terms of whether they (1) serve to
   address important research questions, (2) can be interpreted
   meaningfully, and (3) are reproducible. We argue that existing measures
   of democracy are not interchangeable and that the choice of measure
   should be guided by its theoretical and empirical underpinnings. We show
   that the choice of regime measure matters by replicating studies
   published in leading journals.},

Abstract = {The character and the morality of citizens are important for prosperity
   because they go hand in hand with the great institutions of private
   property. democracy, and free markets. We establish this result by
   reference to the city-states of Athens and Sparta during the period
   490-338 BC. Consequently, we conclude, countries in search of policies
   to escape from the trap of poverty should not only try to emulate the
   institutions of economically advanced countries but furthermore they
   should set up educational systems to infuse into the value systems of
   their citizens' compatible ``ethos{''}. (c) 2009 Elsevier B,V. All

Abstract = {Objective
   Capitalizing on attention directed to judicial agreement and the
   associated consequences of judicial elections, this article conducts an
   examination of the effects of seniority and state methods of judicial
   retention on decisions by state supreme court justices to dissent.
   Methods
   Using data drawn from the State Supreme Court Data Archive, this
   research analyzes decisions by individual justices to dissent in 33,582
   tort cases from 1995 to 1998. GEE logistic analysis with cases as the
   clustering unit is the estimation procedure.
   Results
   While the seniority of justices is positively connected to dissent, the
   findings illustrate that seniority's effect is nuanced and conditioned
   by a state's method of judicial retention. The impact of a justice's
   seniority relative to his or her colleagues is most powerful in
   appointive courts where justices serve without fear of electoral
   retaliation. Alternatively, within elective courts, justices respond to
   elections by pursuing a consensual approach regardless of their
   seniority.
   Conclusion
   The dissent characteristics of justices in state supreme courts are
   intricately tied to the length of careers and the methods by which
   states keep justices in office.},

Abstract = {Alberto Alesina, William Easterly and Janina Matuszeski's paper
   Artificial States, published as a National Bureau of Economic Research
   Working Paper in June 2006, suggests a theory linking the nature of
   country borders to the economic success of countries (Alesina, Easterly,
   \& Matuszeski, 2006). This paper critically examines this suggestion
   that natural boundaries and ethnic homogeneity are desirable for
   economic reasons. It takes issue with the understanding of artificial
   and natural boundaries that they develop, arguing that this ignores two
   centuries of critical and quantitative geographical scholarship that has
   mapped, documented and critiqued the obsession of a link between
   topography and the appropriate Shape of states and boundaries. It
   explores how their argument is linked to a defence of ethnically
   homogeneous states. The focus is on their teleological and paradoxically
   ahistorical vision that naturalizes politics by appealing to spatial
   myths of homogeneity and geometric destiny, grounded in a reactionary
   understanding of space as container. In so doing, I am mindful of the
   strong links between such proposals and calls for post-conflict
   partition, and the corresponding discourses of ethnic and cultural
   homogenization on which they rely. Instead of thinking of boundaries as
   geometric objects, squiggly or not, I consider boundaries through the
   simultaneous processes of reification, naturalization, and
   fetishization. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This paper tries to draw some lessons of the experience of ten years of
   EMU for the theory of Optimum Currency Areas. It examines whether, in
   the light of EMU, the OCA theory may be considered as a relevant
   framework for assessing the functioning of a monetary union as well as
   the costs and benefits which ensue from it for its member countries. To
   this aim, both the traditional approach of OCA (based on the quest for
   optimality criteria) and the endogeneity approach (according to which a
   monetary union will endogenously become an optimal currency area) are
   considered. It appears that the first approach may be of limited scope
   if we would like to use it so as to assess the role played by
   asymmetries in the functioning of a monetary union. Moreover, only
   moderate evidence is found that EMU is endogenously turning into an
   optimum currency area.},

Abstract = {The Department of Defense has always sought a socially representative
   enlisted force, especially with respect to African American and Hispanic
   minorities. Ideally, in a democratic society a military force should be
   representative of the nation it defends. African American
   overrepresentation was a major concern during the first decade of the
   All-Volunteer Force (AVF), while Hispanics were underrepresented. During
   the 1980s black representation stabilized and Hispanics began to
   increase, especially with respect to enlistments. Starting in the 1990s,
   black representation began to decline, followed more recently by
   declines among Hispanics. This article examines changes in minority
   representation since the inception of the AVF in 1973 and argues that
   the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have played a significant role in
   recent changes.},

Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-21},
Abstract = {The announcement that the Russian state-owned gas monopoly Gazprom and
   two German energy companies intend to construct a new undersea Baltic
   pipeline that will bypass Poland has raised a fierce political storm in
   that country. In this paper, we aim to shed further light onto the
   forces that govern the proposed pipeline's interaction with Poland's
   energy, economic and geopolitical landscapes, by examining some of the
   public discourses and state policies that have been associated with the
   country's reaction to it. One of our key findings is that the new gas
   link - recently named Nord Stream - is creating interlocking webs of
   socio-spatial paradoxes and contradictions that reverberate across the
   entire Baltic space. In the process, they simultaneously bind together
   and tear apart the territorial and political fabric of the region.},

Abstract = {The military and police professions share a number of common facets, but
   in spite of surface similarities, the two professions are significantly
   different. Consequently, the evidence indicating a convergence of
   primary aspects of the two roles presages an important societal
   development, with substantial implications on several levels. Thus, this
   article has several objectives. First, it reviews the evidence
   indicating role convergence, that is, evidence that significant segments
   of police operations in the United States have taken on military
   characteristics; and evidence indicating that many U.S. military
   initiatives have taken on policing characteristics. Next, using the
   notion of internal and external role-change ``drivers,{''} it examines
   how such role shifts occur and considers some political and legal
   implications of the shift. Third, the article compares the role
   orientations and job demands of both professions, identifying the
   important differences inherent in the two roles and presenting an
   analysis of the occupational implications of role convergence for job
   holders, job evaluators, and job ``clients{''} (i.e., ordinary
   citizens). The last section considers the implications of role
   convergence for role management.},

Abstract = {Starting from the 2009 Istanbul Biennial, with its Brechtian curatorial
   theme, this essay considers the Left's varying responses to art's
   so-called `political turn'. Discussion ranges from the local and
   regional context of the Biennial's function as part of Turkey's bid to
   join the EU, through to a longer theoretical perspective on the critical
   debates over `art and life', artistic autonomy and heteronomy, and the
   revival in avant-gardism. The authors propose that the standard accounts
   of the intimate connection between the commodity and art have become
   politically counterproductive. They suggest that Marxist analysis needs
   to develop a more complexly-articulated philosophical reflection on the
   relation between economy, politics, and art - and between political and
   aesthetic praxes - if it is to advance its longstanding contributions to
   considerations of `aesthetics and politics'.},

Abstract = {This article considers the status and meaning of the category of value
   in the wake of the financial crisis that began in 2007. I argue that
   value is best understood as a form of social wealth constituted by a
   spatially and temporally generalising social relation of equivalence and
   substitutability under, and specific to, capitalism - and that a
   categorial focus shows that despite massive `devaluations', the
   value-relation is not itself in crisis. On the contrary, it is running
   at near full capacity, erasing the difference between `financial' and
   `real' capitals, values, and assets. Consequently, attempts to
   understand the crisis that rely on material distinctions between `real'
   and `fictitious' values and capitals overstate the extent and depth of
   the crisis for capital, and underestimate the virtually uninterrupted
   consolidation of the rule of the value, i.e. the territorial and
   historical imperative of equivalence and substitutability.},

Title = {Towards a Critical Geopolitics of China's Engagement with African
   Development},
Journal = {GEOPOLITICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Pages = {462-495},
Abstract = {China, in its quest for a closer strategic partnership with Africa, has
   increasingly dynamic economic, political and diplomatic activities on
   the continent. Chinese leaders and strategists believe that China's
   historical experience and vision of economic development resonates
   powerfully with African counterparts and that the long-standing history
   of friendly political linkages and development co-operation offers a
   durable foundation for future partnership. Both in China and amongst
   some Western commentators a form of exceptionalism and generalisation
   regarding both China and Africa has been emerging. In this article
   instead we seek to develop theoretical tools for examining China as a
   geopolitical and geoeconomic actor that is both different and similar to
   other industrial powers intervening in Africa. This is premised on a
   political economy approach that ties together material interests with a
   deconstruction of the discursive or `extra-economic' ways by which
   Chinese capitalism internationalises. From there we use this framework
   to analyse contemporary Chinese engagement in Africa. We examine the
   changing historical position of Africa within Beijing's foreign policy
   strategy and China's vision of the evolving international political
   system, looking in particular at China's bilateral and state-centric
   approach to working with African `partners'. Chinese practice is
   uncomfortable and unfamiliar with the notion of `development' as an
   independent policy field of the kind that emerged among Western nations
   in the course of the 1950s and increasingly China has come to be viewed
   as a `rogue creditor' and a threat to the international aid industry.
   Rather than highlighting one strand of Chinese relations with African
   states (such as aid or governance) we propose here that it is necessary
   to critically reflect on the wider geopolitics of China-Africa relations
   (past and present) in order to understand how China is opening up new
   `choices' and altering the playing field for African development for the
   first time since the neo-liberal turn of the 1980s.},

Abstract = {The recent integration of communications services has revived the debate
   in US Congress whether regulation is required to prevent broadband
   operators from favoring signals running over their networks in terms of
   origin, nature or content. This chapter evaluates this debate, regarding
   the possible need for non-discriminatory or `net neutrality regulation,
   in the context of global interdependency and shows that (1) one of the
   most persistent preconceptions Worming the debate, that the Internet is
   information neutral due to its very architecture, is ill founded. At
   base, network neutrality is not about preserving technical principles,
   but about how to stimulate the development of the Internet in terms of
   open communications (Stimulating equal access) and innovation
   (stimulating freedom of choice). It shows that, contrary to a widespread
   belief (2) the current regulatory regime is well equipped to deal with
   the most harmful form of discrimination on the Internet: the outright
   blocking of content In addition, this chapter shows that (3) the scope
   of the current debate is too limited to come to a balanced judgment
   because it leads both sides in the debate to overvalue the US' ability
   to shape the (global) Internet of the future. Its focus on broadband
   networks ignores the potential of alternative technologies and its
   distinctive national focus ignores the transnational aspects of
   broadband regulation in a global context.
   The technical nature of the Internet requires a global implementation of
   policies in order to be effective. The interdependent nature of the
   Internet prevents States from shaping the global network at large
   unilaterally. This bears important strategic implications for national
   policy setting. Since in an interdependent context domestic policies
   immediately affect foreign actors and vice versa, national communication
   policies demand an evaluation in transnational terms. For the US, this
   translates into the economic question how to maintain technological and
   commercial leadership on the Internet. Simultaneously, it poses the
   political question how to overcome the democratic deficit caused by the
   lack of representation of affected foreign parties in national decision
   making.},

Abstract = {There is need for stakeholders to assess business in terms of its
   financial situation at each stage of an enterprise. There are plentiful
   options. You can use the analysis of financial ratios and different
   Benchmarking methods. It seems advantageous to use methods of
   comprehensive evaluation of the company from the perspective of
   interpretation. The resulting value can be clearly classified in the
   appropriate interval, and thus can predict the future of the company.
   Most currently used methods for comprehensive evaluation of the company
   were founded on the basis of mathematical-statistical methods.
   Contribution analyzes models most frequently mentioned in the
   literature. Advantages and disadvantages of using each method are
   summarized in each particular.
   In the second part the drawbacks addressed by the common attributes of
   all the mathematical and statistical methods. Of course, the use of
   probability and frequency limits the informative value of the
   mathematical and statistical methods.
   Moreover, mathematical and statistical models are becoming increasingly
   complex. Unfortunately, their informational value in any way grows
   substantially. The question therefore is whether to continue the
   development of evaluation methods on the basis of mathematical and
   statistical methods, or focus on other options such as neural networks.},

Abstract = {Objective
   This study investigates whether or not domestic violence agencies are
   located in areas of need. Recent research indicates that community
   economic disadvantage is a risk factor for intimate partner violence,
   but related questions regarding the geographic location of social
   service agencies have not been investigated.
   Methods
   Using Connecticut as a case study, we analyze the relationship of agency
   location and police-reported domestic violence incidents and assaults
   using OLS regression and correcting for spatial autocorrelation.
   Results
   The presence of an agency within a town has no relationship with the
   rates of domestic violence. However, regional patterns are evident.
   Conclusion
   Findings indicate that programs are not geographically mismatched with
   need, but neither are programs located in towns with higher rates of
   incidents or assaults. Future research and planning efforts should
   consider the geographic location of agencies.},

Abstract = {It was was shown previously that in the symmetric contest game of two
   players equilibrium bidding is lower in the case of private information
   than in the case of public information about the players costs I
   consider symmetric contests of an arbitrary number of players with
   continuously distributed private costs and discuss the existence and
   properties of equilibrium bidding functions I show that with more than
   two players the relationship between equilibrium bids in the cases of
   public and private information is no longer universal While high-cost
   players still bid less in the private information case relatively low
   cost players may bid above or below their corresponding public
   information bids (C) 2010 Elsevier BV All rights reserved},

Abstract = {We construct optimal growth models where labor resources can be
   allocated either to production, technology adoption or capital
   maintenance. We first characterize the balanced growth paths of a
   benchmark model without maintenance. Then we introduce maintenance
   activity via the depreciation rate of capital. We characterize the
   optimal allocation of labor across the three activities. Although
   maintenance deepens the technological gap by diverting labor resources
   from adoption, we show that it generally increases the long run output
   level. Moreover, we find that equilibrium maintenance and adoption
   efforts respond in opposite directions to policy or technology shocks.
   Finally, we find that the long-term output response to policy shocks is
   slightly higher in the presence of maintenance.},

Abstract = {In addition to the known effects of government fractionalization, we
   find that larger deficits are associated with a reduced likelihood of
   budgetary reforms. In a war of attrition setting, larger deficits
   signify stronger entitlements on the budget, generating unwillingness to
   impose self-discipline. A sense of crisis emerges only when
   macroeconomic imbalances appear. However, while a crisis creates the
   opportunity for reform, policy credibility is important for effectively
   using that opportunity. We find that one way of establishing credibility
   is by undertaking measures in opposition to the government's known
   ideological position - these presumably signal motivation by broader
   social welfare considerations.},

Abstract = {During the evangelical awakening of eighteenth-century Europe, numerous
   religious communities were founded in order to create a geographical
   space in which religious and social identities could be constructed,
   including several communities of the Moravian Church. This Protestant
   Episcopal Church was based in Germany, but expanded from the
   mid-eighteenth century throughout the colonial world in response to
   political turmoil. This paper traces the establishment of the Moravian
   town of Bethel in South Australia and the role of religion and ethnic
   backgrounds in the identification processes of Europeans in the British
   colonial world. It further analyses the role of politics both locally
   and internationally in the formation of such a settlement, and the
   dynamic exchange between the European headquarters of the Brethren and
   the ``colony{''} of Moravians in South Australia in order to demonstrate
   how interactions between migration and religion affected the European
   world.},

   good biography entails the author being able to combine both empathy and
   distance, as well as enough critical will to remove the distortions that
   ideological pressure and political passion could have poured over the

Abstract = {In this article we suggest, in the first place, that in the second half
   of the eighteenth century the Chilean creole elite enjoyed high degrees
   of administrative autonomy. This autonomy helped the vecinos to defend
   their rights and prerogatives in a corporative way. Secondly, we discuss
   the different scenarios in which the creoles defended their interests in
   relation to the Chilean governor, Francisco Antonio Garcia Carrasco.
   Thirdly, we study the creation of the national Junta of September 18,
   1810, and the political changes that its conformation brought about in
   Chilean society. The last section analyzes how the Junta planned a
   defensive system in 1810 and which was its role in the configuration of
   the frontiers of the Chilean territory.},

Abstract = {This paper estimates the incumbency effects in elections to the House of
   Representatives of 45 states in the United States using a
   quasi-experimental research method, regression discontinuity design
   (RDD). This design isolates the causal effect of incumbency from other
   contemporaneous factors, such as candidate quality, by comparing
   incumbents and non-incumbents in close contests. I find that incumbents
   in state legislative elections have a significant advantage, and this
   advantage serves as a strong barrier to re-entry of challengers who had
   previously been defeated. However, the incumbency advantage estimated
   using the RDD is much smaller than are the estimates using existing
   methods, implying a significant selection bias in the latter.},

Abstract = {How much inequality does market interaction generate? The answer to this
   question partly depends on the level of competition among economic
   agents. Yet, in their normative analysis of the market, theories of
   distributive justice focus on individual characteristics such as talents
   as determinants of income, and tend to ignore structural features such
   as competition. Economists, on the other hand, dispose of the conceptual
   tools to assess the distributive impact of competition, but their
   analysis is usually limited to allocative efficiency. Part I of the
   article distinguishes my argument from conventional perspectives on
   income inequality and redistribution. Whereas the latter propose either
   to redistribute income once the market interaction has taken place or to
   adjust the initial holdings of market participants, I focus on the
   distributive impact of the institutional structure of the market itself.
   Part II outlines the ways in which various forms of competition affect
   distribution. My objective here is descriptive in nature, but shows that
   a normative evaluation of the market has to take seriously the
   distributive impact of competition. This impact can be broken down into
   the analysis of three overlapping groups of economic agents, namely
   consumers, workers, and capital owners. Consumers potentially gain from
   competition in the form of lower prices, but these gains are only
   realized if competition does not put pressure on their work income at
   the same time. Unless competition squeezes profits unusually hard,
   capital owners tend to benefit from competition.},

Abstract = {Under the compensation system of the U.S. Armed Forces, members who are
   married or have dependents receive higher rates of pay and greater
   benefits than those who are single with no dependents. This article
   examines the hypothesis that these compensation policies induce earlier
   marriage by active-duty military members compared to otherwise similar
   civilians who have not served on active duty. Using a logistic
   regression model on American Community Survey data, the authors estimate
   the effect of active-duty military service on the probability of being
   married for twenty-three- to twenty-five-year-olds. Controlling for
   other factors affecting marriage rates, the authors find that the odds
   of being married were about three times greater for those with military
   service compared to similar civilians who have not served. For persons
   ever married, the probability of divorce is significantly greater for
   those who have served two or more years on active duty.},

Abstract = {This paper uses the Swedish municipal amalgamation reform of 1952 to
   study the common pool problem in politics. The amalgams were common
   pools and the municipalities had incentives to free-ride on their
   amalgam partners by increasing debt prior to amalgamation. We find that
   municipalities that merged in 1952 increased their debt between 1948 and
   1952 when the reform could be anticipated. The increase amounted to 52\%
   of new debt issued or 1.5\% of total revenues in the merged
   municipalities. But contrary to the ``law of 1/n{''}, free-riding did
   not increase in common pool size.},

Abstract = {This article examines the factors that lead governments to open up their
   public procurement markets to international competition with a
   particular emphasis on the effect of intra-industry trade. Contrary to
   the conventional notion that intra-industry trade entails less political
   pressure for protectionism than inter-industry trade, I argue that such
   notion does not prevail in the case of discriminatory public
   procurement. Firms in a market with a high degree of intra-industry
   trade are more likely to resist the removal of discrimination than would
   firms in a market with a high degree of inter-industry trade.
   Empirically, I find support for the argument both at sub-national and
   cross-national settings.},

Abstract = {Eleven years after the creation of the euro, this article surveys the
   international role of the European currency. The external representation
   of Eurozone has not yet reached its equilibrium point, and the relative
   economic weight of the area is bound to diminish in future years but
   this has not prevented the euro from gaining a prominent role on
   international financial markets. The euro has risen mainly as a reserve
   of value and as a regional currency but it has not become a competitor
   to the US dollar as a vehicle currency. Its development potential is
   still large, in particular if the markets for euro-denominated
   government securities were to be unified. A possible scenario would be
   the advent of a multi-centered system with several key currencies,
   including the dollar, the euro, and possibly the yen and the renminbi.
   The international monetary system would thus follow the rebalancing of
   economic power and this would solve the Triffin paradox, which threatens
   today the dominance of the dollar. The consequences for the exchange
   rate of the euro would be unclear, the link between the international
   status of a currency and its exchange rate being ambiguous. At most
   could the Europeans hope in such an environment that the exchange rate
   of the euro would better cushion the economic shocks faced by the
   Eurozone, which it has not really done so far.},

Abstract = {The paper deals with accumulation of foreign exchange reserves of
   central banks and its consequences in banking system liquidity
   management. In theoretical part the case of banking system liquidity
   surplus is analyzed focusing on creation of liquidity through FX
   operations, sterilization of liquidity and main sources of liquidity
   absorption. In this context it is analyzed how monetary policy
   instruments (on outright or repo basis) enable central bank to react on
   volatility of banking system liquidity needs and to cover issued
   currency in circulation and bank's reserves by net foreign assets. In
   empirical part these problems are analyzed and compared using the
   example of the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary. The paper focuses on
   main differences in the level of liquidity surplus, cost of
   sterilization, volatility of spread between O/N reference interest rate
   and main policy rate, main sources of liquidity absorption and dynamics
   of currency in circulation and reserves covering by net foreign assets.},

Abstract = {There is a puzzle at the heart of the history of the English criminal
   trial. Defendants accused of serious crimes were denied counsel, but not
   defendants accused of minor crimes. Why? Sir William Blackstone could
   find no explanation and denounced the rule as contrary to the ``face of
   reason.{''} This article proffers an answer. The rule is traced to the
   thirteenth century and a strong view of the royal prerogative. Royal
   interests were at stake, and counsel would not be permitted against the
   king acting ex officio. The rule seems to have been distinctly English;
   it does not appear to have been transplanted from the Roman-canon law.
   The rule continued in England, bolstered by new justifications, long
   after its original rationale had been forgotten.},

Abstract = {The article contests an argument that the creation of a capital market
   in educational ``human capital{''} and subsequent voluntary transactions
   on this market are sufficient to create equal opportunities in
   education, consequently reducing the income premium enjoyed by
   households with higher initial wealth endowment end eliminating
   deadweight detriments to efficiency caused by unequal household budget
   constraints. The counterargument is based on game-theoretical model
   developed in Bowles 2004. The inevitable incompleteness of contracts
   results in allocation inefficiency: agents with above average wealth
   endowment are able to finance larger projects, and/or projects of worse
   than average quality, while agents with insufficient initial wealth
   endowment are excluded from the financial market. This inefficiency can
   be attenuated only by redistribution enforced by the government. The
   article concludes with a discussion of the general relationship between
   equality (redistribution) and efficiency.},

Abstract = {This contribution considers the main paradigms of cultural economics,
   and their consequences in terms of research results and policies
   recommendations. The ``cost disease{''} is the first one analyzed. More
   relevant in the context of globalization and digitalization, the second
   paradigm deals with the structural uncertainty of the cultural goods
   resulting directly from their intrinsic creativity and novelty. The
   third part of this contribution analyzes the current arguments
   underlining the contribution of cultural activities to sustainable
   development. Finally, we present the logic of this special Issue and the
   contents of the corresponding contributions.},

Abstract = {This article aims at analysing how the September 11 terrorist attacks
   have caused the formation of a new geopolitical vision of an area called
   the `Greater Middle East' and how this formation has led to changes in
   US foreign policy towards this region. To do that, the article first
   presents a theoretical background against which the modern geopolitical
   imagination of the USA is formulated. It considers the links between
   national traumas/myths, geopolitical codes and visions, and foreign
   policy actions. The article then applies this analysis to the case of
   the Greater Middle East with respect to how this imagined geography
   shapes the foreign and security policy of the USA. It concludes that
   even though this imagined region has been presented in texts as
   justifying US-led policies with liberal underpinnings, it has in reality
   laid the ground for and been used for justifying US extra-territorial
   intervention in the region.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY \& POLITICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {7},
Number = {4},
Pages = {263-283},
Abstract = {In recent years, a new realm has appeared for the study of political and
   sociological phenomena: the Internet. This article will analyze the
   decision-making processes of one of the largest online communities,
   Wikipedia. Founded in 2001, Wikipedia-now among the top-10 most popular
   sites on the Internet-has succeeded in attracting and organizing
   millions of volunteers and creating the world's largest encyclopedia. To
   date, however, little study has been done of Wikipedia's governance.
   There is substantial confusion about its decision-making structure. The
   organization's governance has been compared to many decision-making and
   political systems-from democracy to dictatorship, from bureaucracy to
   anarchy. It is the purpose of this article to go beyond the earlier
   simplistic descriptions of Wikipedia's governance in order to advance
   the study of online governance, and of organizations more generally. As
   the evidence will show, while Wikipedia's governance shows elements
   common to many traditional governance models, it appears to be closest
   to the organizational structure known as adhocracy.},

   DISCOUNT},
Journal = {POLITICKA EKONOMIE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {58},
Number = {3},
Pages = {291-304},
Abstract = {A social rate of discount is an important variable for cost-benefit
   analysis. Its size can be crucial for an approval (or disapproval) of
   the project under evaluation, therefore it is important to have a
   theoretically founded estimate of the discount rate. There are two main
   approaches to estimating the social rate of discount. The first one is a
   so called social time preference rate (STPR), which is composed of three
   components: pure time preference, mortality rate and a component
   reflecting secular growth of per capita consumption and wealth. We agree
   with other authors that although pure time preference is not in reality
   zero for individuals due to myopia and irrationality, it should be equal
   to zero from the point of view of the public sector. We have also shown
   why it is inconsistent to use mortality rate directly as a component of
   the STPR and why a somewhat lower rate should be used instead. These two
   components together with an estimate of gradually decreasing growth of
   per capita consumption give a gradually decreasing STPR for the Czech
   Republic starting at 5.4 \% and converging in 40 years' period to 2.8 \%
   per year. The other approach to estimating the social discount rate is
   based on social opportunity costs (SOC). We used long-term bond yields
   for estimating a certainty equivalent social discount rate. We found
   gradually decreasing discount rate as appropriate, which starts at 3.2
   \% and declines by 0.016 percentage points per every year of duration of
   the project.},

Abstract = {Critical discussion of Lenin's What Is to Be Done? is hindered by a
   series of historical myths. Issues such as the following need to be
   studied more empirically and more critically: Did the attitudes of early
   readers of WITBD? reflect Lenin's alleged `worry about workers'? Did the
   events of 1905 cause Lenin to renounce his earlier views about the
   workers and about party-organisation, giving rise to disputes with
   Bolshevik activists? Did either Lenin or Trotsky ever rethink and reject
   the ideological positions that Karl Kautsky defended before World-War I?
   These and related issues are addressed with close attention to
   source-material.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on the French republican political thought at the
   beginning of the Third French Republic. After Louis Napoleon's `coup
   d'etat', the republicans tried to establish strong intellectual
   foundations for a future republic. This needed to be a stable regime
   that would not repeat neither the revolutionary excesses of the Terror
   period, nor the authoritarian solutions of Bonapartism Bearing this in
   mind, the intellectual founders of the Third Republic had to face the
   legacy of 1789 and, therefore, had to establish a republican memory
   capable of integrating all those who, during most of the nineteenth
   century, had been lured by the revolution: namely, the mission was to
   face the spectres that threatened the republics in France.},

Booktitle = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2010},
Pages = {105-117},
Abstract = {We present an assessment of net financial benefits for the U.S. and the
   European Monetary Union (EMU) against the rest of the world (ROW). While
   other assessments of regional integration in the Global economy are
   possible, NAFTA and EMU affects nearly 40 percent of world trade. The
   assessment results from Computational General Equilibrium (CGE) method
   using GTAP data sets. On balance, we find positive net benefits, which
   tend to decline in the EMU after the initial impact. A popular
   explanation is that the benefits for a currency union can be sourced to
   the saving from having a single currency. Another explanation is that
   profits fall as convergence takes place. Overall, globalization reflects
   reduction of interest rates, deficits, and unemployment rates.},

Abstract = {In this paper I trace the many debates about the past, and its
   relationship with the present and the future, that have eddied around
   Rome over the last two centuries. I spend quite a bit of time
   illustrating the Catholic line on the ``eternal city{''} and on its
   contestation from, first, Italian nationalist and then more imperialist
   and Fascist expositions of ``sites of memory{''} there. After
   ``liberation{''} in 1944, there were new approaches to elucidating the
   city's meaning, headed by the ``myth of Anti-Fascism{''} and extending
   to a left terrorist reading by the Red Brigades. In recent years,
   ``post-fascism{''} has grown in importance in Italy's capital,
   especially as embodied by the mayor since 2008, Gianni Alemanno. These
   ideological and politically inspired reckonings of history have squared
   uneasily with the more popular comprehension of the place of the past,
   all the more given that Rome has been in rapid growth, first from within
   Italy and nowadays from across the globe. Specific urban groups, notably
   the city's Jews, have also read history in their own manner. In sum,
   Rome has not been a venue for a simple, two sided, ``culture war{''}, as
   cliche assures us is our fate in Australia. Rather, as is also true
   here, Rome has proved a site of constant and multi-fronted arguments
   about the meaning of history, as should be true of any serious
   democracy.},

Abstract = {The European Union directive on Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement
   (IPRED) was implemented in Sweden on April 1, 2009, and was meant to be
   the enforcement needed to achieve increased compliance with intellectual
   property online, especially copyright. This, therefore, was the manifest
   function of the directive. The article empirically shows changes in
   levels of use of Online Anonymity Services (OAS) as a result of the
   implementation of IPRED in Sweden, as being a latent dysfunction of the
   implementation The data consists of two surveys of about 1,000 people
   between 15 and 25 years of age, where the first survey was conducted two
   months prior to the implementation of IPRED, and the second one seven
   months afterwards. This data is complemented with OAS statistics as well
   as Google search engine statistics in Sweden during 2009 on a selection
   of phrases related to online anonymity, revealing the link between
   encrypted anonymity fluctuations and copyright enforcement.
   The article suggests that a key to understand any relationship between
   IPRED and fluctuations in online anonymity can be found in the law's
   relationship to social norms and levels of perceived legitimacy. The
   implementation of illegitimate laws is likely to spur dysfunctional (for
   the law) counter-measures. In the case of copyright enforcement and
   encryption technologies, the first seems to drive the other to some
   extent, affecting the balance of openness and anonymity on the Internet,
   possibly and at worst leading to that the enforcement of legislation
   that has a weak representation among social norms negatively affects the
   enforcement of legislation that has a strong representation among social
   norms.},

Title = {Reassessing the Impact of Hispanic Stereotypes on White Americans'
   Immigration Preferences},
Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {91},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1312-1328},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Objectives
   There is disagreement in the literature on immigration attitudes
   regarding the relative importance of ethnic stereotypes and more general
   cultural and economic concerns about increasing immigration in the
   formation of those attitudes. We argue that the impact of stereotypes
   relative to these other factors may have been underestimated for a
   variety of reasons.
   Methods
   We test the impact of stereotypes on immigration preferences in data
   from the Multi-Ethnic Module of the 2000 General Social Survey. Because
   the dependent variables analyzed herein are ordinal, we estimate ordered
   logistic regressions that correct for diagnosed hetereoskedacticity.
   Results
   Statistical analyses confirm that negative stereotypes are a
   significantly larger predictor of ethnicity-specific immigration
   preferences relative to general attitudes about immigration. Intervening
   variables analyses also suggest that the impact of stereotypes has been
   underestimated relative to cultural and economic anxieties because these
   variables significantly mediate its observed impact.
   Conclusions
   The results suggest that ethnic stereotypes are significantly more
   important in determining immigration preferences among Americans than
   has been reported in previous research.},

Abstract = {More than a century elapsed between Australia's first legislative
   attempts to modify anticompetitive behaviour (the Australian Industries
   Preservation Act 1906) and its most recent efforts to criminalise price
   fixing (Trade Practices Amendment (Cartel Conduct and Other Measures)
   Act 2009). After a burst of activity in the first decade of Federation,
   the intervening years saw only sporadic interest by governments to
   promote competitive markets, with limited impact until the late 1960s.
   This paper assesses the first period of Australia's attempts to promote
   competition. It traces the political, economic and social environments
   of anticompetitive business behaviour in Australia from 1901 up to World
   War I. We suggest that Australia's initial forays into regulating
   cartels were motivated more by protectionist aims than by efforts to
   increase competition, which in part also explains the next half-century
   of legislative apathy towards anti-competitive legislation.},

Abstract = {This paper illustrates a new theoretical case for a strategic R\&D
   policy in a two-country third-market international oligopoly model.
   Asymmetric treatment of domestic firms through a non-uniform R\&D policy
   can create aggregate profits without a foreign retaliation concern and
   further improve national welfare in addition to what a uniform policy
   accomplishes. This effect occurs when the conventional Brander-Spencer
   incentive is entirely absent as well as when the uniformly optimal R\&D
   policy initially prevailed. The superiority of non-uniform policy to
   uniform-policy is not guaranteed, however, when the number of firms
   becomes endogenous.},

Abstract = {This study is focused on the influence of late-night TV comedy viewing
   on political talk. It is posited that debate viewing serves as a
   mediator of this relationship, and age is argued to be a moderator of
   the association between late-night TV comedy viewing and debate viewing.
   More specific to age, it is hypothesized that the predictive value of
   late-night TV comedy for political debate consumption will be greater
   for those audience members who are younger. A secondary analysis of 2004
   national Annenberg debate panel data provides evidence of a positive
   indirect effect of late-night TV comedy viewing on political talk
   through debate viewing, and the moderator of age functioned as
   predicted. Thus, this study details a series of positive unintended
   consequences of late-night TV comedy viewing on what are defined
   normatively as positive democratic communicative activities (i.e.,
   debate viewing, political discussion), and these media effects are
   stronger the younger the voter.},

Abstract = {This study examines the effect of news priming, which refers to the
   media's influence on the standards by which the public evaluates
   political figures. Linking survey data to an analysis of issue coverage,
   we look into whether television news in South Korea affects the way
   citizens evaluate the president. Our findings provided support for the
   priming hypothesis. There was a close correspondence between prominent
   issues in the news and important dimensions of presidential evaluation
   among the respondents. We also found that priming effects were largely a
   function of recent, rather than cumulative, news coverage. Finally,
   findings indicated that people with different levels of news exposure
   were responding to the media within different time frames.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The efficiency of mechanisms to control activities with negative
   externalities is limited by uncertainty about the social costs of these
   activities. Existing regulatory mechanisms require negotiated compromise
   about either the prices of activities or the levels to be tolerated. We
   offer a mechanism in which today's price of an activity is a
   market-based estimate of future informed beliefs about the social cost
   of today's activity. This can be expected to increase the precision and
   accuracy of estimates of the right price and to make it likely that
   agents will base their decisions on better estimates of the harm they
   cause. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract = {In this article, we compare online sales of books to sales in physical
   stores in France during the period March-August 2006. This is the first
   work that characterizes the distribution of book sales in France and
   that analyzes the dynamic interactions between physical and online sales
   of books in new state. We first show that the distributions of sales are
   different between online and physical sales. The is evidence of a long
   tail for online sales, not only in terms of catalogues, but also in
   terms of volume of sales. Secondly, for 58\% of the 20\% of books that
   belong to the best selling list on both platforms, we observe temporal
   shifts between the time a given book enters the best selling list in
   physical stores and online. Finally, we show that sales in independent
   bookstores have a positive effect on online sales, while online sales
   only have a marginal effect on sales in physical stores. Prescription of
   online purchases seems limited.},

Abstract = {Newspapers confront an acute dilemma: how to give citizens more of what
   they need in a democracy-more than citizens now know enough to demand in
   the marketplace. The more news production strays from the core function
   of enhancing democracy, the more potential consumers learn they have
   little reason to invest their free time consuming serious political
   journalism. So they don't,and newspapers and the stock market continue
   redirecting their resources. To counter this, industry observers have
   been urging non-profit business models. Yet even in this scenario,
   maintaining their watchdog function requires newspapers to support
   staffs large enough to investigate the powerful. Therefore, this essay
   argues, even a non-profit newspaper industry should still pursue mass
   audiences. Building on a synthesis of scholarly findings, this article
   suggests ways of doing political journalism that respond to changing
   audience interests and ever-growing alternatives to traditional daily
   newspapers-while remaining true to the higher ideals of watchdog
   journalism. To illustrate pitfalls of current practice and benefits of
   innovation it analyzes news about global warming.},

Abstract = {The notion of financialisation as the exploitation or expropriation of
   workers' wages in the sphere of exchange is taken as a critical point of
   departure. In this way, financialisation is more deeply rooted in
   contemporary developments, including the slowdown preceding the current
   global crisis, and in Marx's own theory of finance. Financialisation is
   seen to represent the increasing penetration of interest-bearing capital
   across economic and social reproduction and to be a key defining moment
   of neoliberalism.},

Abstract = {The municipal administration of Dr Ernest Ferroul in the southern French
   city of Narbonne during the late nineteenth and early twentieth
   centuries reflected the contradictions within the French socialist
   movement regarding the purpose of socialist municipalities. While
   frequently proclaiming violent revolutionary intentions, Ferroul
   primarily concentrated on issues of local improvements and symbolic
   gestures of worker solidarity. This concentration was influenced by the
   local ideological tradition of the republique democratique et sociale,
   the desire, born during the political struggles of the Second Republic,
   to create a local government controlled by `the people' that would
   govern with their interests foremost in mind. The centralized state had
   smashed earlier attempts to assert local popular political autonomy and
   did its best to frustrate Ferroul's similar efforts. But the limited
   successes that he did achieve illustrated his commitment to creating a
   local government that put the well-being of `the people' first.
   Moreover, the negative response by national authorities highlighted the
   continued validity and value of his efforts to achieve popular political
   control at the local level.},

Title = {Whose Views Made the News? Media Coverage and the March to War in Iraq},
Journal = {POLITICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {27},
Number = {1},
Pages = {59-87},
Abstract = {Criticism of the news media's performance in the months before the 2003
   Iraq War has been profuse. Scholars, commentators, and journalists
   themselves have argued that the media aided the Bush administration in
   its march to war by failing to air a wide-ranging debate that offered
   analysis and commentary from diverse perspectives. As a result, critics
   say, the public was denied the opportunity to weigh the claims of those
   arguing both for and against military action in Iraq. We report the
   results of a systematic analysis of every ABC, CBS, and NBC Iraq-related
   evening news story1,434 in allin the 8 months before the invasion
   (August 1, 2002, through March 19, 2003). We find that news coverage
   conformed in some ways to the conventional wisdom: Bush administration
   officials were the most frequently quoted sources, the voices of
   anti-war groups and opposition Democrats were barely audible, and the
   overall thrust of coverage favored a pro-war perspective. But while
   domestic dissent on the war was minimal, opposition from abroadin
   particular, from Iraq and officials from countries such as France, who
   argued for a diplomatic solution to the standoffwas commonly reported on
   the networks. Our findings suggest that media researchers should further
   examine the inclusion of non-U.S. views on high-profile foreign policy
   debates, and they also raise important questions about how the news
   filters the communications of political actors and refractsrather than
   merely reflectsthe contours of debate.},

Abstract = {This article clarifies and delivers a better understanding of the
   difference between cultural value and economic value, and of the process
   through which a change in the cultural value of an item changes the
   economic valuation of that item. Sometimes the cultural value of visual
   works, music scores and texts might be safely ignored by economists were
   it sufficiently isolated from the value created in currency-using
   exchanges. But more generally, there is reason to believe that the two
   varieties of value are interdependent. The economic and artistic
   histories of three paintings are analyzed that show how the cultural
   value of certain items determines their economic value. Raffaello
   Sanzio's ``Madonna of the Pinks{''} shows how the increase of cultural
   value creates a corresponding increase in economic value. Rembrandt's
   ``Man in a Golden Helmet{''} shows an opposed example. Jackson Pollock's
   ``Number 12, 1949{''} illustrates the progressive formation of both
   artistic and economic value. The cases selected should be understood as
   early empirical probes into a yet unexplored scientific territory.},

Abstract = {The paper is concerned with the famous study ``The Protestant Ethic and
   the Spirit of Capitalism{''} (1904/1905) by Max Weber. It analyzes both
   main content and context of this work. It is shown that the main idea of
   the ``Protestant Ethic{''} is not originally one of Weber, but it was
   taken over from Sombart and Troeltsch. Weber was significantly
   influenced - similarly as in his other works - by his environment and
   contemporaries. The article describes critical reactions of German
   historians towards ``Protestant Ethic{''} and reserved attitudes of the
   Catholics.},

Abstract = {In this work, the author discusses the Fundamental Rights Restrictions
   which are a main topic within the Dogmatics of the Fundamental Rights
   Firstly, a concept of those restrictions is given. Then, different
   classifications are analyzed, using criteria related to the
   circumstances under which the restrictions are applied, the origin of
   the restrictions, and the norm where those limitations are stated or
   mentioned.
   Regarding the requirements these restrictions must fulfill in order to
   be considered as legitimate, the author mentions competence,
   international, material, and logic conditions.
   Finally, it is proposed the existence of what the author calls ``factual
   restrictions{''} on the fundamental rights. These restrictions are
   represented by illegitimate restrictions on the rights, established or
   tolerated by the institutionality of the state. This is especially the
   case of the sentences imposed by the Courts of Law which recognize these
   restrictions with the authority of res judicata.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the effect of capital market integration (CMI)
   on capital taxes in a political economy framework in which policy is
   influenced by lobbying of interest groups CMI increases the efficiency
   cost of the capital tax which Introduces incentives to reduce the tax
   rate but also reduces lobbying by owners of capitalists which introduces
   countering incentives to increase the tax rate CM! can therefore result
   in a higher capital tax rate When the market share of each country is
   small CH may increase government supply of public goods and enhance
   efficiency which implies that, in the presence of policy endogeneity
   through lobbying decentralized policymaking can be more efficient than
   centralized policymaking (C) 2010 Elsevier BV All rights reserved},

Volume = {91},
Number = {4},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Objectives
   To determine how frequently disciplinary terminology moves from
   discipline to discipline and to measure how long it takes for a term to
   be established in another discipline.
   Methods
   Using sociology and political science as case studies, core concepts in
   each discipline are identified and their usage in the home and the other
   (adoptive) discipline assessed through a content analysis of three top
   journals in each field.
   Results
   Movement of concepts between the two disciplines is sparse, though
   political science is more of a borrower from sociology than the reverse.
   Conclusions
   Interdisciplinary ideas have not been likely to flourish in leading
   disciplinary outlets over the past century, and there seems to be little
   reason to expect major departures from the patterns documented here.},

Title = {WHAT MAKES INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL FLOWS PROMOTE ECONOMIC GROWTH? AN
   INTERNATIONAL CROSS-COUNTRY ANALYSIS},
Journal = {SCOTTISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {57},
Number = {5},
Pages = {515-546},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This paper re-examines the relationship between international capital
   flows and economic growth within the context of various `conditional
   factors' that possibly have the potential to influence such
   relationships. It achieves this by employing panel data for 80 countries
   that cover 1976-2007. International capital inflow is broken down into
   foreign direct investments (FDI) and foreign portfolio investments
   (FPI). We find interesting evidence that only FDI has a positive effect
   on growth and that FPI has an unfavorable, if not negative, effect on
   growth. The conditional variables of banking liberalization, high-income
   level, twin crises, lower corruption, and human capital mitigate the
   positive impacts of FDI on growth. In contrast, the middle-income level
   and good shareholder protection have a positive effect. As concerns FPI,
   the level of financial liberalization, being in a Latin American region,
   the wealth of countries, and market governance all influence the way
   that FPI affects growth, whereas the conditional variables of twin
   crises and human capital do not influence the effect of FPI on economic
   growth.},

Abstract = {Relying on the specific example of ultimatum bargaining experiments this
   paper explores the possible role of empirical knowledge of behavioural
   ``norm(ative) facts{''} within the search for (W)RE - (Wide) Reflective
   Equilibria on normative issues. Assuming that ``pro-social{''} behaviour
   ``reveals{''} moral orientations, it is argued that these
   ``norm-facts{''} can and should be used along with stated preferences in
   justificatory arguments of normative ethics and economics of the ``means
   to given ends{''} variety. At the same time behavioural norm-facts are
   so heterogeneous that any hopes to reach an inter-personally agreed
   (W)RE in matters moral seem futile. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {After a short literature review, the paper quantifies the turnover of
   organized crime with the help of a MIMIC estimation procedure for the
   years 1995 to 2006 for 20 highly developed OECD countries. The volume of
   turnover from organized crime was US-\$ 270 billion in the year 1995 for
   these 20 OECD countries, rising to \$ 614 billion in 2006. The worldwide
   turnover in organized crime had a value of \$ 595 billion in 2001 and
   rose to \$ 790 billion in 2006. These figures are very preliminary but
   clearly indicate the importance of the turnover of organized crime or
   the extent of money laundering.},

Abstract = {During the past two decades, a new immigrants' rights movement in the
   U.S. has emerged, constructing a counterpublic that challenges hegemonic
   immigration discourses, policies, and practices. We show how a
   counterpublic is constructed in practice, using as a case study the
   Immigrant Workers' Freedom Ride (IWFR), an event in 2003 that helped
   further the momentum of immigrant rights activism. We examine how
   immigrant activists and their allies came together and worked to
   construct, articulate, and enact a shared political identity that we
   refer to as an identity-in-alliance. Space-time and emotions were
   crucial in the development of this identity as `Freedom Riders,' as well
   as a sense of solidarity. We reflect on the vulnerabilities within the
   counterpublic and challenges it faced when inserting its discourses on
   immigration, race, and citizenship into the hegemonic public sphere.
   Taking the insights gained from these practices, we extend Nancy
   Fraser's concept of the counterpublic by demonstrating the centrality of
   space-time and emotions to its theorization. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {The Khrushchev era brought a policy of religious repression in response
   to a resurgence of religious adherence after WWII. But a close
   evaluation of archival sources reveals distinctive features to its
   implementation in the Baltics, compared with other parts of the USSR and
   with the Orthodox Church. The study richly describes the erosion of
   church institutional interests, such as maintenance of registered
   churches and clergy, legal and financial autonomy, publications and
   theological education. But having adapted to their national context,
   republic-level state officials often pursued the campaign
   disproportionately against non-national churches, such as Catholics and
   so-called sects, thereby provoking bureaucratic tensions with party
   hardliners, both in Moscow and at the republic level. Motivated by its
   heightened anti-Vatican stance, Moscow's foreign policy opening-to the
   World Council of Churches, Lutheran World Federation, and the German
   churches-brought the Lutheran churches limited leverage against
   reluctant local and republic officials.},

Abstract = {The transparency and openness of the monetary policy-making process at
   the Bank of England has provided very detailed information on both the
   decisions of individual members of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC)
   and the information on which they are based. In this paper, we consider
   this decision-making process in the context of a model in which
   inflation forecast targeting is used, but there is heterogeneity among
   the members of the committee. We find that rational partisan theory can
   explain spatial voting behavior under forecast uncertainty about the
   output gap. Internally generated forecasts of output and
   market-generated expectations of medium-term inflation provide the best
   description of discrete changes in interest rates, in combination with
   uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment. There is also a role for
   developments in asset, housing and labor markets. Further, spatial
   voting patterns clearly differentiate between internally and externally
   apzpointed members of the MPC. The results have important implications
   for committee design and the conduct of monetary policy.},

Abstract = {After the end of the Civil War, the Franco regime tried to consolidate
   itself in the tragic socioeconomic context of the post-war years. How
   was it possible for a regime to establish and implant itself in spite of
   an economic crisis and a desperate and undernourished population? As
   this article demonstrates, a brutal policy of autarky underpinned the
   consolidation of Francoism. Through the daily mechanisms of autarky and
   the black market to which it gave rise, the `New State' and its local
   representatives repressed their Civil War opponents on a daily basis. At
   the same time, the regime secured the consent of its local supporters by
   offering them the chance to feather their own nests. In this way, hunger
   formed the ballast of the new ship of state because the regime was able
   to force some into starvation while allowing others to profit through
   the control of much needed resources.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to explore the ways politicians characterize and think
   about the relationships they sustain with journalists, using a case
   study approach that focuses on the views and attitudes of New Zealand
   MPs towards members of the Press Gallery and, to a lesser extent, their
   local and regional news media. Undertaken over a twenty-four-month
   period, with two fieldwork phases, 62 of 121 MPs were interviewed. The
   broad findings suggest that MPs are relatively sanguine about their
   media relationships, recognizing their symbiotic nature, but clear
   differences emerged in terms of the complexity and friendliness of these
   relationships. Those differences can be accounted for primarily by way
   of personal style and preferences, on one hand, and party status and
   position, on the other: factors such as gender (either of the politician
   or the journalist) were not significant as determinants of difference,
   although women were more likely to characterize their relationships as
   ``friendly{''} compared with men, who tended to use more neutral
   language such as ``collegial.{''}},

Abstract = {I discuss Elinor (Lin) Ostrom's long journey into complex social systems
   and draw attention to her reliance on induction and the methods of
   experimental science. In her own words, the simple ``organism{''} she
   has experimented on is a particular type of human situation-the common
   pool situation. I compare the philosophy of science associated with the
   European Enlightenment to Lin's approach. I discuss the implication of
   problem difficulty and complexity for institutional policy, and conclude
   by comparing the tragedy of the commons to the tragedy of the
   anticommons, claiming that little is known empirically about the
   existence of the latter phenomenon.},

Abstract = {Whether, and to what degree, the publication of poll results might
   influence the opinions of the public is a much-debated subject. While
   many effect-studies of polls have looked at the voting context, this
   study is an empirical investigation into the effects of poll information
   on personal opinions and perceptions of collective opinion on five
   nonelectoral, though politically relevant issues (independence of the
   Flemish region in Belgium, retirement income, immigration policy,
   purchasing power, and health-care solidarity). An experimental study was
   conducted in which poll information was integrated into a survey of a
   randomly selected group of respondents in order to test the overall
   impact of poll results on opinions, as well as the differential effects
   depending on individual characteristics, such as opinion strength,
   political interest, and perceived poll influence. Furthermore, a
   two-wave panel design was used to investigate the duration and
   repeatability of the poll effects. It was successively found in both
   waves and consistently for all issues that exposure to poll information
   primarily affected the perceptions of collective opinion, while the
   personal opinions on political issues remained unaffected. This poll
   effect on the perceptions of collective opinion was observed not only
   shortly after being exposed to the poll information, but also three
   months later.},

Abstract = {Objectives
   The idea that immigration increases crime rates has historically
   occupied an important role in criminological theory and has been central
   to the public and political discourses and debates on immigration
   policy. In contrast to the common sentiment, some scholars have recently
   questioned whether the increase in immigration between 1990 and 2000 may
   have actually been responsible for part of the national decrease in
   crime during the 1990s. The current work evaluates the influence of
   immigration on crime in urban areas across the United States between
   1990 and 2000.
   Methods
   Drawing on U.S. Census and Uniform Crime Report data, I first use
   ordinary least squares regression models to assess the cross-sectional
   relationship between immigration patterns and rates of homicide and
   robbery among U.S. cities with populations of at least 50,000. Second, I
   employ pooled cross-sectional time-series models to determine how
   changes in immigration influenced changes in homicide and robbery rates
   between 1990 and 2000.
   Results
   In the ordinary least squares models, immigration is associated with
   higher levels of homicide and robbery. However, the pooled
   cross-sectional time-series models suggest that cities with the largest
   increases in immigration between 1990 and 2000 experienced the largest
   decreases in homicide and robbery during the same time period.
   Conclusion
   The findings offer insights into the complex relationship between
   immigration and crime and suggest that growth in immigration may have
   been responsible for part of the precipitous crime drop of the 1990s.},

Abstract = {We demonstrate that deregulation in the form of vertical separation of
   network components into natural monopoly and potentially competitive
   markets does not truly represent a lessening of regulatory burdens. That
   is, vertical separation is not synonymous with deregulation; ``more
   competitors{''} is not equivalent to ``more competition{''}. We assume a
   public interest regulator that is constrained to set a unit price that
   maximizes expected welfare subject to a break-even constraint. We show
   that under both symmetric and asymmetric information cases the
   information demands on the regulator of the vertically integrated system
   are no greater than those in the case of vertical separation.},

Journal = {GEOPOLITICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Pages = {516-535},
Abstract = {In this article, we depict climate as an issue which deterritorialises
   existing geopolitical realities in a manner which suits the discourses
   of both elite science and corporate globalisation. In this
   deterritorialisation, the politics of place, of difference, are removed;
   the divisions between North and South - the Minority and Majority Worlds
   - must melt away as all peoples become citizen-consumers in need of a
   morally conservative (using global archetypal myths of flood and fire)
   but economically neo-liberal global soul with which to confront the
   global nemesis of climate change. This deterritorialisation is
   constructed from a Northern (particularly a Western European) position.
   It emerges from post-material and post-industrial environmental
   discourses, largely ignoring the discourses and frames of post-colonial
   environmentalism (and environmental debt) which are far more appropriate
   when describing the environmental and developmental realities of the
   Global South. In the article, we introduce the case of India, as both
   its civil society and governments wrestle with the new realities of the
   global climate change agenda. We show how India's official framing of
   climate change discourse, overwhelmingly dictated and driven by the
   imperatives of economic growth, continues to oscillate between the
   `scientific' underpinnings of deterritorialised-global representations
   of climate change and the growing trends to reterritorialise
   multifaceted climate space through geopolitical-geoeconomic reasonings.},

Abstract = {When we wonder about the ability of cultural activities to sustain
   economic development, it looks relevant to assess the ability of
   cultural enterprises to develop and survive. Considering the INSEE data
   base on New Enterprises {[}SINE, 1998-2003], this contribution
   demonstrates three results.
   The rate of survival of new cultural enterprises is not actually
   different from the mainstream enterprise one: But some differences
   appear in terms of cultural subsectors. Whereas visual and live arts
   enterprises face difficult beginnings - due to the artisan or notoriety
   risk - audiovisual enterprises face better prospect. The opposite will
   appear after the three years when they face the industrial risk or the
   ability to change their own structure according to the need to satisfy
   new wants and design new organizations.
   A second important result deals with the role of the banks: When they
   look able to assess the potential prospect of any cultural enterprises,
   their financial support can discriminate against their survival due to
   the corresponding financial burden.
   Finally, cultural enterprises survival relies on the nature of their
   environment: linked to similar enterprises, they face an important
   competition effect; connected with other types of cultural enterprises
   they benefit from an important synergy effect. These conclusions support
   the case for new cultural policies designs.},

Abstract = {This article explores institutional influences on Russian news media at
   the regional level and adopts a new institutional approach to help
   explain media's response to increased control by local elites. Media in
   the province operate partly in a clientelist system in which journalists
   and their organizations provide services to political and economic
   elites in the region in exchange for desperately needed resources. The
   poor economic condition of the province and the strongly centralized
   local government help explain the media's dependency on elite patrons.
   Yet, the clientelist model is not a perfect fit. Strong influence by
   local powers tends to erode newspapers' public legitimacy, which both
   newspapers and the area's elite also need. To stem this erosion, news
   organizations attempt to buffer themselves from clientelist influences
   by pursuing practices that reflect the legal-rational ideal type. They
   pursue ceremonial, skin-deep scrutiny of officials; they engage in
   artificial forum oroundtableso with officials; and they emphasize the
   publication of many brief stories to connote progressiveness.
   Journalists also maintain connections across news organizations, which
   undermines the organizational boundaries of the newspapers and helps
   patrons establish individual relationships with journalists, but also
   allows some semblance of an occupational community.},

Abstract = {This intervention aims to question the opposition between a `politics of
   immanence' and a `politics of transcendence' through a critical
   assessment of some contemporary philosophical approaches to politics and
   a reappraisal of Mario Tronti's account of the autonomy of the
   political. I shall argue that the contrast between immanence and
   transcendence is ultimately politically disabling, as it fails to
   provide an adequate position from which to situate a political thinking
   and practice.},

   Constitutional Law consists of the fundamental character of some rights

   cultural rights which reserved applicability, indirect effectiveness, as
   well as its relative actionability are established. This work offers
   some arguments that allow to preach and order, from the juridic
   viewpoint, the necessary and possible recognition of the fundamental
   value of those rights, since they should be conceived as conclusive to
   the real and All affirmation of human dignity.},

Journal = {GEOPOLITICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Pages = {109-132},
Abstract = {This article analyses the ingredients of empire as a pattern of order
   with geopolitical effects. Noting the imperial form's proclivity for
   expansion from a critical reading of historical sociology, the article
   argues that the principal manifestation of earlier geopolitics lay not
   in the nation but in empire. That in turn has been driven by a view of
   the world as disorderly and open to the ordering will of empires
   (emanating, at the time of geopolitics' inception, from Europe). One
   implication is that empires are likely to figure in the geopolitical
   ordering of the globe at all times, in particular after all that has
   happened in the late twentieth century to undermine nationalism and the
   national state. Empire is indeed a probable, even for some an attractive
   form of regime for extending order over the disorder produced by
   globalisation. Geopolitics articulated in imperial expansion is likely
   to be found in the present and in the future - the EU, and still more
   obviously the USA exhibiting the form in contemporary guise. This does
   not mean that empires figure in geopolitics simply by extending their
   own order, however; they are at least as much purveyors of other
   dynamics and orders, which possess their own discrete effects. The
   article ends with stipulations regarding the variety of forms that
   empires may take: neither fully bounded nor centred; neither
   straightforwardly self-serving nor easily made legitimate.},

Abstract = {The 2007 CNN-YouTube Presidential Candidate Debates provided a unique
   opportunity for Americans to engage in national political discussion.
   For the first time in American political history, the public was invited
   into national debate discourse through submissions of video questions to
   YouTube for possible inclusion in two nationally broadcast candidate
   debates. Content analysis was used to examine the nearly 8,000
   submissions to uncover both the demographic populations represented and
   the submitted questions' characteristics to determine if the debates
   provided a viable method for increasing citizen mobilization and
   redefining democratic participation in the Internet Age. Results
   indicate that traditionally politically underrepresented or disengaged
   populations were present in a significant number of submissions and that
   the submissions were politically substantive.},

Abstract = {Financial risk modeling, measuring, and managing are an inherent part of
   management in financial institutions. It is also an important step
   within the setting of optimal level of capital eligible to cover risk
   exposures. A significant portion of capital is usually assigned to cover
   the risk of unexpected changes in FX rates. FX rates (the returns)
   commonly exhibit significant skewness and relatively huge kurtosis. In
   this paper, we apply subordinated Levy models coupled together by
   ordinary elliptical copula functions in order to estimate the FX rate
   risk of normalized portfolio. Selected models are applied in order to
   estimate the risk ex-post, as well as ex-ante. The models are also
   compared to the more standard assumption of the joint normal
   distribution. Although the results for both types of modeling are quite
   different and Levy measure is ignored, suggested models deliver us
   improved risk estimation.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the different characteristics of fiscal policy using
   a two-step estimation procedure First, we decompose both government
   spending and government revenue into three components responsiveness,
   persistence and discretion Second, we assess the determinants of these
   characteristics Using data from 132 countries, our results show that
   fiscal policy is more persistent than responsive to economic conditions,
   which implies that the authorities may have less leeway in the,
   short-run notably to curb spending behavior In addition, countries
   characterized by greater fiscal persistence have less discretion and
   responsiveness Finally, macroeconomic, institutional and geographic
   variables explain cross-country variation in fiscal characteristics},

Abstract = {Welfare policies are a common feature of many societies and often
   strongly favored by the public. Research abounds on welfare policy
   differences across nations yet scholars pay less attention to why and
   how the public formulate opinions on welfare policies. The following
   analysis shows evidence that the public are not merely self-interested
   in their policy preferences. I propose instead that they have a further
   goal in mind unrelated to material gains: the reduction of social
   inequality. I investigate this possibility using survey data from large,
   representative national samples in Australia, Bulgaria, the Netherlands,
   Finland, and Poland (N = 13,294). Structural equation estimates
   correcting for measurement error show that those with economic
   egalitarian values are much more supportive of welfare policies
   consistent with instrumental rationality theory. These egalitarian
   values are more important than self-interest and national institutions
   in shaping preferences for government control of social services, price
   controls for basic needs, and subsidies for basic needs. This holds true
   after controlling for policy regime, attitudes toward government, family
   income, education, occupational status, sex, age, and church attendance
   and holds in all five nations.},

Abstract = {One major challenge in international survey research is to ensure the
   equivalence of translated survey instruments across different cultures.
   In this study, we examine empirically the extent to which equivalence of
   survey instruments to measure human values can be established across
   cultures sharing the same language as opposed to cultures having a
   different language. We expect cultures using the same language to
   exhibit higher levels of equivalence. Our examination made use of a
   short (i.e., a 21-item) survey instrument to measure Schwartz's human
   values based on data from the second and the third rounds of the
   European Social Survey (ESS). The empirical results support our
   expectations.},

Abstract = {Positing a ``clash of cultures,{''} many European politicians oppose
   Muslim headscarves as well as Islamic instruction in public schools; the
   real source of ``failed integration{''} lies not with the religiosity of
   young Muslims but rather with an arcane definition of ``state
   neutrality{''} that sustains the dominance of some religions at the
   expense of others. Focusing on Germany, this study reviews educational
   statistics pertaining to youth of migrant origin, showing that conflicts
   over Islamic instruction mirror deeper patterns of minority
   discrimination. It outlines the legal hurdles new faith communities must
   overcome to secure recognition as ``corporate entities under public
   law{''} (Korperschaftsstatus), entitling them to accredited teacher
   training, tax-funded salaries, construction subsidies, and other
   institutional privileges. It describes divergent curricular models
   utilized by the Lander, followed by a closer look at Islamic instruction
   in Berlin, where a court ruling compelled authorities to take a
   pro-active approach. It concludes with a review of dilemmas inherent in
   Germany's approach to ``value education{''} against the backdrop of the
   new European Union anti-discrimination directives.},

Title = {Economic Context and Americans' Perceptions of Income Inequality},
Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {91},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1220-1241},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Objectives
   The increase in income inequality in the United States over the past
   three decades has been well documented, though Americans differ in their
   perceptions of rising inequality. In this article we investigate the
   degree to which context shapes individuals' perceptions of rising income
   inequality in the United States.
   Methods
   Using objective data on state-level income inequality and survey data
   from the 2004 American National Election Study (ANES), we estimate a
   series of ordered logit models depicting individuals' perceptions of
   rising income inequality as a function of state income inequality and
   various control variables.
   Results
   We find that individuals residing in states with high income inequality
   are more likely than other individuals to perceive large increases in
   national income inequality over the past 20 years. We also consider
   possible interaction effects for state income inequality with political
   knowledge and family income, but our evidence suggests that such effects
   are limited to family income. We find that individuals from lower income
   strata are more likely to translate state income inequality into
   inequality perceptions than those with higher incomes.
   Conclusion
   State inequality context significantly shapes individuals' perceptions
   of rising income inequality, particularly among those with lower
   incomes.},

Abstract = {This paper uses a large cross-country survey of business firms to assess
   their influence on government policies. When controlling for
   endogeneity, we find that such an influence is associated with larger
   firms and to a lesser extent with government ownership, but not with the
   degree of competition. We also find that firms' perception of being
   politically influential is enhanced with the country's level of
   institutional quality.},

Journal = {ECONOMICS \& POLITICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {22},
Number = {3},
Pages = {471-497},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {A simple model of political entry in a two-sector economy is developed
   to analyze the effects of natural resource wealth on economic policy,
   political development, and civil insurrection. The model emphasizes the
   role of political entry and deadweight costs of taxation on the joint
   determination of these economic and political outcomes. Contrary to
   popular belief, my model shows that natural resource abundance is an
   economic blessing even in a rent-seeking society, although resource
   dependence can be negatively associated with economic performance. In a
   contested political market, dictators care about popular support and
   hence resource wealth can help reduce the deadweight cost of taxation
   (and hence the cost of public good provision). On the other hand,
   natural resource wealth can be a political curse, because it encourages
   political entry and hence it induces incumbent dictators to run more
   repressive regimes. With constant returns counterinsurgent technology,
   however, the equilibrium number of insurgents is independent of the size
   of resource wealth. The onset of civil war, therefore, depends on the
   counterinsurgent technology and whether the costs of entry deterrence
   are affected by resource wealth. This helps clarify the two seemingly
   contradictory hypotheses that ``resource wealth enhances regime
   durability'' and ``resource wealth fuels conflict.''},

Abstract = {This article discusses the lack of adequate attention to the Arab
   Security Sector and its complex political and social roles in the Arab
   States and presents the contours of a new research agenda for this
   topic. First, the authors demonstrate the insufficient scholarly
   attention accorded to the Arab Security Sector in several academic
   publications in the fields of Middle East Studies and Security Studies
   in the period 1990-2005. Second, they focus on three major areas where
   recent theoretical and comparative advances in the study of
   civil-military relations have not been paralleled in the study of the
   Arab Security Sector: (1) the role of the Arab Security Sector in the
   process of state formation; (2) informal connections between actors
   within the Arab Security Sector and actors operating in the political
   system; and (3) the role of the Arab Security Sector in reflecting and
   reinforcing patterns of intersectoral relations in the Arab States.},

Abstract = {We re-examine the relationship between central bank independence (CBI),
   proxied by the central bank governor's turnover rate and an indicator
   based on central bank laws in place, and inflation using a random
   coefficient model with the Hildreth-Houck estimator for more than 100
   countries in the period 1980 to 2005. We conclude that there exists no
   general significant negative relation between our indicators of central
   bank independence and inflation. Central bank independence has a
   significant effect only in a minority of the countries in our sample.},

Abstract = {The digital divide eclipses the innovative potential of Internet
   technologies for environmental governance. This study explores the
   determinants of discrepancies across city government websites in their
   capability to support environmental information and communication.
   Drawing insights from prior research, hypotheses were developed to
   examine the effects of organizational factors and community
   characteristics on the adoption of website features addressing
   environmental issues. A multiple regression analysis was conducted on
   data collected from South Korean municipalities. The urban e-government
   divide was significantly associated with senior officials' innovative
   leadership, the size of available financial and human resources, and the
   richness of environmental groups. To bridge the e-government divide at
   the local level, this study underlines the need for a collaborative
   partnership between the central and local governments and community
   efforts in the cultivation of social capital.},

Abstract = {The viceregal government in Peru survived the two imperial crises of
   1808 and 1810. Viceroy Abascal took advantage of hostility among the
   Lima elite to many of the Bourbon reforms in order to harness support
   for the reaffirmation of Peruvian authority over Quito and Charcas, and
   to resist the Brazilian Court's designs on Spanish America. The newly
   formed Army of Upper Peru was commanded in 1810 by the Arequipa creole,
   Goyeneche. Although schooled in the maxims of Spanish absolutism,
   Abascal, recognising the authority of the Regency Council and Cortes,
   witnessed the transformation of the Monarchy into a constitutional
   system.},

   situation of Brazil in 1810. It offers an opposed view to the
   traditional perspective, that presents a calm scenario, without great

   situation when compared with Spanish America, it was part of the same
   general context. It is true that Brazil had opportunities to learn its
   own ways to avoid revolutions, but, in the end, this goal was impossible

Title = {Economic Determinants of Voting in an Era of Union Decline},
Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {91},
Number = {2},
Pages = {379-396},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Objective
   The objective of this article is to test competing hypotheses regarding
   union vote effects by economic sector. Overlooked in existing research
   on political participation and the labor movement is de-unionization's
   sectoral dimension: declining union rolls is a private-sector
   phenomenon. The sectoral dimension of union decline carries important
   political consequences if the influence of unions on voter turnout
   varies by sector.
   Method
   Using Current Population Survey (CPS) November Voting and Registration
   Supplements for all national elections between 1984 and 2006, I estimate
   union vote effects for public- and private-sector employees.
   Results
   The results of the analyses reveal that while union members continue to
   vote at higher rates than otherwise similar nonmembers, the union effect
   is nearly three times as large for private-sector members:
   private-sector unionists have a predicted probability of voting 6.7
   points higher than nonmembers, while public-sector members have a
   predicted probability of voting only 2.4 points higher than nonmembers.
   Conclusions
   Given the small fraction of private-sector workers now in labor unions,
   recent fluctuations in the unionization rate have little aggregate
   affect on turnout. Given that private-sector union members tend to be
   less educated and earn less than their public-sector counterparts, the
   near disappearance of private-sector unions from the economic landscape
   removes an important institutional buffer against political inequality
   in the United States.},

Title = {The shape of the nation: Visual production of nationalism through maps
   in Turkey},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},

Abstract = {Nationalism, as a political discourse requiring a fundamental connection
   to a particular territory has constantly referred to maps as evidence of
   the eternal existence of the respective nation. In the case of modern
   Turkey, the national map has been a symptomatic signifier of a constant
   anxiety of territorial loss. Built around such anxiety, Turkish
   nationalism has been sensitive towards the borders defining national
   territory. This article analyzes the use of national maps as instruments
   for the cultural production of nationalism in Turkey throughout the last
   three decades. In the process, it is intended to differentiate between
   official maps produced under state authority and popular maps circulated
   in mass media.
   Throughout the 1980s, national maps included in school textbooks
   presented a country surrounded by hostile neighbors on all sides, in
   tune with the political climate of the Cold War. A crucial aspect of
   these official maps was the cartographic awareness they generated which,
   in the following decade, would become operational in the widespread use
   of the map as a nationalist sign. With the emergence of the Kurdish
   question in the 1990s, the national map became a key instrument in
   promoting nationalist sentiments with the invention of the flag-map logo
   as a favorite symbol. After the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, the
   Kurdish issue was projected on to Northern Iraq, and a new mode of
   cartographic representation was invented. ``Appropriated maps{''}
   produced through the digital retouching of random maps found on the
   Internet visualized irredentist desires enlarging the country's
   territory especially into Northern Iraq and invoking the Ottoman past.
   These maps, which consciously distorted geographical information, turned
   to historical references to sustain their cartographic validity. (C)

Abstract = {Using a New Keynesian model subject to misspecifications, we examine the
   accountability issue in a framework of delegation where government and
   private agents are uncertain about the central bank's preference for
   model robustness. We show that, in the benchmark case of full
   transparency, the optimal inflation targeting weight (or penalty) is
   decreasing with the preference for robustness. Departing from the
   benchmark equilibrium, the central bank has then incentive to be less
   transparent in order to reduce the optimal inflation targeting weight
   and thus to become more independent vis-a-vis the government. We also
   find that greater opacity will increase the sensibility of inflation and
   model misspecification to the inflation shock but will decrease that of
   output-gap. Since macroeconomic volatility could be increased or
   decreased under more opacity, there could exist in some cases a
   trade-off between the level and the variability of inflation (and output
   gap). Persistent inflation shocks could be associated with a higher
   inflation targeting weight as well as a higher sensibility of inflation
   and output gap to the inflation shock but a lower sensibility of model
   misspecification.},

Abstract = {We experimentally test a rent seeking model under five levels of
   competition. At one extreme, a subject's probability of winning a prize
   is equal to her share of the total expenditures. At lower levels of
   competition, a subject's probability of winning is affected more by her
   own expenditures than by the expenditures of others. Predicted
   expenditure levels are positively associated with higher levels of
   competition. Consistent with previous rent seeking experiments, we find
   that subjects spend significantly more than the Nash equilibrium
   prediction at all levels of competition. However, expenditure patterns
   generally follow the Nash prediction; expenditures decrease as the level
   of competition decreases. Our experimental design also includes a
   lottery choice experiment to control for subjects' risk preference. We
   find that subjects who are more risk averse spend significantly less in
   the contest and this effect is particularly strong for female subjects.},

Abstract = {Studies of interest groups typically sample from organizations or
   lobbyists registered with a government - those already engaged in
   political action. Because of this design choice, the questions asked of
   organizational systems are constrained. We take a different tack,
   pursuing investigation of one organizational form, ministerial
   organizations (MOs), in a wide variety of systems to ask about whether
   and how they engage in public affairs across ecologies. Specifically, we
   ask: What pressures affect whether MOs engage a public versus private
   purpose? How do MOs forage in public affairs, with what size and
   diversity of coalition? The data result from a hyper-network survey of
   MO contacts, identified by a national sample of United Methodist Church
   clergy. We find, contrary to assertions in previous work that religious
   interest groups respond to ecological pressures in a similar manner as
   other interest groups.},

Abstract = {Coal allocation in China is a seminal case of e-government in the
   political economy. The empirical phenomenon of market supporting
   e-government has not been systematically analysed. By developing and
   applying a digital governance model this article examines institutional
   change in a case of coal allocation reform in China. The case shows how
   the central state used e-government to get rid of planning overload.
   Coal allocation meetings were abolished in favour of an ecology of
   online market solutions. The findings suggest that further research on
   Chinese e-government would benefit from attention to the role of
   e-government in the political economy.},

Abstract = {The political potency of national history has been understood for
   generations. Yet there has been an unquestionable surge in history's
   political influence over the last twenty or thirty years, as the various
   history wars that have broken out around the world attest. Australia has
   been no exception: disputes over its national story continue to generate
   considerable controversy in the media, in politics and in public debate.
   But how has this politicisation of the past affected Australian
   political history in the present? This paper examines how history is
   practised in contemporary Australian politics - and notices an
   increasingly strategic use of the past by politicians in recent years.},

Abstract = {This paper argues that the mainstream approaches to the theory of the
   firm do not provide a theory of the human capital-based or knowledge
   firm. We examine the neoclassical theory of the firm, the transaction
   cost model, the incentive-system approach and the Grossman Hart Moore
   approach and argue that none of them is able to fully capture the
   changes to the firm that the movement towards a knowledge economy
   entails. We also consider the effects of knowledge on the organisation
   of production. Will production take place within a single large factory,
   or several smaller factories or even within households?.},

Abstract = {The author analyzes the constitutional problem of secret laws in Chile,
   after the 2005 reform to the Constitution. First, describing briefly the
   normative basis for the publicity of laws in a democratic State. Then,
   the article reviews the new constitutional publicity principle,
   established in article 8 degrees of the Chilean Constitution.
   Additionally, it examines the constitutionality of secret laws from two
   approaches: confronting their compatibility with the general principle
   of transparency -as a foundation of the state's institutions- and
   reviewing the possibility of a breach of the essential content of the
   fundamental right of firedom of information.},

Pages = {121-140},
Abstract = {There is little research on the tone of local news coverage of the
   presidency, despite the public's preference for local rather than
   national news. I use theories of media politics, based primarily on the
   profit-seeker model of news coverage, to explore the impact of newspaper
   characteristics, audience preferences, and story characteristics on
   local newspaper coverage of the presidency. Based on a sample of 288
   stories taken from the Bill Clinton and George W. Bush administrations,
   I demonstrate that everyday local newspaper coverage of the presidency
   is slightly more negative than positive and that audience support for
   the president, newspaper resources, and corporate ownership affect the
   tone of local newspaper coverage of the presidency.},

Journal = {POLITICKA EKONOMIE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {58},
Number = {5},
Pages = {579-595},
Abstract = {The paper deals with lobbying in the EU and CR. The starting point is
   the selected definitions of lobbying and lobbying efforts to integrate
   into the broader context of promoting economic interests in society. The
   text therefore considers the criteria for defining lobbying, the
   defining of the environment for lobbying and the role of interest groups
   and tries to map the relevant literature on the topic. When you define
   the issues of lobbying in the EU, the emphasis is on structural
   differences between the EU in terms of influence and being influenced
   and the bureaucratic apparatus throughout the countries. For various
   interest groups operating in the European political market is important
   to know the position of the EU institutions to lobbying and their
   willingness to create binding standards of behaviour and conduct
   (codes), as well as the need to define the line between lobbying and
   corruption. The text also deals with the assessment and measurement
   capabilities of different forms and methods of lobbing; it compares the
   direct and indirect data of the EU-15, the CR and the new EU Member
   States which regulate lobbying (unlike the CR).},

   cartoons controversy},
Journal = {ETHICS \& GLOBAL POLITICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {3},
Number = {2},
Pages = {101-121},
Abstract = {The paper concerns the specific transnational aspects of the `cartoons
   controversy' over the publication of 12 drawings of the Prophet Muhammad
   in the Danish newspaper lyllands-Posten. Transnationalism denotes the
   relationships that are not international (between states) or domestic
   (between states and citizens, or between groups or individuals within a
   state). The paper considers whether the specifically transnational
   aspects of the controversy are normatively significant, that is, whether
   transnationalism makes a difference for the applicability or strength of
   normative considerations concerning publications such as the Danish
   cartoons. It is argued that, although some of the usual arguments about
   free speech only or mainly apply domestically, many also apply
   transnationally; that standard arguments for multicultural recognition
   are difficult to apply transnationally; and that requirements of respect
   may have problematic implications if applied to transnational
   relationships.},
