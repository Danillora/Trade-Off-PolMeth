   Party Choice},
Journal = {POLITICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {27},
Number = {4},
Pages = {389-405},
Abstract = {Previous research has shown that a party's election results can depend
   on visibility and tone in the media. Using daily content data from the
   major news bulletins and daily survey data from the 2007 national
   election campaign in Denmark (N = 5,083), our analysis improves upon two
   central aspects of this earlier research. First, the effects on vote
   choice of the parties' visibility and tone in the media are studied
   concurrently in the same model. Second, a distinction is made between
   the effects of direct exposure to specific news content and the effects
   of the cumulative information environment created by the media. Overall,
   it is found that the more visible and the more positive the tone toward
   a given party is, the more voters are inclined to vote for this party.
   The effects are primarily effects of the information environment, not
   effects of direct exposure, though undecided voters are also directly
   affected. In the discussion, central conditions for the strength of
   media effects are identified.},

Title = {Accountability and global governance: challenging the state-centric
   conception of human rights},
Journal = {ETHICS \& GLOBAL POLITICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {3},
Number = {3},
Pages = {193-215},
Abstract = {In this paper I analyze some conceptual difficulties associated with the
   demand that global institutions be made more democratically accountable.
   In the absence of a world state, it may seem inconsistent to insist that
   global institutions be accountable to all those subject to their
   decisions while also insisting that the members of these institutions,
   as representatives of states, simultaneously remain accountable to the
   citizens of their own countries for the special responsibilities they
   have toward them. This difficulty seems insurmountable in light of the
   widespread acceptance of a state-centric conception of human rights,
   according to which states and only states bear primary responsibility
   for the protection of their citizens' rights. Against this conception, I
   argue that in light of the current structures of global governance the
   monistic ascription of human rights obligations to states is no longer
   plausible. Under current conditions, states are bound to fail in their
   ability to protect the human rights of their citizens whenever potential
   violations either stem from transnational regulations or are perpetrated
   by non-state actors. In order to show the plausibility of an
   alternative, pluralist conception of human rights obligations I turn to
   the current debate among scholars of international law regarding the
   human rights obligations of non-state actors. I document the various
   ways in which these obligations could be legally entrenched in global
   financial institutions such as the WTO, the IMF, and the World Bank.
   These examples indicate feasible methods for strengthening the
   democratic accountability of these institutions while also respecting
   the accountability that participating member states owe to their own
   citizens. I conclude that, once the distinctions between the obligations
   to respect, protect, and fulfill human rights are taken into account, no
   conceptual difficulty remains in holding states and non-state actors
   accountable for their respective human rights obligations.},

Abstract = {Lenin Rediscovered is an important and powerful contribution to our
   understanding of Lenin's Marxism. However, it is also flawed by an
   attempt to push too far the claim that Lenin was a consistent
   `Erfurtian' or Second-International Marxist. The dynamics of a mass
   political party and social movement are very different from even the
   most representative theoretician. The reality of German Social Democracy
   was certainly more problematic than what Lenin was able to glean from
   the very best of Kautsky's writings. This became apparent to Lenin in
   1914, when he recognised that he had been building a very different kind
   of parry from the actual SPD. It may be possible that the SPD and the
   RSDLP (Bolsheviks) were both `parties of a new type,' but it is also
   clear that they were not parties of the same type. There was much that
   Lenin had in common with Kautsky and Bebel - but he was doing something
   that was, in important ways, quite different.},

Abstract = {Over the last three decades, Turkey implemented a series of
   liberalisation programmes with the objective of increasing the
   availability of funds to both private and public sector. The policies
   were also aimed at stimulating economic efficiency of various sectors
   and enhancing global integration. The present chapter aims at assessing
   the extent by which financial liberalization has contributed to
   financial deepening in Turkey, and the sector that has benefited most
   from it. It will also show that the positive impact of trade
   liberalization on gross fixed capital formation and the country's
   economic growth has been greater than that of financial liberalization.},

Abstract = {States play an important role in standardization processes and even the
   early (US and French) constitutions contained provisions explicitly
   stating State responsibilities for the standardization of currencies and
   weights and measures. Today's State involvement reaches far beyond to
   include, for example, health and safety standards.(222) In addition to
   their legislative capacity, States are also involved as developers,
   investors, end users when exercising procurements, and as lobbyists
   within Standard Setting Organizations (SSOs). Traditionally the
   standardization of critical infrastructures, such as railroad and
   telecommunications systems, form important areas of State concern. Since
   both States and citizens have become increasingly dependent on the
   Internet. State interests have increased accordingly.
   On the Internet, standards facilitate communication and
   interconnectivity between hosts, systems and applications. In addition
   to facilitating communication and commerce, standards also determine the
   amount of control or protection that can be exercised. Since Internet
   standards concern individual liberties as well as security concerns for
   States, this chapter aims to gain some insight into the methods and the
   effects of State-attempts to influence Internet standard-setting
   processes on the global Internet. It takes the US attempts to influence
   standard setting in the telecommunications sector as a starting point to
   provide more insight into the State's ability to maintain its
   traditional (constitutional) commitments and responsibilities towards
   its citizens.},

   democratic `Erfurtian' Marxist undoubtedly poses a powerful challenge to
   those would suggest that Stalinism can be deduced from the arguments of
   the book. Nonetheless, there exists contemporary evidence to suggest
   that not only Mensheviks but also some Bolsheviks interpreted Lenin in a
   way not too dissimilar from what Lih calls the

Abstract = {Objective
   The voucher scheme introduced in Chile in 1981 allows for-profit private
   subsidized schools to choose their students. The objective of this
   article is to present evidence of this practice and examine its
   relationship with academic performance using information from the 2005
   SIMCE test, in which parents were asked about the admission requirements
   for their children's schools. We present evidence indicating that
   student selection is a widespread practice among private subsidized
   schools.
   Methods
   Using OLS and after controlling for a series of selection criteria and
   the segmentation effects that they produce, the evidence indicates that
   there are no differences in results between public and private
   subsidized education.
   Results
   Our results show that a student attending a school that uses selection
   criteria obtains 7-9 percent higher results in standardized mathematics
   tests than a student from a school that does not use selection.
   Conclusion
   The main conclusion of this study is that the basic belief behind the
   voucher system in Chile that competition will lead to better quality of
   all schools is not being met.},

Abstract = {Electronic petitions can serve as an influential mechanism for political
   participation. We present a study on the dynamics in the German
   e-petition system which was introduced in late 2008. Drawing on a data
   set of signatures, we analyze four aspects: (a) the types of petitions
   found, (b) the temporal dynamics of petitions, (c) the types of users
   found, and (d) the intersection of different petitions' supporter
   populations. We present evidence that (a) the system is dominated by a
   very small number of high-volume petitions and (b) these high-volume
   petitions have a delayed boosting effect on the base activity in the
   petition system. We furthermore (c) present a typology of users, showing
   that although highly active ``new lobbyists{''} and ``hit-and-run
   activists{''} exist, one-or two-time petitioners have the largest
   impact. Finally, it is indicated that (d) many of the high-volume
   petitions share a significant part of their user base, hinting at a
   complex, topically motivated network of supporters. Through the
   application of methods from what has been called ``Computational Social
   Sciences,{''} we illuminate a highly relevant field of political
   behavior online, while demonstrating the capability of data-driven
   approaches in such novel domains.},

Title = {Do Immigrant Minority Parents Have More Consistent College Aspirations

Volume = {91},

Abstract = {Objective
   Educational aspirations are an important predictor of eventual
   attainment. We examine if immigrant parents have higher aspirations for
   their children compared to native-born parents and whether they are more
   likely to maintain high aspirations over time.
   Methods
   Using data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten
   Cohort (ECLS-K), we document differences in the formation and
   maintenance of white, black, Hispanic, and Asian parents' college
   aspirations for their children between kindergarten, third, and fifth
   grades. We also examine the role of acculturation in the stability of
   immigrant parents' aspirations.
   Results
   We find that immigrant parents are more optimistic about their
   children's educational trajectories than are native-born parents and
   that over time they are more likely to maintain consistently high
   aspirations for their children.
   Conclusion
   Immigrant parents do not see their children's future as downwardly
   mobile, and instead remain optimistic, consistently reinforcing messages
   about college plans throughout childhood.},

Abstract = {I examine the relation between campaign contributions and stock returns
   during the Florida recount period of the 2000 presidential elections.
   Using the full population of publicly traded firms, I find an
   economically significant positive (negative) relation between
   pre-election campaign contributions to Bush (Gore) and stock returns
   during the 37-day election recount period. This relation exists for both
   the level and partisanship of contributions, and exists incrementally at
   both the firm and industry levels. These relations are robust to several
   different specifications, including alternative event windows that
   exclude the potentially confounding House/Senate races. The firm-level
   analysis is consistent with contributions being influence-motivated.},

Volume = {15},

Abstract = {While past research has shown that the news media can mobilize citizens
   for voting participation, little has been done on the determinants of
   the level of attention paid by the media to elections. Drawing on
   theories of news production, this study postulates that considerations
   of news values and the dynamics of resource allocation would combine to
   shape the quantity of election news. The empirical analysis focuses on a
   local election in Hong Kong, in which the news media paid different
   levels of attention to the contests in different constituencies. It
   shows that characteristics of the electoral contests relevant to the
   news values of prominence and conflict can explain how much coverage a
   constituency received, and the influences of news values factors can be
   interactive as well as additive. At the same time, the influence of
   resource allocation is illustrated by a relatively stronger media focus
   on the contests in urban center areas as well as the support for a
   resource spillover hypothesis. The general implications of the findings
   are discussed.},

Abstract = {The trade-off between equity and efficiency is analyzed in a geometric
   framework for the problem of committee selection, which has recently
   attracted interest in the social choice literature. It is shown that
   this trade-off can be maximal in the precise sense of the antipodality
   of the outcomes corresponding to the rules implementing the two
   normative principles. Following an approach in location theory, the
   minimization of the convex combination of the two criteria is presented
   as a compromise solution. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {We assess the actual relevance of Robbins' paper `On the elasticity of
   Demand for Income in terms of Effort' to the theory of work supply.
   First, we show that the paper is the first application of income and
   substitution effects to this branch of economic research. Next, we
   analyse Robbins' economic terminology, especially his definition of
   work. We find that the concept of work he uses could seem vague as he
   may be considering both the length and intensity dimensions of this
   activity. To verify this possibility, we formally reassess Robbins'
   original proposal by introducing this wider definition of work into the
   mathematical framework he proposes. The resulting model shows that this
   reading (i) is compatible with his diagrammatic analysis; (ii) clarifies
   the meaning of the other vague economic concepts the author uses; and
   (iii) illuminates his verbal explanations. Additionally, we derive all
   the relevant results of both the income-leisure and the more recent
   effort-extraction models from this Robbinsian model of work supply. This
   last outcome allows us to state that Robbins' model comprises current
   theories of work supply.},

Abstract = {German unification is commonly seen as the outcome of a series of
   European wars, with the Hohenzollern dynasty asserting its model of a
   German Empire against a Habsburg alternative. This paper examines a
   broader context for the achievement of unification by looking beyond
   Europe to the larger dimensions of the German national project. More
   specifically, it focuses on a particular phase of the unification
   narrative and integrates it into a new global history. A telling example
   of the ways in which European politics was played out globally is in the
   history of the Austrian and Prussian voyages to East Asia undertaken in
   the period 1857-1862. A close examination of these expeditions reveals
   the extent to which Austrian and Prussian elites were aware of the need
   to tread the world stage, even during times of instability and
   uncertainty at home. The projects of domestic unification and overseas
   expansion were closely intertwined.},

Abstract = {If one wishes to give individuals what they deserve, one must find some
   way of appraising those characteristics that render them deserving. In
   modern democratic societies, it seems attractive to base this appraisal
   on an aggregation of the valuations individuals hold of the desert bases
   under consideration. Some have argued that the market can provide such
   an appraisal. However, I argue that the market does not provide a
   satisfactory democratic appraisal that is relevant for desert, as it
   allows for the existence of net consumer surplus. Nevertheless, I submit
   that a procedure that does not leave any net consumer surplus would
   succeed where the market fails. Taking the average valuation of the
   individuals in society for a given desert base would meet this
   requirement. Hence, I claim that such a procedure can provide the
   satisfactory democratic appraisal that the market cannot, and can be
   used to give individuals what they deserve.},

Abstract = {In this article, we focus on the consequences of quorum requirements for
   turnout in referendums. We use a rational choice, decision theoretic
   voting model to demonstrate that participation quorums change the
   incentives some electors face, inducing those who oppose changes in the
   status quo and expect to be in the minority to abstain. As a result,
   paradoxically, participation quorums decrease electoral participation.
   We test our model's predictions using data for all referendums held in
   current European Union countries from 1970 until 2007, and show that the
   existence of a participation quorums increases abstention by more than
   ten percentage points.},

Abstract = {This paper explores questions related to the association between social
   trust and governance. In particular, the paper explores whether the
   trust-governance association is mainly a reflection of political
   responsiveness to the demands of the electorate or of the supply of
   honest politicians and bureaucrats. After outlining some simple theory,
   the findings suggest that the association reflects a causal influence of
   both types of trust on institutions of economic-judicial governance
   while electoral institutions are not associated with social trust.
   Assessed at the sample mean, the value of social trust under high
   political competition as evaluated by the compensating income variation
   is substantial.},

Abstract = {The paper studies the interaction between cyclical uncertainty and
   investment in a stochastic real option framework where demand shifts
   stochastically between three different states, each with different rates
   of drift and volatility. In our setting, the shifts are governed by a
   three-state Markov switching model with constant transition
   probabilities. The magnitude of the link between cyclical uncertainty
   and investment is quantified using simulations of the model. The chief
   implication of the model is that recessions and financial turmoil are
   important catalysts for waiting. In other words, our model shows that
   macroeconomic risk acts as an important deterrent to investments.},

Abstract = {Policy makers get information about the likely outcomes of policy
   options from experts before they make their decisions. In the executive
   branch, policy experts tend to reflect the views of the chief executive,
   whereas in the legislative branch members seek policy advisors whose
   views reflect their own. The result is a more diverse group of policy
   advisors in the legislative branch than in the executive branch, which
   under plausible conditions generates more accurate policy projections.
   Policy errors will tend to be smaller in legislative than in executive
   decision-making, providing an argument for making policy decisions in
   the legislative branch rather than the executive branch.},

   According to the findings of this study it is very unlikely that it was

Abstract = {As the Internet, and broadband in particular, becomes a platform for
   social and political engagement, researchers investigate more carefully
   both the factors that drive broadband adoption and the barriers that
   constrain it. This paper reports on one of the only large-scale
   qualitative studies of the barriers to broadband adoption in the United
   States, where 30\% of the population lack broadband access. The primary
   research question asks: how can we qualitatively understand barriers to
   broadband adoption among low-income communities? The study's
   community-based approach, undertaken in four regions of the country,
   reveals the complex equilibrium of broadband adoption. Drawing from 170
   interviews with broadband non-adopters as well as community access
   providers and other intermediaries, this study finds that price is only
   one factor shaping home broadband adoption, and that libraries and other
   community organizations fill the gap between low home adoption and high
   demand for broadband. These intermediaries compensate for shortages in
   digital skills that also constitute barriers to adoption in a context
   where broadband is essential for gaining access to jobs, education, and
   e-government. These three main findings suggest that low-income people
   like our research participants are playing roles as actors in an ecology
   of broadband access games (Dutton et al. 2004). In particular, they are
   overcoming barriers to being online in order to participate in accessing
   services and gaining education. This is part of the process of defining
   broadband as an infrastructure for e-democracy. The paper recommends a
   renewed focus on factors that sustain home access rather than drive
   demand, as well as support for community intermediaries in provisioning
   public broadband access within a context of skill shortages. It
   recommends further qualitative research to better understand the role of
   diverse populations in framing the value of broadband access.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to determine to what extent and how federal
   taxes affect local tax decisions. Testing the impact of an increase in
   the federal tax on horizontal tax competition with Canada-US data for
   1984-1994, it finds evidence that an increase in federal tax makes
   horizontal tax reactions weaker. This is because an increase in federal
   tax raises the cost, in terms of utility of income, of a unit increase
   in the province's tax rate. On the methodological side, it is possible
   to estimate the impact of the federal tax on the fiscal policy of the
   province without neglecting control for year effects, which cannot be
   used in the empirical literature because they are perfectly collinear
   with the federal tax.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a positive theory of (de)centralization of policy
   decisions in an international union -defined as a supranational
   jurisdiction that may exercise a policy prerogative on behalf of member
   countries. I build a benchmark model where national lobbies can
   coordinate (i.e. form a trans-national lobby) at no cost and show that
   lobbying does not affect the fiscal regime. On the other hand, when
   interest groups cannot coordinate, decentralization emerges as a
   political equilibrium with lobbying. Policy centralization hurts
   national lobbies by increasing competition for influence. At a
   constitutional stage, interest groups induce politically motivated
   governments to reject centralization. Three extensions show that this
   result depends on the level of cross-border externalities; the voting
   rule at the constitutional stage; and the details of the institutional
   decision mechanism under centralization.},

Title = {How Appreciated Do Wives Feel for the Housework They Do?},
Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {91},
Number = {2},
Pages = {476-492},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Objective
   Sense of appreciation for the work one does contributes to subjective
   well-being and relational satisfaction, but few studies examine the
   factors that may affect levels of recognition for household labor. We
   formulate and test hypotheses based on the effort-reward imbalance model
   in occupational health research to investigate the extent to which
   married women feel that the work they do around the house is
   appreciated.
   Methods
   We use data from a sample of married women from the 1987-1988 National
   Survey of Families and Households to test these hypotheses.
   Results
   We find that wives' absolute time spent in housework and the share they
   do are both important in shaping their perception of appreciation for
   housework. Women who hold relatively liberal attitudes toward gender
   roles and those who have more options outside marriage are less likely
   to feel appreciated. Finally, wives who often share time with their
   husbands tend to report higher levels of gratitude for their work at
   home than those who do so rarely.
   Conclusions
   This study suggests that the literature on psychological and relational
   outcomes of household labor should go beyond amounts and divisions of
   housework to include beliefs about roles, couples' dependency, and their
   relationship.},

Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {91},
Number = {2},
Pages = {554-575},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Objective
   The objective of this article is to identify the sociodemographic
   correlates of Internet dating net of selective processes that determine
   who is ``at risk.{''} We also examine the role of computer literacy,
   social networks, and attitudes toward Internet dating among single
   Internet users.
   Methods
   We use multivariate logistic regression to analyze 3,215 respondents
   from the first nationally representative U.S. survey of Internet dating.
   Results
   Sociodemographic factors have strong effects on Internet access and
   single status but weak effects on use of Internet dating services once
   the sample is conditioned on these factors. For this ``at-risk{''}
   subpopulation, computer literacy and social networks strongly influence
   the likelihood of Internet dating.
   Conclusions
   Internet dating is a common mate selection strategy among the highly
   selective subpopulation of single Internet users and may continue to
   grow through social networks. Material and virtual elements of the
   digital divide have direct and indirect effects on Internet dating.},

Abstract = {This study presents the first empirical analysis of the determinants of
   firm closure in the United Kingdom with an emphasis on the role of
   export-market dynamics, using panel data for a nationally representative
   group of firms operating in all-market-based sectors during 1997-2003.
   Our findings show that the probability of closure is (cet. par.)
   significantly lower for exporters, particularly those experiencing
   export-market entry and exit. Having controlled for other attributes
   associated with productivity (such as size and export status), the
   following factors are found to increase the firm's survival prospects:
   higher capital intensity and TFP, foreign ownership, young age,
   displacement effects (through relatively high rates of entry of firms in
   each industry), and belonging to certain industries. Interestingly,
   increased import penetration (a proxy for lower trade costs) leads to a
   lower hazard rate for exporting entrants and continuous exporters, while
   inducing a higher hazard rate for domestic producers or those that quit
   exporting.},

Abstract = {To authenticate human users to systems, challenge questions based on
   personal information are often used, typically when a primary
   authentication credential, such as a password, is forgotten. This ought
   to be a trustworthy mechanism, that is both reliable and accurate:
   personal information should be inherently memorable and not known to
   others. However, concerns have been raised recently about these
   assumptions: for example, some commonly used questions may be based on
   information that is available publicly. A possible improvement, then, is
   to allow users to choose their own questions. Here we report on an
   experiment which gathered user chosen questions and a subsequent
   security and usability analysis of them. Our experiment itself follows a
   novel method which is designed to engender the trust of participants, so
   they participate honestly. This methodological innovation demonstrates
   that it is possible to perform ethical authentication experiments where
   sensitive information does not have to be collected from users. Our
   experiments revealed some surprising results. Although subjects
   sometimes seemed aware of the need for security, they often `missed the
   mark' by a wide margin; similarly, there are serious concerns over the
   usability of freely chosen questions with free-form answers. These
   results should raise some serious questions for those setting the policy
   agenda for either testing or building authentication solutions for
   Internet applications.},

Abstract = {The assumption of a mutually conditional relationship between democracy
   and conscription is a persistent aspect of the debate on civil-military
   relations. This article discusses the relationship between conscription
   and democracy, in a general sense and with reference to the German case.
   Following a review of conventional motives for conscription, it proceeds
   to discuss the relationship between conscription and democracy in terms
   of empirical coincidence and as a means of subjective military control.
   Continued assertion of an innate democracy-conscription nexus is found
   to be at variance with the evidence while retaining some influence over
   the ongoing debate on conscription. The conflation of democratic
   citizenship with conscription is linked to tensions with individual
   liberty and equality before the law.},

Abstract = {In the quasi-federal democratic polity that India has, lobbying for
   central funds by the states is often done in a subliminal fashion.
   Hence, it becomes difficult to get an account of how much lobbying has
   been done to a particular end. Our paper attempts at constructing
   certain political proxy variables to quantify the extent of such
   lobbying in India. We quantify lobbying through the ministerial
   representation in the council of ministers. We also use several time and
   state dummies to account for the constituent states' political alignment
   with the center as well as the coalition and the reform period breaks in
   the Indian system. Taking panel data that cover 29 years and 14 major
   states we show that our constructed variables do explain disparity in
   central fiscal disbursements under the non-formulaic ``discretionary{''}
   head in a robust way. Our findings remain true even after we take into
   account the impact of endogeneity of net state income on the transfers.
   Additionally, our exercise brings to the fore the fact that the
   coalition governments and economic reform measures impact upon state
   lobbying at the center in a significant manner.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the art of central banking as practised by the
   European Central Bank (ECB) through the prism of Good friend's {[}2009]
   determination of the three policies that fall within the remit of a
   central bank : monetary policy, which consists in varying the size of
   the balance sheet, credit policy, which consists in modifying the credit
   structure, and interest rate policy, which consists in adjusting the
   interest rates of the marginal lending and deposit facilities. The
   theoretical literature emphasises the existence of a principle of
   separation between the first policy, which seeks to ensure monetary
   stability and the other two policies, which are intended to ensure
   financial stability through the smooth functioning of the interbank
   money market. This paper shows in particular that a central bank not
   only has the capacity but indeed must strive to separate the conduct of
   its monetary policy, which must seek to ensure medium and long-term
   price stability, from that of its credit policy, which is driven by
   short-term imperatives and consists in supplying the banking system with
   liquidity in the event of temporary money demand shocks. During the
   first part of the crisis, the ECB acted in accordance with the principle
   of separation. However, it became increasingly difficult to apply as
   interest rates approached the zero-lower-bound. In effect, the
   unconventional measures adopted by the ECB created interference between
   its monetary policy, its credit policy and its interest rate policy.},

Title = {Mobilized by Direct Democracy: Short-Term Versus Long-Term Effects and

Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {91},
Number = {1},
Pages = {188-208},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Objectives
   A number of recent studies find that direct democracy increases voter
   turnout. In this article, we ask: Who does direct democracy mobilize to
   vote and how are they mobilized? We distinguish between long-term and
   short-term effects on voter turnout, noting that much of the current
   literature has focused on participatory theory.
   Methods
   Our research design harnesses the power of geographic information
   systems and examines turnout in special initiative-only elections using
   registered voter lists. Our model draws on individual and Census tract
   data, incorporated using a hierarchical generalized linear model.
   Results
   The findings demonstrate how partisan context mitigates the potential
   for direct democracy to mobilize from the middle, and clarifies the
   dominance of short-term as opposed to long-term effects in increasing
   voter participation in ballot initiative elections.
   Conclusion
   Mobilization via direct legislation occurs mostly because voters are
   actively mobilized by partisan campaigns, not because of an increase in
   participatory fervor.},

Abstract = {We draw on the background of regional and local governments in China to
   identify the source of endemic corruption in the behavior of officials
   in government bureaucracies. When personal advancement in a bureaucracy
   involves payment of bribes to superiors, corruption is the consequence
   of the need to finance the bribes. In order to pay the bribes.
   government officials need to receive bribes, which are sought from
   subordinates in the government bureaucracy and from private individuals.
   All individuals are not, of course, equally corrupt or corruptible and
   merit is also a basis for advancement. However, corruption is endemic if
   the heads of government bureaucracies are corrupt in the procedures and
   criteria for personal advancement in the government bureaucracy. (c)

Abstract = {Through a combination of network ethnography and more traditional,
   qualitative newsroom analysis, this article undertakes a step-by-step
   analysis of the circulation of a particular set of news factsthose
   relating to the eviction and arrest of a group of homeowners in
   Philadelphia during a single week in June 2008, a time period in which
   the story of the arrests emerged, exploded, and then quickly faded away.
   The article discusses some of the larger explanatory factors that might
   have contributed to the particular pattern of news diffusion described
   here, as well as the degree to which the factors observed might be
   generalizable across other cases. The article adds local nuance to
   Benkler's (2006) description of information circulation in the networked
   public sphere, pointing to a pattern of iterative pyramiding in which
   key Web sites positioned within highly particular communities of
   interest act as bridges to larger, more diffused digital communities.
   The article also argues that news movement in the particular incident
   discussed can be characterized by an unusual combination of
   fact-entrepreneurship and a process of categorical misrecognition in
   which the circulation dynamics of the networked news ecosystem are
   leveraged by institutional and quasi-institutional communicative actors
   to advance particular occupational and professional goals, all the while
   misrecognizing both the identity and goals of the other nodes in the
   Philadelphia media sphere. Overall, the article serves as a preliminary
   attempt to outline the changing architecture of local journalism
   ecologies during a period of rapid news industry.},

Title = {Catholicism and Judaism in the Catholic Defence against Alfred
   Rosenberg, 1934-1938: Anti-Jewish Images in an Age of Race Science},
Journal = {EUROPEAN HISTORY QUARTERLY},

Volume = {40},

Abstract = {This article examines the images of Jews and Judaism in the popular
   Catholic defence against Alfred Rosenberg's anticlericalism and
   `neo-paganism' between 1934 and 1938. It contributes to the debate on
   Catholic attitudes to Jews, and National Socialist anti-Semitism and
   racism during the Third Reich. Looking at the grassroots level of this
   defence, the article demonstrates how the hierarchy communicated
   traditional religious views on Jews and Judaism to a Catholic public,
   taking into account the restrictions imposed by a dictatorial regime as
   well as long-held anti-Jewish attitudes in German Catholicism. The
   article suggests that the popular literature clung to traditional creeds
   and values of the Catholic Church and defended biblical Jewry. Yet, at
   the same time, the defence was clad in the language of the time
   and-consequently used images of Jews closer to National Socialist racial
   rhetoric. Taking the restrictions of the dictatorship into account, the
   article argues that this is to a considerable extent the result of the
   authors of the popular Church literature and the German bishops who
   failed to acknowledge that it was no longer possible to distinguish
   between a `good' Jew and a `degenerate' Jew in the face of the Third
   Reich's sweeping anti-Semitism and its core ideology that made no
   distinction between racial and religious Jewishness.},

Abstract = {In 1962 Antonio Garrigues Diaz-Canabate, a prestigious Spanish lawyer,
   was appointed as ambassador to the United States His primary task was to
   renegotiate the 1953 bilateral agreements, which were valid for ten
   years. In this paper, the most directly related aspects to that very
   important negotiation have been leaving aside in order to focus on the
   intense diplomatic activity deployed by Garrigues to improve the
   perception of the Franco dictatorship that existed in the United States
   The Garrigues' personality was liberal but yet inside the Francoist
   consensus and he wished to convey to the American society a message that
   draws the Franco regime as the appropriate Spanish formula of evolution
   towards a future system that should be similar to those in the Western
   countries Garrigues was part thus of the aperturtsta (political
   evolutionist) wing of the regime. The 1960s were years of aperturismo,
   but of unseasonable rigidities and exasperating slowness as well},

Abstract = {What is the role of entrepreneurship in economic development from the
   perspective of neo-Austrian and new institutional economics and what is
   the difference between these approaches? Neo-Austrian economists claim
   that economic development is caused by entrepreneurial discovery. New
   institutional economists argue that structure of incentives determined
   by the institutional environment provides a guideline for
   entrepreneurial decision-making. Hence, an institutional environment
   that rewards rent-seeking does not provide opportunities for economic
   development. In this paper we offer a comparison of these approaches to
   show that both entrepreneurial discovery and institutional environment
   are closely related. Moreover, with the comparison we demonstrate that
   entrepreneurial decision-making plays more important role in economic
   development when an institutional change is taken into account.},

Abstract = {This article forwards a novel approach regarding the U.S. military's
   growing focus on building cross-cultural competence. This piece argues
   that a link exists between the armed forces' internal cultural diversity
   issues and the military's objective to heighten its ability to work
   effectively in foreign cultures. Cross-cultural competence means the
   knowledge, attitudes, and behavioral repertoire and skill sets that
   military members require to accomplish all given tasks and missions
   involving cultural diversity. Despite the military's noteworthy historic
   progress in the area of building a diverse and cohesive force, it
   possesses some ongoing cultural diversity problems. The article examines
   three concerns within the ranks of the U.S. military: signs of religious
   intolerance, some ongoing resistance toward women service members, and
   antihomosexual attitudes and conduct. This piece explores these concerns
   and also argues that ameliorating these cultural diversity issues will
   contribute to building cross-cultural competence in the military.},

Abstract = {Over the last several decades, virtually all large U. S. law firms have
   adopted a human capital strategy that emphasizes academic performance
   and the prestige of the law school attended. Although this focus is
   rooted more in tradition than in hard empirical evidence that it
   produces a competitive advantage, the question has long been irrelevant
   for most law firms because of the perennial rise in profits. If the
   model is not broken, the adage runs, why fix it? Drawing upon extensive
   historical and contemporaneous evidence, this essay argues that the
   limitations of the traditional credentials-based model have been masked
   by a steady multidecade surge in the demand for corporate legal
   services. Further, various data and trendlines suggest that the growth
   in demand for corporate legal services is beginning to flatten out. In
   the coming years, many large corporate law firms will be in the
   unfamiliar position of competing over market share. Unlike the relative
   calm and prosperity of the prior era, their survival will likely depend
   upon a human capital strategy that asks and answers several basic
   empirical questions regarding the selection and development of lawyers.},

Title = {THE SUSTAINABILITY OF HOUSE PRICE TRENDS IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC},
Journal = {POLITICKA EKONOMIE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {58},
Number = {2},
Pages = {225-252},
Abstract = {On the background of current global mortgage crisis the article
   discusses the housing market theory and particularly the methods and
   indicators used for the evaluation of long-term sustainability of house
   price trends. The authors provide the time series of such indicators for
   selected OECD countries, critically examine the past research studies
   evaluating pre-crisis house price development and argue that house price
   falls present in many developed countries are more the causes than the
   consequences of mortgage crisis. The change in house price trends in
   2007 in many developed countries could be thus interpreted as the result
   of the previous record house price growth, often labeled as a price
   bubble. In view of this hypothesis the authors try to assess the
   sustainability of house price development in the Czech Republic, using
   several indicators, error correction models and different data sources.
   The Methods for construction of reliable house price indices are also
   discussed here. The results show that house prices in the Czech Republic
   could be above their ``equilibrium{''} levels at the end of 2007 but
   this deviation was far lower than in countries like UK, Spain,
   Netherlands or Ireland.},

Abstract = {Industrial concentration is broadly defined as a few firms controlling a
   substantial share of assets or sales of the market. In the multinational
   industrial sector, this chapter shows that the largest 100 in the world
   control substantial amounts of assets and sales, both foreign and total.
   Two well known indexes of concentration were used, the Herfindahl and
   Theil's entropy, to check the levels of concentration between 1990 and
   2005. It was found that changes in concentration were not statistically
   significant when compared on a yearly basis.},

Abstract = {Chapbook reform was part and parcel of larger projects of folk culture
   reform in Europe between the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries.
   Political powers excised content perceived as dangerous and substituted
   material reflecting their own principles and aims. This article examines
   the reflections of this process in Turkey. The modernization of
   chapbooks was - carried out by the Turkish political authorities as a
   state project only in 1937. That project included the transformation of
   traditional heroes and events in these chapbooks to place them in line
   with the Republican revolution and the state ideology of modernity.},

Abstract = {Despite the strong theoretical expected linkages between financial
   openness and economic growth, the financial globalization has been
   primarily a source of economic instability. This article presents a
   strategy of alternative political economy to the passivity of Latin
   American countries' political economy facing up to the globalization. It
   emphasizes the idea that a permanent tension exists between the
   internationalization trend in economy relationships and the search for
   autonomy in the political economies; that tension is developed in an
   unstable external environment and in a new international financial
   liberal order. This paper compares the Asiatic and the Latin American
   trajectories after the financial crisis in 1997, and it analyzes the
   recent reform of the international financial architecture.},

Abstract = {The paper presents a game-theoretic representation of a general
   terrorist organization (GTO) that delegates responsibility to local
   terrorist representatives in n countries. The GTO achieves a strategic
   advantage by deploying a more radical representative when the government
   is perceived to be weak and terrorist supporters are committed. When the
   government or terrorist supporters alter their posture, the GTO may
   regret its local representative. Outside assistance can change a
   besieged government's posture, thereby removing the GTO's delegation
   advantage. When both the GTO and the government delegate to surrogates,
   the delegators are worse off if the government appears to be weak.},

Abstract = {The paper deals with the monetary policy of the European Central Bank
   and its effects on economic development of the Czech economy and other
   new members of EU from the perspective of Post-Keynesian monetary
   economics.
   In the, first part the basic principles of contemporary Post-Keynesian
   monetary theory of relative endogeneity of money are shortly presented.
   The second part concentrates on the Post-Keynesian criticism of the
   institutional arrangement of the ECB and its monetary policy. The
   closing part treats issues concerning potential effects of the policy of
   the ECB in the given institutional framework on economic development of
   the Czech economy and economies of other less developed members of EU
   after joining the Eurozone. Possible adverse effects on the process of
   real convergence are discussed and alternative policies eliminating this
   danger are presented.},

Abstract = {This article expands upon the crucial role of the state in the provision
   of infrastructure in late-nineteenth century Australia by examining the
   hitherto overlooked role of local government, and in particular, the
   provision of municipal services in Launceston, Tasmania's second largest
   city. From the 1890s, socialist groups across Europe actively sought to
   control councils, believing ``good{''} local government the key to
   social reform. Municipalisation in Tasmania had more pragmatic origins.
   Colonial governments encouraged local-level service provision to prevent
   the draining of their own finances. In Launceston an ideological element
   occasionally surfaced. But municipalisation was driven by resentment of
   a neglectful Tasmanian government, by the desire to modernise the town,
   by intent to secure new sources of revenue, and by the strong civic
   pride of businessmen.},

Abstract = {Armed conflict typically worsens civilian life chances. The effects of
   social militarization (maintenance of armed forces) and economic
   militarization (military expenditures) on civilian life chances are
   disputed, and the joint effect of armed conflict and militarization on
   civilian life chances has not previously been examined. This study
   examines the joint effects of three types of major armed conflicts and
   two types of militarization on civilian life chances, using a
   fixed-effects negative binomial cross-national panel analysis
   (1985-1998) of data from 175 countries with populations larger than two
   hundred thousand. General economic development, political regime, and
   country-specific effects are controlled. Armed conflict and
   militarization interact in affecting civilian life chances. Armed
   conflict results in higher levels of civilian mortality; militarization
   interacts with armed conflict, producing the best civilian life chances
   at either medium-low or medium-high levels of militarization.},

Abstract = {Despite its social and political importance, veterans' policy is an
   overlooked subject in the field of civil-military relations. This
   article aims to discuss the theoretical problems of studying veterans'
   policy. It also proposes analysis of veterans' policy in Russia. The aim
   of the theoretical review is to underline the limits of traditional ways
   of viewing veterans' policy, which consider veterans' policy as a
   consequence of the development of military institutions. The article
   stresses the importance of taking into account the effect of societal
   factors in explaining veterans' policy. An examination of the Russian
   case demonstrates the historical development of an exclusive veterans'
   policy, including the construction of the privileged position for
   veterans of the World War II. It also analyses the changes of veterans'
   policy after the Soviet Afghan War of 1979-89. Finally, the article
   highlights the principles of contemporary veterans' policy in Russia and
   explains why it cannot be changed without reconfiguration of
   civil-military relationships.},

Abstract = {The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), established by the Kyoto

   the sale of Certified Emission Reductions. For this reason, supposedly
   technical decisions about the approval of CDM methodologies and about

   countries or interest groups. Our econometric analysis of data for about
   250 methodologies and about 1000 projects discussed by the CDM Executive
   Board (EB) so far, suggests that indeed, along with formal quality
   criteria, political-economic variables determine the final EB decision.},

Abstract = {It may be difficult to motivate politicians in their last term. To solve
   this problem, we suggest a triple mechanism involving political
   information markets, flexible pensions, and democratic elections. An
   information market is used to predict the potential reelection chances
   of the politician. Pensions depend on the price in the information
   market and thereby motivate the politician to act in a socially optimal
   manner. We show that, on balance, the triple mechanism increases social
   welfare. Finally, we suggest several ways to avoid the manipulation of
   information markets and we discuss possible pitfalls of flexible
   pensions.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates whether the impacts of financial development on
   growth convergence vary with the stage of real development. We implement
   this analysis through the instrumental variable threshold regression
   approach proposed by Caner and Hansen. Our empirical evidence shows that
   financial intermediary development leads to long-run convergence in
   growth of both economic activity and productivity. Moreover, such
   convergence-enhancing effects of financial intermediation are stronger
   for less-developed countries than for the more industrialized. In
   addition, the data reveal that stock market development assists growth
   convergence only in low-income countries.},

Abstract = {This article studies the conditions that made possible the creation of
   an autonomous government in the first year of the May Revolution of 1810
   in the Viceroyalty of Rio de la Plata. It also studies the different
   actions of this government, the ambiguous positions it adopted and the
   reactions to its creation within the general context of the crisis of
   the Spanish Monarchy. All this without presupposing that the outcome was
   already present in the previous series of events. In this sense, all the
   tensions and conflicts of the colonial period are duly considered. The
   purpose is to present the main disputes regarding legitimacy and the
   representations of popular sovereignty. With this in mind, the paper
   presents an integrated narrative of the whole process, along with the
   review of the main recent historiographic trends that guided it.},

Abstract = {Objectives
   The present study investigates the role of a disadvantaged background,
   the lack of social connectedness, and behavioral problems in channeling
   young men to the opportunities of the all-volunteer military instead of
   to college or the labor market.
   Methods
   Data from three waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent
   Health in the United States are employed. The analytic sample consists
   of 6,938 white, black, and other males.
   Results
   The greatest likelihood of military service versus college or the labor
   force occurs when young men of at least modest ability come from
   disadvantaged circumstances, experience minimal connectedness to others,
   and report a history of adolescent fighting.
   Discussion
   Findings highlight the value of access to post high school education and
   worklife opportunities as a military service incentive for less
   advantaged young men in the all-volunteer era.},

Abstract = {Relatively little is known about the impact of public policies on the
   decisions of firms to contract out parts of their production, despite
   widespread growth in this practice. The present paper uses a simple
   principal-agent model to explore the effects of various public policies
   which affect employers' incentives to outsource by re-grading their
   employees as independent self-employed contractors. Minimum wages are
   predicted to increase contracting out, as are payroll and income taxes
   under several plausible conditions, including worker preferences
   exhibiting constant relative risk aversion.},

Abstract = {Evangelicals form the core of Republican constituencies in many states.
   This has been particularly true in Iowa, where the Christian Right has
   held significant influence in the Republican party for almost 20 years.
   However, recent scholarship has suggested that evangelicals,
   particularly younger ones, may be changing their candidate choices and
   partisanship due to dissatisfaction with Republican policies. Based on a
   unique study surveying caucus-goers' opinions after the January 2008
   caucuses, I examine respondents' candidate preferences in light of their
   religious beliefs, issues preferences, and demographic identities. The
   results indicate that while evangelicals remain more conservative on
   social issues than their co-partisans in both parties, issues seem to
   make little difference in candidate choice. This conclusion suggests
   that Republican evangelicals remain committed to the importance of
   social issues - or at least to their evangelical identity - in their
   voting choices.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN HISTORY QUARTERLY},

Volume = {40},
Number = {2},
Pages = {217-239},

Abstract = {This paper seeks to contribute to the debate on the international
   repercussions of the Spanish Civil War by analysing the numerous British
   missions of investigation that visited both sides during the conflict.
   Drawing on the travellers' own accounts and the documents from Spanish
   and British archives among other sources, it argues that these missions
   were in fact organized tours, first used as propaganda by Republicans
   and their Comintern advisers, and subsequently copied by Nationalists on
   a more limited basis. Although some involved genuinely impartial
   observers, most of the visitors were already committed to the cause they
   pretended to investigate. Spanish war tourism thus almost invariably
   succeeded in producing favourable publicity for both sides, yet failed
   to affect the majority of the British people, who were influenced
   primarily by their Government's neutral stance. Regardless of its
   outcome, the experience aptly illustrates the extent to which persuasion
   and commitment determined foreign responses to the conflict.},

Abstract = {The development of the Internet has led to the creation of countless new
   markets, among them, online, in-game betting markets for sporting
   contests. We examine the behavior of prices as events unfold in a
   baseball game. Specifically, we compare the evolution of prices during a
   game with probability estimates generated by an empirical model of
   scoring in baseball. We find that price changes correspond closely to
   changes in the probability of winning, for plays of both small and
   dramatic impact. Nevertheless, data limitations inhibit the ability to
   make strong claims regarding the hypothesis of efficient pricing.},

Abstract = {The Chinese government and its companies have dramatically increased
   their presence in Africa in the last decade. There has been much media
   interest and commentary on the impacts of this engagement on governance
   in Africa, as it is often seen to be strengthening authoritarian states,
   such Sudan and Zimbabwe.1 However, Chinese actors are also engaging with
   more democratic states and spaces, such as Zambia. This article seeks to
   explore the impacts of increased Chinese engagement with Africa on
   governance through a comparative case study of two contrasting cases:
   Sudan and Zambia, using the concept of flexigemony. Contrary to popular
   perception, behaviour by Chinese actors has sometimes been a moderating
   force in Sudan, while provoking violence in Zambia.},

Title = {Policy Considerations from a Nationwide IT-in-Education Initiative:
   Macedonia Connects},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY \& POLITICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {7},
Number = {4},
Pages = {369-383},
Abstract = {Though information technology (IT) is increasingly touted as an
   effective tool through which governments may enhance their development
   efforts, to date, many IT-related deployments have remained in a pilot
   stage, which does little to aid governments in understanding macrolevel
   IT policy approaches to confronting development challenges. To address
   this shortcoming, this article presents a unique nationwide initiative:
   Macedonia Connects, a multipartner, scaled IT-foreducation project
   wherein every school in the country was equipped with both computers and
   wireless Internet connections and through which the Internet was made
   available to citizens across the entire country. A number of
   policy-related aspects of the project are identified and discussed,
   including the predeployment training of teachers in IT adoption, the
   equality of technology and training provision across the entire country,
   the long-term focus on the part of all stakeholders in terms of
   outcomes, and the business model employed in the public-private
   partnership. Although it is too early to discuss long-term outcomes,
   there are many aspects of this case that will be applicable to
   governments and practitioners alike in future IT-for-development
   endeavors. Some of Macedonia's neighboring states have already indicated
   interest in following this model.},

Journal = {POLITICKA EKONOMIE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {58},
Number = {1},
Pages = {70-91},
Abstract = {The paper discusses the phenomenon of long-term real equilibrium
   appreciation of the koruna in the context of economic, i.e. nominal and
   real convergence. The real appreciation can take place either through a
   nominal exchange rate channel or through inflation differential channel
   vis-A-vis the reference country, or through a combination of those two
   channels. However, the choice of monetary policy regime predetermines
   the occurrence and intensity of those channels. Subsequently, the paper
   summarizes the sources of equilibrium real appreciation, i.e.
   Balassa-Samuelson effect, the effect of terms of trade, FDI inflows, the
   impact of changes in the structure of domestic consumption and the
   effect of state administrative prices. It also presents range of models
   which are applicable for estimation of equilibrium (real) exchange rate.
   Finally, the paper presents and discusses trajectory of equilibrium real
   appreciation resulting from models of the CNB (QPM, g3 and others).},

Volume = {27},

Pages = {178-198},
Abstract = {Over 10\% of the American electorate lives in counties served by
   out-of-state media because of the mismatch between media markets and
   state boundaries. Frequently, these oorphano counties face a different
   information environment than others in their home state: they receive no
   news coverage and political advertising for their own statewide races,
   irrelevant information pertaining to candidates in the neighboring state
   who will not appear on their ballots, or both. With a combination of
   county-level, individual-level, and political advertising data, our
   analysis evaluates the effect of orphan county residency and irrelevant
   political information on political participation. Results indicate that
   orphan counties have lower turnout rates than non-orphan counties and
   that this difference is explained by lower levels of interest in the
   campaign stemming from exposure to irrelevant information.},

Abstract = {This short article shows that Heller's assertion that I have announced
   the death of the early modern French bourgeoisie is misplaced. At the

   stasis together with the low level of bourgeois classness make it
   impossible to sustain Engel's view that absolute monarchy rested on a
   supposed balance between it and the nobility. In conclusion, it is
   suggested that Marxist analysis cannot be reduced to a treatment of
   class-anatogonisms.},

Abstract = {Cultural industries are now encompassed in a wider approach, the
   so-called creative industries. Then the difficult question about the
   economic role of culture for society can be revised through an extended
   approach: What is the dynamic value of the creative industries from the
   economic perspective? This paper seeks to answer this question by
   proposing four models of the relationship between the creative
   industries and the whole economy: (1) welfare, (2) competition, (3)
   growth and (4) innovation. Very different policy frameworks thus follow
   from each of the four basic dynamic models relating the creative
   industries to the rest of the economy. This paper will outline these
   four models and marshal a sample of existing evidence to begin the
   process of sorting among them.},

   of this process, starting with database creation to finally giving
   access to the collected data with browsing and searching interfaces. We
   further demonstrate how we used this toolkit to collect
   elections-related data from YouTube for nearly two years. Some analysis

Abstract = {Objective
   In the wake of Turkey's EU candidacy and the U.S.-led war in Iraq,
   Turkey's Kurdish question has drawn international attention. Due to
   previous data limitations, ours is the first article to analyze what
   explains anti-Kurdish beliefs in Turkey using nationally representative
   survey data.
   Methods
   Through descriptive analyses and partial proportional odds models of the
   Pew Global Attitudes Survey (2002), we examine the extent and sources of
   these beliefs.
   Results
   We find high levels of anti-Kurdish beliefs in Turkey, but little
   evidence of group competition/material interests shaping these beliefs;
   rather, nationalism, secularism, and, somewhat surprisingly, favorable
   evaluations of globalization better explain anti-Kurdish beliefs.
   Conclusion
   Although broad processes of social-dominance orientation and
   authoritarianism may be factors working in the background, anti-Kurdish
   beliefs are better explained by the peculiar case of modernization in
   Turkey and these anti-Kurdish beliefs may be different from negative
   beliefs about other minorities.},

Abstract = {Objectives
   This research investigates the spatial redistribution of socially
   vulnerable subpopulations during long-term recovery from natural
   disaster. We hypothesize that the local environmental impact of a
   disaster influences this redistribution process and that how it does so
   varies by the urban or rural context in which the disaster occurs.
   Methods
   To test these hypotheses, we use a novel research design that combines
   the natural experiment offered by Hurricane Andrew with GIS technology
   and local census data.
   Results
   Findings indicate that in a more urbanized disaster zone (Miami),
   long-term recovery displaces socially disadvantaged residents from
   harder-hit areas; yet, in a more rural disaster zone (southwestern
   Louisiana), long-term recovery concentrates socially disadvantaged
   residents within these harder-hit areas.
   Conclusion
   These findings bridge classic and contemporary research on postdisaster
   recovery and open new terrain for thinking about how environmental and
   social forces intersect to transform regions in different settlement
   contexts.},

Abstract = {Academic observers and public intellectuals frequently criticize mass
   email action alerts as ``slacktivism{''} or ``clicktivism,{''} arguing
   that the lowered transaction costs of the medium produce a novel form of
   activism that carries with it hidden costs and dangers for the public
   sphere. This article challenges those claims, relying on a combination
   of personal observation within the advocacy community and on a new
   quantitative dataset of advocacy group email activity to articulate
   three points. First, that mass emails are functionally equivalent to the
   photocopied and faxed petitions and postcards of ``offline{''} activism,
   and represent a difference-of-degree rather than a difference-in-kind.
   Second, that such low-quality, high-volume actions are a single tactic
   in the strategic repertoire of advocacy groups, thus reducing cause for
   concern about their limited effect in isolation. Third, that the
   empirical reality of email activation practices has little in common
   with the dire predictions offered by common critiques. The article
   responds to a previous Policy \& Internet article: ``The Case Against
   Mass E-mails.{''} 1 (1).},

Abstract = {In this paper, I examine how the incentives of regions to unite and to
   separate are related to the incentives to provide public goods
   Separation allows for greater influence over the nature of political
   decision making while unification allows regions to exploit economies of
   scale in the provision of public goods From a social welfare
   perspective, there are excessive incentives for separation and for the
   provision of public goods When incentives for public good provision are
   not taken into account, however, these incentives can be misinterpreted
   as incentives for separation},

Abstract = {Judgment aggregation theory, or rather, as we conceive of it here,
   logical aggregation theory generalizes social choice theory by having
   the aggregation rule bear on judgments of all kinds whatever, and not
   barely judgments of preference. It derives from Kornhauser and Sager's
   doctrinal paradox and Pettit's discursive dilemma, two problems that we
   restate by emphasizing their conceptual differences. Henceforth, we
   follow the main technical advances of the theory, from the first
   impossibility theorem proved by List and Pettit to the completely
   general results of Dietrich and Mongin. We stress the collective
   achievement of the canonical theorem - by Dietrich and List, Dokow and
   Holzman, Nehring and Puppe - which provided the theory with a specific
   method of analysis: it consists in mathematically characterizing the
   impossibility agendas of a given aggregator - i.e., the sets of
   propositions such that no collective judgment function exists with a
   certain list of axiomatic properties. The presentation is unified here
   by the use of formal logic, for which we claim relevance at every step,
   and by the above-mentioned distinction between the doctrinal paradox and
   the discursive dilemma, which we reelaborate upon technically.},

Abstract = {Israel's Second Lebanon War (2006) is a typical manifestation of a
   flawed war fought by a democratic society. As such, it represents an
   important opportunity to provide significant evidence regarding the
   validity of theories that deal with the ``democratization of war{''}
   syndrome, that is, the limitations imposed on the way democracies wage
   war and how they cope with these limitations. This article argues that
   the events of the war exhibit four theoretical propositions, all of
   which are drawn from the U. S. post-Vietnam experience: speedy decision
   making to avert public disputes, a weak ``civilian{''} government that
   struggles to restrain the military, the proclivity to shorten the war
   and reduce its costs, and the setting of overly ambitious war goals as a
   means of mobilizing public support. In short, the imperatives derived
   from the democratization of war syndrome produce mechanisms that work to
   heighten belligerence rather than temper it.},

   the conflicting interests of different classes of people? This subject
   has received some attention in a utilitarian context, but has been

   studied by John Rawls. My Game Theory and the Social Contract considers
   the problem for a toy society with only two citizens. This paper

Abstract = {This study examines whether perceptions of media influence and
   perceptions of media hostility towards one's views predict taking
   ``corrective{''} actions to ensure that one's views are ``heard{''} in
   the public sphere. Controlling for demographics, political interest,
   efficacy, knowledge, ideological extremity, and Internet use, this study
   provides evidence that both third-person perceptions and hostile media
   perceptions are consistently related to a series of offline and online
   behaviors that seek to enrich public debate and ``correct{''} what are
   seen as potential biases in the public sphere. Based on a national
   probability sample collected in Colombia, these results offer a strong
   case of behavioral consequences for third-person perceptions outside the
   realm of willingness to censor.},

Abstract = {Objectives
   A higher level of organizational commitment for older and more
   experienced workers has primarily been explained via exchange theory or
   a cohort effect. We use an agency-structure framework to explain that
   higher levels of commitment result from feelings of control in the
   workplace.
   Methods
   We examine this framework using data from a survey of 400 unionized
   factory workers in the Midwest.
   Results
   The relationship between organizational commitment and predictors is
   affected by worker career stage. Most significantly, the commitment for
   older and more experienced workers increases with high levels of
   autonomy, while the opposite is true for younger and less experienced
   workers.
   Conclusions
   When workers experience greater control at the point of production, they
   express greater organizational commitment. Although empowering for older
   and experienced workers, having freedom at work can be threatening or
   destabilizing for the younger workers, who may prefer more guidance.},

Number = {2},

Abstract = {Objective
   Agenda-setting theory is used to motivate hypotheses about how media
   coverage of immigration influences public perceptions of its importance.
   The authors seek to offer a more complete explanation of public opinion
   on immigration by exploring differences in the effects of immigration
   news in border and nonborder states.
   Method
   This article employs content analyses of newspaper coverage of
   immigration and Gallup public opinion data over a 12-month period
   (January-December 2006). Respondents' identification of immigration as a
   ``Most Important Problem{''} is modeled as a conditional relationship
   between border state/nonborder state residence and media coverage,
   ethnic context, and individual-level demographics.
   Results
   Media attention to immigration is greater in border states than in
   nonborder states; as a result, residents of border states are more
   likely to identify immigration as a most important problem than are
   residents of nonborder states.
   Conclusions
   The analyses point to the importance of geography and news coverage in
   explanations of public opinion on immigration.},

Title = {Ungoverned space: Global security and the geopolitics of broken windows},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {29},
Number = {5, SI},
Pages = {289-297},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Contemporary geopolitical narratives have shifted from a Cold War focus
   on security attained through effective spatial containment to an
   emphasis on security won through effective spatial administration. Weak,
   disorderly, and ungoverned spaces are often scripted as insecure and
   dangerous, requiring sovereign intervention and harsh discipline as a
   corrective action. These narratives and practices increasingly borrow
   from the domestic arena, and serve to blur former binaries such as
   internal/external and policing and war. This paper investigates the
   domestic ``broken windows policing{''} language of ungoverned,
   disorderly space in New York City, and traces its movement and
   subsequent usage in the occupation of Iraq. The use of language such as
   broken windows and zero tolerance serves to legitimate state practices,
   but is also effective as a shaping force for newly articulated positions
   and subjects. It is argued that broken windows policing, as an
   imaginative geopolitical scripting of the perils of chaotic and
   ungoverned space, helps to produce new forms of governance through
   security. Further, this disciplining process facilitates the formation
   and entrenchment of neoliberal practices and subjectivities by rendering
   spaces and populations `insecure' and in need of repositioning hence
   opening them up to powerful market forces and technologies of the self
   such as privatization, entrepreneurialism, and responsibilization. (C)

Journal = {PUBLIC CHOICE},

Volume = {143},

Abstract = {It stands to reason that social unrest does not erupt out of the blue.
   Although there are a great many reasons why social dismay might descend
   into social disorder, only few yardsticks or indices can plausibly be
   used to gauge the potential for social unrest (PSU). If policy makers
   want to undertake public action to prevent social dismay escalating into
   social disruption, they obviously need to draw on practical sensors.
   This paper assesses critically the adequacy of two such measures, the
   polarization (P) index, and the total relative deprivation (TRD) index.
   The paper proposes a tentative guide to selecting between these two
   measures. A review of three stylized scenarios suggests that, where
   income redistributions reduce the number of distinct income groups, and
   when each group is characterized by a strong sense of within-group
   identity, the P index surpasses the TRD index as a basis for predicting
   PSU. When the within-group identification is weak, however, it is better
   to use the TRD index to predict PSU.},

Volume = {22},

Abstract = {Concerns about Islamic extremism and ongoing debates about the
   integration and assimilation of Muslims into Western societies continue
   to attract considerable attention from the media, policymakers, and
   scholars, but relatively little cross-national research has been done on
   Western attitudes toward Muslims. This article attempts to address this
   question by exploring 2006 Pew Global Attitudes data among non-Muslims
   in Britain, France, Germany, Spain, and the U.S. Using structural
   equation modeling, we examine the determinants of Western views toward
   Muslims, and find that threat perceptions are the primary factor
   influencing these views. Specifically, our analysis suggests that
   perceptions of security threats drive attitudes regarding Muslims, and
   that perceived cultural threats are only indirectly related to views
   towards Muslims.},

Volume = {9},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Revisionist interpretation of Mill needs to be extended to deal with a
   residue of puzzles about his moral theory and its connection with his
   theory of liberty. The upshot shows his reinterpretation of his
   Benthamite tradition as a form of `philosophical utilitarianism'; his
   definition of the art of morality as collective self-defence; his
   ignoring of maximization in favour of ad hoc dealing in utilities; the
   central role of his account of the justice of punishment; the marginal
   role of the internal sanction in his criterion of moral wrong; his deep
   respect for common-sense morality; and his restriction of the scope of
   morality so as to claim for the utilitarian tradition the whole realm of
   the aesthetics of conduct as part of a general theory of practical
   reason.},

Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {29},
Number = {2},
Pages = {109-118},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {At a time when the EU is attempting to mark itself out as a power for
   transformation, particularly in its neighbourhood, this article analyses
   the ability of outsiders in the margins of Europe to have a constitutive
   impact on the nature of the EU's policies, its borders and not least its
   identity and perception of its security environment. Analysing the EU's
   relationship with Ukraine and Belarus through the European Neighbourhood
   Policy, the article argues the ENP's effectiveness and nature is
   dependent upon two factors: first, where the partner countries are
   located (and locate themselves) along a continuum of positive negative
   otherness with respect to the EU and; second, their ability to utilise
   particular strategies of marginality to pursue their goals. If the EU is
   understood as a transformative power, this article argues that the
   nature of this power is significantly circumscribed by the attitudes,
   preferences, strategies and identities of those it seeks to influence.

Abstract = {This article considers European banknote iconography as an indicator of
   national branding choices from the early twentieth century up to the
   present. Systematic quantitative content analysis demonstrates that the
   values and ontologies expressed on Central/East European banknotes have
   historically tracked closely with the trends visible on their West
   European counterparts. This pattern is evident not just since the end of
   the Cold War, but indeed right from the founding of the modern
   Central/East European states about a century ago. Even during the Cold
   War, it did not take long for the trends on Western banknotes to appear
   on Central/East European banknotes as well. Thus, contrary to the
   conventional assumption of a deep-rooted normative gulf separating the
   national identity discourses of so-called ``New{''} and ``Old{''}
   Europe, the article underscores the fact of intense, longstanding
   normative cross-pollination between them. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {This article presents the essential elements for understanding a cycle
   of mobilisation in the Rekalde neighbourhood of Bilbao, which led to the
   Rekalde Families' Association becoming a referent of the neighbourhood
   movement at the municipal and state levels This was due to its ability
   to maintain high levels of struggle against an undemocratic regime that
   was unable to control the population, as well as to its role in
   articulating an identity of protest that has continued up to the
   present. The article analyses the form in which the actors put pressure
   on the municipal structures, as well as the way the latter condition, or
   generate, opportunities for action. These are actors and structures that
   are characterised by pragmatic action unfolding in practice, which we
   describe by analysing how different mechanisms of the struggle connect
   opportunities with discourses, repertoires of action and organisational
   structures.},

   Peacekeeping Operations: Is a Nationalist Orientation in the Armed

Abstract = {Mandates for UN peacekeeping operations in Africa have become more
   robust since the delivery of the Brahimi Report in 2000. Contrary to
   before, soldiers are now unmistakably expected to use force to protect
   local civilians in a number of UN peacekeeping missions in Africa. While
   this expectation of force may be celebrated, the question rises whether
   peacekeeping soldiers can meet the expectation. Are they ready to kill
   and risk their lives to protect local civilians? This question is
   especially pertinent to Western armed forces, which have contributed
   little to post-millennium UN peace operations in Africa but are
   explicitly called upon by the UN administration to contribute to the
   robust peacekeeping missions. This article discusses the question of
   moral and psychological preparedness in light of the possible tension
   between the nationalist orientation in Western armed forces and the
   cosmopolitan demands of UN peacekeeping operations in Africa.},

Title = {A Watershed in White House Journalism: Explaining the Post-1968 Rise of
   Aggressive Presidential News},
Journal = {POLITICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {27},
Number = {3},
Pages = {229-247},
Abstract = {Presidential journalism is known to have grown substantially more
   aggressive through the 1970s and beyond, but a definitive explanation
   for this trend remains elusive. Some suggest that events surrounding
   Vietnam and Watergate transformed the professional norms of journalism.
   However, the trend could also be a more superficial and transitory
   response to other circumstantial factors that converged in the same time
   period, such as president-level characteristics (the prevalence of
   Republicans, Washington outsiders, and more vigorous news management
   efforts), the political environment (the rise of official discord), and
   the economic environment (a downturn in the business cycle). This study
   disentangles these various factors and assesses their relative success
   in explaining trends in journalistic conduct in the postwar era. Data
   are drawn from a large sample of presidential news conferences from 1953
   through 2000, focusing on the aggressiveness of journalists' questions.
   The results strongly support the normative shift hypothesis, although
   economic factors have also been consequential. These results suggest a
   punctuated equilibrium model of journalistic change in relations between
   the White House press corps and the presidency.},

Abstract = {The collective choice of public consumption expenditure is reconsidered
   when voters are socially mobile. In accordance with previous work on
   social mobility and political economics, the analysis concerns a class
   of mobility processes that induce mappings from initial income to
   expected future income that are monotonically increasing and concave.
   The paper abstracts from the explicitly redistributive role of
   government and concentrates on public consumption which is modeled as a
   classical public good. In equilibrium, provision is sensitive to the
   degree of social mobility, theoretically linking social mobility to
   public consumption. Further, empirical puzzles about the impact of
   voting franchise extensions on the growth of government spending are
   addressed within the context of social mobility.},

Abstract = {Candidates in many elections spend a significant amount of their budget
   on posters, yet we know virtually nothing about their communication
   roles. Based on party strategy and visual communication research, this
   article argues that poster content is the result of strategic choices by
   candidates, with major and niche candidates using significantly
   different poster designs in an effort to influence voters' evaluations.
   Using an original database of 256 candidate posters from the 2007 French
   legislative elections and content analysis computer software, I show
   that niche party candidates consistently emphasize partisan and factual
   information cues (through size and placement on posters), while major
   party candidates rely heavily on candidate-oriented visuals and on
   nonverbal cues (e.g., eye contact) to persuade voters. Preliminary
   analyses indicate that poster visual design strategies are significantly
   associated with both major and niche party candidates' electoral
   performance.},

Abstract = {Over the past decade much has been written about the centrality of
   city-regions to accounts of economic success. But despite a rich and
   varied literature highlighting the importance of city-centric
   capitalism, the concept of the city-region remains ambiguous. Defined in
   economic terms, all too often what is missing from these accounts is how
   city-regions are constructed politically, and the processes by which
   they are rendered visible spaces. While recent interventions have done
   much to advance debates on the former, this paper explores the struggle
   to define, delimit and designate city-regions through recent endeavours
   to construct a spatial map of city-regions in England. The aim is to
   demonstrate how the processes by which city-regions are constructed
   politically are the mediated outcome of trans-regional economic flows
   and political claims to territory. The paper concludes by relating these
   findings to ongoing debates around state, space and scalar geographies,
   and speculates what they might mean for the future of city-regional
   debate. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {POLITICKA EKONOMIE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {58},
Number = {5},
Pages = {641-656},
Abstract = {The synthesis of cameralism and the classical school of political
   economy was implemented on university premises in the Czech Lands as the
   education of Adam Smith was adopted. It was spread out by presentations
   of Wenzel Gustav Kopetz, the Professor of political economy at the
   University of Prague, and by professors of political economy at the
   Olomouc Lyceum (from 1827 at the University of Olomouc). A declining
   interest of the state in political economy reduced an interest in
   economic thinking which resulted in a considerable decrease of
   publishing activity. A certain toleration of authorities to the
   criticism of the officially prescribed Sonnenfels' textbook has enabled
   the reception of new ideas of the classical school into the education.
   The lectures by Professor Kopetz, have been preserved up to these days,
   can prove it. A new independent part was formed as a discipline of the
   education.},

Title = {Challenging the State: Transnational TV and Political Identity in the
   Middle East},
Journal = {POLITICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {27},
Number = {4},
Pages = {347-366},
Abstract = {Several scholars have linked the growth of transnational Arab TV in the
   Middle East over the past decade to a rise in transnational Muslim and
   Arab political identification at the expense of national political
   identity. However, a theoretical context for understanding how media
   exposure may influence political identification in the Middle East at an
   individual level of analysis has been lacking, and to date very little
   quantitative evidence has been presented. Our article addresses this gap
   by presenting a theoretical framework for linking individual media use
   to political identity in the Middle East and then employing this
   framework to quantitatively test the association between transnational
   Arab TV exposure and individual political identification using a set of
   cross-national surveys conducted in six Middle Eastern states between
   2004 and 2008. We find evidence that exposure to transnational Arab TV
   increases the probability of transnational Muslim and Arab political
   identification at the expense of national political identities, though
   the influence of transnational TV on identity salience varied
   significantly across levels of education. Theoretical implications for
   the role of media in political socialization and identity salience, as
   well as implications for American foreign policy, are discussed.},

Abstract = {The study of cause lawyers has focused heavily on the private sector,
   but both public and private attorneys bring voting rights litigation.
   This chapter first situates voting rights litigation within cause
   lawyering, as described by Scheingold and Sarat. It then suggests
   criteria for analyzing cause lawyering across public and private sectors
   and applies them to the attorneys who have done the majority of voting
   rights litigation for American Indians: The Voting Section of the U. S.
   Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division and the Voting Rights
   Project of the American Civil Liberties Union. The chapter suggests that
   the public and private attorneys are more similar than one might expect
   in their motivation, relationship to clients, and range of political
   strategies used. Their organizational practice sites differ greatly, but
   the dynamics of the public practice site confirm that Voting Section
   attorneys are cause lawyers.},

Abstract = {Constitutions provide a relatively neutral starting point for the
   inquiry from an ideological point of view because they capture the
   values and ideals of modern statehood in written commitments and
   responsibilities.(11)
   This exposition explains how the constitutionalization of the relation
   between the State and its subjects marks the beginning of modern
   Statehood and uses early constitutional documents to induce the general
   principles and responsibilities underlying present-day democratic
   constitutional governance.
   The first part of this chapter outlines the emergence of the
   constitutional democracy and its characteristics. The second part of
   this chapter develops a conceptual model as a heuristic device for
   describing its dynamic nature.},

Journal = {POLITICAL COMMUNICATION},

Pages = {432-452},
Abstract = {Feminists have frequently accused media outlets of not giving them
   enough coverage and/or portraying them negatively. Conversely,
   conservative women have argued that media suffer from liberal biases.
   While some studies have addressed the larger question of media and
   ideological prejudices, none have examined how media report women's
   activism in comparative terms. Since feminist and conservative women's
   organizations vie with one another over who represents women's
   interests, how media portray them has implications for how well they
   achieve this goal. Using data gathered from four major national
   newspapers, this study analyzes how print journalists depict feminist
   and conservative women's activism over a 14-year span. In so doing, it
   provides information about frequency of media coverage, as well as how
   advocates are labeled, on which issues they are getting visibility, and
   whether or not media present feminist and conservative women's
   organizations as being in direct conflict with each other. Implications
   for understanding women's political efforts, broadly speaking, are also
   explored.},

Abstract = {Objectives
   Income inequality in the United States has risen during the past several
   decades. Has this produced an increase in partisan voting differences
   between rich and poor?
   Methods
   We examine trends from the 1940s through the 2000s in the country as a
   whole and in the states.
   Results
   We find no clear relation between income inequality and class-based
   voting.
   Conclusions
   Factors such as religion and education result in a less clear pattern of
   class-based voting than we might expect based on income inequality
   alone.},

Title = {Land Tenure, Democracy, and Patterns of Violence During the Maoist
   Insurgency in Nepal, 1996-2005},

Abstract = {Objectives
   We seek to investigate the determinants of Nepal's relapse into
   authoritarianism and resort to violence rather than reform as a response
   to the Maoist insurgency. Revolutionary insurgency emerged in Nepal
   after a transition to parliamentary democracy, whereas democracy is
   supposed to inoculate a nation against the risk of civil war. We present
   a theory of how the level of violence varies across districts with
   variations in the distribution of peasants among land tenure categories.
   Methods
   We use district-level data from Nepal and test hypotheses by using
   negative binominal statistical analysis.
   Results
   Our results indicate that the level of violence varies across districts
   with variations in land tenure patterns, the level of electoral
   participation, and the extent of poverty.
   Conclusions
   Our study provides insights into how the concentration of landed
   resources and political power creates incentives for a landowning
   coalition that dominated the state to use violence against those
   segments of the peasantry that have incentives to support an insurgency
   that promised to redistribute land.},

Title = {Embedded Trade: A Third-Party Effect},
Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {91},
Number = {4},
Pages = {964-983},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Objectives
   Previous work on trade, mostly from an economic perspective, assumes
   dyadic independence, and thus that trade can be explained by attributes
   of such dyads. We critique these contentions from the perspective of
   structural embeddedness, hypothesizing that sharing common third-party
   trading partners encourages dyadic trade.
   Methods
   We analyze international trade data of 78 countries in 1975 and 1996,
   using cross-sectional and longitudinal regression.
   Results
   Regression analyses support our hypothesis. A BIC analysis suggests that
   the structural embeddedness variables significantly improve the model
   fit.
   Conclusion
   International exchange of commodities, like other social interactions,
   is shaped and constrained by structurally determined opportunities.
   Thus, an explanation of economic behavior, including trade, is not
   complete without reference to the triads in which a dyad is embedded.},

Title = {Opportunities for Making Ends Meet and Upward Mobility: Differences in
   Organizational Deprivation Across Urban and Suburban Poor Neighborhoods},
Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {91},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1164-1186},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Objectives
   Given the recent rise of poverty in U.S. suburbs, this study asks: What
   poor neighborhoods are most disadvantageous, those in the city or those
   in the suburbs? Building on recent urban sociological work demonstrating
   the importance of neighborhood organizations for the poor, we are
   concerned with one aspect of disadvantage-the lack of availability of
   organizational resources oriented toward the poor. By breaking down
   organizations into those that promote mobility versus those that help
   individuals meet their daily subsistence needs, we seek to explore
   potential variations in the type of disadvantage that may exist.
   Methods
   We test whether poor urban or suburban neighborhoods are more likely to
   be organizationally deprived by breaking down organizations into three
   types: hardship organizations, educational organizations, and employment
   organizations. We use data from the 2000 U.S. County Business Patterns
   and the 2000 U.S. Census and test neighborhood deprivation using
   logistic regression models.
   Results
   We find that suburban poor neighborhoods are more likely to be
   organizationally deprived than are urban poor neighborhoods, especially
   with respect to organizations that promote upward mobility. Interesting
   racial and ethnic composition factors shape this more general finding.
   Conclusion
   Our findings suggest that if a poor individual is to live in a poor
   neighborhood, with respect to access to organizational resources, he or
   she would be better off living in the central city. Suburban residence
   engenders isolation from organizations that will help meet one's daily
   needs and even more so from those offering opportunities for mobility.},

Abstract = {The space of the Internet is often described as easy to traverse with no
   regard for national borders. Yet few have considered what such easy
   border crossings on the Internet might mean to the ordinary people
   actually doing the traversing. Our qualitative study of regular Internet
   users in Kazakhstan shows that the naming of a state-controlled space on
   the Internet, through the use of country code top-level domain names
   (ccTLDs), does in fact matter to the average user. People are aware of
   national boundary traversals as they navigate the Internet. Respondents
   in our study identified their activity on the Internet as happening
   within or outside the space of the state to which they felt allegiance
   and belonging. National borders are demarcated on the Internet through
   naming via ccTLDs and can result in individual expressions of various
   types of nationalism online. We find that ccTLDs are not just symbolic
   markers but have real meaning and their importance increases in
   locations where notions of statehood are in flux.},

Abstract = {This article addresses the question of data-sharing mechanisms under
   REACH. The members of an information exchange forum have to share their
   data. This exchange requires the adoption of a compensation scheme: the
   owner of a data receives a monetary compensation in return for the
   access to his/her data. We are interested in the choice of a
   compensation scheme that would be fair for all participants. In order to
   answer this question, the exchange of information is modeled as in Dehez
   and Tellone {[}2010]. We list a collection of axioms for the
   compensation schemes. Various combinations of these axioms characterize
   several compensation schemes. Some of them coincide with well-known
   solutions of an associated cooperative game with transferable utility.},

Abstract = {The article examines the origins and relationships between global,
   transnational history and international history, and the potential of
   these fields of enquiry to reshape European history. Divided into three
   parts, and drawing on a range of global and European examples, the
   article examines some of the ways in which transnational history holds
   the potential to blur established chronological boundaries and offer new
   approaches to the mapping of time. Global and transnational history has
   also helped to identify new processes and relationships in modern
   history, posing, in particular, new questions of comparative history and
   of Europe's relations with the world. The article concludes by
   identifying new sites of historical enquiry in European history and
   proposing additional ones.},

Abstract = {In a wage bargaining model, a stronger earnings relationship of
   unemployment benefits may reduce wages. Therefore, the benefit structure
   significantly influences profits and trade union utility, raising the
   question as to how the benefit structure is determined in the political
   process. We consider a government that chooses the earnings relationship
   in order to maximize its political support. Our model predicts a strong
   earnings relationship under right-wing governments and a weak
   relationship when unions are influential. Using panel data for 19 OECD
   countries, we find support for these theoretical predictions. Moreover,
   we show that the earnings relationship varies negatively with openness.},

Abstract = {We suggest a probabilistic voting model where voters' preferences for
   alternative public goods display habit formation. Current policies
   determine habit levels and in turn the future preferences of the voters.
   This allows the incumbent to act strategically in order to influence the
   probability of reelection. Comparing to a benchmark case of a certain
   reelection, we demonstrate that the incumbent's optimal policy features
   both a more polarized allocation between the alternative public goods
   and a debt bias.},

Abstract = {Recent empirical studies have found evidence of unstable long run money
   demand functions if recent data are used. If the link between money
   balances and the macroeconomy is fragile, the rationale of monetary
   aggregates in the ECB strategy has to be doubted. In contrast we present
   a ``stable{''} long run money demand relationship for M3 for the period
   1983-2006. To obtain the result, the short run homogeneity restriction
   between money and prices is relaxed and a break in the income elasticity
   of money demand after 2001 is taken into account. Measures of excess
   liquidity do not show significant inflation pressures.},

Abstract = {Apart from denazification, the Americans in particular promoted in
   western Germany after 1945 the ``invention{''} of contemporary history
   as an academic discipline and as a political and moral task. In this way
   important foundations were laid for a self-critical engagement with the
   past. This engagement - which for decades was associated with the
   generation of the Flakhelfer - was ultimately able to overcome the
   counter-movement in the politics of the past which commenced above all
   in the Federal Republic from 1949, but which became visible in the GDR
   as well. Since 1989/90 an open engagement with the rule of the SED and
   the Stasi has been possible in the East of Germany as well, to quite
   some extent capable of building on the critical historical research
   carried out in the West. There is much which speaks in favour of a
   judicious comparison of the fluctuations in the dealings with both
   pasts, but it is also apparent that the second cannot be understood in
   the absence of the first.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC OPINION RESEARCH},

Abstract = {This study suggests a general theoretical framework for explaining the
   decision to participate in surveys, and tests its applicability to the
   Arab minority in Israel. The theory of reasoned action is proposed as a
   conceptual framework that can explain the willingness of respondents to
   participate in surveys. Although the model tested here refers to a
   specific population (Israeli Arabs), a specific topic (coexistence) and
   a specific context (a deeply divided society), it is proposed as a
   theoretical framework that can be applied to the understanding of
   different aspects of survey behavior among different populations. A
   reasoned action model for predicting survey response intention among the
   Arab minority was validated in two face-to-face representative surveys
   in 2002 (N=688) and in 2003 (N=701). The basic structure of the model,
   postulating that attitude and subjective norm are the direct
   determinants of behavioral intention with behavioral beliefs as
   antecedents of the attitude, was supported in both studies.},

Title = {Friends of the Circuits: Interest Group Influence on Decision Making in

Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {91},
Number = {2},
Pages = {397-414},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Objective
   Though there is an extensive literature focused on the participation and
   efficacy of interest group amici curiae in the U.S. Supreme Court, there
   is little rigorous analysis of amici curiae in the U.S. Courts of
   Appeals. Here, we systematically analyze the influence of amicus curiae
   briefs on U.S. Court of Appeals decision making to provide insights
   regarding both judicial decision making and the efficacy of interest
   groups.
   Methods
   We use a probit model to capture influences on appellant success in the
   courts of appeals from 1997-2002.
   Results
   We find that amicus briefs filed in support of the appellant enhance the
   likelihood of that litigant's probability of success, but that amicus
   briefs filed in support of the appellee have no effect on litigation
   outcomes.
   Conclusion
   Amici can help level the playing field between appellants and appellees
   by serving to counter the propensity to affirm in the U.S. Courts of
   Appeals.},

Title = {Reframing the Casualties Hypothesis: (Mis)Perceptions of Troop Loss and

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC OPINION RESEARCH},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {22},

Abstract = {The casualties hypothesis predicts that as the casualties suffered by a
   nation mount during a military intervention, public opinion will turn
   against the intervention and its people will demand troop withdrawal. We
   use the U.S. war in Iraq as a context for testing the perceived
   casualties hypothesis, which predicts that public beliefs about the
   actual number of casualties account for public opinion about a military
   intervention independent of the number of casualties actually suffered.
   Using data from several thousand respondents to telephone surveys
   conducted by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press in
   2005 and 2006 as well as data on the number of U.S. casualties suffered
   as of the interview date, we find that relative to correct estimators
   and underestimators, respondents who believed the U.S. had suffered more
   casualties than had really occurred were most supportive of withdrawing
   troops from the conflict. Attention to the news predicted accuracy in
   one's beliefs about the number of casualties, but not opinion about the
   intervention (when accounting for perceptions of the number of
   casualties suffered), suggesting that accuracy of one's knowledge
   mediates the effect of attention to the news on public opinion.
   Ancillary analyses answer the question as to who is paying attention to
   the news about the war and who is more likely to have accurate knowledge
   of casualties.},

Abstract = {This survey investigates the consequences of the introduction of
   quasi-hyperbolic discounting (QHD) in a life-cycle model. QHD is the
   result of a behavioral bias (intertemporal preferences change over time)
   and a perception bias (the belief that the first bias is temporary). The
   first bias lead to suboptimal savings and excessive short-term
   indebtedness. The second to time inconsistency.
   We show how QHD can be used to explain the recent dynamics of savings
   and debt, which leads to a new assessment of the impact of financial
   deregulation. We also show how opportunistic financial agents can use
   the behavioral and perception biases to set up ``dutch books{''}.
   We introduce the libertarian paternalism doctrine of Thaler, Camerer and
   Rabin, whose aim is to reconcile two apparently irreconciliable goals:
   protection and freedom of choice.},

Abstract = {The Defense Manpower Data Center of the U.S. Department of Defense
   launched the 2006 Survey of Active Duty Spouses to assess attitudes of
   the spouses of U.S. active-duty military members. Severe problems
   existed with the sampling, weight adjustments, and estimation (including
   variance-estimation) procedures. Stratification of the sample without
   proper consideration of the survey objectives made it impossible to
   achieve reportable information for many desired population subgroups.
   Excessive stratification caused many of the sampling strata to have very
   small numbers of respondents, both expected and actual. Consequently,
   nonresponse bias was probably enormous across many of the strata. Absurd
   weight adjustments likely contributed toward rendering many survey
   estimates unreliable. To make the survey estimates seem more precise,
   sampling strata were collapsed together to form new ``variance
   strata{''} for variance estimation. Caution is advised in using results
   from this and other Defense Manpower Data Center surveys.},

Abstract = {Previous research on public opinion regarding military expenditures in
   the United States was conducted predominantly in the cold war context.
   This analysis of public opinion in thirty major U.S. cities over the
   period 1999 through 2002 revisits this earlier literature in light of
   changing sociopolitical conditions during a period bracketing the onset
   of the war on terrorism. The study offers support for much of the
   earlier research with respect to sources of support for robust military
   expenditures, in the process illustrating the value of archival data in
   replicating key research findings in extant literature conducted in a
   cold war context. The results of the multivariate analysis offer
   important insights into the sources of public support for military
   expenditure in the post-9/11 setting.},

   polities. We hypothesize that corruption in nondemocratic settings will
   be greater where the ruling group is personalistic rather than a
   political party or a military clique and that it will be greater where
   rulers expect to remain in power longer. We construct a new
   operationalization of the selectorate theory advanced by Bueno de
   Mesquita et al.
   Methods
   We use cross-sectional statistical analysis (OLS) to examine a sample of
   40-odd authoritarian regimes as of 2000.
   Results
   Our results indicate that personalistic and personalistic-hybrid regimes
   are more prone to corruption than single-party and military regimes and
   also that rulers who expect to remain in power for longer are less
   corrupt. Corroborating previous studies, we document that the
   availability of natural resources and higher levels of institutionalized
   autocracy are associated with greater corruption and that wealthier
   countries experience less corruption. Our results are consistent with
   previous studies, including that of Bueno de Mesquita et al., but
   because of our reconstruction of selectorate theory in terms of
   real-world regime types, they are more easily interpretable.
   Conclusions
   Our study sheds light on why African countries are so notoriously
   corrupt. The personalistic authoritarian regimes that have arisen there
   in the postcolonial period appear especially prone to corruption,
   whereas military and single-party dictatorships are less corrupt.},

Abstract = {Since the early 1980s, ``linguistic{''} and ``cultural{''} influences
   have shaped the study of history and the broader social sciences
   worldwide. In Australia these influences have developed more slowly than
   in comparable countries such as Great Britain or the United States. Yet
   the colourful language and ``culture wars{''} of Australian politics
   have long been key ingredients of political history's appeal in and
   outside of the academy. Many practitioners perceive that the so-called
   ``turns{''} constitute a threat to the study of political history. This
   article contends that, on the contrary, they have enlivened
   historiographical concerns.},

Abstract = {About a decade ago, papers by Gruner and Hefeker (1999) and Cukierman
   and Lippi (2001) predicted that European Monetary Union may lead to
   higher inflation and unemployment in some participating countries.
   Meanwhile, we know that these predictions have not come true. The
   present paper develops a model of trade union behavior that explains why
   EMU was more successful than we predicted. The paper also sheds new
   light on the macroeconomic role of central bank flexibility. (c) 2009

Title = {COORDINATION OF FISCAL POLICIES IN EMU},
Booktitle = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2010},
Pages = {119-134},
Abstract = {A certain loss in efficient national economic policies has taken place,
   given that the globalization of the economy and steps towards economic
   integration mean that the economic policies of different countries has
   an effect that reaches beyond their own borders, not only positive
   ({''}locomotive effect{''}), but also negative ({''}beggar your
   neighbour{''}).
   In addition, taking into account the efficiency problems of fiscal
   policy and the effects caused by other countries, coupled with the
   fiscal policy effects on monetary policy in the Monetary Union, the
   basis for coordinating national fiscal policies and the conditions set
   out in order to form part of the EMU, were established in the Maastricht
   Treaty. This process of restricting room for manoeuvre in national
   fiscal policies culminated in the Stability and Growth Pact (SPG)
   So, this chapter is devoted to the analysis of the evolution and
   theories that analyze the economic effects of the use of fiscal policy.
   The third section undertakes the analysis of the conditions imposed by
   the Stability and Growth Pact and how it conditions the possibilities of
   using fiscal policy on the part of member states. Section four contains
   an empirical analysis of the evolution of public finances for countries
   in the Euro zone. The chapter ends with some brief conclusions},

Journal = {POLITICKA EKONOMIE},

Volume = {58},

Abstract = {The interpretation of the relation between a budget deficit and a
   government debt in the standard economic theory is based on its
   unilateral causality, where the government debt comes into being due to
   the accumulation of budget deficits. The logic of the development of the
   government indebtedness is, in this approach, unambiguously determined
   by public finance processes monitored by Parliament in the framework of
   the course of fiscal years.
   The main objective of this paper is to stress that in reality the
   development of government indebtedness is significantly influenced by
   off-budgetary factors.
   The presented results endorse the hypothesis that the influence of
   stock-flow adjustment on the development of the debt/GDP ratio in a
   number of cases surpasses the influence of the budget balance. This
   trend significantly amplifies in the period of a financial crisis in
   context of the massive shift of the debt burden, occurring in the course
   of them.},

Abstract = {The past several decades have seen a tremendous increase in the U. S.
   incarceration rate, with varying trends in other advanced industrial
   democracies. These developments have only recently begun to attract the
   attention of political scientists. This chapter provides a critical
   review of recent literature on mass incarceration by both political
   scientists and scholars in related disciplines, and a discussion of
   directions for further research. I argue that further work in this area
   should involve theoretically informed analysis of interactions between
   criminal justice experts and professionals, elected politicians, and the
   public at large, with particular attention to how public concerns about
   crime are parsed and interpreted by public officials in the making of
   penal policy.},

Abstract = {Long-term memory processes have been extensively examined in recent
   literature as they provide simple way to test for predictabilty in the
   underlying process. However, most of the literature interprets the
   results of estimated Hurst exponent simply by its comparison to its
   asymptotic limit of 0.5. Therefore, we use moving block bootstrap method
   for resealed range and periodogram method. In our analysis of evolution
   of Hurst exponent between 1997 and 2009, we show that PX experienced
   persistent behavior which weakened in time. Nevertheless, the returns of
   PX remain close to confidence interval separating independent and
   persistent behavior.},

Abstract = {This study examines factors that influence transparency and access in
   e-disclosure of state campaign finances. Although e-disclosure has the
   potential to increase campaign finance transparency and real-time public
   access to information, little research has been conducted on the factors
   that have influenced the extent of state e-disclosure practices.
   E-disclosure practices are analyzed from 2003 through 2007 for the 50
   states using multivariate cross-sectional time series analysis and data
   from the Campaign Disclosure Project. Findings indicate the positive
   influence of legislative professionalism and state resources on more
   comprehensive and transparent e-disclosure approaches. Findings also
   indicate the importance of political factors not found to be salient in
   earlier e-government research and an ideological divergence between
   political elites and the general public on the value of disclosure.},

Journal = {POLITICKA EKONOMIE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {58},
Number = {5},
Pages = {657-674},
Abstract = {This study investigates the relationship between wages and risks of
   work-related fatalities in the Czech labour market. To prove this
   relationship, we followed the theory of compensating wage differentials
   and the theory of hedonic prices. Using data from 2007 Czech labour
   survey, we econometrically derived three hedonic wage functions. To
   estimate mortality risks premiums, two of hedonic wage functions used
   objective measures of fatality risk, one subjectively perceived risk. We
   found a positive and statistically significant correlation between wages
   and occupational fatality risks in all three models. The estimated
   effect was lower for hedonic function with worker's perception of
   mortality risks. This result implies the workers themselves
   underestimate the fatality risks that they are exposed. Based on
   estimated hedonic wage functions, we computed the value of a statistical
   life (VSL) which indicates the marginal rate of substitution between
   compensation and mortality risk. The implied value of VSL is 60 million
   CZK for the model with subjectively perceived risks and 266 million CZK
   for the models with objective risks in 2009 Czech crowns.},

Journal = {ETHICS \& GLOBAL POLITICS},
Year = {2010},

Abstract = {The literature on transnational civil society encompasses a number of
   conflicting views regarding civil society organizations' (CSOs) behavior
   and impacts and the desirability of civil society involvement in
   international policymaking. This piece suggests that this lack of
   consensus arises from the diverse range of contexts in which CSOs
   operate and the wide variety of activities in which they engage. This
   article seeks to organize and analyze the disparate data on civil
   society by developing a context-based standard of democratic legitimacy
   for CSOs. The article disaggregatcs democracy into input, throughput,
   and output components, and shows how CSOs must support or manifest
   different aspects of democracy in order to be democratically legitimate
   in a given context. Applying this standard to existing works, the
   article identifies several problems in current research, including a
   failure to recognize ways the democratic imperatives of transnational
   advocacy differ from national advocacy, and the potential for
   international civil society interventions to undermine local democratic
   processes.},

   the possibilities of mantaining a motion to appeal and the right to
   having a conviction or sentence reviewed by a higher court in the
   context of an oral model of civil procedure. The thesis of this work
   chooses to sustain the rationality, feasibility and utility of

Abstract = {Although the nature of the Internet forecloses national control to a
   degree, it also provides opportunities for pursuing national interests
   abroad. In fact, the Internet has gradually become a battleground for
   competing ideologies. One problem from a US point of view is China's
   censorship regime. Whereas China's economic reform program demands a
   free flow of information,(323) its commitment to the Communist Party
   China (CPC) seems to require the opposite.(324) China's information
   policies also affect foreign parties. Whereas its liberal economic
   policy has opened up the Chinese market to foreign businesses, its
   political commitment to the CPC has induced foreign businesses,
   including US corporations, to engage in Internet censorship. Since these
   latter activities run counter to fundamental US values, they are a thorn
   in the flesh of the US government.
   The Global Online Freedom Act (GOFA),(325) a US bill specifically
   designed to fight foreign censorship activities on the Internet,
   addresses the conduct of US corporations under censorship regimes. Since
   search operators are pivotal players in the dissemination of Internet
   content, this exposition takes Google's censorship activities in China
   as a case in point and shows why the GOFA, designed to fight this
   conduct, does more harm than good in this respect.
   Due to the intimate connection between information access and barriers
   to trade, economic and political objectives largely coincide on the
   Internet. This chapter shows the disadvantages of a rights-based
   approach, as proposed in the GOFA, and explores the possibilities of an
   economic approach based on antitrust law. It concludes that although
   this route could offer a promising and more effective way to fight
   censorship activities abroad, it requires a shift in economic policy the
   US is not yet ready to endorse.},

Journal = {POLITICAL COMMUNICATION},

Volume = {27},

Pages = {158-177},
Abstract = {Research on framing effects has demonstrated how elites can influence
   public opinion by the way they present and interpret political issues.
   However, these findings overwhelmingly stem from experimental settings
   that differ from how issues are typically discussed in real-world
   political situations. This study takes framing research to more
   realistic contexts by exploiting a natural experiment to examine the
   neglected role of political parties in framing effects. Examining the
   effects on public opinion of a sudden shift in how a major political
   party frames a salient issue, I demonstrate that parties can be powerful
   in shaping the policy preferences among their supporters. Yet, even
   strong partisans do not follow the party line uncritically. Rather, they
   judge the party frame according to their own beliefs about the problems
   surrounding the issue. Thus, party elites face the challenge of
   developing frames that resonate with their voters' preexisting beliefs
   if they want to shape policy preferences, even among their otherwise
   most loyal supporters. These dynamics have important implications for
   understanding interactions between political elites and the public.},

Journal = {POLITICKA EKONOMIE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {58},
Number = {4},
Pages = {542-565},
Abstract = {It is always difficult to define the one and only measure of poverty, as
   there are different concepts of poverty based on a number of welfare
   indicators. The paper discuses main approaches to individual welfare
   measurement. A measure of individual welfare in the concept of relative
   deprivation is proposed. Three dimensions of relative deprivation are
   considered (economic strain, inability to afford certain items, and
   housing). The measure is based on multiplicative approach and thus is
   more sensitive to changes and differences in data than measures based on
   additive approach. The measure reflects the complex nature of
   households' relative deprivation and is applied to Slovak EU SILC 2005
   2008 microdata in order to analyze the level of poverty in Slovakia in
   the concept of relative deprivation. Three different poverty lines are
   applied to the data and results are compared. Level of poverty in terms
   of relative deprivation is decreasing in Slovakia over time. Using the
   proposed approach, the results strongly depend on the number of
   components included in each dimension, as well as the components itself.
   In accordance with economic changes in the society, in the further
   research reappraisal of certain components could be a matter of
   discussion in order to reflect the present situation.},

   endogenous Such markets may have multiple equilibria Further, equilibria
   with more sects result in higher welfare and lower membership costs, as

Abstract = {This article is a study of the Australian government's exchanges with
   the Chamberlain government over the ultimately unsuccessful attempt to
   negotiate a Grand Alliance between the United Kingdom, France and the
   Soviet Union during 1939. Robert Menzies and Stanley Bruce carefully
   weighed the arguments for and against before deciding to support the
   proposal for an Alliance. Yet there was considerable ambivalence about
   their support as evidenced by Bruce's panicky response to the
   Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. In its own very small and distant way the
   Menzies government contributed to the inertia that marked the British
   Empire's failure to secure a Grand Alliance in 1939.},

Abstract = {It is a central political goal to secure disabled individuals the same
   opportunities as others to pursue their conception of a good life. This
   goal reflects an ambition to combine an egalitarian and a liberal moral
   intuition. In this article, we analyse how disabled individuals who take
   part in economic activity should be compensated in order to respect
   these two intuitions. The article asks how a system of disability
   compensation should be structured and what the level of such
   compensation should be. It also analyses how the answers to these
   questions depend on whether the disabled individuals are held
   responsible for their choice of work effort.},

Abstract = {Writing the history of a continent is generally a tricky business. If
   the continent is not even a real continent, but rather `a western
   peninsula of Asia' (Alexander von Humboldt) without a clear definition
   of where the continent becomes peninsula, things do not get any easier.
   Despite these problems there is no dearth of trying. In fact, writing
   European histories seems to become more fashionable by the year -
   ironically just as the political and institutional expansion of Europe
   is losing steam. While the European Union is catching its breath, the
   historians are catching up. With the first wave of post-Euro and
   post-big-bang-Enlargement literature written, it is time for the
   reviewer to survey the landscape - and to provide some guideposts for
   future exploration.},

Title = {Estimating the Effect of Tobacco Contributions on Legislative Behavior
   Using Panel Data},

Pages = {635-648},

Abstract = {Objective. This article uses a data set of California State legislators
   to determine the effect of tobacco contributions on legislative
   behavior. Methods. Although many previous studies have analyzed the
   effect of campaign contributions on legislative behavior, this study
   makes a number of improvements to previous studies, including the use of
   panel data and improved instruments. Results. I find that contrary to
   prior research on tobacco industry contributions, campaign contributions
   from the tobacco industry do not influence legislative support for the
   tobacco industry. Conclusion. This suggests that the tobacco industry is
   not an exception to the literature on the influence of campaign
   contributions, which has shown that campaign contributions generally do
   not influence legislative voting and other behavior.},

Title = {Expanding the Scope of Conflict: Interest Groups and Interstate Compacts},
Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {91},
Number = {3},
Pages = {669-688},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Objective. This study looks at how the characteristics of states'
   interest group environments affect state participation in interstate
   compacts. Drawing on prominent theories of interest system
   characteristics, we hypothesize that interest group density and
   concentration will influence a state's propensity to join compacts.
   Method. Using pooled cross-sectional time-series event-count models, we
   test our hypotheses for 48 states over a 30-year period. Results. We
   find that states with denser interest group systems are more likely to
   join interstate compacts, but that greater concentration of organized
   interests in a few economic sectors impedes compact formation.
   Additional analyses show that the effects of state interest group
   systems vary across types of interest groups and compacts. In
   particular, the effects of interest group density appear to be driven
   primarily by not-for-profit groups generating increased state
   participation in noneconomic compacts. Conclusion. Interstate
   cooperation is influenced in important ways by characteristics of
   interest group environments.},

Abstract = {In 1961 the Italian nation-state celebrated one hundred years of
   unification with an official celebration held in the northern capital of
   Turin. Named Italia'61, the purpose of the event was to display what
   comprised and composed a united Italy in 1961 and to showcase what was
   bringing about a post-war Italian ``renascence{''}. However, the 1961
   celebration could not deliver the new beginning hoped for, as in the
   tradition of previous celebrations the organisers presented a narrative
   of the nation that was in support of the party and administration in
   power and in service of their geopolitical interests. Such intent and
   purpose become clear by looking at the evolution of the planning of what
   began as a solitary celebration specific to Turin and became the
   official national commemoration event for the 1961 Centennial.},

Abstract = {This article shows that social norms are better explained as correlating
   devices for a correlated equilibrium of the underlying stage game,
   rather than Nash equilibria. Whereas the epistemological requirements
   for rational agents playing Nash equilibria are very stringent and
   usually implausible, the requirements for a correlated equilibrium
   amount to the existence of common priors, which we interpret as induced
   by the cultural system of the society in question. When the correlating
   device has perfect information, we need in addition only to posit that
   individuals obey the social norm when it is costless to do so. When the
   correlating device has incomplete information, the operation of the
   social norm requires that individuals have a predisposition to follow
   the norm even when this is costly. The latter case explains why social
   norms are associated with other-regarding preferences and provides a
   basis for analyzing honesty and corruption.},

Abstract = {There is considerable debate over whether and how net neutrality should
   apply to wireless networks. We address here whether differences between
   wired and wireless network technology merit different treatment with
   respect to net neutrality. The primary focus is on applications and
   traffic management, rather than device attachment. We first review the
   pertinent aspects of network architecture and discuss the main
   differences between wired and wireless networks, and find that wireless
   networks differ substantially from wired networks at the network layer
   and below. We then turn more specifically to how wired and wireless
   networks differ with respect to traffic management, and conclude that
   wireless networks require some different types of traffic management
   than wired networks. Finally, we turn to the question of how the
   differences in traffic management affect net neutrality, and find that
   despite the differences in traffic management, similar net neutrality
   concerns apply. Furthermore, we argue that since the differences lie in
   lower layers, net neutrality in both wired and wireless networks can be
   effectively accomplished by requiring an open interface between network
   and transport layers. We argue that this is a more streamlined and more
   effective solution that carving out a set of managed services.},

Abstract = {Elinor Ostrom is justly valued for her contributions to understanding
   the nature of and solution to common pool resource problems (CPRs). Her
   solution is generally referred to as balancing the aim of reducing the
   high costs associated with political solutions with that of ameliorating
   the absence of incentives to create solutions at all in the market-based
   approach. In this short paper, I characterize her solution as a ``aEuro
   parts per thousand aEuro similar to just right' solution,{''} in the
   sense that it is a governmental solution, but one that balances these
   objectives. I consider endogenous variables that help maintain the
   creation of the institution to solve CPRs as being the ``just right{''}
   solution, because it is at just the correct scope.},

Abstract = {Twenty years ago the intellectual projects that have become known as
   critical geopolitics emerged at the end of the cold war as a series of
   critiques of geopolitical reasoning. Drawing heavily on Edward Said's
   formulations of Orientalism the critical analyses probed the dense
   cultural productions of danger, the rationalisations for intervention
   and the logics of ``Western{''} foreign policies. The geographical
   specifications of the world in the political discourses used to justify
   numerous imperial actions, and the rationales for the provision of
   security came under sustained scrutiny. Now two decades later despite
   the supposed end of history and endless invocations of globalization,
   the themes of empire and Orientalism remain at the heart of the Western
   geopolitical imaginary, explicitly structuring how the security
   intellectuals of our time plan for war and justify the construction of
   their military machines. Given the continuing dangers of warfare in a
   biosphere that is being radically destabilized by the modes of economy
   and violence these geopolitical texts legitimize, the necessity for
   critique remains compelling. But given the proliferation of uses of the
   term critical geopolitics, and the numerous disciplinary concerns
   encompassed by it, perhaps the time has come to narrow its focus once
   again to its core themes which involve confronting and challenging the
   geographical reasoning used in the legitimizations of contemporary
   warfare. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This study examines the phenomenon of informal civil-military relations.
   Informal behaviors are those that normally do not occur within the chain
   of command, are not mandated by law, and do not conform to official
   procedures. Politicians and soldiers discover that formal, institutional
   routines are sometimes too constraining and that they can advance their
   interests more effectively by amending, circumventing, or violating
   those routines. The party most aggrieved by the rules of the game
   initiates an informal solution. Whether the other side goes along
   depends on how divergent its preferences are with the aggrieved party.
   Greatly divergent preferences result in unilateral informalities, less
   divergent but still negotiable positions yield bilateral- conflictive
   encounters, and convergent preferences result in cooperative ventures.
   Case studies on Chile, Argentina, and Bolivia exemplify three different
   kinds of informal encounters and their impacts on civilian policy
   choices and military interests..},

Title = {Workers' strategies to secure jobs, their uses of scale, and competing
   economic moralities: Rethinking the `geography of justice'},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {29},
Number = {3},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This paper considers workers' strategies to secure jobs, the justice of
   these strategies, and the spatial scales which they involve. It is
   argued that the justice of such strategies is strongly bound up with the
   scales at which they are enacted: the morality of social relations is
   intrinsically geographical. The paper discusses strategies within which
   workers compete individually or collectively for a given
   geographically-structured supply of jobs, including the use of social
   oppressions and territorial chauvinism in such competition. It contrasts
   these strategies with actions which challenge social oppression within
   employment, and which seek to know, contest and control flows of capital
   at large spatial scales. These latter strategies present a radical
   alternative to mutual competition, and embody different notions of
   economic justice. All of these strategies are analysed for the relations
   among workers and between workers and capital which they construct, the
   scales at which these relations are played out, the political ideologies
   they involve, and the moral notions generated and deployed. It is argued
   that to understand these different moralities, justice needs to be
   conceptualised not as rights understood as quasi-property of individuals
   but rather as a moral aspect of social relations. Accordingly, the
   `geography of justice' is conceived as the geography of these social
   relations rather than geographical patterns of (dis)advantage. It is
   argued that the `interests' of individuals and of collectives are not
   given objectively by social structure but are constructed through and
   between different feasible strategies of action; this has implications
   for the problem which selfishness poses to socialist economic
   strategies. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

   the matter.
   He also examines the strong impact that the constitutional reform of
   1994 has resulted in the field of human rights in the Argentine legal
   scenario, the reception at the national level of conventionality control
   established by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, and the
   monitoring line, not always uniformly exhibited by the Supreme Court,
   regarding the judgments and advisory opinions of the Inter-American
   Court, the pronouncements of the Inter-American Commission of Human
   Rights and other quasi-judicial bodies belonging to the universal scheme

Pages = {3-24},

Abstract = {This article measures and explains criticism in U.S. and French national
   newspapers during the 1990s and 2000s. Criticism is operationalized in
   terms of discrete critical statements directed at governmental,
   political party, business, civil society, and foreign/international
   organizations or officials; such critical statements, which take various
   forms-administrative, character, truth, ideology, policy, and
   strategy-offer a more comprehensive measure of criticism on a day-to-day
   basis than the occasional in-depth investigative report. While state
   intervention is often argued to have a censoring effect, this study
   finds that the more ``statist{''} French press presents a greater
   density of criticisms than the U.S. press. French newspapers that
   receive the highest direct subsidies are not less critical of the
   government or dominant party than other French (or U.S.) newspapers.
   French newspapers exhibit a slightly higher degree of political
   parallelism, but in both countries newspapers tend to aim the greatest
   amount of criticism toward the party in power, whether Left or Right.
   Relatively higher French criticism is also facilitated by a distinctive
   French journalistic cultural form, the ``debate ensemble,{''} that, in
   contrast to U.S. ``dramatic narrative,{''} organizes the news as a clash
   of critical opposing viewpoints.},

   justice feasible?},
Journal = {ETHICS \& GLOBAL POLITICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {3},
Number = {2},
Pages = {85-99},
Abstract = {The discussion of global justice has mainly focused on global
   distributive justice. This article argues for global rectificatory
   justice, mainly by former colonial states in favor of former colonized
   peoples. The argument depends on the following premises: (1) there is a
   moral obligation to rectify the consequences of wrongful acts; (2)
   colonialism was on the whole harmful for the colonies; (3) the present
   unjust global structure was constituted by colonialism; and (4) the
   obligation of rectificatory justice is trans-generational so long as
   there are at present identifiable beneficiaries and victims of past
   injustice. Although it is too demanding to ask for full compensation for
   450 years of colonialism, the former colonial powers can in different
   ways and to the best of their efforts contribute to change the present
   inequalities that are the legacy of history. A theory of global
   rectificatory justice is complementary to a theory of global
   distributive justice and enables us to develop a fuller understanding of
   the meaning of global justice.},

Volume = {15},
Number = {4},
Pages = {684-704},
Abstract = {In the summer of 2007, the geopolitics of Russo-North Caucasian
   relations were once again manifest in inter-ethnic violence. During the
   course of six weeks of rioting between ethnic Russian (russkii) and
   non-ethnic Russian (rossiiskii) citizens, three students were killed
   (one Chechen and two Russians) and pogroms were conducted widely. This
   article addresses these events through a focus on the nature and
   politics of the riots and those involved. I argue that a range of
   tensions came together to form a localised geopolitics, and that this
   contributes to an understanding of why these events took place.
   Ultimately, the riots are important as an event which reveals much about
   the complexity of power, space, and identity in contemporary Russia.},

Abstract = {This final contribution shows that the relationship between economics
   and sociology has been largely changing during the last period. During a
   long time, we attended an opposition between a sociology that benefited
   from exhaustive empirical studies on the demand side, producing
   important debates about cultural stratification; and economics that
   benefited from very seminal analysis tools stressing the importance of
   market competition and information.
   This contribution takes as an example of new reciprocate exchanges the
   domain of artistic labor supply and three related issues (the evolution
   of the artistic occupations' categorization; the relevant criteria of
   professionalization; the distribution of the corresponding incomes).
   Then, P.M. Menger shows that sociology and economics are
   cross-fertilizing and mutually benefit from their specific researches
   programs. Very likely, the polarization of such disciplinary
   perspectives on the seminal concept of uncertainty has contributed to
   this mutual enrichment.},

Abstract = {Do the outcomes of government action differ between periods of unified
   and divided government? Using ``event study{''} methodology, this
   articles addresses the question by looking at sudden shifts between
   divided and unified government-Bush v. Gore, the Jeffords switch, and
   the 2002 election. The results show that oil and gas stocks (i.e.
   Republican ``constituent firms{''}) rose abruptly as Republicans took
   unified control, while renewable energy stocks (i.e. Democratic
   ``constituent firms{''}) fell. The pattern reversed, however, when
   Democrats took back control of the Senate. These outcomes call into
   question non-partisan theories of law making.},

Abstract = {Recent histories of Ancient Greece describe a transition from customary
   law to public criminal Justice between 800 and 400 B C This narrative
   contains three pieces of evidence against the presumption that prisons
   are a public good and government must provide incarcerations First,
   before the rise of a formal government, Ancient Greece had a functioning
   system of criminal law enforcement Second, the timeline surrounding the
   rise of government institutions in Ancient Greece originated with
   Solon's penal reforms Lastly, the rise of a government system was more
   the result of private rather than public interest},

Abstract = {It is widely recognized that religious institutions and values play a
   prominent political role in various countries around the world. What is
   less clear is the degree to which other prominent ideologies perform an
   analogous role in regions where they predominate. The purpose of this
   article is to explore the relationship between Confucianism and liberal
   democracy in Taiwan. As the most important belief system in Taiwan and,
   indeed, in much of East Asia, Confucianism has provided a model of civic
   behavior for centuries, performing a largely priestly role. What is less
   apparent is whether Confucianism inhibited or promoted the development
   of liberal democracies in the region. While an extensive theoretical
   debate exists on this question, virtually no work analyzes how
   Confucianism has been understood by political actors on the ground. The
   data for this study consist of interviews with 27 politicians, democracy
   activists, Confucianism scholars, and journalists in Taiwan. The article
   tests whether or not, in the minds of these key political and cultural
   leaders, Confucian values are an aid or a hindrance to their efforts to
   promote liberal democracy. The concluding section discusses the
   implications of the empirical results for East Asian countries and
   addresses the parallels between Confucianism as an ideology in East Asia
   and the religious institutions and values in Western countries.},

Title = {Is a Raceless Identity an Effective Strategy for Academic Success Among
   Blacks?},
Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {91},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1242-1263},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Objective
   <link rid={''}b21 b22{''}>Fordham (1988, 1996) notes that because the
   larger black community has a culture that is oppositional to mainstream
   U.S. society, blacks who wish to maintain academic success and achieve
   upward socioeconomic mobility feel pressure to adopt a raceless
   identity. The purpose of this study is to examine whether a raceless
   identity leads to better educational outcomes for blacks in high school
   than does a nonraceless identity.
   Methods
   Using data from the Maryland Adolescence Development In Context Study
   (MADICS), we create five profiles intended to capture blacks' connection
   to their race and determine whether racial/ethnic connections among
   blacks are associated with school achievement, educational aspirations,
   value attributed to schooling, or detachment from schooling. These links
   are assessed net of affective feelings about being black and beliefs
   about shared fate.
   Results
   The findings are not consistent with the racelessness perspective.
   Specifically, blacks in the race ambivalent and race similar profiles
   have higher achievement and educational aspirations, and attribute more
   value to schooling and are less detached from schooling than are those
   in the race neutral profile.
   Conclusion
   Prior studies have overstated the extent to which racelessness helps
   achievement.},

Title = {The Continuing Significance of Race: An Analysis Across Two Levels of
   Policing},
Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {91},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1025-1042},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Objectives
   Survey research has demonstrated that there is significant race
   variation in perceptions of the police, with black citizens holding
   lower levels of trust than do whites. Although these differences have
   been well documented, few studies have examined if and how these
   differences vary across police organizations. Using survey data from the
   North Carolina Highway Traffic Study, the objective of this research was
   to explore the influence of vicarious experience and perceptions of
   racial profiling in accounting for racial variation in trust across two
   levels of policing-highway patrol and city/local police.
   Methods
   Ordinal logistic regression was utilized to assess both their
   independent and combined influences as the methodology.
   Results
   The results suggest that across both police agencies, the race gap in
   trust is strongly associated with vicarious experience and perceptions
   of racial profiling.
   Conclusions
   The results provide some support for examining perceptions of police
   across levels of policing as the results suggest that perceptions of one
   police organization are not necessarily generalizable across them all.},

Abstract = {One way of responding to the question of what PPE is involves mobilizing
   the tools that PPE involves. That is the exercise attempted in this
   article. The object is to use PPE as a method to analyze PPE as a
   subject matter. PPE is, whatever else, an interdisciplinary enterprise;
   so the point of departure involves analyzing the role and properties of
   disciplines within the institutional organization of enquiry. The basic
   idea is that enquiry is governed by a `division of epistemic labour' in
   Adam Smith's sense, and that that division of labour depends for its
   working on institutions for the reliable certification of claims.
   Disciplines are such `institutions'. As such, they are indispensable.
   But they impose centripetal forces within the organization of enquiry
   that stand against interdisciplinary work. Understanding these forces
   offers some hope of securing an `optimal' compromise between the
   benefits and costs that disciplines entail. Examples are offered from
   each of the disciplines involved in PPE separately, and some
   observations are offered about the architecture of the three
   disciplines' interrelationships.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the passage of the Central American Free Trade
   Agreement (CAFTA) in 2005, paying particular attention to the role of
   campaign contributions. The CAFTA vote is significant in that the
   context in which it occurred was one in which campaign contributions
   were more likely to influence votes. By more carefully identifying the
   special interest groups actively involved in the CAFTA debate, I provide
   a more accurate assessment of the impact of the contributions made by
   these groups. I use instrumental variables to control for the potential
   endogeneity of campaign contributions and find that these contributions
   played at best a secondary role in determining the outcome of the CAFTA
   vote in the U. S. House of Representatives.},

Abstract = {Venezuela, one of few Latin American countries that did not have to
   democratize during the Third Wave, veered hardest to the left at the
   turn of the century. Now, this country, despite its democratic
   tradition, apparently has most to fear with respect to continued
   civilian control of the military. This article shows how Venezuela's
   democracia pactada (democracy-by-pact) and its Bolivarian Revolution
   both permitted fusing of military with political power across policy
   areas. However, the emergence of a coordinate system for civilian
   control of the military protects Hugo Chavez even as it places certain
   constraints on the anti-American president. Moreover, this form of
   civilian control matches elements of the U. S. example. Accurate
   description, or coding, of Venezuela opens an avenue for improved
   military-to-military relations, which could, in turn, lay the foundation
   for constructive U.S.-Venezuelan engagement in the Western Hemisphere.},

Abstract = {Objective. This study examines the influence of ethnic and racial
   network diversity on young people's attitudes about speech rights in
   Canada by examining the impact of diversity on racist groups' speech
   compared to other objectionable speech. Methods. After reviewing prior
   work on diversity and political tolerance judgments, the study presents
   multinomial logistic regressions to assess the impact of network
   diversity on three types of political tolerance dispositions. The data
   are drawn from the Canadian Youth Study, a sample of 10th- and
   11th-grade students in Quebec and Ontario (N = 3,334). Results. The
   analysis suggests that exposure to racial and ethnic diversity in one's
   social networks decreases political tolerance of racist speech while
   simultaneously having a positive effect on political tolerance of other
   types of objectionable speech. Conclusions. The dual effects arguably
   represent an evolving norm of multicultural political tolerance, in
   which citizens endorse legal limits on racist speech. Future work should
   assess the extent to which target group distinctions in political
   tolerance judgments have evolved over time and across age cohorts.},

Abstract = {Lin Ostrom's work constitutes a great step forward in the analysis of
   social governance. Instead of focusing on the technical characteristics
   of goods she studies what types of institutions have emerged and how
   they affect individual motivation and behavior in public goods and
   commons situations. Her approach represents a careful analysis of
   institutions often emerging from below. Unorthodox impacts of
   institutions on individual motivation and behavior as well as the
   possible creation of new institutions must be taken into account. The
   constitution must ensure that the involved individuals can establish
   adequate institutions regardless of possible opposition by politicians
   and bureaucrats.},

Abstract = {Elinor Ostrom and the Bloomington School's important contributions
   include the development of the concept of ``polycentric{''} political

   problems may be solved voluntarily by rational individuals, even in
   situations that resemble Prisoners' Dilemmas. The program, however, pays
   little attention to how individuals' ability to exit may affect the

   We argue why this is a worthwhile consideration and survey results from

Volume = {26},

Abstract = {The literature on intergenerational conflict and public budgets has
   shown that the demands of the elderly may crowd out educational
   spending. We extend this literature to take into account altruism within
   the family where individuals care about the welfare of family members.
   The conflicting claims to the public budget will reflect the political
   strength of age groups, but may also be influenced by whether
   middle-aged have children or elderly parents in the community. We
   investigate the role of family altruism using both survey data and
   demographic and local government budget data in Norway from 1992 to
   2004. Family altruism matters for local government spending on primary
   education, but does not affect spending on old-age care and health
   services. The old must take care of their own interests themselves. (C)

Abstract = {One objection to the principle of public reason is that since there is
   room for reasonable disagreement about distributive justice as well as
   about human flourishing, the requirement of reasonable acceptability
   rules out redistribution as well as perfectionism. In response, some
   justificatory liberals have invoked the argument from higher-order
   unanimity, or nested inclusiveness. If it is not reasonable to reject
   having some system of property rights, and if redistribution is just the
   enforcement of a different set of property rights, redistribution is
   legitimate if chosen democratically. This article explores two problems
   with this response. First, there are different ways to describe the set
   of possible policies, and so different ways to specify the noncoercive
   default that obtains in the absence of conclusive justification. Second,
   if the coercive exercise of political power must be conclusively
   justified, policies that are more coercive ought to require conclusive
   justification as against policies that are less coercive. These problems
   about the baseline with respect to which we require public justification
   raise the question of how we measure coercion, and whether or in what
   sense there is a presumption against coercion. The article distinguishes
   and argues against three such presumptions.},

Title = {Government 2.0? Technology, Trust and Collaboration in the UAE Public
   Sector},
Journal = {POLICY AND INTERNET},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {2},
Number = {1},
Pages = {63-97},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Increased use of the Internet and related technologies in government
   seems to hold out promise for a collaborative governance model, derived
   from cross-agency information and knowledge sharing, but many
   governments struggle to attain this goal. Over the past decade, many
   local and federal government entities in the United Arab Emirates
   witnessed a shift from the traditional, hierarchical `silos mode' of
   governance into a `competitive mode,' heavily influenced by `New Public
   Management' approaches. Although competition has had a relatively
   positive impact on government efficiency, there is evidence that it has
   increased institutional and policy complexity, reduced levels of trust
   and decreased knowledge sharing in government, thereby reinforcing
   information silos and hindering collaboration and cross-government
   innovations. This article reports a national survey of UAE government
   employees in federal and local government institutions which found that
   `technology,' `leadership' and `trust' are perceived as the top three
   interconnected enablers of collaboration in the UAE government. The
   article concludes that there is now a possibility to move towards a more
   collaborative mode in governance, using technological innovations to
   bring down the cost of social transactions in government, with three key
   prerequisites: fostering a comfortable level of `political trust'

Abstract = {An audience's interpretation of news is considered to involve the input
   of news frames and audience predispositions. This study proposes that
   media frame diversity and individual-level factors may both condition
   audience issue cognitions. Using two public issues in Taiwan that vary
   in news frame diversity and data from a sample survey, this study
   compares media and audience frames and examines factors that condition
   audience framing. Results show that media frame diversity corresponds to
   audience frame diversity at the aggregate level. Audience frames are
   more diverse in the more diverse news context, but are less diverse in
   the more uniform news context. Individual differences also affect
   audience framing. Education appears to be a strong predictor to audience
   frame diversity as more education increases audience frame diversity in
   both issue contexts. Other individual variables show differential
   effects on audience framing across the two issues. Overall, the findings
   suggest that, while effects of individual-level factors on broadening
   audience perspectives may vary with issues, diverse media frames may
   help to cultivate a more reflexive citizenry.},

Abstract = {A by-product firm uses the profits from the sale of a private good to
   finance provision of a public good. If the public good exhibits any
   degree of rivalry, an increase in population will lead to a reduction in
   the provision of the public good, when the number of by-product firms is
   constant. An increase in the number of by-product firms raises provision
   of the public good, if population is constant. When population and the
   number of by-product firms are increased in the same proportion, the
   effect on provision of the public good depends upon the degree of
   rivalry exhibited by the public good. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Strangely, two recent critical political histories of Indigenous affairs
   - by Gunstone and by Short - reproduce a structure of perception that
   resembles the characteristic structure of 1950s perception: a sense of
   outrage at the helplessness of Indigenous Australians in the face of
   overbearing colonial pressure, eclipsing the narrative presence of the
   Indigenous political agent. By returning to the work of those political
   scientists, sociologists and anthropologists who observed the political
   reforms of the 1960s and 1970s, I suggest that a richer conception of
   Indigenous and non-Indigenous agency is both possible and necessary.
   There are three interlocking topics in the writing of Indigenous
   political history: the changing quality of non-Indigenous engagement;
   the Indigenous leadership and its historical formation; the
   differentiated institutional response of the state. The political
   history of Indigenous Australians should not be reduced to a narrative
   of the settler colonial state's persistently limited concessions to the
   Indigenous grievance - important though that theme may be.},

Title = {Discrimination and Demand: The Effect of International Players on

Abstract = {Objectives
   This article tests the presence of demand-driven discrimination
   attributable to foreign-born players in Major League Baseball (MLB). We
   quantify the change in demand at MLB games given the number of foreign
   players on an MLB team. We further measure how matching market
   population demographics and team demographics affects demand.
   Methods
   We use regression analysis to estimate the effect on attendance of a
   change in the number of foreign players on a team. We then use these
   estimates to find the change in revenue for the team.
   Results
   The results show that the effect evolves over time. At the outset of the
   sample (1985), the net effect of an additional foreign-born player was a
   decrease in ticket demand. This effect diminished steadily until 1992,
   when the net effect became positive, peaking in 2000, and then slightly
   decreasing until the end of the sample (2005). The matching of team and
   population demographics was not found to be significant.
   Conclusions
   We discuss the implications of this result on league policy decisions.},

Abstract = {Maloney, Civan and Maloney (Public Choice, 2009, this volume) extend the
   existing literature on the economics of religion in several important
   ways. First, they define the religious good. They then distinguish a
   sectarian break from a schism, provide some analysis of schisms in the
   Christian world, and finally, and most interestingly, provide a summary
   of the religious practices and schisms in Islam. The two main strengths
   of the paper, and the most promising paths for future research, lie in
   the definition of the religious good and in the exploration of Islamic
   practices. Maloney, Civan and Maloney offer a novel perspective from
   which light might be reflected back upon Christian schisms.},

Abstract = {Drawing from a critical and systematic study of the regulations issued
   by four superintendencias, the legal stipulations that grant their
   powers and determine their internal organization, as well as the
   relevant case-law and doctrinal work, this article proposes a conceptual
   map of the various constitutional flaws present on the
   superintendencias' legal framework. It is affirmed that those flaws,
   mostly common to all of the analysed superintendencias, varies in their
   type and seriousness, some being applicable across the spectrum of the
   superintendencias' legal powers, whereas some are more closely related
   with one of their traditional activities (inspection, regulation and
   sanctioning/judging).},

Abstract = {This article provides a systematic portrait of the YouTube presence of
   U.S. Senate candidates during the 2008 election cycle. The evidence does
   not support the theory that democratized production, editing, and
   distribution of video content is markedly changing the formats and
   producers of political content. This is apparent from the predominance
   of 30-second ads among both the most popular videos and the broad range
   of campaign videos. Although other potential forms of accountability
   remain unrealized, YouTube is facilitating candidates being held
   accountable for their own advertising. The 2008 findings are compared to
   2006 findings with the same methodology.},

Abstract = {The absence of would-be palpable skills in contemporary and modern art
   has become a commonplace of both conservative and radical art-criticism.
   Indeed, these criticisms have tended to define where the critic stands
   in relation to the critique of authorship and the limits of `expression'
   at the centre of the modernist experience. In this article, I am less
   interested in why these criticisms take the form they do this is a
   matter for ideology-critique and the sociology of criticism and
   audiences than in the analysis of the radical transformation of
   conceptions in artistic skill and craft in the modern period. This will
   necessitate a focus on modernism and the avant-garde, and after, as it
   comes into alignment with, and retreat from, the modern forces of
   production and means of reproduction. Much, of course, has been written
   within the histories of modernism, and the histories of art since, on
   this process of confrontation and exchange that is, between modern art's
   perceived hard-won autonomy and the increasing alienation of the artist,
   and the reification of art under the new social and technological
   conditions of advanced capitalist competition little, however, has been
   written on the transformed conditions and understanding of labour in the
   artwork itself (with the partial exception of Adorno). This is because
   so little art-history and art-criticism certainly since the 1960s - has
   been framed explicitly within a labour-theory of culture: in what ways
   do artists labour, and how are these forms of labour indexed to art's
   relationship to the development of general social technique (the
   advanced level of technology and science as it expressed in the
   technical conditions of social reproducibility)? In this article, I look
   at the modern and contemporary dynamics of this question.},

   feedback on paper published in Politicka ekonomie 2/2010 by authors
   Hrdlicka, Istvanfyova and Vitek. Original paper dealt with similar issue
   but from accountants' point of view. The statistical view of this matter
   is slightly different and it is influenced by current national accounts'
   standard ESA 1995. The most of the paper is devoted to the investment
   and depreciation, in national accounts terms capital formation and
   capital consumption. The sector of government is a very important
   investor and property owner in the Czech Republic. Therefore a good
   record of investment and depreciation is important not only for
   government sector itself but also for total economy.},

Abstract = {This article explores the impact of cyber-campaigning on candidates'
   electoral performance in the 2007 Irish general election. As such, we
   investigate the extent to which previous findings in this area are
   generalizable, testing them in a new political context. Our
   methodological approach seeks to deal with some of the critiques that
   have been leveled against the validity of previous findings regarding
   the electoral effects of cyber-campaigns. We do so by controlling for
   levels of candidate campaign expenditure, as well the extent to which
   candidates were viewed as ``favorites{''} or ``outsiders{''} to win
   seats during the campaign. Finally, we present the first analysis in
   this field of whether the effects of cyber-campaigning are constant
   across constituencies with varying technological profiles.},

Title = {Sex Differences in Constituent Engagement},
Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {91},
Number = {4},
Pages = {947-963},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Objectives
   This article updates and expands the research on sex differences in
   legislators' relationships with constituents.
   Methods
   A 2008 survey of legislators from 26 states is used to collect data on
   constituent-initiated contact, hours legislators spend keeping in touch
   with constituents or conducting casework, legislators' use of
   constituent information, and accuracy of legislators' perceptions of
   constituents.
   Results
   The findings suggest that female legislators do not differ from male
   legislators in the time they spend contacting constituents or doing
   casework or in the accuracy of their perceptions of constituents.
   However, female legislators received more contact from constituents, and
   were more likely to attend meetings and use constituent-derived
   information.
   Conclusion
   Although sex has small effects on the amount of contact legislators have
   with constituents, it does affect the way legislators contact their
   constituents. This is likely because engagement has become an important
   role for legislators. Thus, while legislators all have to be actively
   engaged, they have some flexibility in how they engage with
   constituents.},

   significant impact on income inequality while a negative impact is found
   for real personal income per capita, education, and unionization rate.
   The Granger-causality results associated with a panel vector error

Abstract = {This paper addresses the personal linkages between the public service
   and the legislature that emerge because public servants pursue a
   political mandate. There are concerns that the representation of public
   servants in parliaments generates a conflict of interest. We present a
   cost-benefit calculus and analyze specific legal provisions for the
   German Laender to understand the selection of public servants into
   parliaments. We find that a legal incompatibility of a position in the
   public service and a political mandate decreases and a compensation for
   having to hold one's office in abeyance increases the fraction of public
   servants in Laender parliaments.},

Abstract = {The new interpretive turn in gender studies is disseminated and
   discussed particularly in North American scholarly journals, and is
   situated at the intersection between the historiographies of family,
   women and gender (including men's studies) and world history. This has
   displaced in the direction of `world' or `global history' a practice of
   writing European history which has traditionally privileged
   circumscribed, `particular' areas of enquiry, located within the
   boundaries of communities, regions and nations. To avoid becoming
   passive latecomers in a new master narrative, where imbalances of power
   and unequal distribution of academic, linguistic and financial resources
   tend to marginalize large areas of the world, the tradition of women's
   history/gender historiography should seek to develop transcultural
   cooperation with critical historiographies in non-Western areas, with
   the aim of constructing an ecumenical narrative of world history.},

Abstract = {The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has often been
   maligned for its actions, or lack thereof, during the Second World War.
   In particular the Committee has been criticised for its apparent
   inability to compromise its mandate to provide impartial and
   non-politicised relief. This article discusses some of the problems of
   this interpretation of ICRC history by showing that, contrary to the
   image of the ICRC as a ``well-meaning amateur{''}, the Committee
   responded to the challenges of the Second World War with a series of
   bold initiatives that were crucial to the organisation's long-term
   development. Not only did these initiatives improve the success of the
   ICRC's humanitarian mission, but they also stand as testament to an
   organisation that, though devoid of diplomatic status and political
   power, was able to conduct its work whilst being restricted by the
   policies of belligerent governments and the physical dangers of total
   war.},

Abstract = {Studies concerning the impact of the length of response scales on the
   measurement of attitudes have primarily focused on the method bias
   associated with question format. At the same time another line of
   research has focused on the issue of response styles that affect how
   respondents answer to attitude questions. So far, research has paid less
   attention to the issue of whether the length of the response scales is
   related to response styles. In this study, we explore if differences in
   length of the response scale (i.e., method factor) have differential
   effects in evoking extreme and midpoint response style behavior (i.e.,
   style factor). Our hypotheses read as follows. As the number of response
   categories increases, we expect subjects to be more likely to exert
   extreme response style. Furthermore, we expect subjects to be more
   likely to adopt a midpoint response style when they are offered a middle
   response category. To investigate these hypotheses we developed a split
   ballot experiment in which the number of response categories is
   manipulated from 5 to ii categories. Data are collected by a random
   sample, large-scale web survey which allows for random assignment to the
   experimental conditions. The results show clear evidence of extreme
   response style and moderate evidence of midpoint response style. Extreme
   response style is not affected by the length of response scales, whereas
   the exertion of midpoint response style only popped up in the longer
   scale versions.},

Abstract = {Focusing on the debates on energy security in Germany, this paper
   analyzes the structure, logic, and circulation of the ``new Cold War{''}
   as a geopolitical narrative. We use the literature in critical
   geopolitics to analyze the conceptual implications of an apparent
   dissociation between the media and governmental stance toward the new
   Cold War and its embedded geopolitical logic. The relationship between
   the ``kind{''} of geopolitics inherent in the new Cold War and the
   different ``forms{''} in which it circulates suggests a blurring of
   boundaries between all such geopolitical forms, through multiple
   crossings-over between institutions, textual genies, and circulating
   actors The media presence of the New Cold War also highlights the
   ambiguity of the ``popular{''} in popular geopolitics, which is further
   refracted on other geopolitical forms which share as characteristics.
   This not only makes imperative the more precise formulation of key
   conceptual categories such as popular or banal geopolitics, but also
   calls into question the link between the state and particular
   geopolitical logics, as well as the relationship between the mass media
   and geopolitics. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved},

Abstract = {This paper studies a resource extraction problem with capacity
   constraints, expansion options and stochastic demand process. The
   producer has to decide on the optimal rate of extraction and the optimal
   time to build further capacity simultaneously. Using numerical methods
   to solve the problem, it is shown that previous results which suggest
   that extraction capacity should be built at the beginning, are not
   necessarily true under uncertainty. I derive equations for the optimal
   time to build extra capacity. The results of this paper can contribute
   to better understanding of long-run energy and commodity supply.},

Title = {Pathways to Politics: How Media System Characteristics Can Influence
   Socioeconomic Gaps in Political Participation},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRESS-POLITICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Pages = {295-318},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This article addresses a key democratic question that has not been fully
   answered by political communication research: How do the news media
   influence gaps in participation between socioeconomic groups? The main
   purpose is to develop and propose an institutional framework for
   analyzing how the news media influence participation gaps in different
   countries. It is argued that past research on media malaise and
   mobilization effects has not paid attention to the joint influence of
   two media system characteristics: (1) the strength of media institutions
   with respect to influencing political participation and (2) the
   distinctiveness of their population base. European Social Survey data
   from four democratic corporatist countries are used to analyze both
   these dimensions of the institutional framework. The results indicate
   that newspapers and television news might have different influences on
   participation gaps in these countries, and the findings are discussed in
   light of the specific media system characteristics of democratic
   corporatist countries. Finally, some suggestions for future
   cross-national comparative research based on the proposed institutional
   framework are discussed.},

Abstract = {Policymakers often propose strict enforcement strategies to fight the
   shadow economy and to increase tax morale. However, there is an
   alternative bottom-up approach that decentralises political power to
   those who are close to the problems. This paper analyses the
   relationship with local autonomy. We use data on tax morale at the
   individual level and macro data on the size of the shadow economy to
   analyse the relevance of local autonomy and compliance in Switzerland.
   The findings suggest that there is a positive (negative) relationship
   between local autonomy and tax morale (size of the shadow economy).},

Abstract = {We address a pressing substantive issue as well as evaluate several
   methodologies in this article. Substantively, we ask whether the U.S.
   State Department has a clear understanding of the level of
   cross-national religious intolerance that triggers daily headlines
   around the globe. Methodologically, we ask whether data on social
   attitudes coded from systematic qualitative reports can reliably
   represent cross-national public opinion. We empirically address these
   questions by comparing cross-national levels of religious intolerance
   coded from the State Department's annual international religious freedom
   reports with relevant population survey data from the World Values
   Survey and the Pew Research Center, as well as with data from written
   interviews of country experts conducted by the Hudson Institute. The
   results indicate that the understanding of social religious intolerance
   embodied in the State Department reports is comparable with the results
   of population surveys and individual expert opinion. Methodologically,
   this suggests that cross-national public opinion survey data can be
   cross-validated with coded data from systematic qualitative analysis as
   well as with expert opinion.},

Abstract = {Journalist reports of the siege of Dubrovnik by the Yugoslav National
   Army (1991) were misleading and exaggerated the extent of damage to the
   old city in order to encourage international intervention to protect
   cultural property. This article examines the extent of this destruction
   and how it was reported by British correspondents in the field and
   editors at home. It uses a rhetorical frame of analysis to engage
   current theoretical debates about Western actors, their depiction of the
   Yugoslav war and the nationalities involved. Interview material, with
   correspondents and editors such as Alex Russell and Max Hastings,
   supplements documentary analysis of press sources positioned within the
   secondary literature. The enquiry also considers how these reports
   influence memory and later histories of Dubrovnik's fate in the Yugoslav
   wars, and public responses to humanitarian intervention.},

Title = {Embodying the garrison state? Everyday geographies of militarization in

Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},

Abstract = {This study evaluates the garrison state hypothesis (Lasswell, 1941,
   1962), which posited that the United States and other democratic states
   were becoming militarized societies, dominated by military culture,
   values, and goals. Building on the work of various scholars who have
   more recently identified the militarization of U.S. policies and other
   actions emanating from the formal state apparatus, we have explored the
   everyday geographies of the nation-state, with particular emphasis upon
   the experiences and activities of people in local settings. Considering
   the contingency of how everyday geographies of the state are
   constituted, two towns (Hopkinsville, Kentucky and Clarksville,
   Tennessee) neighboring Fort Campbell, Kentucky are analyzed using
   interviews, participant observations, and documentary evidence to
   examine manifestations of militarism and ongoing processes of
   militarization. Despite their common adjacency to Fort Campbell, the
   agency of actors in Hopkinsville and Clarksville has at times resulted
   in different bases for resistance to, and acceptance of, militarizing
   processes. We conclude that the construction of a `friendly' or
   democratic `garrison state' does not emerge in a simple, top-down
   manner, but rather is possible only with the people and practices who
   constitute the everyday geographies of the state, though this process is
   negotiated differently in different settings due to the complex central
   local relations occurring within them. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {The run up to the euro has been characterized by soft growth especially
   in the largest countries of the zone. This disappointing performance is
   often imputed to the insufficient extent of structural reforms in labour
   and product markets. The ECB conduct of monetary policy, and the
   Stability and Growth Pact, would on the other hand have no negative role
   in the growth performance of euro zone countries. The financial crisis
   while calling for a temporary softening of the constraints (notably on
   fiscal policy), would also confirm that monetary policy was more
   virtuous in the euro zone than in the United States. This article
   proposes a radically different interpretation. We argue that soft growth
   is the consequence of restrictive macroeconomic policies. These are not
   linked to the existence of the euro per se, that in fact has helped
   growth by minimizing monetary perturbations, but rather to the political
   compromise that led to the current institutions for the economic
   government of Europe. This compromise imposed rules for monetary and
   fiscal neutrality while pushing for structural reforms whose main
   objective was to impose a new norm on the distribution of wealth.
   Putting in place the appropriate policies for growth requires rethinking
   this norm, and the financial crisis may be an opportunity to do so.},
