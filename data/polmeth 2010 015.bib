   selected institutes of the antidiscrimination act from the point of view
   of their economic consequences. It shows to which behaviour the economic
   subjects are forced and analyses whether this behaviour is in accordance
   with economic rules of market economy, with principle of private
   property and free choices. It pays attention to equal opportunities and
   affirmative action as measures to ensure them, and the institute of
   burden of proof transfer to the accused. It concludes that the
   antidiscrimination act does not respect the natural rules of people's
   behaviour in real economic relations and it seems to be an artificial
   authority construct, which serves special purposes.},

Title = {THE IMPACT OF UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRATION ON ID THEFT AND PROPERTY CRIME: A
   CASE STUDY FOR US-MEXICO RELATIONS},
Booktitle = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2010},
Pages = {191-202},
Abstract = {In the U.S., illegal immigration is a very controversial issue. One
   dimension of this controversy involves whether this illegal entry in the
   country leads to higher rates of crime. If a clear link between crime in
   the U.S. and illegal immigration is established, the argument for more
   border security and enforcement is established. Clearly, such policies
   could lead to political tensions between the U.S. and Mexico. That said,
   according to the Federal Trade Commission, identity theft constituted
   the most common consumer complaint in the U.S. in 2006. Using
   state-level data for the 50 states for 2005, we find, among other
   things, that the rate of reported identity theft per 100,000 population
   is directed related to the unemployment rate, the percent of the
   population residing in urban areas, and the extent of undocumented
   immigration. We also find investigate the impact of undocumented
   migration upon ``property crime{''} in the forms of ``robbery{''} and
   ``burglary{''} per 100,000 population is directly impacted by
   undocumented migration, as well as the unemployment rate and the percent
   of the population living in urban areas.},

Abstract = {This contribution examines Arrighi's effort in Adam Smith in Beijing to
   understand the trajectory of China's political economy and the effects
   of that trajectory on the current reforms and changes in China. This
   article discusses these reforms from the perspective of China's
   `internal' dynamics and suggests that Arrighi's argument has been
   developed without proper reference to China's complex realities. As an
   alternative, the contribution proposes a research-agenda that could
   better account for these realities.},

   Election},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY \& POLITICS},

Volume = {7},

Abstract = {The present study employs both qualitative and quantitative research
   methods to examine the discourse of leadership in the YouTube video
   clips of 16 candidates who competed in the 2008 U.S. presidential race.
   The introduction and farewell videos of the candidates included on the
   YouChoose portion of YouTube are inductively analyzed for leadership
   utterances. Common categories are constructed through a grounded theory
   approach, while frequencies of the appearance of leadership traits are
   discovered through a content analysis of the data. The findings are then
   compared with relevant literature to determine the nature of
   presidential campaigns within the participatory culture of YouTube. The
   study suggests that the YouChoose videos favor the candidate's character
   over political experience and explores the possibility that the medium
   promotes passive (rather than active) political engagement on the part
   of the user. The idea of the construction of the YouTube audience as a
   ``postmodern constituency{''} is also proposed. Finally, the
   implications of the study are discussed.},

Abstract = {Although law schools have seen rising representation of diverse racial
   and ethnic groups among students, minorities continue to represent
   disproportionately small percentages of lawyers within large corporate
   law firms. Prior research on the nature and causes of minority
   underrepresentation in such firms has been sparse. In this paper, we use
   data on a national sample of more than 1,300 law firm offices to examine
   variation across large U. S. law firms in the representation of
   African-Americans, Hispanics, and Asian-Americans. Overall, minorities
   are better represented in offices located in Western states and in major
   metropolitan areas; offices that are larger and affiliated with larger
   firms; offices of firms with higher revenues and profits per partner;
   offices with greater associate-partner leverage; and branch offices
   rather than principal offices. They are equally distributed between
   offices with single-tier and two-tier partnerships. Distinct patterns
   emerge, however, when the three groups are considered separately and
   when hierarchical rank within firms is taken into account.},

Abstract = {In the wake of 9/11, President George W. Bush downplayed traditional
   `realist' security concerns by defining America's goal as countering
   threats generated by the internal characteristics of Arab societies.
   Bush advanced a strategy of regional transformation based on regime
   change in Iraq and economic, social, and political reform across the
   Arab world. This strategy, however, failed to address the security
   interests of regional governments while generating insecurity for Arab
   societies. To explain these results, the article develops a framework
   for understanding the Middle East regional system that recognises the
   role of societal discourses of insecurity and the system's multipolar
   structure. The framework is used to suggest an alternative strategy for
   US Middle East policy. Rejecting both a renewed project of regional
   transformation and a return to neorealism, the paper outlines a strategy
   based on managing a multipolar, pluralist system.},

Abstract = {Despite the major importance of the news media's election news coverage,
   there are still only a few cross-national studies on how the media cover
   elections. There are even fewer that include both newspapers and TV news
   and that probe possible antecedents of how the media frame politics in
   their election news. Against this background, this article compares the
   media framing of election news in two countries-Belgium and Sweden-that
   constitute highly similar cases and both belong to the democratic
   corporatist model of media and politics. The study focuses on the
   importance of media channels, media types, and commercialism as
   antecedents of the media's framing of election news.},

Journal = {HISTORICAL MATERIALISM-RESEARCH IN CRITICAL MARXIST THEORY},

Pages = {3-34},
Abstract = {This paper is based on the Isaac and Tamara Deutscher Memorial-Prize
   Lecture given at SOAS in London, on 27 November 2009. It claims that
   Marxism remains built around a critique of political economy
   ('economics') but lacks a parallel critique of international relations
   (IR). IR naturalises the organisation of inter-state relations along
   lines comparable to the naturalisation of the capitalist economy by
   economics. The paper argues that the disciplinary organisation of
   Western academia is part of the class-discipline in society at large. It
   was triggered by the abstraction of economics from the field of the
   broader social sciences. IR, in turn, was codified in the slipstream of
   Woodrow Wilson's response to the Russian Revolution that followed on
   from the US-intervention in World-War I. The discipline was built around
   a founding myth of global liberalism and national self-determination. It
   served, among other things, to disqualify the claims of the theory of
   imperialism on disciplinary grounds, and its initial connections with
   Western hegemony, capital, and the national-security state remain in
   place today. Distinguishing modes of foreign relations, and specifying
   the occupation of space, protection, and exchange for tribal and
   empire/nomad foreign relations, as well as sovereign equality and global
   governance, on the other hand make it possible to understand the rise
   and continuing hegemony of the West in its own right, rather than as a
   superstructure of the transnationalisation of capital.},

Title = {Can Institutional Networks Mitigate Labor Market Disadvantages? Evidence
   from College Summer Job Searches},
Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {91},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1264-1287},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Objective
   This study examines whether the use of institutional (school-based)
   networks may help students from disadvantaged backgrounds secure summer
   employment opportunities that are on a par with those of their more
   advantaged classmates who may possess more resource-rich personal and
   familial networks.
   Methods
   The study draws on unique data from the National Longitudinal Survey of
   Freshmen to examine the strategies that a national representative sample
   of nearly 4,000 white, black, Asian, and Hispanic students on 28
   campuses used to obtain summer employment and the characteristics of
   these summer jobs. Multinomial logistic regression techniques are
   applied to examine the types of contacts students used and jobs they
   found, while OLS regression is employed to examine the wages and
   occupational prestige of summer positions.
   Results
   The study reveals that students who obtained their summer jobs through
   institutional contacts had significantly higher earnings and held
   positions with higher occupational prestige than students using most
   other methods (controlling for race/ethnicity, prior work experience,
   and parental education). I also found that minority students are at
   least as likely as white students to draw on these institutional
   networks. In addition, there were no differences by SES, suggesting that
   this type of capital is both accessible and accessed by a wide range of
   students.
   Conclusions
   This study provides evidence that summer jobs obtained through
   institutional networks are more likely to be in desirable sectors, on
   average pay better, and have higher occupational prestige scores than
   jobs obtained by most other methods.},

Title = {Density Zoning and Class Segregation in U.S. Metropolitan Areas},
Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {91},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1123-1143},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Objectives
   Socioeconomic segregation rose substantially in U.S. cities during the
   final decades of the 20th century, and we argue that zoning regulations
   are an important cause of this increase.
   Methods
   We measure neighborhood economic segregation using the Gini coefficient
   for neighborhood income inequality and the poor-affluent exposure index.
   These outcomes are regressed on an index of density zoning developed
   from the work of Pendall for 50 U.S. metropolitan areas, while
   controlling for other metropolitan characteristics likely to affect
   urban housing markets and class segregation.
   Results
   For both 2000 and changes from 1990 to 2000, OLS estimates reveal a
   strong relationship between density zoning and income segregation, and
   replication using 2SLS suggests that the relationship is causal. We also
   show that zoning is associated with higher interjurisdictional
   inequality.
   Conclusions
   Metropolitan areas with suburbs that restrict the density of residential
   construction are more segregated on the basis of income than those with
   more permissive density zoning regimes. This arrangement perpetuates and
   exacerbates racial and class inequality in the United States.},

Abstract = {There have been many attempts to define `European History'. The concept
   did not exist until the emergence of the idea of `Europe' itself, which
   can be dated to the Early Modern period, when `Christendom' no longer
   seemed a viable geographical concept in view of the religious wars of
   the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and the expansion of Christian
   missions overseas. By the late eighteenth century, the reforms of Peter
   the Great had led to the expansion of the idea of `Europe' beyond the
   area imagined by Ancient geographers to include a large part of Russia.
   More recently, attempts to equate European history with the history of
   the member states of the European Union have met with little favour. In
   the UK, European history conventionally means the history of the
   European Continent, not including the British Isles. Argument about the
   cultural parameters of European history continues, and forms an
   essential part of any study of the subject.},

Abstract = {Balanced budget requirements (BBRs) affect all aspects of financial
   operations. Previous studies relied on characterizations that highlight
   a constitutional-statutory distinction. Hou and Smith (Public Budgeting
   \& Finance 26(3):22-45, 2006) instead propose a political-technical
   construct. This article uses probit estimation, six measures of balance,
   and long panels to test which framework offers more explanatory power.
   The findings suggest that BBRs matter to varying degrees. Technical
   requirements exert bigger effects than political ones, the effects are
   more obvious on narrower than broader measures of balance and in the
   later phases of the budget cycle, and the political-technical construct
   offers more explanatory power than the constitutional-statutory
   distinction.},

Abstract = {DSGE-models provide a coherent framework of analysis. This coherence is
   brought about by restricting acceptable behavior of agents to dynamic
   utility maximization and rational expectations. The problem of the
   DSGE-models (and more generally of macroeconomic models based on
   rational expectations) is that they assume extraordinary cognitive
   capabilities of individual agents. In addition, these models need a lot
   of ad-hoc assumptions to make them fit the data. I argue that we need
   models that take into account the limited cognitive abilities of agents.
   One can introduce rationality in such models by assuming ``trial and
   error{''} learning. I propose such a model and I analyze its
   implications.},

Abstract = {The paper analyzes monetary and fiscal stabilization and coordination in
   a multi-sector stochastic new open economy macroeconomics (NOEM) model.
   It first aims to assess the capacity of fiscal and monetary policy to
   reduce or eliminate the negative welfare effects of an unanticipated
   productivity shock affecting some or all of the sectors in each country.
   Second, it evaluates the possible gains from international monetary
   cooperation as well as the impact of active fiscal policy on the welfare
   performance of monetary policy. The setup also allows for international
   asymmetry concerning the uncertainty over the shocks. The results show
   that monetary and fiscal policies are efficient tools of stabilization
   and under several conditions they can replicate the flexible-price
   equilibrium. However, their welfare performance is not necessarily
   increased when both monetary and fiscal policies react to shocks at the
   national level. The existence of bilateral gains from monetary
   cooperation depends on the degree of asymmetry concerning the
   uncertainty over the shocks.},

Title = {Divided Loyalties? Understanding Variation in Latino Attitudes Toward
   Immigration},
Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {91},
Number = {3},
Pages = {856-882},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Objective. In this article, we develop and test a model of competing
   theoretical explanations of Latino attitudes toward immigration;
   specifically examining their policy preferences on legal immigration,
   illegal immigration, and a proposed policy for dealing with illegal
   immigrants. We also consider whether Latino attitudes toward legal and
   illegal immigration are related and comprise a single coherent
   structure. Method. Using data from a 2004 national survey of Latinos, we
   perform regression, logit, and ordered logit analyses to examine the
   determinants of Latino attitudes toward immigration. Results. We
   highlight three important findings. First, our results demonstrate
   ``within-group{''} differences in immigration attitudes among Latinos,
   based on both national origin and generational status; we find that
   Mexicans are more pro-immigration than Latinos from other countries and
   that foreign-born Latinos have much more positive attitudes about
   immigration than second-generation and third-generation Latinos. Second,
   we find that Latino support for various aspects of immigration is
   primarily a function of ethnic and linguistic identity and attachment to
   American culture, with self-interest, contextual variables, and
   political and demographic attributes playing a smaller, more specialized
   role. Finally, we demonstrate that Latino attitudes toward legal and
   illegal immigration are highly interrelated. Conclusion. There is a
   coherent structure underlying Latino attitudes toward legal immigration,
   illegal immigration, and a policy option for dealing with illegal
   immigrants. Our tests of competing theoretical approaches reveal the
   importance of national origin and ethnic attachment and acculturation in
   explaining differences among Latinos on their attitudes toward
   immigration.},

Abstract = {By drawing on the works of Gimenez Caballero, the first Spanish
   intellectual to declare his sympathy for fascism, this article
   endeavours to demonstrate that what attracted him to the Italian regime
   was its model of mass mobilization. By transferring the model to Spain,
   Gimenez Caballero hoped that it would create as a wedge between the
   progressive social sectors, the workers and the republicans, who had
   become increasingly mobilized, and thereby defeat them with their own
   weapons. He was also attracted by fascist exaltation of empire as a
   means of strengthening Spanish national unity, which he considered
   problematic. On the other hand, these two goals were not very different
   from those aspired to by the two main leaders of the early Spanish
   fascist movement, Ramiro Ledesma Ramos and Jose Antonio Primo de Rivera.},

Abstract = {Sunk capital costs are essential in generating hysteresis in
   real-options models that examine firms' decisions under uncertainty. The
   standard results show that greater uncertainty, in the presence of sunk
   capital costs, dampens firms' economic activity across a wide range of
   decision variables. In empirical examination of these models, there is a
   considerable lack of evidence on the conditioning effects of sunk
   capital costs. In this paper, I first detail alternative ways to use
   publicly available data to construct measures of sunk capital costs. The
   data reveal substantial differences across industries in their
   magnitudes of sunk capital costs. Second, I provide some evidence that
   the presence of higher sunk capital costs significantly exacerbates the
   effects of uncertainty.},

Abstract = {Robert Manne numbers amongst Australia's most influential public
   intellectuals. Though his politics have moved leftwards, Manne remains
   critical of the left's so-called neo-Stalinist interpretation of Cold
   War history. Of particular concern is the left's defence of the radical
   Australian journalist, Wilfred Burchett, who was widely regarded as a
   communist propagandist and traitor. Manne's 1985 Quadrant essay, ``The
   Fortunes of Wilfred Burchett: A New Assessment{''}, lent considerable
   academic weight to this view. Though Manne has since acknowledged some
   errors, he still maintains that Burchett was a communist ``hack{''} and
   traitor. But Manne's argument remains selectively based and erroneous.
   It uncritically accepts security-based intelligence, while sidestepping
   the abuse of Burchett's civil liberties by Liberal governments. Manne
   uses and abuses Burchett's life to push his ideological agenda about
   Stalinism's evils.},

Title = {Transparency of Public Decision-Making: Towards Trust in Local
   Government?},
Journal = {POLICY AND INTERNET},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {2},
Number = {1},
Pages = {5-35},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Online minutes of local councils offer the opportunity to look behind
   the scenes of local government decision-making. Will this transparency,
   as promised, lead to higher levels of trust? This issue was investigated
   by conducting an experiment comparing participants who did not access
   the available information, people who were only allowed restricted
   information about the minutes, and those who were shown the full minutes
   of the local council.
   Results indicated that people exposed to more information were
   significantly more negative regarding perceived competence of the
   council compared to those who did not access the available information.
   Additionally, participants who received only restricted information
   about the minutes thought the council was less honest compared to those
   who did not read them.
   The relationship between transparency and trust is influenced partly by
   the perceived credibility of the message on the website. Also, knowledge
   about the decision-making process appears to shift judgment criteria.
   People well informed about the process are inclined to base their
   judgment of perceived competence on this knowledge and less on message
   credibility.
   A theoretical explanation for the negative effect of transparency of
   public decisionmaking is sought in the expectations of the public versus
   the reality. A lower perceived competence by those who had access to
   full information might be explained by a gap between public expectations
   of rational decision-making and the reality of the chaos involved in
   public decision-making exposed through transparency.},

Abstract = {This paper provides interesting insights into an important causal
   mechanism underlying Murray, Evans and Schwab's (Am. Econ. Rev.
   88(4):789-812, 1998) finding that court mandated reforms result in less
   inequality in spending per pupil levels across rich and poor school
   districts within a state. Treating the choice of an education program's
   structure as endogenous, following the analysis of Leyden (Public
   Finance/Finances Publiques 47:229-247, 1992; Public Choice
   115(1-2):83-107, 2003), yields empirical results suggesting that court
   mandated reforms increase the likelihood that a program's structure will
   include a price effect and that the inclusion of a price effect in turn
   results in a decrease in spending inequality.},

Abstract = {This paper examines how government ideology has influenced deregulation
   of product markets in OECD countries. I analyze a dataset of
   non-manufacturing regulation indicators covering energy, transport and
   communication industries in 21 OECD countries over the 1980-2003 period
   and employ two different indices of government ideology. The results
   suggest that government ideology has had a strong influence on the
   deregulation process: market-oriented governments promoted the
   deregulation of the energy, transport and communication industries. This
   finding identifies remarkable differences between leftist and rightwing
   governments concerning the role of government in the economy and basic
   elements of political order.},

Abstract = {There has been a considerable increase in the number of political
   histories written by journalists since the 1960s. Three types of
   journalistic political histories have emerged in this period: the
   quickie, the longer history and the investigative work, and the works of
   Warren Denning, Alan Reid and Paul Kelly have been particularly
   influential in the development of the genre's present characteristics
   and concerns. This article finds that the genre's increase is the result
   of a combination of factors: the expansion of a tertiary-educated
   readership; the introduction of university training for journalists;
   increasing economic pressures faced by publishers, and the rise of
   celebrity culture.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the decision whether to centralize public policy
   in an economy with two levels of government. I show that centralization
   based on the subsidiarity principle emphasizes rather than resolves a
   conflict of interest between jurisdictions. The extent of the conflict
   of interest depends on spillovers and differences in tastes for public
   spending. Spending decisions are determined by negotiation between local
   representatives in the centralized legislature. If an agreement cannot
   be reached, policy is determined non-cooperatively by local governments.
   Results show that pooling sovereignty by the subsidiarity principle
   fails to fully internalize spillovers and may lead to a misallocation of
   public resources. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Empirical Evidence of the Effects of Marriage on Male and Female
   Attendance at Sports and Arts},
Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},

Abstract = {Objectives
   This article provides an examination of how men and women spend their
   recreational attendance time and how their behavior differs when they
   are single and married. The battle of the sexes model and the theory of
   artistic human capital acquisition from one's spouse both suggest that
   married individuals will have different patterns of attendance than
   singles.
   Methods
   Using data from the Performing Arts Research Coalition, we estimate a
   number of models to examine the differences between male and female
   attendance at art, professional sports, and popular culture events for
   those single and married.
   Results
   We find that single males prefer sports, while single females prefer the
   arts. As predicted by the battle of the sexes model, men are more likely
   and women less likely to attend art events after marriage. This increase
   in male attendance is also predicted by human capital models of
   attendance that argue that the choice of art events is based on acquired
   tastes that can be influenced by the human capital of one's spouse. The
   battle of the sexes model, however, also predicts a decline in male and
   an increase in female attendance at professional sports. We find a small
   increase in female, but also an increase in male, attendance.
   Conclusions
   The behavior of married and single males and females tends to correspond
   to the predictions made by the battle of the sexes and human capital
   models of attendance.},

Abstract = {Objective
   We examine racial differences in support for same-sex marriage, and test
   whether the emerging black-white gap is a function of religiosity. We
   explore how religious factors play a crucial role in racial differences,
   and how secular factors have varying effects on attitudes for whites and
   African Americans.
   Methods
   Using data from the General Social Surveys, we estimate ordinal logistic
   regression models and stacked structural equation models.
   Results
   We show that the racial divide is a function of African Americans' ties
   to sectarian Protestant religious denominations and high rates of church
   attendance. We also show racial differences in the influence of
   education and political values on opposition to same sex marriage.
   Conclusions
   Religious factors are a source of racial differences in support for
   same-sex marriage, and secular influences play less of a role in
   structuring African Americans' beliefs about same-sex marriage.},

Abstract = {Governance is not a controversial and misunderstood concept. Sometimes
   concepts such as corruption, institutions and democracy are used as
   governance's proxy. In general terms, it means how an organization is
   governed being the science of government performance and behavior and it
   refers to several processes that must include from historical, cultural,
   social and political determinants. For this reason it is possible to
   establish a relationship between governance and institutions.
   Communities of persons, firms, institutions are essential ingredients of
   good governance and its analysis could be developed considering two
   possibilities. First, considering the factors under which government
   would more efficient in welfare terms. Second, taking into account the
   economic results obtained by the government. Precisely, the main goal of
   this paper is analyse the relationship between governance and economic
   growth. We will consider the indirect effects of governance on growth
   through its effects on private investment, public expenditure and income
   distribution. An empirical analysis is developed considering the case of
   48 countries, considering a multiequational model that includes a
   private investment, public investment, Gini and GDP equations.},

Journal = {HISTORICAL MATERIALISM-RESEARCH IN CRITICAL MARXIST THEORY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {18},
Number = {1},
Pages = {74-87},
Abstract = {Giovanni Arrighi made a remarkably broad-ranging and original
   contribution to comparative political economy and historical sociology
   over five decades. His last book shares these qualities. But Adam Smith
   in Beijing is unfortunately not mainly about the origins and dynamics of
   Chinese capitalism over the past three decades. It presents Adam Smith
   not as the apostle of free-market capitalism, but rather of a
   `non-capitalist market society'; and it uses this to make the case that
   since China's economic development takes place outside the
   European/North American capitalist `core', it must, almost by
   definition, not be capitalist. Markets are conceived here as the
   instruments of states, yet the theory of the state advanced is severely
   undeveloped. Arrighi's argument that China's economic development is
   part and parcel of the demise of the US project for establishing itself
   as the `world state' misinterprets the nature of the US empire as well
   as misses the extent of China's integration with US-led capitalist
   globalisation.},

Abstract = {This chapter focuses on internal regulation in Scandinavian local
   governments. Although internal regulation with respect to contracts and
   performance measurement is connected to institutional economics, the
   approach here holds that such studies can benefit from using other
   theoretical perspectives, in this case, historical institutionalism and
   theories of translation. By using two Norwegian and two Danish empirical
   examples, this chapter demonstrates how these two perspectives
   contribute to the study of internal regulation. First, we start by
   presenting central argument, national contexts, concepts, and
   theoretical perspectives. Next, we shall briefly present the four
   empirical examples, and then apply these observations to demonstrate the
   usefulness of these theoretical perspectives.},

Abstract = {Examining county-level voting patterns since 1992, this paper describes
   the rising strength of the Democratic Party in the Rocky Mountain West
   and explores domestic migration (voter mobility) as a cause of the
   electoral change. Other theories of electoral change (voter conversion,
   voter mobilization and generational replacement) are analyzed and found
   less significant than a voter migration theory. A spatial autoregressive
   model also presents evidence of significant contextual ``neighborhood
   effects{''} contributing to electoral change in the region. Relying on
   IRS tax-filer migration data, Census data and voting results for all
   Western counties since 1992, this work finds a significant correlation
   between growing Democratic strength and in-migration of new voters who
   generally hail from more Democratic environments than the Western
   counties into which they are emigrating. The strongest correlations
   emerge in counties where the share of creative class occupations is also
   growing quickly. Migrating voters are building a new Western community -
   a community of creative classes, childless households and urban
   professionals who are more likely to vote Democrat than the rural
   conservatives they are increasingly outnumbering. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Pages = {318-339},
Abstract = {The role of the Internet as a tool for participation and organization
   has been considered the most important innovation in the 2008 U.S.
   presidential campaign and one of the key strategic factors in Barack
   Obama's conquest of the Democratic nomination and the White House. This
   article analyzes e-campaigning in the 2008 election through data drawn
   from qualitative interviews with 31 consultants and operatives who were
   involved in the presidential race. Rather than adopting a technocentric
   perspective, our interviewees acknowledge that several contextual
   factors enhance or hinder the effectiveness of online tools, such as the
   message of the campaign, the candidate's personality, and his or her
   ability to generate enthusiasm in the electorate, together with the
   campaign's strategic prioritization of grassroots electioneering.
   Technology is seen more as an efficient channel of preexisting
   motivations and loyalties than as a driver of these attitudes. Moreover,
   while the Web has often been characterized as presenting campaigns with
   a dilemma between top-down hierarchy and bottom-up spontaneity, Internet
   professionals and operatives argue that contemporary e-campaigning tools
   can help achieve both goals and breed a hybrid organizing model that
   reconciles control and empowerment through the skillful use of
   individual data. These findings have important implications regarding
   the strategic and organizational dynamics of contemporary campaigns and
   the role of citizen participation within them.},

   results of the paper suggest that both variables are detrimental to
   growth In particular looking more closely at the effect of each
   component of government revenue and spending the results point out that
   1) indirect taxes (size and volatility) ii) social contributions (size
   and volatility) in) government consumption (size and volatility) iv)
   subsidies (size) and v) government investment (volatility) have a
   sizeable negative and statistically significant effect on growth (C)

Abstract = {Anti-Americanism, sometimes called the ``last acceptable prejudice{''},
   is a common phenomenon in the modern era. This paper explores the ebb
   and flow of anti-Americanism in the Australian Labor Party in the
   post-Second World War period and argues that while at times it was
   reasonable or proportionate, at others such criticism became
   unreasonable, disproportionate and therefore prejudicial. When this
   occurs the Australia-US alliance can become strained, the Australian
   electorate tends to become sceptical of the ALP's credentials on
   national security and the party's electoral prospects also tend to
   suffer. Nevertheless, following the brief leadership of the stridently
   anti-American Mark Latham, such sentiment in the ALP has been widely
   discredited and is unlikely to emerge again in its prejudicial form for
   some time, marking the end of an era.},

Journal = {ELECTION LAW JOURNAL},

Abstract = {Most states require voter initiatives to embrace only a single subject,
   and courts have invalidated many initiatives for violating the single
   subject rule. Critics argue that the definition of a ``subject{''} is
   infinitely malleable, so that if judges attempt to enforce the single
   subject rule aggressively, their decisions will be based on their
   personal views rather than neutral principles. We investigate this
   argument by studying the decisions of state appellate court judges in
   five states during the period 1997-2006. We find that judges are more
   likely to vote to uphold an initiative against a single subject
   challenge if their partisan affiliations suggest they would be
   sympathetic to the policy proposed by the initiative. More important, we
   find that partisan affiliation is highly consequential in states with
   aggressive enforcement of the single subject rule-the rate of voting to
   uphold an initiative jumps from 41 percent when a judge agrees with the
   policy to 83 percent when he disagrees-but not very consequential in
   states with restrained enforcement. The evidence suggests that it may be
   possible to apply the single subject rule in a neutral way when the
   judiciary is restrained, but with aggressive enforcement decisions are
   likely to be driven by the political preferences of judges.},

Title = {Ideology, Diversity, and Imprisonment: Considering the Influence of
   Local Politics on Racial and Ethnic Minority Incarceration Rates},
Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {91},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1063-1082},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Objective
   To test the influence of local (county) politics on minority
   incarceration rates.
   Methods
   Data are collected at the county level in California to create a pooled
   cross-sectional data set. OLS regression models predicting black,
   Hispanic, and white incarceration rates (in state prison) are used in
   the analysis.
   Results
   Counties' ideological orientations and racial and ethnic contextual
   characteristics significantly impact minority incarceration rates.
   Greater ideological conservatism within counties is associated with
   higher rates (as a proportion of their population) of both black and
   Hispanic incarceration. Consistent with racial threat theory, results
   show counties with greater racial and ethnic diversity are more likely
   to incarcerate blacks and Hispanics. Tests for interaction effects
   indicate that greater county diversity decreases the punitive effects of
   ideological conservatism on minority incarceration.
   Conclusion
   Political forces nested within states systematically shape how state
   government incarceration power is distributed across different racial
   and ethnic groups.},

   program. We describe the experimental protocol that was built to
   estimate the program's impact on several types of indicators (academic
   abilities, attitude toward reading, school life) by comparing the
   evolution of treatment schools and control schools. Data were processed
   following a Differences-in-Differences (DID) method. Then we use the
   estimation of the impact on academic achievement to conduct a
   cost-effectiveness analysis and take a reduction of the class size
   program as a benchmark. The results are positive for the Action Lecture
   program both in terms of impact's evaluation and in terms of

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to test two hypotheses on the relationship
   between religiosity and war-related distress in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
   The article is based on a representative survey (n = 3,3 13) in Bosnia
   and Herzegovina during 2003-2004. The questionnaire included 15 items on
   war-related distress and 13 items on war experiences. From these items
   we developed a war-related distress scale, a war experiences scale, and
   several measures of religiosity. Regression analysis was used to examine
   the relationship between the war-related distress symptoms on the one
   hand, and religiosity and war experience on the other hand, controlling
   for a range of other variables. Religious beliefs and religious
   stability seem to protect against war-related distress, but religious
   activity works in the opposite direction to increase war-related
   distress. In conclusion, we found weak support for the first hypothesis,
   although the effects of religiosity on war-related distress seem more
   complex than expected. Our second hypotheses, that religiosity may work
   as a buffer to dampen the effects of war experiences on war-related
   distress, found no support.},

Abstract = {This article offers an analysis of two locales in downtown Beijing
   nominally set aside for public use, Tiananmen Square and The Place, as
   successively linked landscapes of power that define the shifting and
   relations between market and place negotiated by the Chinese Communist
   Party-state over time However, whereas Zukin (1993) argues that such
   landscapes lack coherent values because of their subordination to
   capitalism's haphazard process of ``creative destruction,{''} a salient
   feature of Beijing's shifting landscapes of power is the authoritarian
   Party-state's persistent mediation of market relations, and its
   subordination of the contradictions between market and place to the
   changing needs of the regime under market reform Despite their apparent
   differences in intent and design, the shopping mall has eclipsed the
   public square as a key urban site through which the Party-state seeks to
   build a self-conscious and cohesive socioeconomic class of subjects over
   which and for which it seeks to rule (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights

Abstract = {This article has a dual purpose On the one hand it proposes a renewed
   analysis of the governance of specific human capital intensive firms On
   the other hand it empirically estimates the nature of the corresponding
   operational model in France at the beginning of the 2000s Actually for
   nearly two decades, the firm has changed especially with the growing
   importance of human capital in the value creation process This evolution
   raises questions about the necessity to revisit firm governance
   Considering that the very first mission of a large number of firms is to
   retain and to accumulate specific skills we propose that a composite
   model that we call the ``multi resource{''} model of firm governance has
   to be outlined Firstly we analytically show that this latter aims at
   motivating key partners at work through the simultaneous use of
   individualized incentive tools and horizontal coordinative mechanisms
   Secondly, we give an original empirical exploitation of the
   ``Employer{''} part of the REPONSE 2004 2005 survey to test the
   hypothesis that such a governance system is implemented by some French
   firms},

Abstract = {WTO negotiations deal predominantly with bound - besides applied -
   tariff rates. But, how can reductions in tariffs ceilings, i.e. tariff
   rates that no exporter may ever actually be confronted with, generate
   market access? The answer to this question relates to the effects of
   tariff bindings on the risk that exporters face in destination markets.
   The present paper formalizes the underlying interaction of risk, fixed
   export costs and firms' market entry decisions based on techniques known
   from the real options literature; doing so we highlight the important
   role of bound tariffs at the extensive margin of trade. We find that
   bound tariffs are more effective with higher risk destination markets,
   that a large binding overhang may still command substantial market
   access, and that reductions in bound tariffs generate effective market
   access even when bound rates are above current and long-term applied
   rates.},

Abstract = {In this paper, I examine a simple procedure in the United States House
   of Representatives, approving the Journal, and its implications for
   legislative business. In this paper, I examine the hypothesis that such
   votes are more than simply pro forma motions or dilatory tactics by the
   minority party. Considering the 102nd-107th Congresses, I show that
   votes on the Journal's approval are just as frequently requested by the
   majority party as by members of the minority party. Furthermore, I find
   that votes recorded on days on which a vote was also recorded on the
   House Journal were more likely to be close and more likely to be
   party-line votes than those recorded on other days.},

Abstract = {The study of political religion has focused on how religious structure
   and substance came to permeate grand political ideologies such as
   fascism and communism. The relevance of various relatively veiled forms
   of religion in modern day-to-day democratic politics has been
   undervalued and we therefore fail to appreciate to what extent, and how
   religious structure and substance have also penetrated conventional
   democratic politics. As a result, we do not comprehend that it is the
   progressive abolition of ``quasi-messianism{''} in politics that is
   currently causing the existential problem of democracy, namely massive
   political disaffection. Quasi-messianism concerned the visionary
   anticipation of a better world that is attainable, here and in the
   distant, yet foreseeable future. This promise accorded politics an
   enchanting quality. Quite down-to-earth political ventures got charged
   with an inspiring and imaginative sense of purpose, direction, and
   meaning, but equally with this-worldly catalysts, which, in contrast to
   the political-religious grand utopias, were operational and practical.
   In this quality, some mass political projects or elite missions
   developed a capacity to enchant the political elite and the public
   alike. Hence the thesis that it is the disenchantment of politics, which
   lies at the heart of the contemporary phenomenon of waning political
   allegiance.},

Abstract = {The idea that Australia developed a uniquely ``hard{''} political
   culture after 1788 - a culture that prized the rational and made short
   shift of religion - has had plenty of currency over the years. This idea
   has been challenged in recent scholarship, along with the broader notion
   that Western society became secularised during the twentieth century.
   Set against the backdrop of a wider challenge to the ``secularisation
   narrative{''}, this article explores the work of several historians
   dealing with the relationship between religion and Australian politics
   at the turn of the twentieth century. These historians, who include Al
   Gabay, Frank Bongiorno, Bruce Scates, and Judith Brett, are creating
   ``softer{''} understandings of Australian political history. As a
   consequence, I suggest, their work has implications for the way we think
   about the relationship between the religious and secular Left, as well
   as for the way we think about Australian masculinities and culture more
   generally.},

Abstract = {This paper incorporates tax morale into the Allingham and Sandmo (1972)
   model of income tax evasion. Tax morale is modeled as asocial norm for
   tax compliance. The strength of the norm is shaped endogenously.
   depending on the share of evaders in the society. Taxpayers act
   conditionally cooperative as their evasion depends on the others'
   compliance. We characterize the equilibrium which accounts for this
   interdependence and study the implications for tax and enforcement
   policies. The analysis is extended to the case of a society consisting
   of heterogenous communities. Individual evasion decisions are then
   embedded in a complex social structure and behavior is influenced by the
   norm compliance among morale reference groups. Within this framework, we
   highlight the role of belief management as an alternative policy tool.

Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2010},

Abstract = {Objective
   Past research reveals how religion and opinions about the cause of
   homosexuality influence attitudes concerning same-sex unions. No study
   to date contains a comprehensive collection of religion measures while
   also accounting for views of the cause of homosexuality. Therefore, this
   study investigates the extent to which religion predicts certain
   attribution beliefs as well as attitudes toward same-sex unions while
   controlling for attribution beliefs.
   Method
   The Baylor Religion Survey (2007) is used to estimate binary logistic
   models predicting the effects of religion and attribution beliefs on
   attitudes toward same-sex unions.
   Findings
   First, religion is strongly associated with the belief that homosexuals
   choose their sexual orientation. Second, religion maintains a
   significant association with attitudes toward same-sex unions despite
   inclusion of an attribution variable.
   Conclusion
   Even if a biological explanation for homosexuality is ultimately proven,
   unfavorable attitudes toward same-sex unions will most likely endure due
   to religion's persistent effect.},

Abstract = {This article is a response to the article by Maloney et al., which
   adapts an economic model of Christian schism to Islam. We evaluate the
   basic assumptions, concepts, and approach of the article and then turn
   to factual questions to be considered. Their main contribution is to
   explain ex post the divisions observed in religions in general and Islam
   in particular as sects or schismatic breaks. The differentiation and
   application of concepts such as schism and sect across religious
   traditions is very problematic for the research design and analysis of
   the article. Despite the justification of generalizations for
   comparisons among religions in long time periods, the elimination of
   caveats and particularities undermines the argument.},

Title = {What makes sovereignty a relative concept? Empirical approaches to
   international society},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {29},
Number = {1},
Pages = {40-49},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Sovereignty takes on many forms today. Legalistic and absolute
   conditions of sovereignty have dominated in theoretical reasoning and
   its practical applications whereas empirical attributes of statehood and
   relative sovereignty conceptualisations have generally been neglected.
   Yet, the quantification of empirical sovereignty would give us a few
   ways to compare and contrast the different degrees of internal and
   external sovereignty and demonstrate the `differences of being
   sovereign' among internationally recognised states, de facto states,
   autonomous regions, dependent territories and governments-in-exile. All
   these entities display their internal and external attributes of
   sovereignty, which results in power (efficiency of governance) or
   symbols (representation of ideas). This paper highlights the need to pay
   more attention to the empirical aspects of sovereignty - it has to be
   complemented with the facts on the ground - and shows how to
   operationalise the relative concept of sovereignty. Ignoring the
   empirical aspects of sovereignty, or spurning the time-honoured
   requirement of recognition, is bound to lead to the emergence of failed
   states. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {We examine the relationship between government size and economic growth,
   controlling for economic freedom and globalization, and using Bayesian
   Averaging over Classical Estimates in a panel of rich countries.
   Countries with big government have experienced above average increases
   in the KOF globalization index and in the Fraser institute's Economic
   freedom index. To maintain comparability with earlier studies, we use
   two sample periods: 1970-1995 and 1970-2005. Government size robustly
   correlates negatively with growth. We also find some evidence that
   countries with big government can use economic openness and sound
   economic policies to mitigate negative effects of big government.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the extent of Congressional candidates' use of
   YouTube in 2008 and analyzes which candidates were more likely to adopt
   and use this tool. While 72 percent of the major party candidates for
   the Senate opened YouTube channels, only 28 percent of candidates for
   the House seats did so. A multivariate analysis of all major-party
   candidates for the House shows that better-financed candidates and those
   in competitive elections were more likely to become early adopters by
   opening a YouTube channel; open seat candidates were less likely than
   incumbents to open a channel. A multivariate analysis of how extensively
   candidates used YouTube revealed that incumbents and better-financed
   candidates posted more videos to their channels. Candidates from
   districts with a higher percentage of college graduates also were more
   likely to post videos. YouTube is best understood as a vehicle for
   disseminating campaign communications produced by or for traditional
   media, especially television, and not so much as a new technology tool.
   Separating adoption from implementation leads to some more nuanced and
   conceptually important interpretations of the findings in this and
   earlier studies, and underscores the need to attend to life cycle and
   technology specific attributes of new media in campaigns.},

Abstract = {This chapter examines ways the Spanish Constitution of 1812, also known
   as the Constitution of Cadiz, has been viewed in historical and
   constitutional thought. The document is a liberal constitution
   establishing constitutional rights, a representative government, and a
   parliamentary monarchy. It influenced ideas of American equality within
   the Spanish Empire, and its traces are observed in the process of Latin
   American independence. To these accepted views, one must add that the
   Constitution was a lost moment in Latin American constitutional
   development. By the immediate politicization of constitutionalism after
   1812, the document marks the beginning of constitutional difficulties in
   the region.},

Abstract = {Artistic labour is characterised by features that combine to set artists
   apart from other workers when viewed in terms of their labour market
   behaviour. Here, the value of a work of art can be simplified down to
   two essential elements the work's economic value, and its cultural
   value, measured in terms of criteria of artistic worth such as
   aesthetic, spiritual, symbolic, and other types of value. In regard to
   the weights on economic and cultural value in the objective function,
   the model will allow for a range of financial and artistic motivations
   as stimuli to creative work. At one extreme, a unitary weight attached
   to cultural value and a zero weight to economic value would indicate
   that the artist's aims relate purely to the quality of the artwork
   itself, with complete disregard for its financial prospects. At the
   other extreme, a unitary weight on economic value and a zero weight on
   cultural value would imply that the artist is in the game solely for the
   money. The majority of artists in reality probably lie somewhere between
   these two polar cases.},

Abstract = {Various countries have recently implemented Freedom of Information acts

   To test this, we analyze annual data on 128 countries between 1984 and

   find no significant relationship with one exception In the developing
   world, FOI acts are significantly associated with rising levels of
   corruption Further investigation suggests this may be due to the fact
   that the effectiveness of FOI acts appears to be conditioned by a

Title = {Comparing Government Redistribution Across Countries: The Problem of
   Second-Order Effects},
Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {91},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1390-1404},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Objective
   We offer an alternative to the conventional measure of government
   redistribution that seeks to address problems of second-order effects
   whereby income guarantees arising from public pensions make it less
   necessary for people to save for their retirement, rendering the
   ``pregovernment{''} counterfactual to the observed postgovernment
   distribution unrealistic.
   Method
   We use household-level data from the Luxembourg Income Study to
   calculate an alternative measure of government redistribution that
   includes public-sector pensions in ``pregovernment{''} income alongside
   private-sector pensions, on the assumption that each represents a claim
   on future income.
   Results
   Employing the alternative method described in the article results in
   lower values for redistribution than the conventional measure.
   Conclusion
   We suggest that our alternative method be used in addition to the
   conventional method in cross-national research, in an effort to achieve
   a more complete understanding of government redistribution in the
   developed countries.},

Abstract = {This paper considers a common n-agent symmetric rent-seeking game It
   derives conditions so that risk-aversion and risk always decrease
   rent-seeking efforts These conditions hold for any regular contest
   success function when risk-averse rent-seekers are also prudent Under n
   = 2, prudence is a necessary and sufficient condition for risk-aversion
   to decrease rent-seeking efforts compared to risk-neutrality An
   intuition for this result is given based on a self-protection model},

Journal = {PUBLIC CHOICE},

Volume = {145},

Pages = {253-264},

Abstract = {The purpose of the present paper is to consider how voters form
   perceptions about macroeconomic policy competence by focusing on the
   role of recent macroeconomic news: Do their perceived views of good news
   matter as much as bad news when they form beliefs about the incumbent
   government's competence in managing the macroeconomy, in particular,
   with regard to their ability to control inflation and unemployment? We
   find that `bad' news about unemployment persists when households are
   forming their perceived competence, whereas ``good{''} news does not.
   That is, voters tend to display pessimistic bias when forming
   perceptions about the incumbent government's competence.},

   within the voting theory literature pertaining to the representation of

Abstract = {There has been an institutional turn in the philosophy of science, which
   has led the discipline to become more concerned with understanding how
   the scientific process actually works. This paper argues that such a
   philosophy of science, which lies beyond only proposing a logic of
   science, has something to learn from economics. Economic thinking can be
   instrumental in understanding the actual scientific process, and in
   proposing proper institutions guiding scientific competition. It is,
   however, also argued that economics would benefit from overcoming the
   pure logic of choice inherent to the neoclassical approach, by further
   developing the institutional approach to economics.},

Abstract = {At first sight, modern economics and justice seem not to fit together.
   Whereas the former primarily deals with individual self-interest and
   extrinsic incentives, the latter deals with other-regardingness and
   intrinsic social motives. However, recent findings, mainly from the
   field of experimental economics, reintroduce aspects of justice into
   economic modeling. Other theories, evolutionary models for instance,
   take up the key findings and apply the economic rationale in order to
   find out why human traits which apparently run counter to individual
   self-interest may have survived. In this introductory note we date this
   discussion back to the days of Adam Smith and argue that he already set
   the basis for such a discussion. Apparently, Smith was well aware that
   principles of justice and the market may, at times, be contradictory.
   However, he also found that both served a common purpose, or so we will
   argue. We further aim at bringing together Smith's classical position
   with recent ideas, for instance Binmore's theory of justice, and see
   whether the one can be fruitful for the other. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {Objective. This article examines claims made by environmental justice
   advocates that government inequitably enforces environmental laws.
   Methods. We test for race- and class-based disparities in the regulatory
   enforcement of the U.S. Clean Water Act from 2000-2005. We estimate
   pooled logistic regression models, and the analysis is conducted at the
   facility-level using an areal apportionment methodology to measure the
   composition of populations living near facilities. Results. We find
   evidence of modest race- and class-based disparities in both government
   inspections and punitive actions taken in response to noncompliant
   behavior, although the pattern of these disparities depends on model
   specification. Conclusions. Our findings provide some evidence of
   disparities in government enforcement of the federal Clean Water Act,
   lending support to the general claims made by environmental justice
   advocates.},

Title = {Density Dependent Dynamics in the Population of Transgender Interest

Volume = {91},

Abstract = {Objective. This article seeks to determine the value of density
   dependence theory in helping us understand the process of interest group
   mobilization. The general theory of density dependence has been tested
   against manifold organizational populations. It has not, however, been
   tested extensively against data on populations of overtly political
   organizations. Methods. I test the theory of density dependence against
   original data on the foundings of nationally active transgender interest
   groups in the United States for the period 1964-2005. I estimate several
   simple Poisson regression count models. Results. The results provide
   strong support for the theory of density dependence. Specifically, in
   the population of U.S. transgender interest groups, the data imply an
   inverted-U relationship between density and the founding rate.
   Conclusions. My findings suggest the following: (1) theories of group
   mobilization that do not take contextual variables into account are
   likely to be incomplete; and (2) interest group populations most likely
   have stable carrying capacities. In all, the results provide yet more
   support for the general organizational ecology paradigm.},

Title = {Strategic Government Spending in South Korea and Taiwan: Lessons for

Abstract = {Objectives. How is government spending used strategically in South Korea
   and Taiwan? As nations generally considered to have weathered
   democratization, government allocations in South Korea and Taiwan are
   instructive on how spending may be used strategically without
   undermining democratization. Methods. The similar sociocultural,
   historical, political, and economic experiences of the two nations
   underlie a most-similar-systems approach to study how their differences
   influence diversity in strategic spending and, correspondingly,
   political outcomes such as size of the government party in the
   legislature. This article evaluates defense and civilian expenditures
   for South Korea and Taiwan from 1975 to 2006. Results. Three results are
   interesting. First, different elections-legislative elections in South
   Korea, presidential elections in Taiwan-lead to increases in spending.
   Second, in both nations, defense spending increases in election years
   but not social spending; however, defense spending benefits the
   government-party in the legislature in South Korea but not in Taiwan.
   Third, when the strategic uses of spending are accounted for,
   democratization does not directly affect allocations. Conclusions. These
   results explicate that government spending is a viable resource for
   party building in new democracies; however, the results also underscore
   that governing parties in new democracies benefit from spending only
   insofar as it is used to build the nation's or party's strengths-not
   undermine the opposition-under competitive elections.},

Abstract = {In The Grammar of Society, Bicchieri maintains that behavior in the
   Ultimatum game (and related economic games) depends on people's
   allegiance to `social norms'. In this article, I follow Bicchieri in
   maintaining that an adequate account of people's behavior in such games
   must make appeal to norms, including a norm of equal division; I depart
   from Bicchieri in maintaining that at least part of the population
   desires to follow such norms even when they do not expect others to
   follow them. This generates a puzzle, however: why do norms of equal
   division have such cultural resilience? One possibility is that our
   natural emotional propensity for envy makes norms of equal division
   emotionally appealing. An alternative (but complementary) possibility is
   that deviations from a norm of equal division would naturally be
   interpreted as threats to status, which would facilitate the
   moralization of such norms.},

Abstract = {To express attitudes and act according to their self-interest, citizens
   need relevant, up-to-date information about current affairs. But has the
   increased commercialization in the media market increased or decreased
   the flow of political information? Hallin and Mancini stress that the
   existing empirical evidence is fragmented and that this question
   therefore has been difficult to answer. In this article the authors
   present new data that allow them to systematically examine how the flow
   of political information on TV occurs across six Western countries
   during a thirty-year period. The authors find that the flow of political
   information through TV varies according to the degree of
   commercialization. The flow of news and current affairs is lowest in the
   most commercially oriented television system and among the commercial TV
   channels. There is however important cross-national variation even
   within similar media systems. The authors' data do not suggest a
   convergence toward the liberal system when it comes to the political
   information environment on TV. Rather, what strikes them is how strongly
   resistant some European countries have been to subordinating the needs
   of democracy to profit making.},

Abstract = {Venture capital firms are known as specific financial intermediaries
   providing not only funds but also expertise to innovative projects This
   paper analyses the consequences venture capital investments syndication
   for an expertise motive can have on investment decisions and on post
   investment involvement of investors In that perspective, we use the
   analytical framework provided by the Soft (versus Hard) Budget
   Constraint literature and more specifically the paper published by Huang
   and Xu {[}2003] in which the capacity of syndication for risk
   diversification to refinance short run inefficient projects is examined
   We develop an extension of that model in order to consider the
   specificity of syndication for expertise and what could be its impact on
   investors' refinancing decision Then, the model discusses the conditions
   for which syndication for expertise motive may be more profitable for
   venture capitalists than syndication for a pure risk diversification
   motive},

Abstract = {It usually happens that the alternatives to be voted on in committees
   are chosen or sponsored by some particularly active committee members.
   For example, in parliaments, some representatives and some government
   members are known to be especially active in introducing bills on which
   the whole committee will later vote. It appears that parliamentary
   agendas-namely amendment and successive elimination voting rules-are
   vulnerable to strategic behavior by groups of individuals introducing
   motions which are not their most preferred alternatives. Our aim in this
   paper is to evaluate how frequently this type of behavior arises.},

Abstract = {The worlds of intelligence, the military, and academe reflect very
   different, at times conflicting, cultures, ethical norms, and
   priorities. This examination assesses the evolution of the sometimes
   fractious relationship between scholars and government military and
   intelligence officials, disputes among them, and cases of convergence
   and critical collaboration. To be effective in policy and decision
   making, the U. S. government needs the best information and thinking it
   can obtain. Much of that expertise resides in academia. For their part,
   social scientists and members of the healing professions, in particular,
   must be attentive to the moral, intellectual, and ethical dictates of
   their professions when participating in support of government employment
   of coercive military force and extraordinary means of intelligence
   acquisition. Finding the appropriate balance between helping safeguard
   national security and upholding the tenets of professional integrity is
   a joint task of soldiers, scholars, and spies.},

Abstract = {This paper develops a theory of optimal institutional structure for
   staggered-term (overlapping generations) organizations such as
   legislative bodies. Our model is a simple stochastic game of
   multi-principal, multi-agent dynamic relationships. Our results
   emphasize two key features that are determined by legislative founders
   at the ``constitutional moment{''}. First, they will agree to institute
   a mechanism that endows (imperfectly informed) legislators with
   information about the history of play. Second, we provide conditions in
   which legislative founders will be indifferent to the structure of
   legislative procedures.},

Abstract = {It has been argued that a balanced budget rule exhibiting sufficient
   fiscal increasing returns creates aggregate instability by generating
   expectation driven fluctuations This paper shows that the assertion
   crucially depends on the nature of the external effects affecting the
   technology By contrast with factor specific externalities usually
   studied in the relevant literature the balanced budget rule can be used
   as a stabilization policy to rule out indeterminacy based on sector
   specific externalities, provided the discount rate is small enough The
   policy is more efficient when government spending is financed by a tax
   on labor income stabilization cannot be achieved under an exclusive
   capital levy However capital levy may help in reducing the taxation on
   labor supply while main taming stabilization but generates an increase
   in the tax burden Consequences for policy prescriptions are discussed},

Abstract = {Using a two stage rent-seeking framework, we present a simple model of
   strategic entry/terrorism deterrence and test the model using laboratory
   experiments. Our contest success function highlights the potential for
   strategic spillovers. The theory illustrates that, relative to a
   cooperative outcome, negative externalities lead to over-spending on
   deterrence and positive externalities lead to under-spending on
   deterrence. Our experimental results are broadly consistent; subjects in
   the negative externality treatment had higher expenditures. In contrast
   to theoretical predictions, participation decisions, while primarily
   driven by the probability of winning a contest, were influenced by a
   subject's ability to participate in multiple contests.},

Abstract = {Prior to World War II, the U.S. Army numbered 187,000 soldiers. Its
   growth to more than 8 million was a significant accomplishment. Little
   known to most, the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration's youth program,
   the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), provided the pretrained manpower
   to fill the U.S. Army's ranks upon mobilization with men who readily
   assumed the role of Non-Commissioned Officers (NCOs). It also gave
   Organized Reserve Corps officers the opportunity to occupy leadership
   positions, an experience that would have been unavailable otherwise. By
   the same token, it allowed the Regular Army to assess the leadership
   potential of both Regular and Reserve Officers in leading future citizen
   soldiers. Last, it provided the Army with an opportunity to exercise its
   mobilization plans.},

Abstract = {The commercial use of information on the Internet has produced
   substantial benefits for consumers. But, as the use of information
   online has increased, so have concerns about privacy. This paper
   discusses how the use of individuals' information for commercial
   purposes affects consumers, and the implications of restricting
   information availability in the interest of privacy. It lays out a range
   of information benefits to consumers of the commercial use of online
   information, including targeted services, cost reductions through
   targeted advertising, efficient search engines, differential pricing and
   re-use of information. It argues that firms have incentives to satisfy
   customers' privacy preferences and that restrictions in the legitimate
   use of information may not lead to further privacy benefits. It
   discusses a number of policy proposals geared at maximizing privacy,
   arguing that benefits to consumers would be outweighed by the
   information costs.},

Abstract = {This article reviews media-related aspects of the 2009 Japanese lower
   house elections, which saw the historic defeat of the long-ruling
   Liberal Democratic Party by the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ). Drawing
   mainly on Internet sources and on interviews with politicians and
   political journalists, the authors argue that the DPJ relied primarily
   on conventional media strategies and made only limited use of new media
   in their campaign. If the DPJ hopes permanently to transform Japan's
   political landscape, the party will need to prioritize the reform of
   outdated election campaign legislation and abolish ``closed shop{''}
   reporters' clubs.},

   number of times each member appeared on national television news at the
   time of study was obtained and used as a measure of television news
   coverage. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that, over and above
   controls for a host of factors, the physical attractiveness of the MKs
   was associated with their coverage in television news.},

Abstract = {Antitrust legislation and enforcement has over the last few decades been
   increasingly informed by ever more sophisticated analysis while-at the

   `nirvana fallacy' (Demsetz in Journal of Law and Economics 12(1):1-22,
   1969) expectations. I draw upon a recent Supreme Court decision as well
   as the results of Young and Shughart's (Public Choice, 2010. doi:
   10.1007/s11127\_009-9531-y) novel approach to the analysis of antitrust
   enforcement activities to discuss the extent to which public choice

Abstract = {This paper contrasts the time-series properties of aggregate and
   disaggregate UK inflation. While aggregate inflation is found to be
   non-stationary, unit root rejection frequencies are increasing when we
   use more disaggregate data. Structural break analysis suggests that
   structural shifts in monetary policy could alter inflation persistence.
   Additionally, panel evidence indicates that the unit root hypothesis can
   be rejected for sectoral inflation rates. Finally, we compare the
   persistence properties of UK inflation, finding statistically
   significant differences between aggregate and disaggregate series. Our
   analysis suggests that aggregation matters, which has important
   implications for econometric analysis and the conduct of monetary
   policy.},

   Middle East},
Journal = {GEOPOLITICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {15},
Number = {2},
Pages = {210-238},
Abstract = {This article argues that American actions in the Middle East designed to
   advance democracy and/or `moderation' tend to yield perverse outcomes
   that frustrate the aspirations of local actors while undermining the
   values purportedly being promoted by the US. In order to explain these
   contradictions, we emphasise the linkage between policies of democracy
   promotion and long-standing American commitments both to millennialism
   and geographical omnipresence. As a result of these policies and
   geopolitical vision, we argue that `democracy promotion' often devolves
   into a simple defence of American interest - by producing electoral
   outcomes intended to strengthen local agents seen as compliant with US
   regional priorities. In this context, the shift from democracy promotion
   to a policy of pursuing `moderation' in the region, understood as
   support for American policies, is entirely coherent. Commentators tend
   to present this shift (particularly in the wake of the Iraq War) as
   recognition by US political actors of the imperial overtones embedded in
   more heavy-handed approaches to regime change. Yet, the call for
   moderation is itself profoundly intertwined with American millennial
   aspirations, while remaining remarkably devoid of clear content and thus
   equally amenable to manipulation for strategic ends. By way of
   conclusion, we suggest an alternative basis for a less intrusive
   American position in the region, one that rejects the need for an
   overstretched territorial presence and that is grounded in a substantive
   respect for local self-determination.},

   in Independent India},
Journal = {GEOPOLITICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Pages = {586-605},
Abstract = {Contrary to the view of some observers who insist that the Cold War was
   of limited or no relevance to the transition from colonies to
   nation-states after 1945 we argue that the geopolitics of the Cold War
   played a crucial role in shaping the character and direction of the
   trajectories of nation-states in Asia, if not the erstwhile Third World
   as a whole. More particularly, the geopolitics of the Cold War provided
   the crucial backdrop for the rise and fall of developmental nationalism,
   while the post-Cold War era has set the scene for an array of cultural
   nationalisms. These issues are explored with a particular focus on
   India. The case of India makes clear that it is impossible to separate
   the emergence of new nation-states and their success or failure after
   1945 from the geopolitics of the Cold War. It will also make clear that
   the shifting geopolitics of the end of the Cold War reinforced the
   demise of developmental nationalism. Since the late 1980s, the problems
   facing the nation-states of the former Third World, are being played out
   in a geo-political context, which includes an important shift from
   developmental nationalisms to cultural nationalisms, while the
   nation-state system itself is sliding deeper into crisis against the
   backdrop of the global framework of `genuinely existing' liberal
   capitalism and the changing geopolitics of the early twenty-first
   century.},

Abstract = {This article traces the evolution of socialism in Alsace through an
   analysis of socialist attitudes towards the nation and region. After
   Alsace's annexation into Prussia in 1871, socialism in the province
   developed under the auspices of the German social democracy. This did a
   great deal to integrate Alsatian workers into a wider national political
   culture, while local militants retained the symbols and language of the
   French revolutionary tradition. Such flexibility eased the transition
   from German to French rule when the province was returned to France
   after the First World War. However, this flexibility also masked a range
   of contradictions in the socialist analysis. These contradictions meant
   that during the later years of annexation, during the War and the
   Revolution of 1918, the Alsatian socialist idea of the nation was still
   being shaped and contested. At the Tours Congress, the party's militants
   explicitly stated their attitudes towards Alsace, France and Germany,
   yet the tensions resulting from their dual heritage were never
   satisfactorily resolved. The result was the clash of expectations, and
   of political cultures, which characterizes French governmental attempts
   to reintegrate its lost provinces. The discussion here addresses the
   evolution, articulation and application of Alsatian socialist attitudes
   towards nation and region as their province was transferred from German
   Reichsland to French Republique.},

Volume = {3},
Number = {2},
Pages = {123-142},
Abstract = {On 17 February 2008, the province of Kosovo formally declared its
   independence from Serbia. The most important normative theories of
   secession choice theories and just cause theories appear to justify the
   creation of a second Albanian state on the Balkans. Kosovo's
   independence reflects the will of the vast majority of its inhabitants
   and can be seen as a remedy for grave human rights violations in the era
   of Slobodan Milosevic. Two problems, however, need to be thoroughly
   discussed. Firstly, the secession of Kosovo may establish a precedent
   for other separatist conflicts and contribute to the destabilization of
   south-east Europe and other world regions. Secondly, the new political
   authorities in Pristina may not be capable to protect the Serb minority
   against discrimination and repression. It is argued that both problems
   give no conclusive reasons to reject Kosovo's claim for independence.
   However, some aspects of the secession, for instance the maintenance of
   the provincial borders, are considered to be illegitimate.},

Abstract = {In a few short years, the World Wide Web has become a standard part of
   candidates' campaign tool kits. Virtually all candidates have their own
   sites, and voters, journalists, and activists visit the sites with
   increasing frequency. In this article, we study what candidates do on
   these sitesin terms of the information they presentby exploring one of
   the most enduring and widely debated campaign strategies: ogoing
   negative.o Comparing data from over 700 congressional candidate Web
   sites, over three election cycles (2002, 2004, and 2006), with
   television advertising data, we show that candidates go negative with
   similar likelihoods across these media. We also find that while similar
   dynamics drive negativity on the Web and in television advertising,
   there are some notable differences. These differences likely stem, in
   part, from the truncated sample available with television data (i.e.,
   many candidates do not produce ads). Our results have implications for
   understanding negative campaigning and for the ways in which scholars
   can study campaign dynamics.},

Journal = {POLITICKA EKONOMIE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {58},
Number = {3},
Pages = {326-342},
Abstract = {This article, based on an empirical analysis, discusses factors
   affecting property prices and tries to identify periods of property
   price overvaluation in the Czech Republic. To achieve this, the article
   uses both relatively simple approach using ratios related to the house
   prices (e.g. price-to-rent or price-to-income indicators) as well as
   international comparison and more advanced econometrical approach.
   Within this econometrical approach we apply both time series analysis
   for the Czech Republic as a whole and panel regression for the Czech
   regions. This analysis identifies overvalued property prices in
   2002-2003 and 2007-2008. In 2007-2008, however, the rise in property
   prices was largely explainable by fundamentals, meaning that the price
   overvaluation in this period was considerably smaller than that in the
   first one. From the regional perspective, there is a higher degree of
   overvaluation in regions with higher property prices. The exception is
   Prague, which seems to be a ``specific{''} region partly due to the
   properties of the estimation technique.},

   TARGETING WITH POST-KEYNESIAN ECONOMICS},
Journal = {POLITICKA EKONOMIE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {58},
Number = {1},
Pages = {92-104},
Abstract = {The article deals with the relationship of post-Keynesian economics to
   new consensus as a theoretical framework of inflation targeting. First,
   new consensus with its roots in Wicksell's approach is briefly
   introduced. In the next parts differences and meeting-points of new
   consensus and post-Keynesian economics are discussed. Among the main
   similarities is identified: short term interest rate management,
   endogeneity of monetary base, endogeneity of money supply. But a lot of
   basic differences are found (goals of monetary policy, interest rate
   functions, nature of inflation, shape of Phillips curve and others). As
   a result, on the general level new consensus and post-Keynesian
   economics seem to be rather incompatible.},

Volume = {36},
Number = {2},
Pages = {310-326},

Abstract = {This article addresses the causes and dynamics of spin-off violence by
   paramilitary groups that developed in Serbia in the early 1990s. It
   shows that some forms of violence that challenge the state's monopoly
   come into being due to decisions of state agencies. But delegated
   violence easily develops a life of its own, and therefore the decisions
   of state leaders are not the only variable, perhaps not even an
   important one, needed to explain the dynamics of violence once the
   turmoil of war has started. In retrospect, it seems as if warfare was
   just an episode in the political life of militias or the political
   groupings behind them. Violence was just one means among others in the
   fight for political chances. Therefore, the emergence and the life of
   these groups have to be explained as attempts of single political
   entrepreneurs to achieve the accumulation of power through the exertion
   of violence.},

Title = {Precision vs. Realism on the Framing Continuum: Understanding the
   Underpinnings of Message Effects},
Journal = {POLITICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {27},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-19},
Abstract = {Although largely unrecognized, a close reading of extant experimental
   research on framing effects reveals that contrasting approaches mark the
   conceptualization and operationalization of message frames in much
   contemporary inquiry. One approach strives to maintain factual and
   logical equivalence while altering the vantage point taken in the story,
   while the other emphasizes different facts, changing the sources,
   subjects, and scope of a story as part of the frame shift. Exploring the
   continuum between precision and realism as approaches to framingbetween
   more internally valid and more ecologically valid conceptions of
   framesis the focus of this research. An online experimental study
   contrasted a precise equivalence framing of a social issue in gain and
   loss terms against a version that included frame-resonant facts,
   providing the news story more realism. These frames were embedded within
   a broadcast news report that was scripted, filmed, and produced in
   conjunction with working television journalists from a PBS affiliate.
   Results suggest that both more precise and more realistic forms of gain
   and loss framing deserve continued attention, albeit with careful
   consideration of what it means oto frame,o both conceptually and
   operationally.},

Journal = {POLITICKA EKONOMIE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {58},
Number = {6},
Pages = {747-760},
Abstract = {The aim of the article is to investigate if there exists a systematic
   link between size of the firm, market concentration and R\&D activity of
   firms. Three tentative results emerged from the regression analysis
   based on the firm balanced panel data 1998-2006. First it follows from a
   regression analysis that a positive relationship between size and R\&D
   activity of the firm exists, which is non-linear however. Second the
   results indicate that a negative relationship between firm R\&D
   personnel and industry concentration exists. If market concentration is
   a measure of competition than we can conclude that innovation is related
   to the competitive market structure. We arrived at the same conclusion
   when innovation was measured by intangible assets and competition was
   measured by Lerner index. Finally, our analysis concluded that although
   foreign firms are on average larger than domestic, a negative
   relationship between the foreign ownership of the firm and the number of
   R\&D employees exists. In comparison to domestic firms, foreign firms
   have less R\&D personnel.},

Abstract = {The dilemma of direct democracy is that voters may not always be able to
   make welfare-improving decisions. Arthur Lupia's seminal work has led us
   to believe that voters can substitute voting cues for substantive policy
   knowledge. Lupia, however, emphasized that cues were valuable under
   certain conditions and not others. In what follows, we present three
   main findings regarding voters and what they know about California's
   Proposition 7. First, much like Lupia reported, we show voters who are
   able to recall endorsements for or against a ballot measure vote
   similarly to people who recall certain basic facts about the initiative.
   We show, second, that voters whose stated policy preferences would
   otherwise suggest they would favor the ``no{''}position cast their
   ballots with far less error than do people who favor the
   ``yes{''}position. This suggests that many voters may employ a
   ``defensive no{''}strategy when faced with complex policy choices on the
   ballot. Our third result is a bit surprising: we find that
   better-informed voters, whether this information is derived from factual
   knowledge of the initiative or from knowledge of well-publicized voting
   cues, are no more likely to make reasoned decisions than those who are,
   by our measure, uninformed. This suggests that existing theories of
   voter choice, especially in direct democracy, may be inadequate. We
   conclude with some preliminary policy recommendations that could help
   improve the information environment for initiatives and referenda by
   providing key information on the ballot.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes how political institutions affect the execution of
   exchange-rate policy. By focusing on policy-makers' responses to the
   emergence of speculative pressure on their currencies, we argue that the
   effect of democratic institutions on exchange-rate stability is likely
   to be conditioned by the officially announced exchange-rate regime.
   Officially fixed exchange rates are the main instrument of autocrats to
   signal commitment to long-term stability. Autocratic governments with
   strictly fixed exchange rates are thus more likely to defend their
   exchange rates than autocrats with an intermediate regime because the
   latter implicitly signal that they care less about monetary stability.
   In contrast, democrats defend more often in intermediately than in fully
   fixed official regimes by using a combination of external and internal
   adjustments, which reduce the negative effects of a devaluation on
   voters. Our analysis of 189 currency crises between 1975 and 1999
   supports this conditional effect.},

Abstract = {The following article tests the hypothesis that veterans have better
   health if they were officers when they were in the U. S. military than
   if they served in the enlisted ranks. It examines this hypothesis by
   presenting results from logistic regressions that are based on four
   surveys: the National Survey of Veterans, the Survey of Retired
   Military, the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, and the Wisconsin
   Longitudinal Study. In all four of these surveys, the evidence is
   consistent with the hypothesis that military rank is associated with
   health, particularly among veterans who served longer. It also suggests
   that the health gradient by rank is independent of similar gradients by
   education and income as well as health differences by race. These
   findings indicate that health may be influenced not just by differences
   in civilian society but also by those in the military.},

Abstract = {In 2003, Japan enacted its first private-sector data protection
   legislation, complementing the concurrent update of the public-sector
   regulations. The publicly stated goal of the Japanese government was to
   support trade with Europe by providing suitably strong protection to
   qualify for European data-export approval. In this paper we examine the
   internal social and political pressures that led to the adoption of
   apparently strong private-sector data protection, despite prior long
   resistance to such a move. The pressures we have identified include
   direct and indirect effects of Japanese economic difficulties since the
   early 1990s, media pressure to update public-sector rules because of the
   introduction of Juki Net, and similar media pressure to apply similar
   rules to the private sector. We also examine the role that the
   technology of kanji input systems played on the lack of urgency in
   demands for private-sector data protection until 2000.},

Abstract = {Citizens' expectations about what government is capable of doing and
   what policies government officials intend to pursue can influence their
   decisions. After a disaster, for instance, expectations of government's
   intent and capacity to assist in the rebuilding process will influence
   the rebuilding strategies that affected citizens adopt. This article
   develops a typology that categorizes citizens' expectations of
   government response to disaster. We then deploy this typology to
   identify expectation patterns among residents and other private actors
   in New Orleans' Ninth Ward communities who have returned following
   Katrina and explain how these expectations shape their preferred
   rebuilding strategy.},

Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {91},
Number = {2},
Pages = {415-435},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Objective
   Although the impact of the president's rhetoric on public opinion
   remains unfound, it appears to increase the president's success in
   Congress. This article argues that instead of moving public opinion,
   presidential speeches act as informational cues for legislators and
   holds that the impact of the president's public speeches in Congress is
   conditional on the salience and complexity of the policy voted on by
   Congress.
   Method
   I use probit methodology to examine the effect of presidential rhetoric
   on the likelihood of presidential success on House roll-call votes from
   1989-2000. An interactive model assesses the conditioning impact a
   policy's salience and complexity have on the relationship between
   presidential rhetoric and legislative success.
   Results
   Presidential rhetoric increases the president's legislative success on
   votes pertaining to policies that are both salient and complex.
   Conclusion
   Presidential rhetoric matters to the president's relationship with
   Congress, despite the limited impact it appears to have on public
   opinion.},

Abstract = {Although Israel constitutes an interesting case for the study of
   civil-military relations, the role played by its Directory of Military
   Intelligence (AMAN) has rarely been discussed in this context. This role
   is of special interest, since Israel is the only liberal democracy today
   in which a military intelligence service functions as the leading
   national estimator not only in military but also in civilian affairs.
   The unique Israeli model is usually justified by Israel's security
   concerns-primarily the threat of a sudden conventional attack. To test
   this model's validity, this article (1) traces and elucidates its
   historical development; (2) employs five crucial mini case studies to
   test its practical success or failure; and (3) explains how, in light of
   the fact that AMAN failed in four of the five cases, its military
   characteristics create inherent weaknesses that hamper its ability to
   serve as a high-quality national intelligence estimator.},

Abstract = {In this comparative study of two water basins in the Middle East, we
   examine the hydro-political construction of scale as central to state
   and nation building, and their territorial consolidation. We argue that
   scalar negotiations and constructions of freshwater became central to
   the very consolidation of both Turkey and Israel. The examples we offer
   also illustrate the usefulness of a performative approach to scale,
   benefiting from but moving beyond a politics of scale approach. The
   comparative focus on hydro-scalar politics and performativities in
   relation to state and nation building offered a) lends to an enriched
   understanding of water politics in these two contested river basins, b)
   enables fuller understanding of how water becomes central to the
   processes by which nations, states, and territories are consolidated in
   this region, and c) contributes to recent debates in political geography
   by demonstrating the value of scalar and performative approaches.
   Underscoring these linkages, the analysis differs from many works on
   water in the Middle East, contributes to studies of state and nation
   building as contested processes, and avoids the assumption of state or
   national scales as ontological pre-givens. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Political historians traditionally privileged the political activities
   of men and masculine political institutions. This vision of political
   history was revised from the early 1970s, first by ``women's history{''}
   and later due to the influence of the ``gender turn{''}. The latter
   encompassed a recognition that conceptions of masculinity and femininity
   contribute to the shaping of political power. Both developments
   challenged but ultimately reinvigorated political history. However, as
   this article will argue, political history and feminist history remain
   to an extent quarantined from one another, despite the radical potential
   for feminist scholarship to change the way politics is conceived.},

Abstract = {Objectives
   Agency-based support, defined as material assistance received from
   charities and private social service agencies, can constitute an
   important source of help for low-income families. This study examines
   the socioeconomic determinants of agency-based support and seeks to
   reveal whether it constitutes an alternative source of support for
   families whose personal networks can provide only limited assistance.
   Methods
   Multivariate analyses were conducted using data from ``Welfare,
   Children, and Families: A Three City Study,{''} a study of low-income
   mothers living in disadvantaged urban neighborhoods.
   Results
   Findings reveal that respondents with high levels of network support
   were significantly less likely to use agency-based support. No
   association, however, was found with network burden, which led to
   rejecting the alternative hypothesis that people may use agency-based
   support to limit their interactions with demanding network members.
   Conclusions
   Overall, findings suggest that agency-based support constitutes an
   alternative source of assistance for those who receive little or no
   support from family and friends. Policy implications in light of welfare
   reform are discussed.},

Abstract = {Do the antitrust law enforcement activities of the US Department of
   Justice act as exogenous ``technology shocks{''} or as ``markup
   shocks{''} limiting market power and promoting economic growth? We
   analyze annual time series data from 1947 to 2003 on three measures of
   federal antitrust intervention: the ratio of the Antitrust Division's
   budgetary expenditures to GDP as well as the numbers of civil and
   criminal antitrust cases instituted. We find that changes in the levels
   of these policy variables act like negative technology shocks and that
   the negative effects are transitory; antitrust policy generates no
   subsequent offsetting increases in productivity.},

Abstract = {The planting of a Russian flag at the bottom of the Arctic Ocean in the
   summer of 2007 precipitated a series of policy and media-level reactions
   including expressions of outrage and discontent. This paper develops an
   analysis of the work of the Commission on the Limits of the Continental
   Shelf (CCLS) and the different strategies used by coastal states to
   press `claims' to outer continental shelf (OCS). The agency of Arctic
   `coastal states' such as Canada, Norway and Russia is noteworthy but
   others including the European Union and indigenous peoples have also
   raised concerns about the behaviour of these geographically proximate
   actors. Finally, I consider other ways of looking at the Arctic as a
   circumpolar space and the challenges that are held to be facing the
   region in the present and future. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Publications in foreign or domestic scientific journals are an important
   part of research output. And so is the citation feedback on these
   publications, which is done by other scientists in this field of
   science. One of the tools which can effectively and impartially evaluate
   the publication and citation level of a scientist is the h-index. The
   groundwork for its calculation is drawn on the most prestigious citation
   and publication database which is Web of Science. What is the quality of
   the records in this database and what are the other problems than can
   occur while using it? This paper describes all that and much more.},

Abstract = {The recent establishment of the US Africa Command (AFRICOM) embodies the
   resurgence of counterinsurgency arguments within the transformation of
   the US military. The command's emphasis on its onon-traditionalo
   character that includes civil activities, a focus on the population's
   security, as well as its interagency approach intensified the
   controversy about the role of the military in US foreign policy. Rather
   than merely focusing on how to succeed in asymmetric warfare, AFRICOM
   proposes a long-term commitment of US forces in situations where violent
   conflict is not apparent and has to be prevented. This oproactive
   peacetime engagemento on the continent targets crucial communities and
   their perceptions through humanitarian and development projects. Africa
   is likely to become a testing ground for the US military's expansion
   into onon-traditionalo activities ranging from counterinsurgency to
   conflict prevention. Blending security and development in this radical
   way may make the distinction between civil and military intervention
   vanish.},

Abstract = {The academic literature that addresses the creation and transformation
   of large law firms seldom mentions the presence of legal secretaries.
   The absence of legal secretaries, the vast majority of whom are women,
   reproduces law firm hierarchies in which attorneys are important in
   understanding the legal profession and law firm dynamics while
   secretaries remain invisible. Given the lack of secondary literature on
   legal secretaries, much of this chapter is based upon legal secretaries'
   responses to a nationwide survey, which I conducted in Spring 2009.
   Using such data, along with other primary sources, the chapter examines
   how legal secretaries' roles and work have changed during the past 50
   years, how legal secretaries view themselves and their roles in law
   large law firms, and the material conditions under which legal
   secretaries work. Moreover, the most significant scholarship on
   secretaries has depicted the secretary/boss relationship as one of
   personal and domestic nature - what we might call the ``second-wife
   syndrome.{''} The chapter explores whether such a description remains
   accurate and the complicated gender dynamics that exist between legal
   secretaries and attorneys.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the manner in which the break-up of the
   Austro-Hungarian Empire was represented to the US public using a
   qualitative content analysis of articles from three major US newspapers
   in October and November, 1918. Against a geopolitical backdrop of the
   increasing global presence of the United States and assertion of its
   influence in international affairs, the analysis shows that three key
   themes were emphasised in the popular US political narratives at the end
   of World War I: national self-determination, legitimacy of governance,
   and the role of Eastern European diasporas and representatives in the
   United States. Throughout the essay, these themes are connected to key
   discussions of US hegemony in political geography. The critical
   geopolitics approach highlights how the articles signposted boundary
   markers of identity at a crucial, transitional point in US history,
   helping to crystallise an American sense of `Self' increasingly based
   upon world leadership, and sending compelling messages about the
   expected behaviours of nations, states, and individuals. This work
   concludes that the stage was set early in the twentieth century for a
   phase of US global intellectual and moral leadership, and that the
   ascendance of US hegemony globally was accompanied by an active media
   project at home which sought to redefine Americans' collective sense of
   themselves as vanguards of liberal democratic values in a world of
   outdated and undemocratic regimes.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the effects of asymmetric information on the public
   control of politicians in a world where the politicians' pre-election
   promises are not credible. We study a model with identical politicians
   and a representative voter whose interests conflict with those of the
   politicians'. The voter's decision to reelect the politician depends on
   both observable policies of the politician and the outcome of the
   unobservable policies. In equilibrium, either optimal decisions for the
   voter are not taken by the politician or if taken, the politician would
   extract more rent. In the latter case, politicians are also replaced
   more frequently.},

Journal = {POLITICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2010},

Pages = {406-431},
Abstract = {In recent years, voluntary associations and political organizations have
   increasingly relied on Internet-based mobilization campaigns, replacing
   traditional forms of face-to-face recruitment and mobilization. Within
   the literature, one can observe an intensive debate about the possible
   consequences of this transition. Most importantly, the question is
   whether political mobilization through the Internet is just as effective
   as mobilization in a face-to-face setting. In this article, we report on
   a mobilization experiment using both traditional (face-to-face) and
   modern (Web site) incentives for mobilization. The experiment was
   conducted among undergraduate students in Belgium and Canada and
   included a test of medium-term mobilization effects. Results suggest
   that the Internet is successful in transferring knowledge and raising
   issue salience among respondents, but neither experimental manipulation
   led to significant behavioral changes. We do not find any indication
   that among this experimental sample Internet-based mobilization would be
   less effective than traditional face-to-face forms of mobilization.},

   2008 Campaigns for President of the United States and Prime Minister of
   Canada},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY \& POLITICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {7},

Abstract = {The parallel 2008 campaigns for President of the United States and Prime
   Minister of Canada provided a unique opportunity for a comparison of the
   issues raised in the campaigns of two neighboring countries with many
   similarities. After exploring the roles of information policy in recent
   political campaigns, this article compares the information policy and
   technology issues emphasized in the platforms and positions of the major
   party candidates in the 2008 races, both between the candidates of each
   nation and across the border. The article also compares the uses of
   information technologies by the campaigns to organize and disseminate
   their messages. As information policy issues are central aspects of the
   political agenda in technologically advanced nations and those nations
   that wish to become technologically advanced, the ways in which the
   issues are raised in political campaigns can be quite instructive about
   current approaches to and future directions in information policy.},

Title = {American Dual Containment in Asia},
Journal = {GEOPOLITICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {15},
Number = {4},
Pages = {705-725},
Abstract = {US grand strategy after 9/11 turned from post-containment drift to
   preemption. But the costs are high - suspicion of American power,
   hedging by traditional allies, expensive, go-it-alone ventures like
   Iraq. Tried-and-true containment better reflects American values. While
   forward in the world, containment is also defensive. It reassures
   skittish partners and reflects liberal, anti-imperial US preferences. In
   Asia, containment would deter the primary contemporary challengers of US
   power - radical Islam and Chinese nationalism - without encouraging a
   Bush-style global backlash. In a reductive analysis of US alliance
   choices, this article predicts a medium-term Indo-American alliance.
   India uniquely shares both US liberal democratic values and the same two
   challengers; it is the likely pivot in a US-backed neo-containment
   architecture in Asia.},

Abstract = {Responding to comments by Ben Fine in relation to the concept of the
   degree of separation among workers, this article argues that Fine (a)
   confuses Marx's levels of analysis and thus cannot distinguish between
   necessity and contingency; (b) fails to grasp the problematic character
   of Marx's discussion of relative surplus-value once we remove the
   assumption of a given standard of necessity; and (c) accordingly remains
   trapped (like so many others) in a `Ricardian Box' that Marx himself was
   able to escape.},

Journal = {ESTUDIOS CONSTITUCIONALES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {8},
Number = {2},
Pages = {125-166},
Abstract = {Most of the social rights consist in social benefits. From the legal
   point of view, this is an important constraint to its protection and
   satisfaction, because they depend on the economic resources available by
   the State. Consequently, when a Constitution recognizes those rights
   usually does not give the possibility of judicial protection. That is
   what happens in the Chilean Constitution. The jurisprudence of the
   Supreme Court has confirmed that social benefits are not enforceable in
   Courts, even when they are associated to traditional rights and
   freedoms. However, the Constitutional Court's recent jurisprudence
   regarding the rights to health protection and to social security
   contradicts this, attributing to social rights the same value as other
   rights and freedoms.},

Abstract = {More than 30\% of the population lives in less favoured areas in the
   Czech Republic. These areas are characterized by a number of limitations
   such as shorter growing season, lower average annual temperature, the
   worse traffic conditions, higher environmental protection and others.
   Sustainable development of these areas depends not only on development
   of agriculture in these areas that is well supported, but also on the
   development of other sectors of the economy. An important element of
   development of these areas is a sufficient number of job opportunities.
   An analysis of employment in the years 2002-2006 was performed to
   investigate this. The method shift-share analysis was used. The analysis
   revealed that the total change of employment in the LFA was influenced
   mainly by a positive development of the regional component in the most
   important sectors. In the non LFA, the decrease of a number of workers
   due to the industry-mix component (mainly transport and trade) was
   intensified by unfavourable values of the regional component. Dealing
   with the situation of the employment in industry, trade and transport is
   the key matter.},

Abstract = {This paper inquires into beginnings of a gift economy as well as related
   contemporary institutions. Gift economy and the gift as a complex
   phenomenon was a common base for institutions of markets, credits,
   taxation, alms or social security. Inquires of origins, development and
   contemporary forms are consequently important contributions to our
   understanding to contemporary social institutions. We can also inquire
   with economists into present forms of a gift and look for reply to
   different questions about efficiency of a gift: Why to give, how to give
   and what way give a gift.},

Title = {Justifications of Inequality: The Normative Basis of Pay Differentials
   in 31 Nations},
Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {91},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1405-1431},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Objectives
   We investigate social consensus and dissensus within and between nations
   in three important justifications for pay differences: family needs,
   performance on the job, and education/authority.
   Methods
   Data are from 31 nations and 66,777 individual respondents analyzed
   using structural equation and multilevel regression methods with
   multiple imputation of missing data.
   Results
   In poor countries, but not in rich, most believe that family needs
   legitimate higher pay. Within countries-particularly English-speaking
   ones-low SES groups endorse family needs, but high SES groups reject
   them. Valuing performance and effort is widespread throughout the world
   and throughout all segments of society, high and low. Education and
   authority are widely valued, more in poor nations than in rich, with
   some demographic differences but few socioeconomic cleavages.
   Conclusions
   There is conflict both within nations and between them as to whether
   need and education/authority justify unequal pay, but consensus that
   performance on the job does justify it.},

Abstract = {The modern theory of voting usually regards voters as expected utility
   maximizers. This implies that voters define subjective probabilities and
   utilities for different outcomes of the elections. In real life, these
   probabilities and utilities are often highly uncertain, so a robust
   choice, immune to erroneous assumptions, may be preferred. We show that
   a voter aiming to satisfice his expected utility, rather than maximize
   it, may present a bias for sincere voting, as opposed to strategic
   voting. This may explain previous results which show that strategic
   voting is not as prevalent as would be expected if all voters were
   expected utility maximizers.},

Abstract = {Using data on a sample of manufacturing establishments in Germany, we
   find that the use of self-managed teams is associated with increased
   intra-firm wage inequality between skilled and unskilled blue-collar
   workers. We also show that moderating factors play an important role.
   While teamwork interacts positively with employer-provided further
   training and a production technology of the most recent vintage, it
   interacts negatively with the age of the establishment and the coverage
   by a collective bargaining agreement.},

Abstract = {The Confederate Congress passed draconian trade legislation in February
   1864 to regulate the blockade running business in contrast to their free
   trade agenda. This legislation created higher prices and deadweight
   costs except in areas under Union control. We examine the series of
   votes and proposed amendments relating to the passage of this
   legislation and find that representatives were more likely to vote for
   trade regulations if their districts would be largely unaffected by the
   legislation, such as those districts under Union occupation. This
   private interest explanation provides a heretofore unexplored historical
   example of public choice theory under extreme conditions.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a detailed analysis of voters responses to
   municipality and regional-level unemployment and economic growth, using
   panel data on 284 municipalities and 9 regions, covering Swedish general
   elections from 1982 to 2002. The preferred specification suggests that a
   reduction in regional unemployment by one percentage point is associated
   with an increase in the support for the national government by about 1.7
   percentage points. The effect of growth, at the regional level, is
   substantial in size, but statistically insignificant. At the
   municipality level, unemployment has a smaller effect than at the
   regional level and growth has no effect on government support. (C) 2010

Abstract = {Objective
   I explore the effects of the partisan composition of government on
   industrial aid disbursement in 14 EU member states during the period
   1992-2004.
   Methods
   Predictions are tested controlling for the impact of international
   economic integration, the European Commission, domestic institutions,
   and macroeconomic conditions, using Prais-Winsten coefficients with
   panel-corrected standard errors, a random effects specification, and
   two-stage least squares analysis with GLS random effects.
   Results
   Contrary to conventional wisdom, right-wing governments systematically
   give out more total and sectoral aid than left-wing governments.
   Conclusion
   Partisan politics tempers national enthusiasm for a single European
   market, exposing market reforms to a range of restraining domestic
   political issues.},

Abstract = {In contemporary democracies, the construction of political leadership is
   driven by communication strategies with greater emphasis on image over
   substance and personality over ideology. This article analyzes two
   countries, Italy and France, that have been recently characterized by a
   remarkable increase in the personalization and mediatization of
   politics. First, the article intends to identify some key features of
   the leadership that emerge and prove to be successful in mediatized
   democracies. Second, the article makes a comparison of Italian and
   French electoral campaigns, paying special attention to the role of the
   media in the construction of leadership. Finally, the article examines
   the cases of two leaders who have left their mark on recent electoral
   campaigns and are credited with remarkable expertise in political
   marketing and news management: Silvio Berlusconi and Nicolas Sarkozy.},

Abstract = {This paper looks at British policy in the Mediterranean in the late
   nineteenth century, and the importance and role of Cyprus as an island
   under British administration at that time. Specifically, it aims to
   investigate the neglected role of Cyprus during the Arabi revolt and
   ensuing Egyptian campaign in 1882. In order to highlight this
   less-examined aspect, it examines the reasons why Cyprus had not been
   transformed into a suitable naval station by 1882. It also looks at the
   effect of the lack of military facilities on the island's use, and the
   politicians' perception of the usefulness of Cyprus during these events
   in Egypt, vis-A-vis the reaction of the British and Cyprus press.},

Abstract = {The placement of various tee boxes on golf courses subsidizes the first
   shot of each hole for certain players. McCormick and Tollison find that
   this subsidy is statistically larger (other factors equal) in the
   southern US states and that it has been decreasing over time. These
   findings illustrate more general issues of chivalry, gender, age, and
   opportunity costs. The economics profession will undoubtedly continue to
   use sports data to better understand the behavior and interactions of
   people and firms in the economy.},

Volume = {57},

Pages = {103-117},

Abstract = {We estimate a flexible non-linear monetary policy rule for the United
   Kingdom to examine the response of policymakers to the real exchange
   rate. We have three main findings. First, policymakers respond to real
   exchange rate misalignment rather than to the real exchange rate itself.
   Second, policymakers ignore small deviations of the exchange rate; they
   only respond to real exchange under-valuations of more than 4\% and
   over-valuations of more than 5\%. Third, the response of policymakers to
   inflation is smaller when the exchange rate is over-valued and larger
   when it is under-valued. None of these responses is allowed for in the
   widely used linear Taylor-type rules, suggesting that monetary policy is
   better analysed using a more sophisticated model, such as the one
   suggested in this paper.},

Abstract = {In this paper we analyze the dynamic conditional correlations between
   GEE stock markets (also known as countries from Vysehrad Group - V4) and
   developed European stock markets, with German DAX utilized as a
   benchmark. Our methodology is based on the DCC MV-GARCH approach. It is
   shown that the dynamic conditional correlations exhibit statistically
   significant growth after the integration of GEE countries to European
   Union, i.e. after the May 2004. The only index not exhibiting this trend
   is the Slovak SAX index.},

   relations and the cooptation of the bourgeoisie by a monarchical state
   which was still propping up the feudal regime, whereas Heller views
   mercantile activity and production increases as evidence of rising
   capitalism.},

   TRANSGRESSION},
Journal = {ESTUDIOS CONSTITUCIONALES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {8},
Number = {2},
Pages = {31-48},
Abstract = {Constitutionalism has posed, from the beginning, a claim for controlling
   the power of the state, through the formulation of the rule of law,
   understood as a set of rules that apply to all the integrants of the
   constitutional game. However, such a pretension carries with it, also
   from the beginning, an irresoluble problem that appears recurrently
   within the heart of constitutionalism: the necessity of universalism
   that, however, can only aspire to be a precarious generality, due to the
   permanent presence of the exception. This, instead, gives rise to a
   permanent cycle of transgression, which would pose the law in the side
   of slavery rather than freedom. This paper analyses this problem by
   reviewing not only the classic sources but also and importantly by
   analyzing the thesis of contemporary authors in this respect, such as
   Badiou, Zizek and Agamben.},

Abstract = {Recently, research revolving around blogs has flourished. Usually,
   academics illustrate what blogs are, motivations to blog, and, only to
   some extent, their role in politics. Along these lines, we examine the
   impact of digital politics by looking specifically at blog readers.
   Although blog readers might be considered at the forefront of a new
   technological revolution, and people have speculated about their
   participatory habits both online and off, little research has
   specifically looked at this growing proportion of the population. This
   article models factors that predict traditional and online forms of
   participation, presenting a portrait of a new type of political
   advocate.},

Journal = {ETHICS \& GLOBAL POLITICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {3},

Pages = {255-275},
Abstract = {This paper addresses the 2008 Russian Georgian conflict in the context
   of the post-Soviet spatial order, approached in terms of Carl Schmitt's
   theory of nomos and Giorgio Agamben's theory of the state of exception.
   The `five-day war' was the first instance of the violation by Russia of
   the integrity of the post-Soviet spatial order established in the
   Belovezha treaties of December 1991. While from the beginning of the
   postcommunist period Russia functioned as the restraining force in the
   post-Soviet realm, the 2008 war has made further recourse to this
   function impossible, plunging the post-Soviet space into the condition
   of anomie, or the state of exception. This paper interprets this
   disruptive policy in the post-Soviet space as the continuation of the
   domestic political process of the `management of anomie,' which has
   characterized the entire postcommunist period. In the conclusion, we
   address the implications of the transformation of the international
   order into the ethos of anomie for rethinking the ethical dimension of
   global politics.},

Series = {Studies in Law Politics and Society},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {52},

Abstract = {This chapter proposes that corporate lawyers be studied as committed to
   their clients, asking how they advance exercises of power by those whom
   they have chosen to represent. Currently, corporate lawyers are studied
   as independent from their clients, asking how they resist client
   demands. Such research continues despite repeated findings that
   corporate lawyers are not independent. This chapter explains the
   puzzling persistence of independence by cultural understandings of both
   professionalism and law. It recovers a submerged historic voice in which
   corporate lawyers are judged by their position in a network of
   relations. It argues that it was the organization of the corporate law
   firm as a factory which allowed it to become a professional ideal.
   Market competition has led corporate law firms to move away from a
   factory model to one in which commitment to clients, not independence
   from them, is the organizing principle.},

Abstract = {National borders in the eastern Himalaya region exhibit pressures of
   modernisation transition between two powerful emerging nation-states.
   The research question concerns under what circumstances borders are
   maintained. Consideration falls on the role of physical features,
   borders as cultural identity markers, and passes as transgressive
   spaces, negotiated through historical shifts in population and politics.
   A geopolitical history of boundary contestations in this region
   indicates the role of passes as conduits of political and cultural
   flows. Power relations bound space that cultural preservation makes
   worth delimiting.},

Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Pages = {606-627},
Abstract = {This article challenges popular claims about the capacity for
   microfinance to reduce poverty and empower women in the global South.
   Instead, I posit microfinance as a contradictory development tool, one
   that creates possibilities for both the contestation and continuation of
   unequal social relations at multiple scales. The article is divided into
   two major sections. I begin by examining the assumptions embedded in
   mainstream financial mappings of global space since the 1980s. In
   particular, I show how they privilege the transnational mobility of
   corporate capital and elide the everyday, place-based work of social
   reproduction. I examine the expansion and commercialisation of
   microfinance in this context, as an alternative mechanism for enabling
   poor households to continue meeting their everyday needs by taking on
   more debt. In the second section, I draw on fieldwork in Andhra Pradesh,
   India, to show how these interlocking macro/micro financial flows
   interact with regional social histories to shape and differentiate
   people's mobility `on the ground' according gender, caste, and class. I
   conclude by suggesting how a critical geopolitics framework can help
   formulate new questions about microfinance as a development strategy.},

Abstract = {Objective
   In 1975, the Puerto Rican community successfully sued the New York City
   Department of Education, mandating the city to provide bilingual
   education to its Spanish-speaking English learner (EL) students. The
   settlement, known as the ``Aspira Consent Decree,{''} has been amended
   over time to include EL students of all language groups and now requires
   public schools that have at least 15 students of the same language group
   in two contiguous grades to offer bilingual education. Yet observational
   studies of bilingual education classrooms in the city document that
   Spanish-speaking EL students may be the only language group that
   receives native-language instruction, while students from other language
   groups who are enrolled in bilingual education primarily receive English
   instruction.
   Method
   I use this difference in treatment dosage to estimate the effect of
   bilingual education on the time that it takes students to learn English.
   Results and Conclusions
   Students who enroll in bilingual education classrooms learn English less
   quickly, but the effect of bilingual education is the same for
   Spanish-speaking and other students, implying that negative selection
   mechanisms are at work.},

   redistricting and voting rights, who has testified as an expert witness
   on behalf of both political parties and for many of the leading civil

   U.S. Department of Justice. He has twice been employed by the Special
   Master appointed by the Federal Court, Southern District of New York, to
   be involved in the voting rights aspects of congressional redistricting
   plans for the State of New York. His research has been cited in nearly a
   dozen Supreme Court redistricting decisions, including Thornburg v.
   Gingles ( where he was the principal expert for the prevailing side in
   the trial in federal district court), and in Georgia v. Ashcroft. Work

Abstract = {With its Books project, Google has made an unprecedented effort to
   aggregate a comprehensive public-access collection of the world's books.
   If successful, Google's collection would become the world's largest and
   most broadly accessible public book collection-indeed, project leaders
   have frequently spoken of their desire to create a ``universal
   library{''} (Toobin 2007). Still, the Google ``library{''} would differ
   from established contexts for the provision of free, public access to
   reading materials-like public libraries-along several policy-related
   dimensions, of which perhaps the most glaring is its treatment of reader
   privacy. This paper teases out the specific differences in reader
   privacy protections between the American public library and Google
   Books, and what those differences might mean for the values and goals
   that such contexts have historically embodied. Our analysis is
   structured by Helen Nissenbaum's ``contextual integrity decision
   heuristic{''} (2009), which focuses on revealing changes in
   informational norms and transmission principles between prevailing and
   novel settings and practices. Based on this analysis, we recommend a
   two-pronged approach to alleviating the threats to reader privacy posed
   by Google Books: both data policy modifications within Google itself and
   inscription of privacy protections for online reading into federal or
   international law.},

Abstract = {This article challenges both the ``gentlemanly capitalist{''} thesis and
   ``official mind{''} interpretation of the 1882 British occupation of
   Egypt. The former fails to adequately consider the political character
   of the Anglo-French financial Control overturned by the Urabist revolt
   in February 1882. The latter overstates the significance of the Suez
   Canal as both trigger and justification for military intervention. The
   article argues that the primary motivation behind the Egyptian
   occupation was the vindication of British prestige, vis-a-vis the
   Continental Powers, but especially in India and in the ``East{''} by
   suppressing the threat to ``civilised{''} order posed by the Urabist
   revolt. The protection of the Suez Canal and British financial and trade
   interests were secondary and derivative.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to expand civil-military and military
   health research's concepts of stress with the addition of a theoretical
   construct of the concept known as ``cultural stress.{''} Military
   research often discusses combat and operational stress and its effect on
   soldiers but does not address unique culturally induced stressors
   created by the modern military's interaction with indigenous
   populations. Civilian research discusses stress as it relates to
   ``culture shock{''} but does not account for unique pressures facing
   servicemen in both peacetime and wartime environments. This article
   synthesizes these concepts to produce a new conceptual basis of
   ``cultural stress{''} from which further empirical research can be
   conducted.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the influence of the shadow economy on corruption
   and vice versa. We hypothesize that corruption and the shadow economy
   are substitutes in high income countries while they are complements in
   low income countries. The hypotheses are tested for a cross-section of
   98 countries. Our results show that there is no robust relationship
   between corruption and the size of the shadow economy when
   perceptions-based indices of corruption are used. Employing an index of
   corruption based on a structural model, however, corruption and the
   shadow economy are complements in countries with low income, but not in
   high income countries.},

Abstract = {The analysis of media policy usually, and understandably, focuses on
   visible instances of policy action: of government intervention,
   regulatory activity, civil society engagement, and corporate
   initiatives. Less frequently considered is the process by which certain
   issues, frames, and proposals are neglected inside decision-making
   structures. This article reflects on the relationship between
   ``industrial activism{''} and policy silences in relation to government
   desire to secure a digital communications infrastructure for the
   twenty-first century. It argues that policy analysts need to look beyond
   immediate and visible instances of decision making in the media field
   and examine the ideological processes of exclusion and marginalization
   that distort media policy making and undermine the emergence of
   alternative paradigms and policy outcomes.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on the anti-Jewish riots that took place in the
   spring and summer of 1898 in the western counties of the Habsburg
   province of Galicia, today divided between Poland and Ukraine. More than
   5000 Polish peasants and townspeople were arrested, thousands were
   tried, and many received long prison sentences. An increasingly strident
   Catholic anti-Semitism, rumor, mass political mobilization, and actions
   urged and taken by the various levels of the Habsburg state - the
   central ministries in Vienna; the office of the Galician governor in the
   provincial capital of Lemberg; military and police forces on the ground;
   local officials in western Galicia - all affected the outbreak and
   course of the violence. The article argues that the riots were not
   simply a manifestation of rural backwardness, but rather should be
   understood in the context of the arrival of mass politics in the
   Habsburg countryside.},

Abstract = {In recent years there has been a debate about the extent to which
   democratization implies protection of the environment. This article
   offers an exemplary case of this debate, exploring the theoretical links
   between democracy and environmental protection advanced by Walker
   (1999): accountability, development and participation. The site of the
   study is a Mexican native village, one of many incorporated into the
   metropolis, Mexico City. The city is faced with the challenge to supply
   an expanding population of some 20 million with housing, clean water and
   oxygen. The forest in the common property belonging to the original
   inhabitants is formally protected with logging bans and a rigorous Land
   Use Plan, yet illegal sales of this communal land to new settlers result
   in irregular settlements which now contain one quarter of the village's
   inhabitants. In 1997 local elections were reinstated in Mexico City,
   after a suspension of nearly 70 years. Although the governing party in
   the city promoted the protective Land Use Plan, the party's local
   politicians promised to regularize the zone in exchange for votes from
   the irregular settlers. These dynamics are explored in the context of
   everyday political practices in the village. The struggles over material
   and symbolic resources are analyzed in terms of force fields with
   multiple actors, making visible the ways in which democratic elections
   alone cannot prevent the ongoing deforestation caused by irregular
   settlements. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The article designates certain current key features of British political
   communication, contrasting them with their counterparts two decades
   earlier. It specifies some systemic sources of those developments, which
   may be common (or becoming so) in other competitive democracies. It
   argues why this matters: A Machiavellian view of political communication
   is increasingly emerging, so emphasising an instrumental pursuit of
   power that citizenship is in danger of becoming little more than a form
   of noncommercial consumption. Finally, it proposes some institutional
   changes intended to counteract these disturbing latter-day trends.},

Abstract = {This is a study of religious schism. The purpose of the research is to
   explore the nature and causes of religious segmentation and realignment.
   A model of religious schism is developed and illustrated with reference
   to many different religions. The model is then directly applied to
   Islamic history. Schism occurs because of innovations in dogma or
   practice. These innovations must appeal to demanders of the religious
   product. However, the innovations themselves may be driven by
   organizational conflicts within firms supplying religion. A special
   situation is created when schism occurs within a state-supported
   supplier of religion. Our study leads us to revisit the debate between
   Hume and Smith over the effect of state religion. We side with Smith.},

   be a winner. This type of rank-order competition has the advantage that
   it can eliminate the negative externality a group's performance imposes
   on other groups. However, it has the disadvantage that incentives to
   outperform others are absent, and therefore it does not eliminate
   equilibria where all groups cooperate at an equal but low level. We find
   that all-can-win competition produces a universal increase in
   cooperation and benefits a majority of individuals if the incentive to
   compete is sharp. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {U.K. Reserve Forces, principally the Territorial Army (TA), have been
   increasingly used since the end of the cold war, but there have been
   some concerns about their mental health problems and also possible
   unwillingness to remain in service. This article reports on the
   retention issues of 191 TA personnel who deployed to Iraq from 2003 to
   2006. Qualitative data were thematically analyzed from three
   complementary studies. The authors found that, in 2003, negative aspects
   of Army organizational culture were reported as the prime reasons for TA
   personnel wishing to leave the military. In particular, Reservists
   reported their being unaccepted and underutilized. In contrast, by 2006,
   TA personnel were generally reporting being satisfied with their work as
   a Reservist and felt integrated with Regular colleagues. Those who
   stated they wanted to leave the military now reported it was primarily
   because of poor military family welfare support. These results suggest
   that although the British Army appears to have successfully managed the
   changing role and integration of the TA on operations, family welfare
   needs further consideration as an important influence on retention.
   Since the end of data collection for this study, new measures focusing
   on welfare have been introduced. Future work will assess the impact of
   these changes.},

Abstract = {This debate with William Beik and David Parker concerns whether a
   capitalist bourgeoisie developed in the ancien regime. Parker asserts
   that, in 1789, this class at best was new and unfledged. Beik claims
   that it is unhistorical to speak of its existence. Addressing their
   arguments, I re-iterate that the existence of a capitalist bourgeoisie
   was of long standing. It emerged from the sixteenth century onwards,
   buoyed by primitive accumulation and strengthened itself even in the
   face of the so-called offensive of rent under seventeenth-century
   absolutism.},

Pages = {305-325},
Abstract = {The article deals with the export credit promotion in the Czech
   Republic. The econometric analysis of the gravity model of Czech trade
   shows that the credit support provided by specialized government agency,
   Czech Export Bank, has a positive but statistically weak influence on
   export. The other determinants of the Czech export in our model are GDP,
   distance, gross fixed capital formation, and policy risk. The comparison
   of estimated tax revenues from the supported projects with government
   subsidies provided to the Czech Export Bank shows that export promotion
   does not create a financial burden for the government budget. The
   budgetary costs of export credit support are offset by the tax revenues
   generated by supported export.},

Abstract = {Due to the existing crisis, some hegemonic ideas about the role of the
   State, its functions, what should be. and the question of the
   responsibility of administration, have been refuted. If years before the
   international institutions and the central Governs insisted on the need
   to promote the minimum State which is separated from the market, now the
   State has appeared as the necessary guarantor of the financial system.
   However, that which is supposed to be a contradiction of the older way
   of thinking should be understand as a narrative continuity of the
   contemporary policy An historic genealogic review through the different
   discursive traditions that make up the meta-discourse of the
   administration shows that, among the pluralities of ideas which support
   each narrative tradition, the nodal points of the general discourse of
   the administration remain the same the consolidation of the capitalism,
   the naturalization of the liberal democracies as the only possibilities
   to carry out good governance, the need to legitimate the market as a
   principal political actor, which must be protected Within this
   framework, the paper suggests the need to re-think the Science of the
   Administration though theoretical-political parameters that incorporates
   the rhetorical good judgement and avoid the possibility of falling into
   the typical limited conceptions of the vigilant democracy.},

   Human Rights, specially in the cases ``Almonacid Arellano{''} and
   ``Trabajadores Cesados del Congreso{''}, disposes that the national
   judges must consider not valid the domestic norms that infringe the
   American Convention of Human Rights, or the jurisprudence of the
   Interamerican Court. That control is an important instrument in order to
   edify an interamerican ius commune about human and constitutional
   rights. Its success depends on the legitimacy of the resolutions of the
   Interamerican Court, and the disposition of the national tribunals.},

Abstract = {This paper aims at studying the cinema demand in France from 1975 to
   2004. The relative weight of the explanatory variables is examined
   (price, income, competition coming form both television and video),
   which enables to see how cinema's perception changed in people's mind.
   The obtained price elasticity made us consider cinema as pretty close to
   the ``higher performing arts{''} of Throsby {[}1994]. The income
   elasticity of demand reinforces this point of view, as it classifies
   cinema as a luxury good. Regarding television and video recording, we
   obtain significant results in the long run. They both have a negative
   impact on cinema attendance. They might have become more popular ways to
   watch a movie, making the cinema only available for some sections of
   population. Finally, it's seems that cinema became a luxury good. It
   lost the popular status it had kept for many years.},

Title = {Members of Parliament: Equal Competitors for Media Attention? An
   Analysis of Personal Contacts Between MPs and Political Journalists in
   Five European Countries},
Journal = {POLITICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {27},
Number = {3},
Pages = {310-325},
Abstract = {Power relations between politicians and journalists are often depicted
   as an ongoing tango with one actor leading the other. This study
   analyzes interactions between politicians and journalists not by posing
   the question of who leads whom, but rather by investigating which
   politicians are invited to dance in the first place, and which are
   better positioned to take the lead. Building upon theories and past
   research into press-government relations, comparative politics, and an
   economic perspective on journalist-source relations, three groups of
   hypotheses on a personal, party, and political system level are derived
   and tested using a unique survey with members of parliament (MPs) in
   five democratic corporatist countries (Belgium, The Netherlands, Sweden,
   Norway, Denmark). The results display a similar pattern in all five
   countries where parliamentary experience and institutional position
   increase the frequency of contacts that MPs have with journalists. While
   these party variables have a more modest influence on the frequency of
   contacts, it is also shown that there are clear differences between
   countries attributed to parliament size in general and higher inter-MP
   competition in particular.},

Title = {The Moral Geopolitics of Exported Spatial Development: Revisiting
   Israeli Involvement in Africa},
Journal = {GEOPOLITICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Pages = {441-461},
Abstract = {This article will analyse Israel's past involvement (1956-1973) in
   Africa, in the context of a wider theoretical conceptualisation of the
   role of spatial development in the construction of moral geopolitics.
   Re-thinking the relevance of postcolonial critiques, the paper examines
   the political and institutional setup underlying Israeli involvement in
   development in Africa, documenting the scope of this phenomenon by
   looking at policy makers, professionals and institutions, studying the
   role of spatial development and planning in the design of Israel's
   policies, and analysing the actual results of such projects. Despite
   considerable Israeli involvement and investment in spatial development
   projects in postcolonial Africa, the existing literature on the subject
   is narrow, dealing mainly with pragmatic political interests, and there
   is hardly any structured documentation of Israel's exported spatial
   development to Africa - its scope, qualities, successes or failures.
   Moreover, in the wider literature the analysis of spatial development as
   oexportedo knowledge is perceived as a by-product of the polity between
   Empires and the Margins - an assumption that this paper aims to
   question. This article is dedicated to the memory of Sara Khinski, with
   whom my journey to Africa began.},

Abstract = {Robust institutional change is difficult to achieve. However, it is more
   difficult for some countries than others. We use data on 69 countries
   between 1870 and 2000 to show that political instability does not always
   affect growth outcomes. We then develop a simple model to explain this
   fact in which the likelihood that ``good'' institutions are abandoned
   during periods of political uncertainty depends on the opportunity cost
   of doing so. We operationalize our model by using contract intensive
   money as a proxy for this initial investment in growth-enhancing
   institutions. Cross-sectional and panel growth regressions support the
   model's predictions.},

   reveals considerable similarities in the volume of news coverage of
   President George W. Bush and the Iraq War on both sides of the border.
   Indeed, these data suggest the possibility of an international two-step
   news flow, where changes in the volume of coverage on NBC frequently
   were reflected in the news coverage on CBC and CTV during the following
   days. It is suggested here that this may be attributable to the
   limitations faced by international reporters, resulting in a ``two-step
   flow{''} that should be relevant not just for Canadian reporters in the
   United States, but also for many international reporters elsewhere.},

Abstract = {Multinational military missions increasingly rely on the recruitment of
   host nation interpreters. The purpose of this research note is to
   explore the relationship between the soldiers and these local
   translators during the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF)
   operation in Afghanistan. The findings suggest that more attention to
   the development of cross-cultural competencies among military personnel
   and a greater awareness of the precarious dynamics between the two
   parties may improve the cooperation between the soldiers and the local
   translators.},

Title = {Towards a More Participatory Style of Election Campaigning: The Impact
   of Web 2.0 on the UK 2010 General Election},
Journal = {POLICY AND INTERNET},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {2},
Number = {3},
Pages = {69-98},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Web 2.0 has heralded a networked, participatory and conversational
   culture reaching beyond national borders and cultures, reshaping
   communicational hierarchies and thus creating a new set of communicative
   rules. Web 2.0 offers political actors a potentially effective means of
   building a relationship with activists, supporters and possibly floating
   voters. The cost, however, is that the interactive nature of these
   technologies requires some loss of control of political discourse.
   Election campaigning tends to be synonymous with top-down, persuasive
   and propaganda-style communication which aims to win the support of
   voters crucial for the victory of a candidate or party. While this
   remains as the dominant paradigm for understanding campaigns, the use of
   Web 2.0 tools, features and platforms challenges this notion. Emerging
   in 2005, Web 2.0 ushered in a networked, participatory culture to be
   observed online with tools facilitating asynchronous or symmetrical
   conversations to take place within a variety of online environments.
   This participatory and conversational culture, like the Internet itself,
   reaches beyond national borders and cultures, reshaping communicational
   hierarchies, thus creating a new set of communicative rules. Web 2.0
   applications raise significant questions for political parties and
   individual candidates in terms of how they might use the Internet for
   building relationships with activists, supporters and possibly floating
   voters. Through the systematic measurement of the usage of Web 2.0
   tools, features and platforms-embedded within or linked to-from the
   websites of six UK parties we analyse the use of the Internet, and in
   particular Web 2.0 tools, features and platforms, during the 2010
   general election in the UK. We find that differing strategies emerge
   between parties, with some withdrawing from interactive feature use.
   Where Web 2.0 features are employed they are largely within discrete
   areas aimed at building contact with communities of supporters, but
   largely these are geared towards electoral objectives and not harnessing
   the collective wisdom of party networks to inform policy.},

Abstract = {Broadband is poised to transform many sectors of the economy in the
   United States. Indeed, the federal government, via the President,
   Congress, and the Federal Communications Commission, has identified this
   technology as a key tool for realizing an array of ``national
   purposes,{''} including fundamental changes to how healthcare, energy,
   education, and an array of other services are delivered to and consumed
   by citizens. However, as broadband begins to inure itself into the
   business models of services that are largely regulated by the states,
   novel questions regarding the proper scope of regulatory federalism-that
   is, the ways in which federal and state government share oversight of a
   wide range of industries, from telecommunications to energy to
   healthcare-are likely to arise. This article examines the historical
   balance of federalism in the regulation of communications services,
   healthcare, and energy, identifies novel issues that have arisen and
   that are likely to arise as broadband is used to transform these
   services, and proposes a framework for efficiently and effectively
   addressing these issues.},

Abstract = {Objectives
   Conflicting arguments exist in the literature about whether
   associational involvement can enhance people's social resources
   (operationalized as the extent to which people have nearby social
   networks they can rely on). We aim to test these arguments.
   Methods
   We use two-wave panel data. These are needed, as a causal relationship
   is presumed: participation as antecedent and social resources as
   outcome. To test this relationship, we compared two groups: respondents
   who became members of an association (between the two waves) and
   respondents who remained uninvolved.
   Results
   We found no general membership effect. However, starting volunteer work
   showed a small, positive effect on the growth of social resources.
   Furthermore, membership effects were found among groups with fewer
   possibilities of acquiring social resources in other contexts (the
   elderly, people without a partner, and ethnic minorities).
   Conclusions
   In line with the more skeptical ideas about voluntary associations, the
   effects of voluntary association participation seem small. However,
   people differ in the extent to which they profit from this
   participation.},

Abstract = {The securitization of immigration has led to increased reliance on
   border enforcement, detention, and deportation to control unauthorized
   movements. Based on a case study of the ways that Salvadoran immigrants
   to the United States have experienced these tactics, this paper analyzes
   the spatial implications of current enforcement strategies. As movement
   across borders becomes more difficult for the unauthorized, national
   territories become zones of confinement. This carceral quality is a
   dimension of national territory in that undocumented and temporarily
   authorized migrants cannot exit their countries of residence without
   losing territorially-conferred rights, while if they are deported, their
   countries of origin become extensions of the detention centers they
   occupied before exit. This transformation of national spaces is
   accompanied by internal differentiation, as interior enforcement
   confines migrants to subnational spaces where they must remain to avoid
   detection or harassment. Securitization thus entails both
   extraterritoriality, that is the extension of U.S. legal regimes into
   foreign territories, and intra-territoriality, or the operation of
   different legal regimes within national territories. The paper also
   highlights the ways that securitization contributes to
   multidimensionality, such that spatial locations are rendered ambiguous,
   both inside and outside at the same time. Finally, the paper considers
   how these spatial transformations redefine citizenship and belonging.

Abstract = {In replying to Steven Wall's and Andrew Lister's thoughtful essays on my
   account of justificatory liberalism in this issue, I respond to many of
   their specific criticisms while taking the opportunity to explicate the
   foundations of justificatory liberalism. Justificatory liberalism takes
   seriously the moral requirement to justify all claims of authority over
   others, as well as all coercive interferences with their lives. If we do
   so, although we are by no means committed to libertarianism, we find
   that that many of our cherished values, moral intuitions, and political
   aspirations no longer ground the range of authority over others many of
   us would claim. In this sense, justificatory liberalism is a theory of
   limited authority and limited government - which is what a genuinely
   liberal theory must be.},

Abstract = {Objective
   This article tests if welfare generosity is related to abortion rates,
   allowing effects to vary by program type and abortion policy context.
   Methods
   Measuring welfare generosity with respect to cash assistance, family
   caps, Medicaid, child care and family leave policies, I estimate fixed
   effects models of abortion rates in 48 U.S. states over 1987-2000.
   Results
   More expansive family leave laws are associated with lower abortion
   rates. In states that do not enforce any of three key abortion policies,
   increased Medicaid eligibility and child care spending predict higher
   abortion rates. For Medicaid, this relationship diminishes and reverses
   itself as states add abortion regulations.
   Conclusion
   Welfare state expansions may help reduce abortion, but programs' effects
   are not unambiguously pro-natalist. Estimated impacts of welfare
   generosity on abortion rates vary by program, and some with abortion
   policy context.},

Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {91},
Number = {1},
Pages = {129-142},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Objective
   Several studies have examined the impact of race and the value of
   baseball cards, but few have investigated the role of race on football
   card values.
   Methods
   Data were derived from 1,279 black and white football players who were
   selected to participate in at least one Pro Bowl and who started their
   careers between 1946, the year professional football in the United
   States became racially integrated when Kenny Washington played in a game
   for the Los Angeles Rams, and 1988, the last year of Topps' monopoly in
   the football card market. Data for each player's race, value of their
   rookie card, card availability, card vintage, performance, Hall of Fame
   status, and position were obtained.
   Results
   When controlling for other factors, race has no effect on the value of
   players' rookie cards, whereas card vintage exerted the most influence
   on the value of players' cards.
   Conclusions
   Football card values are largely driven by objective markers, supporting
   the conclusion that the market performs pretty much as expected for a
   collector market. Speculations on the absence of race effect,
   limitations related to the study, and suggestions for future research
   are offered.},

Abstract = {In the social capital literature a distinction is made between trust
   expressed in people in general, and trust in people who are known to us
   personally. In this article we investigate the frames of reference
   respondents make use of when answering two commonly used interpersonal
   trust questions. Half of our sample was administered a version which
   asks respondents whether ``most people{''} can be trusted. The other
   half of the sample was administered an alternative version of the
   question, in which the object of trust is restricted to ``people in your
   local area.{''} Immediately after answering the trust question all
   respondents were asked to report, in their own words, who came to mind
   when formulating their response. Counter to the widespread assumption
   that these questions measure generalized trust, we find that a
   substantial number of respondents report having thought about people who
   are known to them personally. Furthermore, respondents who report having
   thought about individuals who are known to them also report
   substantially higher levels of trust than people who say they thought
   about abstract categories such as ``people in general.{''} Our results
   suggest that apparent differences in trust across question formats and
   groups within the general public derive, at least in part, from
   heterogeneity in question interpretation.},
