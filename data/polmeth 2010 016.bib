Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY \& POLITICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Pages = {3-21},
Abstract = {This article describes data on how central government officials think
   about the use of information and communication technology (ICT) in
   central government. It focuses primarily on e-government, but features
   of e-democracy are also covered. The perceived effects of ICT on the
   economy, service quality, transparency, coordination, political and
   administrative control, and user participation are described. It also
   aims to explain variations in such perceived effects. The major findings
   are, first, that government-to-government tools are the most widespread,
   while e-democracy tools have received little attention. Second, the
   perceived effects are strongest regarding better public services,
   increased transparency, and internal coordination and administrative
   control, and weakest when it comes to coordination with local government
   and political control. Third, the most important set of independent
   variables explaining the variations in perceived effects of ICT are the
   actual use of ICT tools among civil servants, as well as structural
   features such as administrative level and tasks, demographic features
   (e.g., age), and cultural features, such as having an efficiency
   oriented culture.},

Abstract = {In this work, after revising the origins and characteristics of the
   jurisdictional reform of the year 2005, in particular, the new features
   of the writ of non-applicability, we analyze some problems of
   constitutional design related to the link between the latter and the
   writ of unconstitutionality. Once that task is completed, we analyze a
   group of paradigmatic decisions by the Constitutional Court that suggest
   that this organ has still much work to do in order to develop a refined
   understanding of the juridical nature of the writ of non-applicability
   and its differences with the writ of unconstitutionality. This
   represents an urgent matter, not just because the coherent articulation
   of the constitutional text is one the most basic roles of constitutional
   adjudication, but also due to the centrality that the writ of
   non-applicability has acquired in the Constitutional Court's
   adjudicative work.},

Abstract = {The Internet blurs the paradigmatic divide between State and market
   coordination. Its decentralized architecture does not appear to allow
   for central planning in the public interest as typically conducted by
   States and State-based organizations. Yet, the Internet Corporation for
   Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) sets public policies in managing the
   Internet's Domain Name System (DNS) without the traditional limitations
   on power characteristic of modern States. Its central coordination of
   the global DNS does not appear to fit a market model either since its
   alleged DNS monopoly seems to have deprived the Internet user from the
   free choice that characterizes market coordination.
   This chapter sets out to identify the effects of globalization on the
   execution of constitutional responsibilities and shows that private
   governance in the public interest can be a viable alternative for
   State-based institutions. This inquiry into the DNS shows that the
   inextricable bond between the State and its subjects created through the
   State's monopoly on central coordination in the public interest has lost
   its self-evident status. In addition, it shows that, contrary to the
   prevalent scholarly view on the matter, ICANN is primarily kept in check
   by market mechanisms and has developed a governance model well suited to
   fit the economic reality underlying its operations.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes international migration when migrants invest part of
   their income in their country of origin We show that a non total
   migratory equilibrium exists Exogenous shocks such as an increase in
   migrant income lead to an increase in optimal invested remittances per
   migrant and a higher wage in the country of origin Yet the net effect on
   the equilibrium number of migrants is positive Hence in equilibrium
   emigrants optimal Invested remittances and number of migrants are
   positively related We use data from twenty five countries in Eastern
   Europe and Central Asia in 2000 to test for this implication of our
   model OLS and bootstrap estimates reveal a positive elasticity of the
   number of migrants with respect to estimated invested remittances per
   migrant in the range of {[}03 07] (C) 2010 Elsevier BV All rights

Abstract = {This research looks at how foreign direct investment (FDI) in a small
   open economy compares with that of larger countries. I apply several
   specifications of the knowledge-capital model to unique FDI data from
   the isolated country of Iceland, allowing for comparison with previous
   analysis of larger and similarly open economies. Using this together
   with other techniques, I seek to explain investment determinants by
   geography, economic size and skilled labor availability. The results of
   these analysis show that popular specifications do not accurately
   predict the effects for a small country case.},

Title = {Honor among thieves: Cooperation as a strategic response to functional
   unpleasantness},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {26},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {351-362},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The assumption of self-interested behavior makes it difficult to explain
   cooperation among strangers. Economics experiments and game-theoretic
   analyses suggest that cooperation can arise from a willingness to punish
   noncooperative behavior, even at personal cost. Such behavior is often
   based on the notion that people who punish noncooperators value
   cooperation in itself. We show, by contrast, that people who like to
   cheat but also punish other cheaters - people who are Unpleasant, but
   who also have a strategic desire to avoid being punished themselves -
   can form the basis for widespread, even complete cooperation in society.
   Ultimately, such Unpleasant but strategic types can create conditions
   where all cooperate even though everyone would prefer to cheat. (C) 2009

Abstract = {I define and classify moral (or altruistic) behaviour and discuss the
   necessity of moral behaviour for the functioning of a market economic
   and a democratic political order. I also evaluate claims that moral
   behaviour is unnecessary. Moral behaviour can only be stable if certain
   conditions hold, including most importantly that moral requirements for
   citizens not be too high; only a minimum standard of morality can be
   demanded if many citizens are expected to comply. Finally. I point to
   some problems of relying on moral behaviour. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Many countries today face the challenges posed by their ethnic and
   religious diversity. This article comparatively analyzes how defining
   nation in Russia and Turkey affects what groups constitute religious
   minorities and what their prospects of integration into the Russian and
   Turkish societies are. It conceptualizes religious minorities as those
   religious groups that are excluded from the prevailing and
   institutionalized definitions of nation. This article studies what role
   religion, comprising Orthodox Christianity, and Sunni Islam,
   respectively, has played historically and until nowadays in Russia and
   Turkey in the definitions of their national identities and what kind of
   religious minorities each of these definitions created. It argues that a
   position of religious minorities depends not only on the informal
   association of national identity of the majority with certain religion,
   but also on the institutionalized support for the dominant religion by
   the ruling political forces.},

Abstract = {Both the choice between ``stick{''} and ``carrot{''} and the tension
   between ``control{''} and ``preservation of civil liberties{''}
   characterize the policy debate over counterterrorism. Arguing for the
   ``carrot and preservation of civil liberties{''} viewpoint, Frey and
   Rohner (Def. Peace Econ. 18(3):245-252, 2007) propose strategic
   reconstruction as an alternative to protection. Our paper provides a
   comparative analysis of these two policies. First, we study the
   rationality of the public's expectations, and we show that credible
   strategic reconstruction may deter terrorist attacks. Next, we derive
   conditions under which strategic reconstruction is more efficient than
   protection. Finally, we show that strategic reconstruction may reinforce
   the efficiency of protection.},

Abstract = {Although historiography has always considered the 10th of August 1809
   -date of the creation of the first Junta of Quito- as the symbolic date
   of Ecuadorian independence, this essay underlines the experience of the
   second Junta -created in September 1810 and defeated two years later- as
   a key transitional moment between the colonial and the republican eras.
   Whereas the 1809 Junta attempted to restore its supremacy on the
   territory of the Audiencia, the Junta of 1810 was created to fulfil
   another objective: restructuring a territory which was under a
   fragmentation process, due to the 1808 crises, to the peninsular events
   and to those that took place in the neighbouring regions.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRESS-POLITICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Pages = {319-343},

Abstract = {When political elites receive unfavorable news coverage, a common
   strategy is to attack the source. Past research suggests that attacks on
   the news media increase perceptions of media bias, but it remains
   unclear how this occurs. Using two experiments, the author examines how
   attacks on the news media increase perceptions of bias. For the
   experiments, all participants read news articles about elected
   officials, but some read an attack on the source. The author also
   manipulated the direction of the attack (liberal or conservative bias)
   and its placement before or after the article. The results suggest that
   elite attacks increase perceptions of bias in the news source, and this
   occurs even when the attack is read following the article. In addition,
   attacks were effective when they came from politicians in both parties,
   suggesting that Republicans and Democrats are able to influence
   perceptions of bias. In conclusion, the author argues that elite attacks
   are likely to benefit the attackers but weaken democratic
   accountability.},

Abstract = {At state and particularly in federal (or national) elections, Aboriginal
   Peoples in remote regions turn out to vote in low numbers. A number of
   hypotheses have been offered to explain the low voting participation of
   such constituencies. Some have asserted that Aboriginal Peoples do not
   wish to vote; others have suggested that ``first order{''} elections
   have low salience for Aboriginal Peoples, thereby depressing turnout.
   The low political efficacy thesis has also been proposed, as well as
   cultural and mechanical factors. We consider whether any of these
   hypotheses are plausible using data obtained in group interviews with
   twenty-nine Anangu Women in remote South Australia. On the basis of this
   fieldwork we consider means for stimulating turnout within this, and in
   similar, constituencies.},

Title = {The question of `the political' in critical geopolitics: Querying the
   `child soldier' in the `war on terror'},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {29},
Number = {5, SI},
Pages = {247-255},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {After two decades of scholarship on `critical geopolitics', the question
   of whether it is largely a discursive critique of prevailing knowledge
   production and geopolitical texts or critique with an implicit,
   normative politics of its own remains open. These positions are not
   incommensurate, and much scholarship on critical geopolitics does both.
   This paper analyzes critical geopoliticians' concern with this question
   in the present historical moment and probes the possibility of a
   post-foundational ethic as the basis for `the political' in critical
   geopolitics and beyond. Empirically, this paper explores these
   theoretical tensions within `critical geopolitics' by tracing the
   disparate fates of two young men, both child soldiers at the time of
   their capture. `Child soldier' is an unstable category subject to
   geopolitical valence and stigma during the `war on terror'. The
   deployment of extra-legal tactics and spaces of violence, such as those
   faced by detainees at Guantanamo Bay, point to the rise of biopolitics
   combined with geopolitics, illustrating the intersection of sovereignty
   and governmentality as important political fodder for critical
   geopolitics two decades after its inception. The stories of Canadian
   Omar Khadr, one of the youngest prisoners at Guantanamo and the only
   citizen of a Western state still held there, and Ismael Beall, a
   rehabilitated soldier who fought as a boy from Sierra Leone, illustrate
   too how geographical imagination strongly shapes access to provisions of
   international law and the victimized status of `child soldier' in
   particular. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {We exploit the time-series properties of charitable giving to provide
   additional insights into the relationship between charitable
   contributions and government spending. Cointegration tests reveal a
   significant long-run relationship between several categories of
   charitable giving and government spending. Granger causality tests
   provide evidence on the short-run giving and spending relationship.
   Evidence suggests that charitable contributions to education respond
   quite differently to state and local government education expenditures
   versus federal government expenditures. We argue that the government
   spending and charitable giving relationship depends on the source of
   government revenue, how this revenue is used, and the rational ignorance
   of private donors.},

Abstract = {This article offers a normative evaluation of the Christian Right's
   impact on American democracy. It argues that our response to the
   question of whether this movement enhances or diminishes democracy turns
   on our understanding of the ideal of democracy. When viewed as a
   participatory ideal, the Christian Right's mobilizing practices enhance
   democracy. When viewed as a deliberative ideal, the Christian Right's
   practices diminish the deliberative virtues of toleration and free and
   open debate. These conflicting assessments point to an important
   democratic paradox. They show that the very same practices that inspire
   the participatory virtues of active political engagement also incite the
   deliberative vices of intolerance and polarization. To address this
   paradox, I argue that we ought to strive for a balance between pure
   participation and pure deliberation. The primary problem with Christian
   Right organizations like Focus on the Family, I will argue. is that they
   tend to disrupt this balance. They inspire active participation at the
   expense of deliberation.},

Abstract = {How economic integration does affect the profile of firms' exports? Did
   euro introduction benefited to French exporters? And if so, how did they
   expand? We investigate these issues by using detailed French firm-level
   exports data, provided by the French customs. First, we find that French
   firms export disproportionately more to the most integrated destinations
   (European Union). When these destinations are considered, we find that
   more firms export more products, each year, as compared to less
   integrated regions. Hence, more individual shipments are registered,
   each year, for these destinations. The value of exports that is recorded
   for each individual shipment is also more important. In a second step,
   we quantify the effects of a greater integration due to the adoption of
   the euro in 1999. We find that the euro promoted French exports to
   eurozone destinations, as compared to similar destinations outside the
   eurozone. This effect is channeled mainly through the number of
   individual shipments. French firms increased the number of products they
   export, each year, to eurozone destinations. However, the number of
   exporters remained unaffected.},

Abstract = {Most industrial countries have traditionally subsidized the provision of
   higher education. Alternative financing schemes, which rely on larger
   contributions from students, are being increasingly adopted. Those based
   on income-contingent loans provide insurance against uncertain
   educational outcomes. We consider a unified framework where we analyze
   the following schemes: 1) the traditional tax-subsidy, 2) pure loans, 3)
   income-contingent loans with risk-sharing, and 4) income-contingent
   loans with risk-pooling. We focus on their insurance role and their
   effect on higher education participation. We show that an
   income-contingent loan with risk-pooling can induce the optimal level of
   participation provided that it covers both financial costs of education
   and forgone earnings. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The relationship among media, politicians, and the public has been
   studied a lot, especially how the media's portrayal of politics affects
   people's (cynical) attitudes. Scholars know little about the antecedent
   of this assumed spiral of cynicism: How cynical are politicians and
   journalists about each other and about politics? Based on a survey among
   Dutch politicians and political journalists, the research presented in
   this article tries to fill this gap. The results show that politicians
   are rather cynical about media and journalists, especially when they
   feel media are out to set the political agenda. journalists are equally
   cynical about politicians as the latter are about themselves, but it is
   a relative cynicism since it is lower than that of the general public.
   journalists are, however, convinced that most politicians are driven by
   what we call ``media salacity{''} a drive to get journalists' attention
   and coverage, a conviction shared, surprisingly, by the politicians
   themselves.},

Abstract = {This chapter proposes a research agenda for the study of large law firm
   culture and explains how the research would contribute to both legal
   ethics and organizational theory. It focuses on two sets of questions
   that are uniquely suited to investigation in large law firms. First:
   what is the significance of organizational culture, relative to that of
   professional networks and subgroups? To what extent does organizational
   membership shape lawyers' understandings about ``how things are
   done{''}? Second: how is organizational culture sustained? What are the
   mechanisms of cultural integration in volatile, multioffice firms? The
   chapter draws on a pilot study of law firm culture in one 500-lawyer
   firm.},

Abstract = {In December 1966 through January 1967, Harrison Salisbury of the New
   York Times wrote dispatches based on a visit to Hanoi that disputed the
   administration's claims that its highly accurate bombing did not hit
   civilian targets in North Vietnam. Administration officials, other
   journalists, and even his own paper challenged his reporting. Deemed
   unpatriotic, Salisbury was denied a Pulitzer Prize. This case study
   employs documents from the files of the New York Times, the CIA, and the
   Harrison Salisbury Papers at Columbia University, as well as content
   analysis of his coverage of Vietnam compared with other reporting by him
   that won a Pulitzer. The study shows how editorial standards of news
   sourcing become higher when correspondents challenge the official line.
   While illustrating factors that lead newspapers and reporters to index
   foreign news to the prevailing political consensus, it also demonstrates
   the limits of indexing and the conditions under which journalists may
   effectively challenge the official line.},

   CONSTITUTIONAL JURISDICTION AND AS BUDGET FOT THE INTERVENTION OF
   AMICUS CURIAE IN BRAZILIAN LAW},
Journal = {ESTUDIOS CONSTITUCIONALES},

Abstract = {The main purpose of this article is to introduce a discussion about the
   rule of the amicus curiae in brazilian law, considering as theoretical
   foundations the concepts of open and cultural Constitution and
   consequently of an ``open society of constitutional
   interpreters{''}-worked by Peter Haberle, those understood as basis that
   allows and demands an effective participation of citizens in the
   hermeneutical sphere and in the interpretation of constitutional
   contents, mainly centered in the notion of status activusprocessualis,
   considering that, in the context of a Democratic State of Law,
   participation becomes the main status, playing an essential rule in the
   concretization of public tasks and of fundamental rights, essentially in
   the context of a Constitution seen as a permanent open ended process. It
   is exactly in this perspective that the instrument of amicus curiae
   becomes an important procedural mechanism, once that it offers an
   institutional sphere of participation in process and jurisdiction,
   powering, in this way, the constitutional debate and contributing to an
   increase of decisions legitimacy in the ambit of democracy.},

Abstract = {The notion of the labour-aristocracy is one of the oldest Marxian
   explanations of working-class conservatism and reformism. Despite its
   continued appeal to scholars and activists on the Left, there is no
   single, coherent theory of the labour-aristocracy. While all versions
   argue working-class conservatism and reformism reflects the politics of
   a privileged layer of workers who share in `monopoly' super-profits,
   they differ on the sources of those super-profits: national dominance of
   the world-market in the nineteenth century (Marx and Engels),
   imperialist investments in the `colonial world'/global South (Lenin and
   Zinoviev), or corporate monopoly in the twentieth century (Elbaum and
   Seltzer). The existence of a privileged layer of workers who share
   monopoly super-profits with the capitalist class cannot be empirically
   verified. This essay presents evidence that British capital's dominance
   of key-branches of global capitalist production in the Victorian period,
   imperialist investment and corporate market-power can not explain
   wage-differentials among workers globally or nationally, and that
   relatively well-paid workers have and continue to play a leading role in
   radical and revolutionary working-class organisations and struggles. An
   alternative explanation of working-class radicalism, reformism, and
   conservatism will be the subject of a subsequent essay.},

Abstract = {Bertolt Brecht and Theodor NW. Adorno stand for opposing modes and
   stances within an artistic modernism oriented toward radical social
   transformation. In his 1962 essay `Commitment', Adorno advanced a biting
   critique of Brecht's work and artistic position. Adorno's arguments have
   often been dismissed but, surprisingly, are seldom closely engaged with.
   This paper assesses these two approaches that have been so central to
   twentieth-century debates in aesthetics: Brecht's dialectical realism
   and Adorno's sublime or dissonant modernism. It provides what still has
   been missing: a close reading and immanent critique of Adorno's case
   against Brecht. And it clarifies one methodological blind spot of
   Adorno's formalist conceptualisation of autonomy: he fails to provide
   the detailed analysis of context that his own dialectical method
   immanently calls for. The paper shows how and why Brecht's dialectical
   realism holds up under Adorno's attack, and draws conclusions for
   contemporary artistic practice.},

Abstract = {Digital studies on culture may be distinguished from cultural studies of
   the digital, at least in terms of method. This lecture takes up the
   question of the distinctiveness of ``digital methods{''} for researching
   Internet cultures. It asks, initially, should the methods of study
   change, however slightly or wholesale, given the specificity of the new
   medium? The larger digital methods project thereby engages with
   ``virtual methods,{''} the current, dominant ``e-science{''} approach to
   the study of the Internet, and the consequences for research of
   importing standard methods from the social sciences in particular. What
   kinds of contributions are made to digital media studies, and the
   Internet in particular, when traditional methods are imported from the
   social sciences and the humanities onto the medium? Which research
   opportunities are foreclosed? Second, I ask, what kinds of new
   approaches are worthwhile, given an emphasis on the ``natively
   digital{''} as opposed to digitization? The goal is also to change the
   focus of humanities and humanities computing away from the opportunities
   afforded by transforming ink into bits. The effort is to develop the
   study of natively digital objects (the link, the tag, etc.) and devices
   (engines and other recommendation machines) that make use of them. After
   critically reviewing existing approaches to the study of the digital,
   which largely import method onto the medium, I subsequently propose
   research strategies that follow the medium. How can one learn from
   methods in the medium, and repurpose them for social and cultural
   research? The lecture launches a novel strand of study: digital methods.},

Abstract = {In most industrialized countries, renewable energy is supported by
   policy schemes burden of which is distributed among taxpayers and energy
   consumers. Renewable sources of energy face a major problem because of
   their intermittency and that has not been adequately reflected in the
   discussions of their subsidies in the Czech Republic and in the analysis

Year = {2010},
Volume = {142},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {125-150},

Abstract = {Theories of political budget cycles have been contested because scholars
   find that incumbents can manipulate deficits in the pre-election period
   only if fiscal transparency is low. I argue that these findings do not
   generally rule out the possibility of fiscal electioneering. Governments
   may increase spending on highly visible policies. The composition of the
   budget serves as a second-best strategy. It increases political support
   without straining the budget balance. An empirical analysis of the West
   German states reveals alternative electoral budget strategies and
   ultimately point to the importance of analyzing how governments choose
   between alternative fiscal instruments.},

Abstract = {In this paper we consider the nature of local Nash equilibrium (LNE) for
   a model of the 2007 Duma election in Russia, using estimates of valence
   obtained from sociodemographic variables.
   We then extend this sociodemographic valence model by including
   institutional valences, the approval by voters of the various
   institutions, including the President, the Prime Minister, the State
   Duma and the Federation Council. We show by simulation that the vote
   maximizing LNE of this general stochastic model were not at the
   electoral origin. The dominant feature of the election was the influence
   of approval or disapproval of President Putin on each voter's political
   choice.},

   Potential for Territorial Expansion},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW},

Volume = {12},
Number = {4},
Pages = {505-532},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Whether China's rise as a great power will be peaceful or violent is a
   question that animates scholars and policymakers alike. Power transition
   theory and offensive realism reach pessimistic conclusions about China's
   potential for armed conflict because of the benefits of aggression.
   Nevertheless, applications of these theories to China's rise fail to
   examine the size and scope of these benefits and to compare them
   systematically to the costs of conflict that other scholars have
   identified. To fill this gap, this article applies different
   international relations theories to identify potential benefits in one
   defined issue area, territorial conflict, and then weighs these benefits
   against the likely costs. The potential benefits of territorial
   expansion are limited, a finding that weakens confidence in the
   predictions of power transition theory and offensive realism but
   increases confidence in more optimistic arguments about China's rise
   based on economic interdependence.},

Abstract = {There is a wealth of research into time series dynamics of bureaucratic
   control in the federal presidential system of the US, but no equivalent
   investigation in unitary parliamentary systems. This article proposes an
   approach for measurement of the effect of political interventions on
   bureaucratic outputs in British politics. It throws some light on tools
   of bureaucratic control that are associated with the fusion of
   legislative and executive powers in Britain's Westminster system. In
   contrast to the US, political control in the form of oversight or
   appointments is not required because government is able to intervene
   directly in bureaucratic activities through legislative, executive and
   administrative controls. It uses Box-Tiao time series models to analyse
   administration of the UK asylum system by the Immigration and
   Nationality Directorate of the Home Office.},

Abstract = {This essay asks whether dead bodies have human rights, and if so, what
   philosophical foundations those rights have. With equal importance, it
   considers how these rights would operate in a real-world area of human
   rights practice, the forensic exhumation of mass graves. It argues that
   human rights for the dead are philosophically unworkable and
   irreconcilable with the practical limitations of forensic work;
   therefore, we should not think of the dead as having human rights.
   However, this conclusion does not end discussion about what forensic
   investigators do for dead bodies. Rather, it makes room for a modest but
   rich sense of how exhumation can restore the identity, physical
   location, and care that have been denied to victims of atrocity.},

Title = {The geometry of security: Modeling interstate alliances as evolving
   networks},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {47},
Number = {6},
Pages = {697-709},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In this article, it is argued that interstate alliances function as
   public costly signals of state intentions to cooperate militarily, and
   as such, they should be expected to influence state expectations within
   dyads, between dyads, and across time. Accurate statistical modeling of
   interstate military alliances thus requires that researchers escape the
   assumption of independent units of observation, which is built into most
   of the statistical tools currently used by international relations
   scholars, as such models can be expected to produce unbiased parameter
   estimates in this domain only if the decisions to create and dissolve
   interstate alliances are formulated in isolated dyadic bubbles. The use
   of stochastic actor-oriented models, combined with Markov simulations of
   network evolution, is shown to be a productive alternative method of
   modeling interstate alliances, which allows the researcher to avoid the
   assumption of dyadic independence by incorporating theory-driven
   assumptions about patterns of extra-dyadic interdependence directly into
   the functional form of the statistical model. The results demonstrate
   that triadic patterns of amity and enmity exercise powerful influence
   over the selection of alliance partners and the evolution of the global
   alliance network. The results also show that failure to incorporate
   patterns of extra-dyadic interdependence into our statistical models of
   interstate alliance decisions is likely to result in biased parameter
   estimates.},

Abstract = {The civil war in Cote d'Ivoire presents unique features with respect to
   the causes of civil wars and the nature of peace processes in West
   Africa. It is a conflict largely driven by concrete political and social
   grievances over citizenship. In addition, it is marked by a significant
   effort by the belligerents to take ownership of the peace process and
   negotiate directly. This article traces the civil war to the
   politicization of citizenship and ethnicity during the democratization
   process. It argues that the peace agreements engineered by the
   international community failed to end the conflict largely because they
   relied heavily on traditional peace formulas and paid insufficient
   attention to the underlying issue of citizenship. In contrast, the peace
   agreement forged by Ivorians has been relatively successful because it
   directly addressed the citizenship issue and restored domestic ownership
   of the peace process. This article focuses on the peace process and the
   intrinsic relation between citizenship and progress toward peace in Cote
   d'Ivoire. In addition, it connects the discourse on democracy in Africa
   with the salient issue of citizenship and underscores the fluidity of
   citizenship and democracy in African politics.},

Abstract = {Discussions of policy networks are common in Britain and Europe.
   Possibly reflecting the elitist view of politics, these discussions
   stress stability. In a similar vein, policy studies in Hong Kong have
   been carried out within the confines of elitism, with a particular
   emphasis on government/business collusion. This article, however, argues
   that networks and policies do change, and the change does not
   necessarily favour business. In explaining change, exogenous factors are
   important, so is the type of the network involved. The impact of
   exogenous factors depends on the structure of the network, which affects
   the network's ability to resist external pressures.},

Abstract = {Despite the clearly specified conditions laid down in the Slovenian
   Local Self-Government Act, both in theory and practice, the question
   often arises whether or not the Slovene municipalities are able to
   perform original tasks. In this regard, it must be noted that the local
   communities, i.e., municipalities and wider self-governing local
   communities, are not formed on the basis of certain criteria of
   rationality according to which it would be possible to prejudge whether
   or not they are capable of performing the tasks that they must perform,
   namely, the local public services. Today's municipalities are mostly the
   result of the historical development, traditions, political compromises,
   geographical and other factors that have nothing to do With the criteria
   of rationality with regard to the tasks and needs they must carry out
   and satisfy. Due to a large number of relatively weak local communities
   in Slovenia, the cooperation between them is important in carrying out
   the functions that are common to municipalities, to the state or to the
   EU. It is about public-public partnerships where local communities can
   play a key role because they know the needs of the local population.},

Abstract = {The former Communist countries in Central and Eastern Europe have
   attempted to reconcile their Communist past in different ways. It is in
   Poland, however, where the issue of dealing with its Communist past
   through attempts at lustration has been especially fraught. It will be
   argued here that Poland's lustration problems are caused primarily by a
   failure to understand the specific nature of totalitarian dictatorship
   that existed in Poland under Communist rule. (C) 2010 Published by

Abstract = {Comparison of the experiences of middle-class Peruvian immigrants in
   South Florida and working-class Peruvian immigrants in Santiago confirms
   that individuals negotiate the framework of legality differently
   according to social class. Although the middle-class Peruvians in South
   Florida were forced to live in what Susan Coutin has called ``spaces of
   nonexistence{''} there, their interactions with other Peruvians similar
   to themselves allowed them to retain their middle-class identity
   regardless of their legal status. In contrast, the working-class
   Peruvians in Santiago, who lived precariously in both places, were
   forced to compete with each other for jobs and to rely on their
   employers for regularization of their status, and therefore they could
   not count on the solidarity of other immigrants like themselves to
   bolster their sense of belonging.},

Abstract = {Two studies examined the interaction of political conservatism and the
   need for cognitive closure in predicting aggressiveness in intergroup
   conflict and hostility toward outgroups. In the first study, Polish
   participants indicated their preference for coercive conflict strategies
   in the context of a real-life intergroup conflict. Only among
   participants who identify themselves as conservative, need for cognitive
   closure was positively and significantly related to preference for
   aggressive actions against the outgroup. In the second study, the
   predicted interaction was investigated in the context of the terrorist
   threat in Poland. The findings indicated that high in need for closure
   conservatives showed greater hostility against Arabs and Muslims only
   when they believed that Poland was under threat of terrorist attacks
   inspired by Islamist fundamentalism.},

Abstract = {Bolivia's National Development Plan is the most detailed official
   document on the objectives of Evo Morales's administration and therefore
   an important reference point for the evaluation of the intentions,
   difficulties, and approaches of his political project. Analysis of the
   plan reveals bold objectives such as transforming the nation's structure
   of development and making the country the energy center of the continent
   and more modest goals of reducing poverty and social inequality. The
   greatest advance in the first four years of the Morales administration
   is regaining state control of the economy; Bolivia has effectively
   changed its economic model from a predominantly free-market one to a
   mixed model in which state management of the basic sectors of the
   economy predominates. Changing the structure of development has taken
   second place to these changes, but the government has acted to promote
   the needed diversification by encouraging environmental protection,
   guaranteeing workers' rights, and providing improved access to credit.
   The implementation of some of the plan's main features has been delayed
   by political opposition from the eastern part of the country, but with a
   congressional majority for Morales's party in his second term further
   advances can be predicted. Given the plan's limitations and moderation
   and the problems in its implementation, it is significant that Bolivia
   has witnessed an impressive increase in the gross domestic product and a
   decrease in income inequality.},

Abstract = {When the indigenous coca grower Evo Morales was elected president in
   Bolivia in 2005, he promised to fundamentally change 25 years of the
   U.S.-funded and dictated ``drug war.{''} The new policy values the coca
   leaf and relies on local organizations to control coca production within
   limits set by the government. A review of its successes and limitations
   to date suggests that Bolivia's experience may offer lessons for drug
   control in other parts of the hemisphere.},

   Reality},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {64},
Number = {3},
Pages = {443-479},
Month = {SUM},
Abstract = {Prevailing theories hold that U.S. public support for a war depends
   primarily on its degree of success, U.S. casualties, or conflict goals.
   Yet, research into the framing of foreign policy shows that public
   perceptions concerning each of these factors are often endogenous and
   malleable by elites. In this article, we argue that both elite rhetoric
   and the situation on the ground in the conflict affect public opinion,
   but the qualities that make such information persuasive vary over time
   and with circumstances. Early in a conflict, elites (especially the
   president) have an informational advantage that renders public
   perceptions of ``reality{''} very elastic. As events unfold and as the
   public gathers more information, this elasticity recedes, allowing
   alternative frames to challenge the administration's preferred frame. We
   predict that over time the marginal impact of elite rhetoric and reality
   will decrease, although a sustained change in events may eventually
   restore their influence. We test our argument through a content analysis
   of news coverage of the Iraq war from 2003 through 2007, an original
   survey of public attitudes regarding Iraq, and partially disaggregated
   data from more than 200 surveys of public opinion on the war.},

Abstract = {Global restructuring has dramatically affected the value, extent, and
   significance of informal economic activities worldwide. Approaching
   informalization as a systemic phenomenon, this essay illuminates
   linkages among economic processes, widening inequalities, ``governance
   gaps,{''} and global insecurities. It considers the historical context
   in which distinctive approaches to informality emerged and reviews three
   principal ``islands{''} of existing research: mainstream, structuralist,
   and feminist. These variously illuminate patterns of economic inequality
   that are central to studies of international political economy.
   Informality's significance to IR and security studies is further
   illuminated through a discussion of the processes and political economy
   of informalization in relation to global migrations, and the interaction
   of economic and political informalization in the context of ``new{''}
   wars and security crises.},

Abstract = {Foreign aid involves a chain of accountability relationships stretching
   from international donors through national governments and implementing
   agencies to a set of ultimate end users of the goods and services
   financed by the aid. In this paper, I review five different
   accountability relationships that exist in foreign aid projects among
   donors, governments, implementing agencies and end users. Then I
   summarize existing empirical evidence demonstrating that foreign aid
   functions better both at the macro-level of aid flows and at the
   micro-level of individual aid projects when there is more government and
   implementing agency accountability. Specifying several mechanisms that
   facilitate accountability, I emphasize that participation is a tool
   often used to produce accountability within aid projects. However, in
   terms of donor accountability to aid-receiving countries and the end
   users in them, recent pushes for increased participation have not
   resulted in more accountability in the design of aid programs.
   Ultimately, although enthusiasm for participatory models of aid design
   and delivery is warranted, participation is not a panacea for all the
   accountability problems in foreign aid programs.},

Abstract = {Negotiated civil war terminations differ from their interstate war
   counterparts in that one side must disarm and cease to exist as a
   fighting entity. While termination through military victory provides a
   relatively more enduring peace, many civil wars end with peace
   agreements signed after negotiations. However, research has shown that
   the implementation of civil war peace agreements is difficult and prone
   to collapse. Often these failures are followed by recurrence of the
   conflict. In some cases, the agreements break down before key provisions
   are implemented. This article adds to this topic by focusing on the role
   of state capacity in peace agreement success. We argue that peace
   agreements and state capacity are necessary but not sufficient
   conditions for sustainable peace. The article employs a case study
   approach to explore the importance of state capacity in implementing
   civil war peace agreements. The role of third-party interventions is
   also considered. The cases (United Kingdom-Northern Ireland,
   Indonesia-Aceh, Burundi, Mali, and Somalia) include 14 peace agreements
   that vary by war type (secessionist or control over government), type of
   agreement (comprehensive or partial), levels of state capacity (high or
   low), and peace success (success, partial or failure), and each
   experienced third-party involvement in the peace process.},

Abstract = {How have European state-makers managed to coordinate various key
   activities to the point where many of them see the European Union as
   providing a model for the rest of the world in general and Asia in
   particular? For example, most of Europe now shares a common market and a
   common currency. This was originally considered unthinkable. However,
   most European state-makers did surrender significant aspects of their
   sovereign power to make this happen. State-makers in the Asian region
   have not yet followed suit. This tells us something about their
   competing politico-strategic, economic and social concerns. Asian
   state-makers are nonetheless capable of sustaining their own form of
   regionalism. This tells us something about the different
   politico-cultural context in which they live. This context makes it
   possible to promote distinctly `Asian' perspectives. It provides an
   Asian alternative to European regionalism and a way of compensating for
   the limits and distortions of the European Union. International Politics

Abstract = {This study continues earlier research efforts that investigated the
   impact of the European Union (EU) on welfare states by examining the
   relationship between the welfare state attitudes of citizens and the
   economic dimension of European integration. Two waves from the European
   and WorldValues Study (EVS/WVS) are combined with UNCTAD data about EU
   trade. Multilevel analysis of this dataset including 67,346 individuals
   from the EU member states shows that there is a curvilinear relationship
   (a reversed U) between welfare state attitudes and economic integration
   in the EU.},

Volume = {20},

Abstract = {Recent public management literature has emphasized the influence of
   public sector characteristics on employee attitudes, behaviors, and
   performance. This article assesses how recent management reforms, such
   as contracting out, civil service overhaul (also known as Title 5
   exemptions or removal of civil service protections), and managing for
   results are associated with employee job satisfaction in the federal
   government. Using the Federal Human Capital Survey 2006 dataset, this
   article finds that contracting out and Title 5 exemption are negatively
   related to job satisfaction. Managing for results, operationalized as
   perceived performance orientation and innovative culture, is positively
   related to job satisfaction, but the relationship is moderated by
   employees' trust in leadership and their perceptions of the
   effectiveness and fairness of performance appraisal.},

Title = {Master or Servant? Common Agency and the Political Economy of IMF
   Lending},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {54},
Number = {1},
Pages = {49-77},

Abstract = {What explains the substantial variation in the International Monetary
   Fund's (IMF) lending policies over time and across cases? Some scholars
   argue that the IMF is the servant of the United States and other
   powerful member-states, while others contend that the Fund's
   professional staff acts independently in pursuit of its own bureaucratic
   interests. I argue that neither of these perspectives, on its own, fully
   and accurately explains IMF lending behavior. Rather, I propose a
   ``common agency{''} theory of IMF policymaking, in which the Fund's
   largest shareholders-the G5 countries that exercise de facto control
   over the Executive Board (EB)-act collectively as its political
   principal. Using this framework, I argue that preference heterogeneity
   among G5 governments is a key determinant of variation in IMF loan size
   and conditionality. Under certain conditions, preference heterogeneity
   leads to either conflict or ``logrolling{''} within the EB among the
   Fund's largest shareholders, while in others it creates scope for the
   IMF staff to exploit ``agency slack{''} and increase its autonomy.
   Statistical analysis of an original data set of 197 nonconcessional IMF
   loans to 47 countries from 1984 to 2003 yields strong support for this
   framework and its empirical predictions. In clarifying the politics of
   IMF lending, the article sheds light on the merits of recent policy
   proposals to reform the Fund and its decision-making rules. More
   broadly, it furthers our understanding of delegation, agency, and the
   dynamics of policymaking within international organizations.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},

Volume = {54},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This study argues that the reputational concerns of several high-profile
   actors drove the emergence of oil sector transparency as an
   international norm. Thanks to successful advocacy campaigns, developing
   country oil sector operations began to pose increasing levels of
   reputational risk to Western governments, international institutions,
   and corporations. These actors responded to this scrutiny by
   facilitating the evolution of transparency into a widely cited oil
   sector ``best practice.{''} However, the self-interests of these actors
   also altered the course of the norm's definition and
   institutionalization in ways which may constrain its eventual impact on
   industry behaviors. This study narrates the surprising and rapid spread
   of the transparency norm in developing country oil affairs, a process
   which suggests that reputational utility should be considered as a
   possible explanation for norm emergence.},

Abstract = {Previous research has implicitly assumed that civil wars represent a
   coherent category of events, but given the variety of rebel goals that
   supposition seems tenuous. We split civil wars into those where the
   rebels simply want to remove the government (replacement) from those
   where the rebels want to alter the relationship between the state and
   society (legitimacy). Theoretically, states are most at risk for a civil
   war of replacement when they extract substantial wealth from society and
   the government is weak. In contrast, civil wars of legitimacy are more
   likely to occur in states where the rebels have both grievances and a
   means to maintain their future viability. An empirical analysis of civil
   wars of replacement and legitimacy from 1960 to 1999 confirms both our
   argument about the different types of civil violence and their differing
   causes.},

Abstract = {Contemporary Mexican cabaret is an art genre akin to theater and based
   in part on the popular tent theater (Teatro de Carpa) of the 1920s and
   1930s. It is profoundly connected to the exercise of critical
   citizenship vis-a-vis Mexican neoliberalism. Many of its artists are
   part of a deviation from the sexual norm in that they challenge the
   predominant conceptions of gender and sexuality in national discourse.
   The fact that cabaret attracts an audience beyond purely commercial
   entertainment can be interpreted in terms of Slavoj Zizek's proposal
   that the organic symbolic links created by communities are gradually
   being eliminated in favor a single form of relationship, the economic
   one. Mexican cabaret calls into question nationalistic collective models
   and proposes alternatives to the uniform cultural production of
   subjectivities and sexualities. In doing so it calls attention to the
   fragmentation and multiplicity of Mexican reality and especially to the
   need for nondogmatic and queer perceptions of it.},

Journal = {CAMBRIDGE REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Pages = {87-106},
Abstract = {The critique of methodological nationalism arose in the 1970s in
   sociology, but it only gained salience with the rise of globalization
   theory in the late 1990s. This article argues that in International
   Relations the discussion of the so-called `domestic analogy' is closely
   connected to the one on methodological nationalism as they equally point
   to the substantive problem of understanding the nation state's position
   in modernity. The first section of this article revisits the three waves
   of the debate on methodological nationalism in sociology. The second
   part connects this with the discussion in IR on the domestic analogy.
   The last section brings the two disciplinary strands together by
   suggesting that social theory's claim to universalism is a fundamental
   resource to theorize current global processes beyond methodological
   nationalism and the domestic analogy. But for us to do so, we still have
   to unpack social theory's ambivalent relationship with the natural law
   tradition.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Pages = {387-408},
Abstract = {This article seeks to understand why, despite over three decades of
   claiming women's reproductive health as a human right, we have seen
   little progress in reducing their health inequalities and poor health
   outcomes. I argue that one reason for this lack of progress may be due
   to a failure to clearly articulate the responsibilities of key actors,
   crucially states, in ensuring that women have access to, and provision
   of, services required to realize their reproductive rights. What is
   needed, this article suggests, is a framework that can translate decades
   of rights language into action and specifically identify the provisions
   required to address women's health.},

Abstract = {In an effort to address some of the gaps in homeland security policy
   analysis-at present a relatively understudied topic from an analytic
   perspective-Professor Mueller offers an examination of policy decision
   making for a subset of low probability-high consequence events;
   particularly the idea of passive asset defense. This article provides a
   critical examination of Professor Mueller's work, tendering what we
   identify as a number of critical limitations with his framework and
   argues it does not provide an adequate basis for sound analysis in this
   policy area. We also offer several suggestions where one could build
   upon a portion of the groundwork his paper lays, especially in moving
   toward a greater appreciation of what terrorism means for an all-hazards
   management system.},

Abstract = {Al-Qaeda has displayed an impressive grasp of electronic media in its
   strategic communication for propaganda, recruitment and mobilisation. It
   understands that the power of modern communication lies in resonance,
   channelling unconscious feelings towards a message and narrative that
   give meaning to its messages. Its media provide visual context for these
   messages that appeal to the emotions for motivation and to reason for
   persuasion. It has shown a sophistication worthy of top US political
   media in driving its own political messages. They have found power in
   different modes and channels of communication, but video has suited the
   purposes of violent extremists well and would be a mistake to
   underestimate their ability, flexibility, imagination and effectivness.},

   Financial Crisis},
Journal = {GLOBAL POLICY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {1},
Number = {1},
Pages = {29-39},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The post-global financial crisis world will be increasingly dominated by
   China and the United States. What the de facto G2 do, together,
   independently or in conflict, will increasingly define the global bounds
   of the possible. Both countries want to embed their bilateral diplomacy
   in the multilateralism of the G20. The problem for the emergent G2 in
   G20 global architecture is that economic relations between China and the
   US will be increasingly difficult to manage. The large economic
   imbalances between the two countries, in which China buys American debt
   and Americans buy Chinese goods, will endure. Before the crisis, the
   codependence these imbalances created was a source of stability in
   Sino-American relations. After the crisis, they will be a source of
   frustration and conflict, as the second half of 2009 showed. To manage
   economic relations between China and the US effectively, the G20 agenda
   will have to move from crisis management to strategic planning for the
   global economy. The G20 will also have to become more institutionalized,
   but in a way that resembles more a nonexecutive board of directors of a
   multinational firm than a management committee of C-level executives.},

   understanding of the variance of the behavior of state challengers had

   network associations, and compare the Afghan Taliban's and the Colombian
   Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (Revolutionary Armed Forces
   of ColombiaFARC)'s organizational principles from this point of view.
   The main claim is that organizationally inspired explanations behave
   much better than resource inspired ones when accounting for the
   differences between the Taliban and the FARC.},

Journal = {CRITICAL POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {3},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {309-335},
Abstract = {In this article, I argue that power and hegemony are vital for
   critically explaining a range of policymaking practices. Developing the
   basic assumptions of Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe's
   poststructuralist discourse theory, in which discourse is understood as
   an articulatory practice, I first elaborate the concept of power in
   relation to the work of Michel Foucault, Steven Lukes, and others. Power
   in this picture consists of radical acts of decision and institution,
   which involve the drawing of political frontiers via the creation of
   multiple lines of inclusion and exclusion. The exercise of power thus
   constitutes and produces practices, policies, and regimes. But power is
   also evident in the sedimentation of social relations via various
   techniques of political management, and through the elaboration of
   ideologies and fantasies, where the function of the latter is to conceal
   the radical contingency of social relations and to naturalize relations
   of domination. In elaborating this conception of power, I draw upon a
   neo-Gramscian concept of hegemony, which speaks to the construction and
   deconstruction of political coalitions, as well as the stabilization of
   practices and policy regimes into partially fixed historical blocs and
   formations. I conclude by setting out a five step approach that
   articulates the concepts of power and hegemony into a method of
   conducting critical policy studies.},

Journal = {STUDIES IN CONFLICT \& TERRORISM},

Volume = {33},

Abstract = {The Internet has become a crucial part of modern society's life due to
   its ability to facilitate communication and structure contemporary
   society. Indonesia has not been left out of this global phenomenon. The
   Internet came to Indonesia in 1983 and its usage has continued to expand
   ever since, especially within institutions of learning and in the
   government sector. The study of radical websites must be situated within
   the development of the Internet in Indonesia in general instead of being
   examined by itself. The impact of certain activities such as
   cyberterrorism must then be examined in perspective, given the vast
   expanse of Indonesia as an archipelago and the resulting difficulties in
   linking the entire country to the Internet. This article seeks to trace
   the development of the Internet in Indonesia and examine the resulting
   impact on the reach of the radical Bahasa Indonesia Islamic websites in
   the Indonesian Archipelago and beyond. It also highlights typical
   narrative and operations of the radical websites, which serves to
   distinguish them from radical websites from elsewhere, such as the
   Middle East.},

   Islamist Militants in Britain and Spain},
Journal = {STUDIES IN CONFLICT \& TERRORISM},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {33},
Number = {10},
Pages = {911-932},
Abstract = {Islamist militants frequently lack a talent for tradecraft. In recent
   attacks in Britain and Spain, terrorists made numerous mistakes:
   receiving traffic citations while traveling in oenemyo territory, acting
   suspiciously when questioned by the police, and traveling together
   during missions. Militants' preference toward suicide operations
   restricts their ability to acquire practical experience, particularly
   when they lose their lives during attacks. And their unyielding devotion
   to their cause blinds them to opportunities to improve their operations.
   This is good news for counterterrorism officials. Terrorists' poor
   tradecraft provides alert law enforcers with critical leads they can use
   to identify their attackers, unravel their plots, andsometimesdisrupt
   their operations before they cause additional harm.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {17},
Number = {5},
Pages = {648-664},
Abstract = {Thinking of the European Union's (EU's) Council system in terms of
   institutional environments can help generalize the scope conditions
   under which co-operative styles of negotiation develop and become
   durable over time. Analytically, we expect to find that those
   institutional environments which code higher on a set of four
   independent variables should exhibit more robust patterns of
   co-operative negotiation; that is, are highly insulated from domestic
   audiences, transact with wide scope, high interaction intensity, and/or
   maintain a high density of norms and group standards. This in turn
   offers a concrete application of the sociological argument that EU
   institutions not only matter, but shows how, by building legitimation
   and appropriateness standards into the negotiation process,
   institutional environments can place limits on instrumentalism.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {127-142},
Abstract = {This essay reconsiders anti-foundationalism, the majority position in
   human rights theory, not once more from a rationalist foundationalist
   perspective but from a post-secular perspective. Post-secularism offers
   a relatively new vantage point from which to consider
   anti-foundationalism in human rights theory. That vantage point leads
   this essay to its first claim, which is that anti-foundationalists
   provide no compelling motive for upholding human rights.
   Anti-foundationalists may reconstruct human rights regimes as the times
   demand, but they may also abandon these regimes when faced with
   difficult contingencies. The second claim is that, of the three distinct
   foundationalist alternatives to the anti-foundationalist consensus
   produced by post-secularism, only one is compelling in offering what
   amounts to a religion of humanity. The essay identifies the first of
   these other two post-secular theorizations of human rights as too
   sectarian, and the second as too wedded to the conviction that beliefs
   can be bracketed. The third and final claim of this essay is the most
   preliminary, which is that contemporary theorists of this religion of
   humanity should turn to the work of important post-secular predecessors;
   recommended here as a starting point is the religion of humanity
   proposed by John Stuart Mill.},

Abstract = {In the wake of the terrorist attacks on Mumbai in November 2008, India

   current challenges facing the Indian Government in the implementation of
   these laws, in light of India's experience with the Prevention of
   Terrorism Act of 2002 (POTA). We analyze how POTA, a law originally
   designed to protect the Indian nation as a whole from extraordinary
   terrorist threats, was instead captured by state-level political elites
   and wielded as a weapon against rival political groups. We argue that
   this dynamic can be explained by the broader political transformation in
   the federalist structure of the Indian polity that occurred in the
   1990s: the fragmentation and decline of Congress party control over the
   Central Government allowed state and regional parties, and state
   governments, to claim more and more power at the expense of the Center.
   An(similar to)examination of case studies in the Indian states of
   Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, and Gujarat illustrates the dynamics of local
   capture and the deployment of anti-terrorist legislation by elites
   against economic challenges. Through an analysis of the implementation
   of POTA, this paper seeks to contextualize India's latest round of
   anti-terrorism laws in light of the structural realities of the Indian
   polity.},

Abstract = {What explains the discrepancy between the avowed commitment of the
   Georgian government to human rights and praxis of human rights in the
   post-Rose Revolution republic? This article engages with this question
   and attributes persistent breaches of civil, political, and personal
   integrity rights in Georgia not only to its domestic circumstances but
   also to the international impact. The study develops a reference group
   theory; a type of social theory that stresses the influence of social
   groups of states on policies and behavior of their members. Reference
   groups endorse goals, values, and standards of behavior for their
   members and serve as the oframes of referenceo that enable other states
   to assess the effectiveness and legitimacy of their actions. The
   findings of this study indicate that Georgia's reference groups,
   particularly the United States, contributed to its backsliding on human
   rights by (1) supporting the Georgian government in its goal of
   rebuilding the state prior to democratizing it and strengthening respect
   for human rights; (2) redirecting financial and other assistance from
   democracy promotion to state-building projects; and (3) providing the
   Georgian government with flattering, yet, misleading feedback concerning
   the republic's accomplishments in the area of human rights.},

Title = {Ambition and Fear: Iran's Foreign Policy and Nuclear Programme},
Journal = {SURVIVAL},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {52},
Number = {3},
Pages = {95-113},
Abstract = {As the West's nuclear dispute with Iran continues to dominate world
   headlines, it is easy to forget that Iran's relations with the world are
   multifaceted and complex. Within its region, Iran's policies are shaped
   by instabilities in neighbouring countries and the Middle East in
   general, questions of Persian Gulf security, the Israeli-Palestinian
   conflict and various contests for power and resources. Iran's relations
   with Europe, as well as with Russia, China, India and other actors in
   Asia, Africa and Latin America, have long been shaped by economic
   interests on the one hand and, particularly in the case of Europe,
   political differences on the other, in addition to the growing influence
   of the nuclear conflict. Iran's bilateral relations with the United
   States are themselves far more intricate than they sometimes appear.
   Commentators trying to find a single doctrine or underlying driver to
   explain Iran's regional and international policies, as well as its
   nuclear programme, have traded various possibilities, including Persian
   imperialism, the export of the revolution, or the religious zeal of
   Iran's ruling elite. None of these explanations are convincing. Rather,
   Iran's regional, international and even nuclear policies are driven by a
   combination of ambition and fear.},

Title = {Conflict escalation in dyads with a history of territorial disputes},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {21},
Number = {4},
Pages = {415-433},
Abstract = {Purpose - Building on the steps to war model, this paper seeks to
   examine the impact that territorial Militarized Interstate Disputes
   (MID) have on the time it takes a dyad to go to war after it experiences
   its first MID.
   Design/methodology/approach - A model common to epidemiological
   research, the hazard model, is employed to examine the dyadic
   relationship from the time of the first MID forward. This is an
   improvement to dyadic analysis, as most research examines the
   characteristics of individual MIDs in isolation.
   Findings - Dyads with a history of territorial MIDs go to war much more
   quickly than dyads without a history of territorial MIDs. Future
   research should explore the relationship between territory, war, and
   power status to test the assertion that minor power states engage in
   power politics behavior less frequently.
   Practical implications - Conflict resolution measures need to be
   employed more quickly when states have unresolved territorial issues.
   Mediation generally does not occur quickly, which may explain why
   territorial issues are less likely to be referred to mediators and less
   successfully mediated. The results presented herein highlight the need
   for flexible, quick responses to certain crises and the need to settle
   borders and other territorial disputes permanently to avoid war.
   Originality/value - The paper tests a critical component of the steps to
   war model and examines the assertion that the historical relationship
   between states affects conflict decisions.},

Pages = {183+},
Abstract = {The Arctic and High North are enjoying a renaissance. According to some
   observers, interest in the region's natural resources could take on a
   military aspect. As the receding ice cap initiates a run for possession
   of whatever natural resources lie beneath the Arctic Ocean, will it
   bring us to the brink of a new Cold War? Will unresolved legal issues
   and deteriorating foreign relations in the wake of climate change create
   the conditions for armed conflict rather than diplomatic resolution? In
   this article, climate change, socio-economic consequences and questions
   of security are addressed. The purpose is to show that a fruitful
   analysis of security policy challenges in the north must rest on an
   insight into the international legal framework on which co-existence in
   the region rests, the variability in climate change projections,
   socio-economic challenges and opportunities and a sober realpolitik
   analysis. The article concludes that a description of the situation as
   an armed mad dash for resources seems rather overdrawn.},

   Soviet Union in 1990?},
Journal = {EAST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {26},
Number = {1},
Pages = {54-79},
Abstract = {Former president Vladimir Putin still appears to dominate an
   unassailable regime from the position of prime minister. However,
   parallels with imperial Russia shortly before the tsar's overthrow, and
   with its Soviet successor in the year before the union collapsed,
   suggest that the security of the regime should not be taken for granted.
   The failure of `experts' to identify the weakness of the earlier regimes
   should teach us to be prepared for the unexpected. The parallels between
   tsarist Russia and the mature Soviet Union are strong, and Putin has
   publicly shown his appreciation of both previous regimes. In some
   respects, Putin's regime is close to its tsarist predecessor, and in
   some the parallels with the Soviet case are compelling; but the wealth
   of oil and gas appeared to give Putin's Russia a measure of
   invulnerability that neither earlier regime enjoyed. Yet technological
   disasters, the possible limits to the Russian nation's legendary
   patience, the expressed apprehensions on the part of the intelligentsia,
   and the shock of the global economic crisis of the autumn of 2008, place
   the regime's supposed invulnerability in a different light. In
   particular, it lacks a clear and inspiring ideology that could be used
   to unite the population round the regime. The sudden demise of the
   regime is not inevitable, but history teaches us not to be surprised by
   the unforeseen.},

Pages = {207-223},
Abstract = {The narrative turn in the social sciences and the ethical turn in the
   humanities that occurred in the 1990s converged in the study of human
   rights and social justice. Human rights, it was argued, were about and
   dependent upon modes of storytelling; torture was often cited as a
   paradigmatic example of the ways in which narrative and human rights
   were co-implicated. The centralization of torture in the prosecution of
   the ``War on Terror{''} and the recent declassification of documents
   authorizing the use of torture by US personnel offers an important
   occasion to reconsider some of the tenets of the arguments about human
   rights and narrative. This essay considers the problem of
   declassification as a process of un-narration and examines some of the
   ways that art and literature have attempted to deal with the stories of
   torture that are actively untold.},

   Religion in Northern Ireland},
Journal = {ETHNOPOLITICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {85-102},
Abstract = {Religious distinctions, ethnic oppositions and national differences
   intersect in Northern Ireland. This essay explores how this symbolic
   complexity has fed political conflict. It is argued that the
   institutional structure of Northern Ireland encouraged the
   generalization of religiously informed values across the fields of
   ethnicity and politics, which in turn fed back to tighten and constrain
   available religious repertoires. The recent process of institutional
   reform has interrupted this process. Although this is only one factor
   that contributes to the reproduction of conflict, it allows us to make
   sense of otherwise paradoxical features of everyday division in Northern
   Ireland, and to explain the seemingly inchoate processes of change in
   the post-1998 period.},

Volume = {109},
Number = {437},
Pages = {575-595},

Abstract = {Increasingly, scholarship on urban Africa has focused on the social
   construction of place in informal neighbourhoods. In this approach,
   researchers often highlight the fluidity, contingency, or creativity of
   the urban poor majority. Efforts to remake planning processes to work
   with or be driven by these informal everyday place-making strategies can
   be quite inspiring. Yet I question whether these ideas as put into
   practice in cities can be anything more than survival strategies of the
   abject poor. Historical-geographical roots and social relations with the
   state make each informal neighbourhood a particular case, and these
   factors have significant influence on people's capacity to make new,
   alternative statements with their urban places, or to create
   alternatives that might be replicated. This essay is based mainly around
   fieldwork in 2006-8 in Zanzibar's peri-urban West District shehia
   (locations) of Mwera and Welezo, including assessment of the built
   environments, interviews, archival work, and participant observation. I
   document ways in which these neighbourhoods are, despite newness, rooted
   in history and geography, and how residents' peri-urban everyday place
   making depends upon their relationships with the state. The internal
   heterogeneity of place making and social positioning proves difficult to
   contend with or deploy for alternative planning.},

Abstract = {As the involvement of third sector organisations in the delivery of
   publicly funded services has increased, so too have debates over the
   effect of such collaboration on their distinctive value base. This
   qualitative study asks whether the normative legitimacy of third sector
   organisations is being compromised by the requirements placed on them by
   external funding agencies. The study finds that third sector
   organisations are able to protect their normative legitimacy through a
   range of strategies, the most important of which is a mixed resource
   base; a strategy that also enables third sector organisations to engage
   in evolutionary innovation.},

Title = {State Reform as a Result of Impacts of the Economic Crisis},
Journal = {REVISTA DEL CLAD REFORMA Y DEMOCRACIA},
Year = {2010},
Number = {48},
Pages = {31+},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The present article deals with the impact of the current economic and
   financial crisis on the organization of the State. It starts from the
   presupposition, that every economic crisis ends up having political
   consequences and creates the conditions for a deep reorganization of the
   State. The question is how to identify those consequences, considering
   how indispensable this institution became in coping with its early
   effects, while at the same time recognizing its limits in an
   increasingly interconnected and interdependent world. This crisis has
   therefore strengthened the State, even though, paradoxically, it has
   also diminished the autonomy of politics. In many places we have a
   bigger State, more present in the life of society, but a less powerful
   one. This is the contradiction of our historical times, which it will be
   followed up as analytically as possible. In order to do this, the
   document will focus on the two main dimensions of State action, the
   external -the State as an international actor-, and the internal one.
   Regarding the first, it has been detected that the State has
   rehabilitated itself as a fundamental institution in the international
   arena, mainly through its key protagonist role -at least for the
   powerful ones- in the G-20, and the declining position of traditional
   western powers, which contrasts with the parallel expansion of powers
   such as China, India and Brazil. The point here is how to evaluate this
   issue within the framework of effective global governance. Is the State
   now the solution for this problem or an obstacle for a better political
   action within a globalised world?
   Regarding internal governance, the crisis has uncovered certain
   protectionist temptations and, in general, efforts directed at
   increasing the means for a more effective governance. This contrasts
   with a parallel pressure to cut budget deficits and achieve fiscal
   stability. Within the European political space, it is perceived a
   weakening of the project of the EU while at the same time a
   strengthening of the different member states. This coincides with other
   social and ideological trends, which are briefly analyzed in this paper,
   all of which witness a changed political atmosphere. In sum, the crisis
   has fostered a more defensive social and political attitude, which
   demands ``more State{''} in order to face the new problems.
   Paradoxically, and considering recent events such as the increase in the
   power of financial markets, only a resolute strategy of co-operation
   beyond the nation-State will be capable of solving most of the pressing
   problems that haunt the majority of world societies.},

Year = {2010},
Volume = {47},

Pages = {639-650},

Abstract = {While ethnic identity formulated by historical memory is often
   understood as the cause of violent conflict in Africa, this qualitative
   historical study of interethnic relations between Luo and Bantu-speaking
   communities on the borderlands of Tanzania and western Kenya
   demonstrates just the opposite. In fact, migration and violent conflicts
   over land in the late 19th century were the basis for oral traditions
   that established new microethnic identities. It was only in the colonial
   era that the modern macroethnicities of Luo and Suba (Bantu), as rigid
   oppositional identities, began to solidify around land disputes.
   Historical memory constructs these dynamic microethnic identities around
   interethnic reciprocal networks that were necessary for gaining security
   and access to land in the past. During these late 19th-century
   conflicts, interethnic alliances and marriages were the norm, resulting
   in many Bantu-speaking communities becoming Luo, to one degree or
   another. Historical memory, as the central tool for constructing
   ethnicity, can be used to promote either violence or peace, depending on
   how it is deployed. In western Kenya, an oppositional Luo identity
   resulted from the colonial construction of macroethnicity, while in
   North Mara, Tanzania, a different national narrative has resulted in
   relative peace. In his collection of oral traditions from North Mara,
   Zedekia Oloo Siso makes a case for these still salient microethnicities,
   based on regional networks that cross-cut ethnic boundaries, as the
   indigenous networks necessary for peace.},

Abstract = {While electoral gender quotas are rapidly disseminating all over the
   world, they are also meeting with fierce resistance. A closer look at
   quota debates reveals that a considerable number of arguments for and
   against quotas take the form of predictions of the impact of quotas.
   This article identifies a number of key predictions from the quota
   debate in relation to three dimensions: descriptive representation,
   substantive representation and symbolic representation. Through examples
   from the growing quota research, the article discusses how nine selected
   pairs of predictions have been or could be tested empirically. By this
   we hope to move the discussion of quotas away from the present deadlock
   between quota proponents and opponents. A central argument made is that
   the differences in research results do not only derive from variations
   between the countries, but also from the use of disparate criteria of
   evaluation. The article points to the need for clarification and the
   development of common concepts and criteria.},

Abstract = {In the 2000s, Bolivia and Ecuador were marked by battles over natural
   resources in which mass mobilizations challenged the neoliberal
   privatization of resources such as water and natural gas. In El Alto and
   Quito, these mobilizations boosted the public standing of women whose
   frontline militancy helped confront privatization and build momentum for
   the election of women to top leadership. Although gender discrimination
   persisted, women's activism in these resource battles demonstrated to
   men their capacity to lead in arenas other than health, family, and
   education. In the wake of these conflicts, variations in women's
   voice-the power to speak, set agendas, and dictate discourse-on the
   executive councils of popular organizations prove to be determined by
   societal sexism, leadership and training opportunities for women, the
   presence of more women on the executive council, the status of the
   council seats won by women, and the particular organization's
   decision-making process.},

Abstract = {This article examines the relationship between state regulation and the
   informal economy at the macro-level across a broad set of countries. The
   analysis shows (a) that countries have different types of regulatory
   environments varying by the degree of state regulation of economic
   activity and the degree to which the state implements and enforces the
   existing regulations and (b) that this variation helps explain why some
   nations have more informal economic activity than others. The findings
   also suggest that (c) contrary to what the neoliberal orthodoxy has
   prescribed over the past few decades, decreasing the degree of state
   regulation in the economy will not necessarily formalize the economy.
   The degree of regulation seems to have a significant association with
   the size of the informal economy only in nations with effective law
   enforcement. Where this is not the case as in many developing
   nations-deregulatory policies are likely to be counter-productive in
   formalizing the economy.},

Abstract = {A seeming paradox of globalization is that while innovation and the
   industries and institutions that support it transcend local and national
   boundaries, high-tech innovative activity continues to agglomerate in a
   select number of high-capacity regions. Research, however, suggests that
   innovative regions must-through collaborative activity and related
   networks-both economize regional capacities while remaining open to
   global knowledge and finance. Collaboration and network formation are
   viewed as critical in this regard, as the competitive pressures of
   globalization are forcing firms to adopt collaborative and open
   innovation practices: forging relationships with external partners. Two
   important sources of knowledge and finance are regionally concentrated
   venture capital firms and large corporations, often globe-straddling
   multinational enterprises. While collaboration occurs between these two
   actors, an understanding of the processes and implications has only
   begun to emerge. Focusing on collaborative venture capital activity in
   London and the South East, this exploratory paper presents a preliminary
   understanding as to the role that this particular collaborative activity
   plays in the pursuit of complementary, extra-regional knowledge and
   expertise, and the extent to which this collaboration is
   recharacterizing the shape of regionally based venture capital networks.},

Abstract = {Given distinct partisan macroeconomic preferences, the partisanship of
   the president or majority in Congress should influence presidential
   decisions to use force in the face of poor economic conditions-the
   diversionary use of force. But previous research posits contradictory
   accounts of the influence of partisanship. We seek to resolve this
   debate by developing a game theory model, which predicts that leaders
   divert when government is divided and economic conditions hurt the
   opposition party's constituency. Leaders seek to divert the legislature
   from the economy in order to prevent the legislature from passing a
   remedial economic bill. Analyzing US conflict behavior since World War
   II, we examine the conditional influence of presidential partisanship
   and the president's cohesive partisan support in Congress on the effects
   of inflation and unemployment. Consistent with the model's predictions,
   we find that as their cohesive partisan support in Congress declines,
   Democratic presidents tend to use force in response to inflation and
   Republican presidents tend to use force in response to unemployment.},

Abstract = {Many international organizations, including the United Nations, are
   accused of lacking democratic accountability. A variety of proposals
   have been made to close the gap between their extended influence and the
   lack of effective controlling mechanisms to prevent abuses of power.
   This article focuses on one specific proposal: the establishment of
   parliamentary assemblies. Based on the experiences of the Council of
   Europe and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, it
   presents the factors that enable such assemblies to exercise
   parliamentary control and influence towards intergovernmental
   decision-making bodies. The article shows how a parliamentary dimension
   can be introduced conceptually into the debate on the democratic
   accountability of international organizations and how these insights
   support the reflections on a United Nations parliamentary assembly.},

Title = {Conception and Decentralization of Consumer Protection in Peru: a
   Comparative Analsis with Mexico, United States, Brazil and Sweden},

Abstract = {Consumer protection is one of the most important instruments for the
   well functioning of a modern market economy. Three elements are crucial
   to distinguish its degree of effectiveness: i) the scope of protection,
   ii) the institutional system that enforces laws and resolves conflicts,
   and its extension throughout the country. In Peru, consumer protection
   has a limited scope, a weak institutionality and a narrow territorial
   reach.
   By reviewing the experiences of Mexico, Brazil, United States and
   Sweden, some issues are brought into the table, as they are useful to
   make significant improvements to the Peruvian case. Key issues are: a) a
   wider concept about protection to consumption; b) the need of a leading
   authority (executive) at the national governmental level that would
   enforce laws and articulate the action of other sectorial authorities,
   decentralizing its functions throughout all regional and municipal
   governments; and c) a great variety of public, private and civil society
   mechanisms that would bring justice to consumers; decentralizing ``small
   consumer complaints{''} at the municipal level, and complaints of larger
   consumer, authorities and civil society at the regional and national
   levels.
   Public administrative justice must be free of charge on all ``small
   complaints{''} and be autonomous and independent from executive
   authorities in all centralized or decentralized causes or complaints.
   These lessons could be useful not only for Peru, but for all other
   countries in Latin America.},

Abstract = {In typical crisis bargaining models, strong actors must convince the
   opponent that they are not bluffing and the only way to do so is through
   costly signaling. However, in a war, strong actors can benefit from
   tactical surprise when their opponent mistakenly believes that they are
   weak. This creates contradictory incentives during the pre-war crisis:
   actors want to persuade the opponent of their strength to gain a better
   deal but, should war break out, they would rather have the opponent
   believe they are weak. I present an ultimatum crisis bargaining model
   that incorporates this dilemma and show that a strong actor may feign
   weakness during the bargaining phase. This implies that (1) absence of a
   costly signal is not an unambiguous revelation of weakness, (2) the
   problem of uncertainty is worse because the only actor with incentives
   to overcome it may be unwilling to do so, and (3) because of the
   difficulty with concealing resolve, democracies might be seriously
   disadvantaged in a crisis.},

Abstract = {Implementing urban governance strategies to improve local democracy and
   to regulate local economic growth is an important determinant of
   effective local administrative change and performance. The underlying
   hypothesis adopted here is the assumption that the adoption of urban
   governance processes requires political leadership. It inevitably
   results in the introduction of innovations within the administrative
   apparatus in order to improve its performance. Indeed, understanding the
   interaction between these three aspects (political leadership, urban
   governance, and administrative modernisation) is of fundamental
   importance for the effectiveness of most, if not all, policy
   interventions directed at the introduction of democratic innovations and
   public administration modernisation initiatives in local governments. To
   bring out the importance of those interactions, case study(1) research
   is used.},

Title = {On the transformation of warfare: a plausibility probe of the new war
   thesis},

Abstract = {This article intends to contribute to the debate on the emergence of
   so-called new wars by reconstructing the new war thesis in a way that
   allows an empirical assessment of the plausibility of the thesis. It
   makes explicit the defining criteria implicit to the new war thesis
   which claims that a fundamental transformation of modern intra-state
   warfare has taken place due to the end of the Cold War. It also lays out
   the causal mechanisms that underpin the alleged transformation of
   warfare. Based on the reconstructed conceptual framework and drawing on
   case studies of the wars in Cambodia, Afghanistan, Angola, Somalia and
   Sierra Leone, the article then lends support to the new war thesis. The
   cases demonstrate that, in the 1990s, war economies based on criminal
   activities became more important and triggered the fragmentation of
   warring parties and the economisation of their war motives. Moreover, in
   combination, the fragmentation of warring parties and the economisation
   of their war motives facilitate the application of brutal violence
   against civilians. Journal of International Relations and Development

Abstract = {While physicists have advanced theories that directly challenged
   unidimensional theories of history, the social sciences have held on to
   older, linear conceptions of historical time, but all this should
   change. Politics entails the making and remaking of the past, the making
   and remaking of the future, the inheritance of imagined futures, the
   recognition of the cyclic and the repetitive, reversals of linear
   causality, and other strategies and effects at odds with dominant
   historical conventions. If we are to study politics then we must attend
   to the broader, less disciplined, relation of politics to history, which
   is the purpose of the current article.},

Abstract = {This article attempts to show that in Latin America, as in the rest of
   the world, ``quality{''} and ``evaluation{''} are themes that have
   developed almost independently. Furthermore, the paper argues that there
   are important relations between these two themes and it shows ways in
   which evaluation and quality can be linked and thus mutually benefit.
   The main conclusions are summarized in the following paragraphs.
   For a long time, the evaluation of public policies and the quality of
   services have been parallel practices and disciplines, with very few or
   no links whatsoever. Evaluators and quality experts have been operating
   in different worlds, forming separated ``communities of practice{''}.
   This way, those that work in the evaluation field very seldom know or
   are aware of what quality experts do, and viceversa, despite the
   complementarities between these perspectives. This leads to a waste of
   potentially valuable synergies, that could enrich the value of the work
   of evaluators and quality experts. Evaluation and quality improvement
   associations operate practically without contacts among them, like
   parallel words, even though their scope and procedures are not
   completely different. Thus, it is infrequent that evaluators participate
   in meetings of quality experts and viceversa. These are independent
   communities of practice.
   The document points out that the recent trend to privilege public
   management results has led evaluators to frequently neglect or
   undervalue the importance of processes. However, given the difficulties
   of attributing results to specific policies and programs, due to the
   fact that these interventions take place in an open and complex context
   in which exogenous factors intervene (and, in some cases, also other
   policies or programs), it is convenient to take into account the
   processes connected with interventions, as they may contribute to
   clarify attribution. Therefore, process evaluations may complement
   results evaluations, and this is being one of the key potential links
   between evaluation and quality.
   On the other hand, the research concludes that evaluation techniques and
   perspectives can enrich the work of quality experts, as it allows for a
   more elaborate approach to the causal relations that link processes or
   ``facilitating agencies{''} with results, and the consideration of
   contextual or external factors, given that quality schemes generally do
   not take them sufficient into account and they could be critical to
   determine the extent to which ``facilitating agencies and/or
   processes{''} were instrumental in achieving results.
   Finally, the paper argues that evaluation and quality are complementary
   perspectives that can mutually reinforce each other, benefitting from
   the stock of techniques and approaches developed in parallel and that
   have an important potential to improve both the practice of evaluators
   and that of quality experts, leading to public policies and services
   that would contribute in a better and greater extent to citizens'
   welfare.},

Title = {Vertebral Axes of Governance in Public Systems. A Framework of Analysis
   in Latin American Key},
Journal = {REVISTA DEL CLAD REFORMA Y DEMOCRACIA},
Year = {2010},

Pages = {73+},

Abstract = {Governance refers the set of institutional arrangements through which
   public decisions are prepared, adopted and executed in a given social
   environment. Scholars frequently complement this descriptive notion with
   normative approaches that emphasise one or another specific interaction
   within the public sphere. Exploring the quality of governance
   necessarily requires identifying the formal and informal institutions
   which represent the system's desired attributes. This paper thus aims to
   carry out said exploration, identifying the governance axes which will
   allow to determine if an advanced democratic system exists. The
   objective is to have a useful framework of analysis to be able to
   examine the type of governance actually in place, especially in Latin
   American countries.
   As such, the central part of this article proposes and develops five
   content axes upon which basic institutional arrangements should be
   systematised to frame decision processes within the public sphere and
   which, taken as a whole, offer a full view of the type of governance in
   a given country. These axes are: 1) the country's political
   institutions; 2) its legal institutions; 3) market institutions; 4)
   public management; and 5) civil society. It further explores the
   institutional framework elements within each axis which need to be
   considered in order to evaluate the quality of that governance model.
   Lastly, this work faces the problems associated to measuring and
   improving governance. The first difficulty is that we cannot limit
   ourselves to measuring outputs, that is, the immediate result of a given
   actor's actions within the process. We have to aspire to measure the
   aggregate results of all the interactions included within said process.
   In other words, we have to measure the impact on reality, its outcomes,
   something which makes it more difficult to establish causal connections
   and, as a result, extract valid conclusions. In keeping with J. C. March
   and J. P. Olsen, this document proposes creating spaces for social and
   political consensus to improve governance, spaces which enable the
   experimental exploration of certain central public policies and which
   can maintain this consensus for relatively long periods of time. In
   addition, it also defends the compatibility between this basic consensus
   and a vigorous sphere of public deliberation. The latter has to be able
   to draw from reliable information and be capable of demanding
   accountability and managing political explanations regarding what is
   happening so that useful evaluation and collective learning processes
   are created.},

Abstract = {Does peacekeeping intervention improve the human rights situation in
   states with a history of civil war? While this question has received a
   myriad of attention and debate within the human rights community, there
   have been relatively few studies that attempt to answer this question.
   Examining the characteristics of peacekeeping following civil war from
   1980 to 2004, this article finds that peacekeeping can both encourage
   and undermine respect for human rights. Specifically, the mission and
   activities of peacekeepers matter. These findings support the human
   rights community's stance that peacekeeping can be problematic but holds
   promise for human rights in post-conflict states.},

Title = {IMPLEMENTING EVIDENCE-BASED POLICY IN A NETWORK SETTING: ROAD SAFETY
   POLICY IN THE NETHERLANDS},
Journal = {PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {88},
Number = {3},
Pages = {871-884},
Abstract = {In the early 1990s, in order to improve road safety in The Netherlands,
   the Institute for Road Safety Research (SWOV) developed an
   evidence-based `Sustainable Safety' concept. Based on this concept,
   Dutch road safety policy, was seen as successful and as a best practice
   in Europe. In The Netherlands, the policy context has now changed from a
   sectoral policy setting towards a fragmented network in which safety is
   a facet of other transport-related policies. In this contribution, it is
   argued that the implementation strategy underlying Sustainable Safety
   should be aligned with the changed context. In order to explore the
   adjustments needed, two perspectives of policy implementation are
   discussed: (1) national evidence-based policies with sectoral
   implementation; and (2) decentralized negotiation on transport policy in
   which road safety is but one aspect. We argue that the latter approach
   matches the characteristics of the newly evolved policy context best,
   and conclude with recommendations for reformulating the implementation
   strategy.},

Abstract = {During the 90s decade most of the Latin American countries experienced
   privatization processes that led to the restructuring and liberalization
   of key sectors of their economies. In the cases of Argentina and
   Bolivia, the energy sphere -centering on petroleum and natural gas- did
   not remain on the sidelines of the reforms, so that transnational
   corporations occupied a key position in the different points of the
   productive chain. In the first few months of 2004 Argentina was immersed
   in a deep energy crisis and, since then, natural gas has played a
   leading role in its bilateral relations with Bolivia. Nonetheless, the
   existence of internal factors peculiar to each State makes compliance
   with international agreements difficult, which causes certain gray areas
   in the links between Argentina and Bolivia.},

Abstract = {In this article we test current knowledge about policy implementation in
   multilevel governance systems and focus on the debated case of transport
   biofuels (EU Directive 2003/30/EC). We probe a set of hypotheses in a
   qualitative comparative analysis, offering a systematic comparison of 10
   member states between 2003 and 2006. The findings show that
   implementation of the EU biofuels policy is a complex phenomenon where
   combinations of causal conditions, and not single conditions, produce
   the outcome. Implementation is more likely when three favourable
   conditions are present, when policy frames and content between EU and
   national levels match, when a consensual policy style is used and the
   most important actors are included. These findings are in agreement with
   previous studies. Non-implementation, on the other hand, is explained by
   a dichotomy between member states unable to implement because they lack
   capacity and those member states unwilling to implement even if they
   can.},

Abstract = {In this article, we suggest that the degree of (dis)unity - both between
   the member states (MS) in the Council and within the Commission - is a
   key factor in affecting the balance between Commission autonomy and MS
   control in international trade negotiations. We shed empirical light on
   this issue, and on the relative influence of MS and the Commission in
   general, through a case study of the Economic Partnership Agreement
   (EPA) negotiations between the European Union (EU) and the African,
   Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries. We suggest that the differing
   preferences and priorities among MS and the relative cohesiveness of the
   Commission provided the Commission with quite a high degree of autonomy
   during all phases of the EPA negotiations. The informational and
   procedural advantages given by its institutional position as sole
   negotiator also contributed to the significant autonomy of the
   Commission.},

Title = {AN EXPLORATION OF WHY PUBLIC ORGANIZATIONS `INGEST' INNOVATIONS},
Journal = {PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {88},

Pages = {979-998},
Abstract = {Organizational change sometimes occurs as organizations `ingest'
   innovations from without. This process represents a vital form of
   organizational learning and adaptation to the external environment. This
   study seeks to understand the factors that predict the adoption of
   Foreign Professional Specialty Occupation Visas, or H-1B visas, by Texas
   public school districts. The use of H-1B visas to hire foreign skilled
   workers is a staffing innovation that is growing in use among public and
   private organizations. Three sets of factors frequently used in studies
   of organizational innovation are considered: organizational size and
   slack; attitudes and dispositions of organizational leaders; and
   environmental influences. The findings contribute to our understanding
   of ingested innovations, indicating that slack resources, influences
   from the task and institutional environments, and the organizational
   leader's disposition and behaviour relating to change influence the
   probability of adopting this staffing innovation.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {19},
Number = {3},
Pages = {374-391},
Abstract = {Building upon the work of green theorists and corporeal and material
   feminists, the epistemological construal of contemporary approaches to
   green citizenship is challenged, and the more ontological approach of
   `corporeal citizenship' is advocated. With this term an understanding of
   citizenship is advanced that is not only embodied and attentive to the
   particularities of human difference but also one that recognises humans'
   inescapable embeddedness in differing social and natural (discursive and
   material) contexts that shape subjectivity and condition our collective
   agency. Bodies are envisioned as porous but resistant, plural and
   connected in an effort to unsettle the nature/culture dualism and
   broaden the range and scope of issues considered environmental. This
   approach also offers the opportunity to rethink traditional conceptions
   of agency and citizenship practices while providing a foundation for
   greater cooperation with advocates of environmental justice.},

Abstract = {The centralization of power and the decline of regionalism were two of
   Vladimir Putin's principal achievements during his presidency. These
   achievements are now threatened by the global financial crisis, which
   weakens the Russian central state and widens existing divisions between
   the centre and the regions. While the crisis does not portend a revival
   of a 1990s-style regionalism, it exposes the Kremlin's
   over-centralization of power in the form of stress within the ruling
   party, United Russia, and rising internal defections among regional
   elites. As a result, the regime is increasingly vulnerable to social
   protest and its potential transformation into anti-regime nationalism.},

   to public participation},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {19},
Number = {3},
Pages = {430-448},
Abstract = {Public participation is key to effective environmental governance, yet
   in China the public's role has been limited. Since 2002, China's
   environmental authorities have promulgated legislation that provides
   channels for public participation in planning processes. By defining
   public participation in legal terms, this legislation has facilitated
   the emergence of `rules-based' environmental activism whereby citizens
   pressurise officials to uphold public participation rules. This
   phenomenon is examined in the context of an `environmentalist'-NIMBY
   (not-in-my-backyard) dichotomy. It is found that environmentalist NGOs
   engage in rules-based activism on a long-term basis to improve the
   institutional environment for public participation. Although NIMBYs have
   also interacted with public participation legislation, this is secondary
   to pursuing their own localised interests. Unlike NGOs, NIMBYs can adopt
   contentious tactics that exert considerable pressure on local officials
   to open participatory channels. Both environmentalist and NIMBY
   activists in China are important in promoting more inclusive
   decision-making processes and consolidating governance reform.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Pages = {70-93},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose a research agenda for
   studying Chinese culture and conflict.
   Design/methodology/approach - Publications on Chinese culture and
   conflict are searched and reviewed to identify conceptualizations of
   Chinese culture and key findings on conflict.
   Findings - A review of the scholarly literature on Chinese culture and
   conflict suggests that Chinese culture has been mainly conceptualized as
   Confucianism and collectivism. Inadequacies of such conceptualizations
   and their negative effects on empirical research on Chinese culture and
   management and organization in China have been addressed.
   Research limitations/implications - Limitations were not being able to
   get an exhaustive list of research publications on Chinese culture and
   conflict.
   Practical implications - The paper helps to reduce stereotypes about
   Chinese conflict management stemmed from previous research
   Originality/value - On the basis of recognizing the importance of past
   research, new directions for researching Chinese culture and conflict
   that constitute a new research agenda have been proposed.},

Abstract = {When a political system is compared with others, one can learn
   fundamentally important things about it, which remain obscure or even
   invisible when it is studied in isolation. This paper illustrates this
   point by considering India. It focuses on several themes: the radical
   redistribution of power that has occurred there since 1989; two key
   consequences of that change; post-clientelist strategies used by Indian
   politicians in efforts to secure re-election; the emergence of
   small-time political entrepreneurs at the local level; and the fluidity
   of political identities. The article concludes with a discussion of the
   limited opportunities that colleagues in India have to undertake
   international comparisons, and a proposed partial solution to that
   problem.},

Journal = {PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {88},
Number = {2},
Pages = {564-583},
Abstract = {Claims that a particular policy has been a `success' are commonplace in
   political life. However, a few of these claims are justified in any
   systematic way. This article seeks to remedy this omission by offering a
   heuristic which practitioners and academics can utilize to approach the
   question of whether a policy is, or was, successful. It builds initially
   on two sets of literature: Boyne's work on public sector improvement;
   and the work of Bovens et al. on success, failure and policy evaluation.
   We discuss the epistemological issues involved in whether it is possible
   to produce an objective measure of `success'. Subsequently, we present a
   framework for assessing success, focusing on three dimensions: process
   success; programmatic success; and political success. We then move on to
   raise a series of what we term complexity issues in relation to success
   for whom; variations across time, space and culture; and methodological
   issues.},

Abstract = {Examining the linkage between service provision and client outcomes is
   important in performance-based human service environments. Since most
   performance initiatives reward agencies for improving client outcomes
   rather than providing specific services, managers may have incentives to
   streamline workers' efforts and reduce resources devoted to services
   considered nonessential. This article uses data from a performance-based
   child welfare initiative to examine the relationship between child
   permanency outcomes, the services provided by caseworkers, and the
   environment surrounding frontline service provision. Findings indicate
   that greater service efforts are required to reunify children with
   parents than to reach other outcomes, including adoption and placement
   with relatives. They also indicate that formal organizational responses
   to performance environments affect client outcomes partially through the
   services provided by frontline workers. These findings suggest that
   managers should attend to the interplay between the organizational
   environment, service technology, and client outcomes when designing

   GOVERNMENT HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT: A EUROPEAN COMPARATIVE PERSPECTIVE},
Journal = {PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {88},
Number = {2},
Pages = {455-478},
Abstract = {This article reports a comparative study of human resource management
   (HRM) practices in Europe. We focus on the extent to which
   decision-making authority is decentralized, that is, passed down to
   management, and individualized in the sense of being in the discretion
   of a single decision maker. Using these two dimensions, this paper gives
   a picture of the distinct way HR decision-making practices are organized
   in Europe: although decentralization has been a common goal of
   modernization initiatives, we still find a rather high degree of
   centralization. Moreover, we find that decentralized decision making
   frequently goes hand in hand with a higher degree of shared decision
   making. In addition, we examine the influence of several cultural and
   institutional factors to address the question of embeddedness in more
   detail. Our results show that national culture, administrative
   traditions and institutional arrangements play an important role as
   explanatory factors for the organization of HR decision-making in
   Europe.},

Title = {The role of face in the decision not to negotiate},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {21},
Number = {4},
Pages = {400-414},
Abstract = {Purpose - Implicitly, the negotiation literature has generally assumed
   that, if economic gains are sufficient, individuals will negotiate.
   However, recent research has begun to consider the social costs incurred
   by negotiating. This paper aims to develop a conceptual model of the
   role of one of those social costs threat to face in the decision of
   whether to negotiate or not to negotiate.
   Design/methodology/approach - The approach was to combine relevant
   literature from face theory and from negotiation to develop and support
   a model of the role of face in the decision to negotiate or not to
   negotiate.
   Findings - A model was developed which proposed that, if people believe
   that negotiating will result in a loss of face, they are less likely to
   negotiate in situations that they recognize are potentially negotiable.
   Six variables are proposed to be antecedents to the belief that
   negotiating could result in loss of face. These six are divided into
   categories of social context (social roles and status), individual
   differences (face threat sensitivity and negotiation self-efficacy), and
   knowledge (knowledge of negotiation scripts and knowledge of negotiation
   content).
   Originality/value - The question of why some people do not negotiate
   when the potential for economic gains would suggest that they should
   negotiate has received very little attention in the negotiation
   literature. This model provides one theoretical approach for exploring
   this phenomenon.},

Volume = {19},

Pages = {61-79},
Abstract = {The current generation of crop-based biofuels is heavily contested for
   its negative consequences for the environment and the poor. Hence, the
   current biofuel system needs to be transformed in the direction of what
   can be labelled `fair fuels': (bio) fuels that are environmentally and
   socially sustainable. Conventional state environmental authorities have
   limited power and legitimacy to effectively regulate the sustainability
   of current global biofuels. Hence, we witness the emergence of private
   market environmental authorities, moral environmental authorities and
   all kinds of hybrid authorities in biofuel regulation. These new forms
   of environmental authority should neither be condemned as ineffective
   and undemocratic nor celebrated as the modern answer to transnational
   environmental problems that face state failure. Further critical inquiry
   into the changing environmental authority structure under conditions of
   globalisation is needed.},

Title = {Legitimacy in financial markets: credit default swaps in the current
   crisis},
Journal = {SOCIO-ECONOMIC REVIEW},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {17-45},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The current financial crisis appears to be a moment of epochal change,
   an archetypal `legitimation crisis'. This paper examines the impact of
   this collapse on one particular section of the financial markets that
   concerned with credit default swaps. This paper shows how and why the
   markets for these products expanded and why they were integral to the
   financial crash. The consequence of the crash was a huge loss of
   legitimacy for these markets. This paper examines the processes whereby
   this legitimacy is being reconstructed. In particular, it distinguishes
   between the re-establishment of pragmatic legitimacy, which is the
   primary concern of the market participants, and the re-establishment of
   broader political legitimacy, which concerns governments and regulators.
   It argues that these two forms of re-establishing legitimacy work in
   different ways and proceed at different rates. It explores the tensions
   to which this leads in terms of reconstructing the financial system.},

Title = {Task conflict, relationship conflict and agreement-seeking behavior in
   Chinese top management teams},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Pages = {94-116},
Abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to investigate the effects task conflict has
   on agreement seeking behavior and interpersonal conflict. In addition,
   it seeks to examine the moderating role of trust on the effects of
   agreement seeking behavior and interpersonal conflict on the styles of
   handing conflict, namely, avoidance, collaboration, and third party
   intervention.
   Design/methodology/approach - Using a structured survey instrument, this
   paper gathered data from 252 senior executives from Mainland China and
   analyzed these using the regression technique to see how interpersonal
   trust between executives moderates the relationship between conflict and
   conflict response mechanisms. The study also investigates the
   relationship between task and relationship conflict as well as
   agreement-seeking behavior among Chinese executives in Mainland China.
   Findings - Results show that the presence of interpersonal trust among
   executives affects the conflict responses for the benefit of
   organization. The results show that task conflict in top management
   teams is positively related to relationship conflict and negatively
   related to agreement-seeking behavior. The data support the view that
   intra-group trust moderates the relationship between agreement-seeking
   behavior and collaborating responses such that high-trust groups will
   have greater collaboration than low-trusting teams. Results also support
   that intra-group trust moderates the relationship between
   agreement-seeking behavior and third party responses such that
   high-trust groups will have greater third-party responses than
   low-trusting teams.
   Research limitations/implications - Self-report measures may have some
   inherent social desirability bias. Despite this potential weakness, this
   study examines Chinese executives and therefore provides insights into
   top management team literature.
   Practical implications - This study contributes to both practicing
   managers as well as to strategic management literature. This study
   suggests that administrators need to focus on interpersonal trust while
   dealing with the outcomes of task and relationship conflict.
   Originality/value - Although the study is related to Chinese executives,
   the findings from the study, that task conflict has its affect on
   interpersonal conflict and agreement-seeking behavior, contribute to the
   strategic decision making literature.},

Abstract = {This article analyses major changes in the regulation of the financial
   sector across Europe over the last three decades. The authors explain
   the timing of major regulatory variation in regulatory outcomes across
   five countries (Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Spain) in terms of
   political calculations on the part of elected elites that involve the
   relationship of financial regulation to other policy areas (including
   monetary policy and pension reform). The first countries to initiate
   major regulatory overhauls in Europe were those in which postwar
   regulatory institutions raised the costs to elected governments of
   imposing monetary austerity in the 1970s. On the other hand, the move to
   create single, politically accountable financial regulators in Britain
   and Germany over the following decades is related by the authors to the
   more radical effort to promote private savings at the expense of
   mandatory pensions in these two countries.},

Pages = {400-415},
Abstract = {If the European Union (EU) has been an effective bulwark against ad hoc
   globalization in any economic domain, we may well find evidence from
   finance, the engine of cross-border economic activity. Yet our study
   revealed little indication of a distinctive EU approach for regulating
   financial services industries. Our findings suggest that European
   decision-makers tried mainly to secure full market integration inside
   the EU rather than shape regulation to meet a common public purpose,
   whether at the EU or global level. The policy framework adopted by the
   EU was essentially modeled on pre-existing United States (US) examples,
   and does not reflect a transatlantic difference in underlying values. We
   put forth several hypotheses about why the EU did not seek to manage
   globalization in the financial services area.},

Journal = {REVIEW OF AFRICAN POLITICAL ECONOMY},

Volume = {37},
Number = {123},
Pages = {61-69},
Abstract = {This article focuses on the complex conceptual and practical terrain
   offered by the concept of `liberation', both analytically and
   practically. It argues that liberation is best considered to be a
   multi-dimensional process, evoking an approach to its study (and to its
   practice) that would take seriously its resonance, for purposes of the
   analysis of Africa, as implicating struggle on the levels of race,
   class, gender, and (democratic) voice. The article then seeks, with
   special reference to South Africa, to suggest the costs that have
   accompanied a collapsing of the meaning of the term `liberation' into a
   mere metaphor for national emancipation from colonial/quasi-colonial and
   racially defined rule. Comfortable as the narrowing of its definition in
   such a way may be to the domestic elites who have succeeded their former
   colonial rulers into possession of formal power, it leaves great scope
   for merely rationalising the imposition of a kind of recolonisation upon
   the territories concerned and ensuring the continued subordination in
   class, gender, and political terms of the vast mass of the ostensibly
   `liberated' population. In sum, in both political and theoretical terms
   the concept `liberation' must be reclaimed so as to permit both more
   precise scientific investigation and more militant and engaged practical
   work.},

Title = {Cultural change or cultural paradox? The continuities and
   discontinuities in Dutch official agency talk},
Journal = {CRITICAL POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {4},
Number = {2},
Pages = {164-184},
Abstract = {This article analyzes Dutch official agency talk over the period of the
   1990s for the purpose of examining culture and cultural change.
   Following from Hood (2000), it applies Grid Group Cultural Theory and
   the New Rhetoric as both complementary and competing perspectives on
   culture. It shows that, while the complementary perspective enables
   patterns in rhetorical styles to be associated with particular cultural
   ways of life, the New Rhetoric as a competing perspective can also
   identify similar patterns together with the cultural paradoxes of talk.
   Furthermore, the variation in Dutch talk over time is found to be
   primarily associated with changes in the rhetorical situation rather
   than the rhetorical reactions predicted by Grid Group Cultural Theory.
   More generally, the article demonstrates the surprisingly rich and
   nuanced cultural findings that can be drawn from official government
   documents. These include findings about both the durable cultural
   features of talk and their fragmentary and paradoxical aspects},

Journal = {POLITICS RELIGION \& IDEOLOGY},

Pages = {289-310},
Abstract = {The `woman question' played a central role in the rhetoric and debates
   surrounding the Islamic Revolution in Iran, yet the precise outcome of
   the woman question is still debated. While some scholars argue that the
   revolution has repressed women by forcing them into traditional roles,
   others argue that the revolution has liberated women by mobilising them
   in the public sphere. This article claims that the revolution tried to
   create a female subject who was simultaneously pious and politically
   active, and that the creation of this particular subjectivity exceeds
   and defies the categories and dichotomies of earlier scholars. To make
   this claim, the article utilises both an intellectual history of `the
   woman question' and the interpretivist trends of women themselves,
   showing how the ideal, revolutionary Islamist women was discursively
   produced and enforced. This unique subjectivity gives rise to a
   productive tension in that women are using this new identity to act in
   ways that are both beyond and contrary to what the Islamist regime
   initially anticipated. In this way, the subjectivity has destabilised
   so-called Islamic norms as well as the legitimacy of the regime itself.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},

Pages = {339-355},
Abstract = {The term `green citizenship' is used with respect to a wide range of
   competing conceptions of political action toward environmental goals.
   But different conceptions in fact address different environmental and
   institutional circumstances. Green citizenship should thus be understood
   as complex, and should be conceived as the ability to judge what forms
   of political activity are called for, given the details of context. The
   theory of green citizenship therefore ought to provide and explain
   exemplary cases of the exercise of green political judgement.},

Title = {Governance without governance' 1: how nature policy was democratized in
   the Netherlands},
Journal = {CRITICAL POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {4},
Number = {4},
Pages = {344-361},
Abstract = {Trends in governance, including a changing role for the state and
   increasing civil society participation, are often seen as promising ways
   to achieve democratic legitimacy. The prominent presence of these claims
   and intentions in the new Dutch nature policy plan, `Nature for People,
   People for Nature', stimulated us to look more closely into how this
   plan came about. Our analysis shows that the process started with the
   organization of several informal participatory processes, which involved
   not only traditional but also new actors. However, it ended in a fairly
   traditional way, with limited participation, which involved mostly
   traditional actors, and which was strictly orchestrated by central
   government. Based on these findings, we argue that although the plan
   itself was clearly intended to achieve participatory governance, the
   participatory characteristics of the process can be questioned. For this
   reason, the case may be seen as one of `governance without governance'.
   The article ends by discussing the implications of these findings for
   democratic legitimacy.},

Abstract = {This contribution argues that social policies ameliorate poor short-run
   and long-run socioeconomic conditions (e. g., unemployment, poverty,
   inequality, and dissatisfaction), thereby indirectly reducing terrorist
   activity. The authors empirically assess the influence of social
   policies (indicated by social spending and welfare regime variables) on
   homegrown terrorism for fifteen Western European countries during the
   1980-2003 period. The authors find that higher social spending in
   certain fields (health, unemployment benefits, and active labor market
   programs) is associated with a significant reduction in homegrown
   terrorism, while spending in other fields (e. g., public housing) is
   not. Moderate evidence furthermore indicates that the different worlds
   of welfare capitalism differently affect homeland terrorism. Social
   democratic welfare regimes that create low levels of market dependence
   are on average less prone to domestic terrorist activity. The findings
   suggest that homegrown terrorism in Western Europe may also be fought by
   higher spending in certain fields and more generous welfare regimes.},

Abstract = {The Ukrainian opposition faced one of the greatest degrees of
   state-backed violence in the second wave of democratization of
   post-communist states with only Serbia experiencing similar cases of
   assassinations and repression of the youth Otpor NGO. In the 2004
   Ukrainian elections the opposition maintained a strategy of non-violence
   over the longest protest period of 17 days but was prepared to use force
   if it had been attacked. The regime attempted to suppress the Orange
   Revolution using security forces. Covert and overt Russian external
   support was extensive and in the case of Ukraine and Georgia the
   European Union (EU) did not intervene with a membership offer that had
   the effect of emboldening the opposition in Central-Eastern Europe. This
   article surveys five state-backed violent strategies used in Ukraine's
   2004 elections: inciting regional and inter-ethnic conflict,
   assassinations, violence against the opposition, counter-revolution and
   use of the security forces. The article does not cover external
   Russian-backed violence in the 2004 elections unique to Ukraine that the
   author has covered elsewhere. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd on

Abstract = {Political units often spatially depend in their policy choices on other
   units. This also holds in dyadic settings where, as in much of
   international relations research, analysis focuses on the interaction or
   relation between a pair or dyad of two political units. Yet, with few
   exceptions, social scientists have analyzed contagion in monadic
   datasets only, consisting of individual political units. This article
   categorizes all possible forms of spatial effect modeling in both
   undirected and directed dyadic data, where it is possible to distinguish
   the source and the target of interaction (for example,
   exporter/importer, aggressor/victim, and so on). This approach enables
   scholars to formulate and test novel mechanisms of contagion, thus
   ideally paving the way for Studies analyzing spatial dependence between
   dyads of political units. To illustrate the modeling flexibility gained
   from an understanding of the full set of specification options for
   spatial effects in dyadic data, we examine the diffusion of bilateral
   investment treaties between developed and developing countries, building
   and extending on Elkins, Guzman, and Simmons's 2006 study. However, we
   come to different conclusions about the channels through which bilateral
   investment treaties diffuse. Rather than a capital-importing country
   being influenced by the total number of BITS signed by other capital
   importers, as modeled in their original article, we find that a
   capital-importing country is more likely to sign a BIT with a capital
   exporter only if other competing capital importers have signed BITs with
   this very same capital exporter. Similarly, other capital exporters'
   BITs with a specific capital importer influence an exporter's incentive
   to agree on a BIT with the very same capital importer.},

Abstract = {The end of the Cold War has reinvigorated academic interest in the
   regions of the world, as well as in the regional powers and potential
   regional hegemons that inhabit them. Yet, what is missing, for regional
   research to be meaningful and successful, is a well-defined
   understanding of the variance of regional powers. An anomaly yet to be
   explained by the existent literature is, for instance, that these
   states, unlike what might be typical, and expected, for traditional
   hegemons, do not seem to provide public goods, such as order and
   stability, nor do they always have an extraordinary impact on the
   behavior of other states in their region. The driving impulse of this
   study is, thus, the question of why an `achievement-expectations gap'
   can be observed in almost all cases of potential regional hegemons. This
   article, in specific, then makes the argument that in order to deal with
   this challenge, we need to move away from the implied assumption about
   the uniformity of these actors and, rather, that we should begin to
   deliberately think about the concept of a regional power as a variable
   that can take on different forms and values. The suggestion of a
   typology to study these important second-tier states is, therefore, at
   the heart of this article.},

Abstract = {Modernisation of the fire service in England was intended to drive fire
   performance upwards through the implementation of an extensive
   managerial reform programme. This article explores the impact of
   modernisation using panel data for 46 English local fire authorities
   between 2001 and 2006. The panel regression results suggest that in the
   post-modernisation period the performance of English fire authorities
   improved relative to their previous levels. Further analysis indicates
   that the introduction of the Integrated Personal Development System and
   Integrated Risk Management Plans, in particular, is associated with
   improvements on key measures of performance.},

Abstract = {This paper studies the provision of public goods in open-source software
   support forums. Data from the Italian TeX Users Group were analysed to
   find individual motives for offering help. Using this methodology, we
   were able to split the forum participants into a small intrinsically
   motivated core group and a much larger group motivated mainly on the
   basis of reciprocity. The motives of the two groups were largely
   complementary and jointly produced a situation where the overwhelming
   majority of questions received an appropriate answer. At the same time,
   the core group played a fundamental role and was the key in explaining
   the forum's success. Without this group, the forum's performance would
   have been considerably diminished, probably down to a level that would
   not justify its existence.},

Abstract = {This article argues that the core Clausewitzean proposition that war
   tends to extremes no longer applies in contemporary wars. Instead an
   alternative proposition is put forward that war tends to be long lasting
   and inconclusive. The article adopts the Clausewitzean method and
   derives this proposition from the logic of a redefinition of war. It
   also shows the relevance of many of Clausewitz's central tenets if
   reinterpreted. Thus contemporary wars are about politics, not policy;
   they are instrumental and rational but not reasonable (in the sense of
   being in accordance with universal values); and they bring together a
   trinity of motivations (reason, chance and passion) but not a trinity of
   the state, the generals and the people since new wars are fought by a
   range of nonstate actors. In particular, international missions in
   crisis zones should take seriously what Clausewitz says about the
   importance of political control, the character of the commander and the
   crucial significance of moral forces.},

Journal = {POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {31},
Number = {5},
Pages = {717-738},

Abstract = {The article examines the role of collective identification processes in
   the politicization of Russian migrants in Germany. Building on the
   assumption that politicized collective identity (PCI) is a dual
   identity, the authors predicted and found that dual identification as
   both Russian and German was positively related to politicization among
   members of the Russian minority in Germany. This relationship held up
   even when the influences of several sociodemographic variables, past
   political activity, and other forms of collective identification were
   statistically controlled. In addition, perceived maltreatment of Russian
   migrants in Germany moderated the relationship between dual
   identification and politicization in keeping with the theoretical
   assumption that the development of PCI presupposes high awareness of
   shared grievances. Finally, dual identification was unrelated to
   acceptance of political violence, but positively related to
   self-restriction to peaceful political means. The constructive role of
   politicization driven by dual identification in social integration is
   discussed.},

Title = {Bureaucratic Infrastructure Matters: the Case of the Fight against the
   Organized Crime in Mexico},
Journal = {REVISTA DEL CLAD REFORMA Y DEMOCRACIA},
Year = {2010},
Number = {48},
Pages = {51+},

Abstract = {On the one hand, political corruption has very negative effects on the
   economy and development of countries and societies. Perceived corruption
   is significantly associated with less satisfaction with democracy, less
   satisfaction with government, more of a sense that breaking rules is
   justifiable, less institutional trust, less interpersonal trust, and
   less interest in politics. On the other hand, organized crime has a
   pernicious impact on governance and economic development.
   Organized crime and political corruption go together because mafia type
   activities tend to erode the integrity of those holding a public office,
   including those responsible for upholding the rule of law. Where
   organized crime groups are powerful, legislation, policy-making and
   legal rulings no longer serve the general interest but the interests of
   the few. These dark networks are very dangerous for the rule of law and
   can produce failed states. Tolerating organized crime implies letting
   grand corruption penetrate into government and destroy the bedrock of
   the State. The research question of this article is: Is it possible to
   fight against the organized crime without a professional and
   meritocratic bureaucracy? The hypothesis is that it is essential to have
   a meritocratic State infrastructure so that the fight against dark
   networks will be effective.
   According to different studies, well performing police services and
   independent, professional judiciaries seem to make a difference in
   controlling organized crime. In order to validate these statements, it
   has been chosen the case of Mexico's fight against drugs. This war is
   having serious strategic problems and risks a possible failure.
   Following the line of discussion, the author believes that one of the
   most important causes of this situation is the lack of a bureaucratic
   police system. It has been studied the human resources management of the
   Mexican police and it has been found very serious breakdown in the
   system.
   Building on this research and previous scholarly studies of State
   formation processes, the basic proposition of this paper is that a
   bureaucratic infrastructure affects institutions and social outcomes.
   Mexico's fight against drugs shows us how important is having a
   meritocratic and professional police when confronting organized crime.},

   nurture by comparing expansionist lawmaking in the European Court of
   Justice (ECJ) and the Andean Tribunal of Justice (ATJ), the ECJ's
   jurisdictional cousin and the third most active international court. We
   argue that international judges are more likely to become expansionist
   lawmakers where they are supported by substate interlocutors and
   compliance constituencies, including government officials, advocacy
   networks, national judges, and administrative agencies. This comparison
   of two structurally identical international courts calls into question
   prevailing explanations of ECJ lawmaking, and it suggests that
   prevailing scholarship puts too much emphasis on the self-interested
   power-seeking of judges, the importance of institutional design
   features, and the preferences of governments to explain lawmaking by
   international courts.},

Abstract = {Terrorism is designed to draw attention to particular issues and causes.
   Yet, the incidence of credit-taking (announcing one's responsibility for
   acts of terror) varies even though anonymity can undermine the clarity
   of the intended messages. This article offers an explanation of the
   variation in credit-taking that emphasizes how the competitive context
   in which groups operate shapes terrorists groups' need to cultivate
   support for their activities. Increasing numbers of terrorist
   organizations make it difficult for the supporters of terrorism to
   reward the perpetrators of particular attacks with their backing. Since
   such support is critical to the proper functioning of terrorist
   organizations, groups use claims of responsibility to distinguish
   themselves from those that had no hand in the violence. Consequently,
   variation in the probability of credit-taking fluctuates as a function
   of the number of active terrorist groups in a given theater of
   operations. This argument is contrasted with theories that suggest
   credit-taking is influenced by: the ideological mix of terrorist
   organizations; the willingness of governments to respond to terrorism
   using military force; state sponsorship; the depth of communal
   grievances; and the use of suicide attacks. The results, based on an
   analysis of transnational terrorism events conducted in the Israeli
   theater of operations between 1968 and 2004, suggest that competitive
   context is a consistently strong predictor of credit-taking. By
   implication, the results point to the utility of counter-terrorism
   strategies that interfere with the transmission of information between
   terrorist organizations and their supporters.},

Abstract = {While Sino-Japanese relations are quite stable presently, it was as
   recent as 2004-2005 that the two nations slid into the worst bilateral
   quagmire in decades. When in 2007 Japan was China's third largest
   trading partner and China surpassed the US to become Japan's largest
   trading partner, what is eating these two otherwise very pragmatic
   traders? History, nationalism and face, enabled by recent changes in the
   strategic environment, are the factors that have been most salient in
   bringing about the plunge in Sino-Japanese relations in 2004-05 and
   though Sino-Japanese relations have been much better since, these
   factors hang like a storm front over Sino-Japanese relations today.},

Abstract = {Exploration of the migration history of the community of Cabanaconde, in
   Peru's southern highlands, and the impact of transnational migration on
   the fiesta system calls attention to the role of the fiesta in
   strengthening migrants' ties to the networks they draw on to migrate and
   adapt to their new settings in the United States. It also suggests that
   the transnationalization of the fiesta contributes to an emerging
   division of villagers into those who have access to migrant networks and
   those who do not. By serving as a public showcase for Cabanenos'
   positions in migrant networks, the fiesta not only intensifies economic
   and social divisions within the community but also underpins the
   exclusiveness of those networks and reminds them and their fellow
   villagers of their new social status as both transnational villagers and
   global cosmopolitans.},

Abstract = {Using data from the International Social Survey Programme, this research
   investigated asymmetric attitudes of ethnic minorities and majorities
   towards their country and explored the impact of human development,
   ethnic diversity, and social inequality as country-level moderators of
   national attitudes. In line with the general hypothesis of ethnic
   asymmetry, we found that ethnic, linguistic, and religious majorities
   were more identified with the nation and more strongly endorsed
   nationalist ideology than minorities (H1, 33 countries). Multilevel
   analyses revealed that this pattern of asymmetry was moderated by
   country-level characteristics: the difference between minorities and
   majorities was greatest in ethnically diverse countries and in
   egalitarian, low inequality contexts. We also observed a larger positive
   correlation between ethnic subgroup identification and both national
   identification and nationalism for majorities than for minorities (H2,
   20 countries). A stronger overall relationship between ethnic and
   national identification was observed in countries with a low level of
   human development. The greatest minority-majority differences in the
   relationship between ethnic identification and national attitudes were
   found in egalitarian countries with a strong welfare state tradition.},

Abstract = {Competition is often prescribed as an efficiency-enhancing tonic for
   ailing health systems. However, critics claim that competition
   exacerbates socioeconomic inequality in health care. This claim is
   tested in relation to the ``internal market{''} reforms of the English
   National Health Service (NHS) from 1991 to 97, which injected a small
   dose of hospital competition into a state-funded, state-owned health
   system responsible for more than 90\% of national health expenditure.
   Our dependent variables are NHS hospital utilization rates for hip
   replacement and heart revascularization in 8,500 English small areas
   from 1991 to 2001. We estimate small area level associations between
   deprivation and hospital utilization, allowing for need and supply
   variables. We then compare year-by-year inequality differences between
   areas with ``potentially competitive{''} and ``noncompetitive{''} local
   hospital markets, as competition was phased in and out. No evidence is
   found that competition had any effect on socioeconomic health care
   inequality.},

Abstract = {The association between quality assessment and status attainment is
   fundamental in the sociology of markets. However, past literature failed
   to explain status dynamics such as mobility in the status order where
   highly uncertain goods make quality hard to measure. This paper
   contributes to the understanding of this relationship by identifying
   various social mechanisms behind quality evaluation processes. It also
   explores why certain products are considered to be more valuable than
   others. The results demonstrate that only through exchange relations and
   active participation in the marketplace (what I call status actions) can
   actors affect the social definition of what are perceived as
   high-quality products. The results also provide evidence of two major
   market outcomes: conservativism and centralization. The findings improve
   the understanding of the evolution and dynamics of status in uncertain
   markets from both micro- and macro-sociology of markets. These processes
   are illustrated in a study of the art market in Israel.},

Abstract = {The Human Rights Act (HRA) 1998 s. 4 declaration of incompatibility was
   designed to preserve and maintain the supremacy of parliament and
   thereby reinforce the superiority of the democratic actors within the UK
   constitution. Despite this, the author will illustrate a process of
   juridification - the replacing of politics with the formality of law and
   legal decisions - and will argue that this has undermined the protection
   of civil liberties and the control of the executive in the UK. The
   strengthening of democracy through a genuine `declaration of
   incompatibility' rather than the current de facto judicial strike-down
   power will be advocated.},

Volume = {30},
Number = {2},
Pages = {98-104},

Abstract = {In the first sections of this article I give a simple and general
   account of critical discourse analysis (CDA) and how it might contribute
   to the theoretical and methodological repertoire of political studies
   through its discourse-dialectical theory of how discourse figures as an
   aspect of social practices without reducing those practices to
   discourse. In the final section I give a short illustrative example of
   how a CDA approach to detailed textual analysis might also be applied to
   specific texts (or groups of texts) in the political arena: in the
   example I take the press release in which the national UK government
   heralded its recent `empowerment' White Paper, `Communities in Control'.},

Abstract = {Evidence suggests that the quality of grassroots political reform varies
   throughout rural China from fair elections to electoral manipulation.
   This reflects an uneven supply of reforms. However, top-down
   implementation is not a complete measure of success when it comes to the
   introduction of grassroots reform. Rural folks are good judges of
   institutional qualities, such as procedural fairness. It is their
   attitudes that are associated with the support for democracy. This is
   called the supply and support model. I modify and apply this model to
   rural China, and show that support for democratic institutions and
   ideals can develop within an authoritarian regime such as the People's
   Republic of China.},

Title = {Third Sector and Social Service Delivery: the ``Black Box{''} of
   Citizen's Participation in Public Management and Its Impact on
   Corporative Welfare Regimes},

Abstract = {The article analyzes a type of citizen participation in public
   managenet: third sector delivery of public social services through
   contracting-out. Acknowledging the increasing importance this mechanism
   has and taking concrete experiences in Uruguay and Spain, the paper
   describes its main characteristics and challenges.
   The main goal of this exercise is to determine to what extent the
   participation ideals that tend to be associated to contracting-out are
   actually present in the discourse and everyday practices of the actors
   involved in public policies. At the same time, the document tries to
   identify the risks related to contracting-out that can influence in a
   negative way the confirmation of the most optimistic hypotheses about
   the democratizing role of third sector.
   Additionally, the paper explores the place that contracting-out of
   public social services through third sector organization has on the
   welfare systems of both countries, questioning its importance and trying
   to determine the threats and alerts that arise from regulation and
   accountability mechanisms that are being used. Based on evidence from
   several previous studies, the article shows important deficit in the
   evaluation of third sector organizations' work in this specific type of
   participation in public management, confirming that the ``good
   intentions{''} usually associated to the third sector are actually an
   obstacle for the effective development of control mechanisms in two
   consolidated democratic regimes like Spain and Uruguay.
   Finally, using empirical evidence, the document discusses the meanings
   of these findings and, particularly, the impacts that this ``black
   box{''} of citizen participation has on social protection systems. The
   comparison between Spain and Uruguay offers several opportunities for
   the interpretation of the meanings that citizen participation on public
   administration could have in countries with weak civil societies and
   corporative models of welfare.},

Abstract = {This article reviews the European Union's policy towards Asia since
   2001, when an ambitious Communication from the European Commission
   suggested that the EU should play a political and security role in the
   region commensurate with its economic strength. After assessing a number
   of political and security issues in Asia, the article concludes that the
   EU has had little or no impact on the major geopolitical issues but that
   it is making some impact on security issues of lesser importance. The
   article also touches on integration as a contribution to security. It
   reviews the limited progress in Asian integration and suggests that the
   basic criteria for integration are missing in Asia. Some aspects of the
   EU model, however, might be useful for Asian countries wishing to move
   forward towards closer integration. International Politics (2010) 47,

Abstract = {This article examines how the complexities of the Sudeten German
   expulsion and resettlement of the former Sudetenland spawned the notion
   that certain groups of people were unreliable or suspicious and,
   therefore, unwanted inhabitants. The intolerance and suspicion that
   setters, local and central officials, and others voiced toward different
   groups and actions directly related to the expulsion of Germans. The
   rapid influx of new settlers in search of German property and social
   mobility had a destabilizing effect on the region as well. The category
   of unwanted elements changed over time and reflected not necessarily the
   arrival of particular people but the problems unleashed by expulsion and
   settlement. The emergence of this category demonstrates how ethnic
   cleansing affected not only the targeted ethnic group but also how that
   process transformed people and places. This article offers new insights
   into the increasing body of literature on this topic in Central and
   Eastern European history by expanding the focus beyond Czechs and
   Germans. By examining a range of different sources, it also demonstrates
   that local actors as much as central ones created and sustained
   repressive attitudes in the borderlands.},

Abstract = {In recent studies of public management reform in France, Italy, and
   Spain inspired by historical institutionalism, the Napoleonic tradition
   is cast as a causal factor whose overwhelming strength explains how
   these countries' reforms proceed and finish. This symposium pursues the
   same research interest in the politics of public management reform and
   goal of understanding how reforms begin, proceed, and finish in these
   countries. However, the features of this research project include (1) a
   focus on instances of public management policymaking, (2) original
   research on public management reform episodes in each country, and (3)
   explanatory research arguments that place causation within events. Based
   on a comparison of explanatory research arguments developed in each case
   study, the symposium's conclusion extends earlier institutional
   processualist accounts of causal tendencies of public management
   policymaking and offers a critique of the historical institutionalist
   studies mentioned earlier.},

Abstract = {Given far-reaching changes in the legal systems of East Central Europe
   since the mid-1990s, one might expect administrative court judges to
   have modified the way in which they decide cases, in particular by
   embracing less formalistic adjudication strategies. Relying on an
   original dataset of over one thousand business-related cases from the
   Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland, this article shows that - despite
   some variation across countries and time - judges have largely failed to
   respond to the incentives contained in the new constitutional
   frameworks. They continue to adopt the most-locally-applicable-rule
   approach and are reluctant to apply general principles of law or to rely
   on Dworkinian `policies' in deciding hard cases. The analysis links
   these weak institutional effects to the role of constitutional courts,
   case overload and educational legacies.},

Abstract = {Chance is a prominent feature in the processes by which people become
   aware of job openings, yet current theories-which emphasize the
   instrumental job search activities of workers-do not provide a framework
   for understanding the unsolicited receipt of job leads. The concept of
   serendipity is discussed as a way to understand the role that chance
   plays in informal job finding. Interviews with 42 workers in an
   engineering firm reveal that job information often comes from unlikely
   sources in unexpected situations. Moreover, nationally representative
   survey data are used to assess the non-random experience of serendipity,
   finding that personal, contextual and relational characteristics
   structure the unsolicited receipt of job leads. The results from this
   mixed methods approach help to supplement the current theories of job
   matching and offer a promising research agenda for future investigations
   of the conditions under which serendipitous job finding is likely to
   occur.},

Abstract = {Weak states often instigate war against the strong, sometimes repeatedly
   so. I explain this phenomenon by recourse to the nature of the
   contestants' foreign alignments. Pivotal patronage, balanced patronage,
   competitive patronage and one-sided patronage are offered as ideal
   types, and five rivalry cases are introduced to highlight the variations
   in the willingness and opportunity for war initiation by the weaker side
   and the intensity and duration of the subsequent conflict (should it
   occur). Whether the pertinent international system is unipolar, bipolar
   or multipolar distinguishes the alignment types, which in turn point to
   the concerns for relative gain and credible commitment that motivate the
   weaker side's decisions. International Politics (2010) 47, 163-185. doi:

Abstract = {How can we integrate the agential influence of state preferences and the
   structural influence of social environments in models of change within
   international organisations? Through an analysis of the central aspects
   of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) initiative, this article
   argues that in isolation neither of the two dominant accounts of
   international organisations - the principal-agent (PA) and
   constructivist approaches - is able to adequately capture the
   progression of the initiative. Rather., I show that the evolution of the
   PRSP initiative is best conceptualised as an Archerian morphogenic
   cycle, whose unfolding can be understood by synthesising elements of the
   PA and constructivist approaches. The morphogenic approach provides an
   analytic framework capable of tracking the process of multilevel
   feedback from state socialisation through to policy operationalisation,
   and for the input of creditors, the International Financial Institutions
   (IFIs), and borrowing countries to be mapped. Journal of International

Abstract = {While the relationship between intergovernmental organizations (IGOs)
   and conflict has captured the attention of international relations
   scholars for decades, the empirical results of this research agenda have
   presented contradictory conclusions regarding the pacifying effect
   normally attributed to IGOs. We address these contradictions by
   refocusing primarily on potential IGO effects on low-severity conflicts.
   We examine new states in the postcommunist space spanning Europe and
   Central Asia as a useful research site to explore these relationships in
   the post-Cold War era. We argue that especially in the case of newly
   emerging states, where there is little institutional memory and
   long-term experience in foreign affairs, IGOs expose differential policy
   preferences between members, and such information should be associated
   with the likelihood of increased low levels of conflict. We find a
   strong association between shared IGO membership and low severity
   conflict, a significant relationship between low and high severity
   conflict, and differences between IGO membership effects on low versus
   high severity conflict, consistent with our theoretical argument.},

Abstract = {Despite the sustained effects of catastrophic economic policies, a
   terrible civil war, and a major decline in international prices, coffee
   production in Peru has increased phenomenally during the past decade and
   is now the nation's primary agricultural export. The increase makes Peru
   unusual among coffee-producing countries, and it can be explained in
   large part in terms of the response of small coffee growers to the
   disruption of traditional marketing networks. The experience of a small
   cooperative in the Department Of Junin reveals that the alternative
   networks developed with the assistance of international nongovernmental
   organizations have not only provided coffee growers guaranteed prices
   that are higher than the international average and strengthened their
   position in the market but also facilitated improvements to the
   productive system and better management of natural resources.},

Abstract = {Utopian theory has long challenged the conventions of private property.
   Drawing on two case studies, this article explores utopian practices
   that challenge dominant property narratives. These practices range from
   the mundane to the profound and occur inside the domestic, economic,
   interpersonal and ideological structures of the cases in question. These
   cases are Riverside and Centrepoint Communities: two intentional
   communities, comprised of people who have chosen to live and work
   together for a common purpose, are critical of current socioeconomic
   (and ideological, spiritual and interpersonal) norms and who intend to
   create a better life for their members.},

Journal = {POLITICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {30},
Number = {1},
Pages = {70-77},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Recently several thinkers have endorsed compulsion or other measures to
   increase turnout and revitalise democracy. This article argues that such
   measures are misguided, because lower turnout (even if unequal across
   social groups) is not necessarily undemocratic - indeed, it may serve
   democratic values by, for example, making it more likely that decisions
   really are made by the relevant constituency, with those most affected
   getting more say. Encouraging others to vote, or even to turn out, runs
   the risk of distorting electoral outcomes. If there is no clear
   democratic case for compulsion, then we should not risk even small
   limits on individual liberty.},

Journal = {AFRICAN AFFAIRS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {109},
Number = {434},
Pages = {115-134},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Supermarkets are often seen as marking the transition of food economies
   from traditional, informal, low-quality markets to more sophisticated,
   quality-based modes of food retailing. Focusing on Lusaka, Zambia's
   capital, this article critically assesses the claim that supermarkets
   `revolutionize' food economies in Africa. While supermarkets have been
   successful in expanding their investment reach in Zambia, the article
   shows that they are not the only players in the food economy, neither
   are they the most dominant. The article argues for a more critical
   engagement with supermarkets and their role in urban Africa by drawing
   attention to contextual changes in the local food economy and factors in
   the regional political economy that drive/resist the process. It argues
   that the `supermarket revolution myopia' sidelines evidence of other
   potentially transformative processes by which the transition of food
   economies is made possible, and shows that `informal' food markets, made
   up of complex networks of interaction, present a considerable challenge
   to the claims that supermarkets transform food economies in urban
   Africa. Transitions in the regulation, governance, and physical
   infrastructure of these markets suggest that they are progressively more
   resilient and competitive, despite the growth of supermarkets.},

Abstract = {Following a democratic transition in 1992, Ghana has made significant
   efforts to promote a liberal democratic culture and system of
   government. This paper provides an analysis of the extent to which
   Ghana's liberal democratic process is being consolidated, focusing on
   the role and contribution of the media, civil society and state
   political institutions to this process. It is argued that the country
   has made significant strides towards its goal of consolidating a
   democratic process and culture. This is evident in the five successive
   elections that it has held since 1992, in improvements in human and
   political rights, in the independence of various institutions of
   government such as the Electoral Commission and in the significant role
   played by the media and civil society organisations. Nonetheless, there
   are a number of constraints and challenges that need to be addressed in
   order to sustain the gains that the country has chalked up in the
   democratic consolidation process.},

Abstract = {Mwai Kibaki's election in 2002 raised enormous hopes: after 24 years'
   repressive and corrupt rule by his predecessor Daniel Arap Moi, an
   apparently reformist opposition leader had been democratically elected
   president. The fight against corruption stood high among his electoral
   promises. Unfortunately, a year and a half after his election, the
   enormous Anglo-Leasing corruption scandal, and Kibaki's failure to
   prosecute the ministers involved, marked the end of the anti-corruption
   war. Building on existing Kenyan literature and international relations
   scholarship on transnational advocacy networks, this article
   systematically analyses the impact of both international and domestic
   pressures exerted on Kibaki to fight corruption. It confirms that this
   combination of pressures explains Kibaki's initial dismissal of the
   ministers involved. However, analysis of the `counter-pressures' is also
   necessary to understand the crisis in all its complexity. Desperately
   seeking electoral support for the 2007 election, Kibaki acquiesced to
   ethnically based counter-pressures exerted by the dismissed ministers,
   and reinstated them.},

Abstract = {Negotiations in the European Union (EU) Council of Ministers are highly
   secretive, so outsiders have limited knowledge of the factors that
   determine bargaining power there. However, previous research has shown
   that gains and losses in these negotiations are relatively equally
   shared amongst the EU members and that the influence of exogenous power
   resources such as votes are more important than endogenous resources
   such as bargaining skill (Bailer 2004). Based on findings of the current
   literature on bargaining success in EU negotiations, I suggest several
   areas for future research - in particular regarding the partisan
   preferences of EU governments and the way this influences their
   coalition formation behaviour. More attention should also be paid to the
   context of these negotiations, their differing meeting frequencies and
   the resulting reciprocity logics. However, more efforts to generate and
   analyse data on negotiation positions will be necessary in order to see
   what bargaining power can achieve in the Council.},

Title = {Women, Muscular Nationalism and Hinduism in India: Roop Kanwar and the
   Fire Protests},
Journal = {POLITICS RELIGION \& IDEOLOGY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {11},

Pages = {271-287},
Abstract = {This article unpacks the manner in which women/womanhood circulates
   within an uniquely Hindu interpretation of a particular gendered vision
   of nation that I term `muscular nationalism'. Muscular nationalism
   centres the values of martial prowess, physical strength, moral
   fortitude and the readiness to go to battle against groups defined as
   enemies of the nation. Further, these values are most frequently
   expressed by a male body. The relationship between women/womanhood and
   muscular nationalism is dynamic. This nation as woman can take multiple
   forms; it can be imagined as powerful mother or vulnerable virgin or
   warrior goddess. Whether mother or virgin or goddess, chastity and
   purity are important components of this imagination and nation as woman
   impacts real women's lives through ideas of honour. In muscular
   nationalism this focus on the purity and chastity of female bodies stems
   from their role as border guards. By border guards I mean the notion
   that the boundaries separating `we the people' from `them' are
   represented by chaste women's bodies. Put another way, this line of
   thinking argues that our women are chaste and pure, yours are not. This
   is the difference that separates our nation from yours. Women's role as
   border guards requires that their purity be vigilantly guarded. The
   story of women/womanhood in Hindutva or Hindu muscular nationalism which
   unfolds in this essay is rooted in the assumptions described above. By
   drawing on interviews with women in the Hindu nationalist Rashtriya
   Sevika Samiti - with reference to women's involvement in the Bharatiya
   Janata Party, Vishwa Hindu Parishad and the Shiv Sena - this paper
   contextualizes the role of women in Hindutva. Then it goes on to unpack
   the 1987 immolation of Roop Kanwar as well as cultural protests against
   Deepa Mehta's film Fire to illustrate the contested location of female
   bodies in this ideology. This analysis indicates that many women are
   certainly politically active in Hindu muscular nationalism; however, the
   vision of femininity driving the discourse around Roop Kanwar and the
   resistance against Fire reveals the limitations of an activism embedded
   in a context of a rigid expectation of female chastity and virtue.},

Journal = {PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION},

Number = {2},
Pages = {496-512},
Abstract = {The literature on comitology has largely ignored the European
   Commission's actual behaviour in the daily workings of the numerous
   comitology committees that were designed to control it. On the basis of
   survey data of Danish and Dutch representatives on nearly all comitology
   committees, this paper investigates the Commission's role in the system.
   We find that the Commission acts both as a mediator and as a policy
   advocate, but to varying degrees. We take a first step towards
   understanding this behaviour by an inspection of four arguments found in
   the literature on comitology and the Commission: the constraining or
   enabling impact of the comitology procedures; the institutional position
   of the responsible Directorate-General; the nature of the cases dealt
   with by the committees and, finally, the intensity of the member states'
   preferences in relation to the committees' cases. In comitology, each of
   these arguments shapes the mediating or the advocating behaviour of the
   Commission.},

Title = {Trouble with champions: local public sector-third sector partnerships
   and the future prospects for collaborative governance in the UK},
Journal = {POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {31},
Number = {6},
Pages = {613-630},
Abstract = {In Britain, the former Labour government employed a range of
   collaborative governance initiatives to get public sector officers
   (PSOs) and third sector champions (TSCs) working together successfully.
   This article draws upon evidence from a series of policy seminars
   undertaken in a subregion of North East England to explore the strengths
   and weaknesses of inter-and intra-sector relationships. The article
   shows that PSOs' perceptions of the `troublesomeness' of TSCs arise
   from, firstly, difficulties in communicating effectively with the third
   sector because of TSCs' inability to represent sector-wide interests
   effectively. Secondly, because many TSCs are unwilling to conform to
   public sector protocol, this leads to accusations of unprofessional
   practice. The article considers whether the perception of TSCs as
   troublesome can be interpreted as a convenient device when PSOs are
   reticent about yielding control over the delivery of public sector
   services to the third sector. In the context of significant reductions
   in public sector funding by the new coalition government, the article
   concludes that the landscape of partnership working and prospects for
   collaborative governance will change significantly - but not necessarily
   always to the detriment of inter-sector relationships.},

Abstract = {In conflict situations the protagonists are driven by rival visions of
   the past. The protracted conflict between Israelis and Palestinians is a
   particularly extreme case to illustrate this point. In protracted
   conflict like the Israeli-Palestinian conflict historians themselves are
   acting as combatants. In this regard, the article argues that history
   writing, particularly in the cases of protracted conflicts, constitutes
   an important part of the construction and reconstruction of security
   discourses whether by supporting mainstream security discourses or by
   challenging them. By discussing the role of history writing in the
   securitization process, this article aims to contribute to the
   centuries-long debates over the history-writing-politics nexus by taking
   a security studies perspective.},

   and Spain in Southern Europe, and Argentina, Uruguay and Chile in the
   Southern Cone of Latin Americaaddressed the legacy of human rights
   violations under authoritarian rule during the transition to democracy
   and beyond. It is argued that, while the international and regional
   context or zeitgeist helped frame the issue and the expectations and
   actions of the various players involved, domestic conditions were
   crucial in shaping these processes. Specifically, we look at the
   transitional context and authoritarian legacies and broader historical
   legacies. The second half of the essay focuses on the `politics of
   memory' and how this relates to transitional justice efforts.},

Abstract = {Embryonic stem cell research and research cloning are issues of great
   public and political conflict in many countries. The author of this
   study analyses whether public ethical debates on these issues in Great
   Britain and Germany provided the grounds for societal control and
   political governance of the development of science. She concludes that
   `ethical debates' did not counter a commitment to scientific `progress'.
   On the contrary, in both countries public discourse, especially a
   discourse in terms of `ethics', was a medium in which an imperative of
   scientific progress, on the one hand, and concerns about, or opposition
   to, scientific endeavor, on the other, could coexist. `Ethical'
   problematizations of these issues created a discursive space for the
   articulation of anxiety or conflicts and the formation of an `ethical
   viewpoint, without, however, challenging an imperative of scientific
   `progress'.},

Abstract = {This article investigates how concepts from the field of public policy,
   in particular the Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF) initially
   introduced by Sabatier and Jenkins-Smith, can be applied to the study of
   foreign policy analysis. Using a most similar comparative case studies
   design, we examine Switzerland's foreign policy toward South Africa
   under apartheid for the period from 1968 to 1994 and compare it with the
   Swiss position toward Iraq after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990,
   when the Swiss government imposed-for the first time-comprehensive
   economic sanctions against another state. The application of the ACF
   shows that a dominant advocacy coalition in Swiss foreign policy toward
   South Africa prevented a major policy change in Swiss-South African
   relations despite external pressure from the international and national
   political levels. Actually, quite the opposite could be observed: Swiss
   foreign policy increased its persistence in not taking economic
   sanctions against the racist regime in South Africa during the 1980s and
   early 1990s. The ACF, with its analytical focus on policy subsystems and
   the role of external shocks as potential triggers for change, provided a
   useful framework for analyzing the factors for policy change and stasis
   in Swiss foreign relations toward the selected two countries.},

Abstract = {There is a small, although well-established body of literature examining
   network performance and accountability. In addition, there are
   relatively few studies which examine potential factors for determining
   network formation. The current study provides a systematic analysis of
   network formation determinants. A logistic regression model is
   constructed to explain the probability of network formation; five major
   groups of explanatory variables are included: institutional,
   programmatic, managerial, political, and socioeconomic. Data for this
   study were collected between 2003 and 2005 from 411 programs at the
   subnational governance level of Thailand as part of a larger study on
   the management of local governments. The analysis shows that the most
   significant variables in determining network formation include the
   nature of the programs and management capacity. Local political climate
   also has a significant effect on network formation, but only indirectly.
   The study also reveals that collaborations in educational and cultural
   promotion programs are still restricted, which differs from the
   experiences in many developed countries. This study illustrates the
   importance of programmatic, managerial, and political contexts that
   administrators may consider when forming networks.},

Abstract = {The article is aimed at analysing New Public Management (NPM) reforms at
   the local level in Germany, France and Italy. The case selection is
   justified by the fact that these three `classical' Continental European
   countries have largely been missing from comparative administrative
   research thus far. The article focuses on local governments, since in
   all three countries these are considered the NPM forerunners and are
   acknowledged to be more advanced in reform implementation than are upper
   levels of government. Against this background, the purpose of this
   contribution is twofold. On the one hand, we wish to show to what extent
   and with what effects the NPM agenda has been taken up at the local
   level in Continental Europe. On the other hand, taking a comparative
   perspective over time, we wish to ask whether or not there has been
   increasing convergence or divergence between the three countries as a
   result of these reforms.},

   Swordo and martyrdom by the Islamic Resistance Movement of Palestine,
   Hamas, as a central pillar of Palestinian identity and as a major source
   of political mobilization and national empowerment. As part of this
   concept Hamas presents martyrdom as the epitome of jihad and of Islamic
   belief. The end-goal of jihad is the destruction of Israel and the
   elimination of the Jews. By emphasizing the centrality of oJihad of the
   Swordo Hamas's ideas reveal a certain similarity to, or inspiration by,
   radical Salafi-jihadist Islamic movements. While Hamas adopted a
   pragmatic approach on short-term tactics, these doctrines impose
   constraints on the scope of a profound ideological transformation it can
   undergo.},

Volume = {37},

Abstract = {The globalisation of the market for basic consumer goods, speculation,
   and the success of biofuels production all underlie a recent return to
   the international agenda of the issues of food security, food
   sovereignty and the right to food. In 2008, the `high cost of living'
   phenomenon sparked off numerous collective, urban, African protests
   movements: these challenged and took the governments in power by
   surprise, impelling them to react in different ways. This article
   describes and analyses the social movements brought into being by
   activist organisations (including unions, human rights organisations,
   and consumer associations) in two countries, Niger and Burkina Faso, and
   demonstrates how important it is to situate the movements in local
   temporalities and circumstances. One of the main issues highlighted by
   the findings of the research is the importance of local governance
   issues: the measures taken in relation to the price rises were aimed
   more at the symptoms than at the underlying causes, and had only
   short-term effects. The different temporalities of world events hence
   played a very minor role, despite the connection of a number of the
   actors, especially in Niger, to the international sphere via
   anti-globalisation movements.},

Abstract = {This is a report of a direct psychological examination of suicide, or
   omartyrdomo terrorists and of organizers of martyrdom attacks.
   Assessments of the personality of self-martyrs have so far relied on
   biographical material drawn from secondary sources. In the absence of
   direct psychological examinations, the debate on the existence of
   distinctive personality factors among suicide terrorists has so far
   remained at the hypothetical level. This study subjected failed
   Palestinian suicide terrorists, a control group of non-suicide
   terrorists, and a group of organizers of suicide attacks, to clinical
   psychological interviews and tests. Significant differences were found
   between suicide and non-suicide terrorists and between these two groups
   and the organizers of martyrdom attacks. Two main personality styles
   were found among the would-be suicides. Members of this group had a
   significantly lower level of ego strength than the organizers of
   martyrdom attacks. Most of the would-be martyrs displayed a dependent
   and avoidant personality style, a profile that made them more amenable
   to group, leader, and public influence. Others were assessed as having
   an impulsive and emotionally unstable style. Some of the would-be
   martyrs but none of the control and organizers groups' participants
   displayed sub-clinical suicidal tendencies. Significantly more martyr
   than control group members displayed symptoms of depression.},

Volume = {4},

Pages = {38-57},
Abstract = {This paper explores the role of social movements in the policy process
   and, in particular, the ways in which movements interact with, access,
   and deploy expert knowledge. In the technocratic model, citizens are
   conceptualized as undifferentiated, rather than considered in terms of
   distinctive identities or interests. Their inclusion in policy-making is
   viewed as a technical problem to be `solved' through forms of citizen
   engagement, rather than viewing citizens as active agents in the
   mobilization of distinctive knowledges. Citizens, we argue, are more
   than the undifferentiated lump that appears in the technocratic model
   under the guise of citizen engagement. Drawing on a case study of autism
   activism in Canada and the US, we demonstrate the range of ways in which
   civil society actors both deploy and contest expert knowledge in the
   policy process, and discuss the implications for how we conceptualize
   knowledge mobilization in policy processes.},

   Union (EU) in terms of the EU's foreign, security and defense policies.
   It reviews Turkish capabilities, namely its military capabilities, which
   could provide the EU with valuable defense assets. There are differences
   related to Turkey's relations with the EU, which have increasingly
   spilled over into the NATO, hindering the development of cooperation
   over crisis management operations. The article then delves in the
   implications of Turkey's strategic geographical location to EU policies.
   It reviews how far the EU and Turkey may have convergent interests in
   some of the neighboring regions, especially in the Middle East.},

Abstract = {This essay offers a comparative examination of the historical processes
   through which secularism was adopted and consolidated in India and
   Turkey. It examines the historical choice and the ideological practices
   that worked to establish secularism as an essential component of
   national identity in each country at their time of founding (Turkey in
   1923 and India in 1947) and shows how this reinforced rather than
   defused the political salience of religion in both cases. The rise of
   religious political movements in later years is related to the presence
   and persistence of these pre-existing, secular repertoires. As the
   article argues, in India and Turkey, the ascendancy of religious
   politics is built on secular foundations.},

Journal = {PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {88},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {This article directs attention to the role of ideational variables in
   shaping public management reform initiatives. It considers the
   contribution of both endogenous rhetorical styles and exogenous
   international fashions in explaining official agency talk in consensus
   and adversarial contexts. Departing from an earlier observation that
   convergence in talk across contexts is more likely than convergence in
   practice (Pollitt 2001), this article demonstrates that symbolic
   convergence is also limited. It is found that agency talk is primarily a
   consequence of national styles of speaking, rather than the limited
   adoptions of a common international story. Secondly, the article
   demonstrates that rhetorical theories can enrich the concept of
   translation by providing tools for making explicit the rules through
   which international fashions are mediated in national contexts. It is
   found that financial officials have been responsible for the
   introduction of the similar (Anglo-Saxon) stories that have achieved
   consensus in political administrative contexts, but that this has not
   brought about cultural homogenization.},

Abstract = {This paper documents the early evolution of UK organic food and farming
   policy networks and locates this empirical focus in a theoretical
   context concerned with understanding the contemporary policy-making
   process. While policy networks have emerged as a widely acknowledged
   empirical manifestation of governance, debate continues as to the
   concept's explanatory utility and usefulness in situations of network
   and policy transformation since, historically, policy networks have been
   applied to `static' circumstances. Recognizing this criticism, and in
   drawing on an interpretivist perspective, this paper sees policy
   networks as enacted by individual actors whose beliefs and actions
   construct the nature of the network. It seeks to make links between the
   characteristics of the policy network and the policy outcomes through
   the identification of discursively constructed `storylines' that form a
   tool for consensus building in networks. This study analyses the
   functioning of the organic policy networks through the discursive
   actions of policy-network actors.},

   in restoring the ethnolinguistic rights of Bulgaria's Turkish minority
   since the post-10 November 1989 reversal of former Communist leader
   Todor Zhivkov's policy of cultural-linguistic assimilation. In spite of
   strong opposition and nationwide protests by various nationalist parties
   and hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of ordinary Bulgarians, gone
   are the worst abuses of the Zhivkov era, such as the government's
   prohibition of ethnic Turks speaking Turkish in public, learning their
   ancestral language in school, bearing Muslim names, performing Turkish
   folk music and dance, or having access to periodicals, books, radio and

Title = {Civic Science and Salmon Recovery Planning in Puget Sound},
Journal = {POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {38},
Number = {2},
Pages = {235-256},
Abstract = {Today, science and scientists as experts no longer hold sway as
   unquestioned authoritative sources of objective information in many
   policy debates. This has led to growing frustration on the part of
   government officials and scientists over their inability to have science
   exert as meaningful a role as they think appropriate in the
   consideration and selection of policy alternatives. Given this
   development, what can be done to restore or otherwise ensure that the
   appropriate science and scientists are integrated into the policy
   process so that they matter to policy outcomes? There is general
   agreement that traditional top-down, one-way (from scientists to
   others), linear models for conceptualizing the role of science and
   scientists in the policy process are not capable of capturing the
   changed political, social, and ``scientific{''} realities of the
   contemporary policymaking context. Many have gravitated to the concept
   of civic science/scientists as a new and improved model. Yet, despite
   clear progress in reconceptualizing the role of science in the policy
   process, there are gaps in the literature when it comes to actual
   applications of civic science. As McNie correctly notes: ``it is
   essential that we develop a more robust understanding of experience and
   practical experiments regarding how relationships {[}and institutions]
   are constructed and managed across the science-society boundary{''} (p.
   29). This research develops lessons for civic science in the policy
   process by exploring an innovative collaborative governance effort by
   the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries and the
   Shared Strategy for Salmon Recovery in Puget Sound (Washington). The
   integration of science into the salmon recovery process in this case
   relied on a series of actions that the Technical Recovery Team (TRT)
   took to bridge the traditionally separate science and policy spheres in
   order to increase the certainty of science impact, specific steps taken
   to establish and maintain the TRTs role as an authoritative, credible
   source of science, and the embrace of a results-oriented, adaptive
   learning approach.},

Abstract = {In the wake of the global financial crisis, three G20 Summits have
   reinvigorated global cooperation, thrusting the International Monetary
   Fund centre stage with approximately \$1 trillion of resources. With
   China, Brazil, India, Russia and other powerful emerging economies now
   at the table, is a new more multilateral era of governance emerging?
   This article examines the evidence. It details the governance reforms
   and new financing of the IMF but finds only very limited shifts in the
   engagement of major emerging economies - insufficient to position the
   IMF to address the global imbalances, to set new multilateral rules, to
   operate as an alternative to self-insurance or indeed to provide a more
   multilateral response to the development emergency. The IMF is shifting
   between: borrower dependence (relying on fee-paying borrowers for
   income); independence (with its own investment income); and lender
   dependence (relying on wealthy members to extend credit lines to it).
   The result is an ambiguous set of forces restraining the IMF to stay as
   it is, and only weakly driving reform. A new order may emerge in which
   multilateral institutions - such as the IMF - end up with only a limited
   role to play alongside emerging national and regional strategies, unless
   a more radical transformation begins.},

Abstract = {The role of legitimacy in international relations is a topic of much
   debate, yet there is little understanding of the mechanism behind it.
   Here I address this discrepancy by asking: are state threats perceived
   as (il)legitimate more or less likely to be successful? By
   operationalizing illegitimacy as unilateral action in the presence of a
   multilateral option, I consider the variation in the success of U.S.
   trade measures from 1975 to 2000. As I show, the (il)legitimacy of
   threats modifies the nature of the signal sent by concessions to those
   threats, and this effect can be measured and predicted. I find that,
   controlling for material pressure, perceived illegitimacy of U.S. trade
   threats decreases the likelihood of a target conceding by over 34
   percent. Moreover, it pays to resist: targets that resist illegitimate
   unilateral measures from the United States are 25 percent less likely to
   encounter similar unilateral measures over the following five years.},

Abstract = {We conduct an empirical analysis of the geographic, economic, and social
   factors that contributed to the spread of civil war in Nepal over the
   period 1996-2006. This within-country analysis complements existing
   cross-country studies on the same subject. Using a detailed dataset to
   track civil war casualties across space and over time, several patterns
   are documented. Conflict-related deaths are significantly higher in
   poorer districts and in geographical locations that favor insurgents,
   such as mountains and forests; a 10 percentage point increase in poverty
   is associated with 25-27 additional conflict-related deaths. This result
   is similar to that documented in cross-country studies. In addition, the
   relationship with poverty and geography is similar for deaths caused by
   the insurgents and deaths caused by the state. Furthermore, poorer
   districts are likely to be drawn into the insurgency earlier, consistent
   with the theory that a lower cost of recruiting rebels is an important
   factor in starting conflict. On the other hand, geographic factors are
   not significantly associated with such onset, suggesting that they
   instead contribute to the intensity of violence only after conflict has
   started. Finally, in contrast to some cross-country analyses, ethnic and
   caste polarization, land inequality, and political participation are not
   significantly associated with violence.},

Abstract = {From the end of the Cold War in 1991 to the end of the 2000s,
   anti-Americanism has passed through different phases in Europe, as well
   as in other parts of the world: it was modest in the 1990s, it exploded
   between 2003-2008, then declined after 2008. Although anti-Americanism
   continues to be rooted in many political cultures and experiences, its
   emergence in the post Cold War era seemed to be correlated to a United
   States foreign policy-making process unrestrained by either domestic or
   international institutions. When domestic and international multilateral
   checks have been unable to keep under control the exercise of US
   international power, then anti-Americanism has functioned as a sort of
   last resort critic on the latter. Anti-Americanism has seemed to be the
   reaction, more than to controversial foreign policy's decisions, to
   their unchecked elaboration and unilateral implementation. For world
   public opinion, the legitimacy of the foreign policy-making process
   counts more than the latter's outcomes. International Politics (2010)

Abstract = {Most discussion about critical realism concerns the concepts of
   structure and agency. This neglects Bhaskar's arguments about facts and
   values. Bhaskar argues that we can move from facts to values with
   `explanatory critiques' and from values to facts with `descriptively
   adequate' accounts of `value impregnated' events. The argument in this
   article is that both of Bhaskar's arguments are untenable and that the
   alternative is the value-to-value argument.},

Abstract = {Created in April 2009, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) represents
   the G20 leaders' first major international institutional innovation. Why
   was it established and what role will it play in global economic
   governance? The creation of the FSB has been linked to a US-led effort
   to strengthen an international prudential standards regime that had
   evolved in the years leading up to the 2007-08 global financial crisis.
   The FSB faces a number of serious challenges in its new role: developing
   effective mechanisms for monitoring and encouraging compliance;
   promoting the development of effective international standards and
   fostering consensus on their content; establishing its legitimacy
   vis-a-vis nonmembers and within member countries; and clarifying its
   relationship with other global governance institutions. Since these are
   very difficult tasks, the FSB may be forced to assume a less ambitious
   role in international regulatory politics than some of its creators
   initially envisioned.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION},
Year = {2010},

Number = {5},
Pages = {745-770},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {When do civil wars last especially long? Commitment problems can stymie
   conflict resolution but they are not homogeneous across all civil wars.
   Indeed, combatants' perceptions of their adversaries significantly
   affect the severity of commitment problems. Intergroup interactions
   provide combatants with one crucial type of information about their
   adversaries and about the risks associated with signing a peace
   settlement, shaping strategic decisions. The argument is tested against
   a new data set of all ethnic civil wars between 1945 and 2004. The
   results demonstrate that intergroup interactions prolong wars when they
   indicate that a peace deal will be especially fragile or that the costs
   of it breaking down will be especially high. This is true, regardless of
   the combatants' goals or their capabilities. In sum, information shapes
   perceptions and the severity of commitment problems, in turn affecting
   the duration of civil wars.},

Title = {Public Bioethics and Deliberative Democracy},
Journal = {POLITICAL STUDIES},

Volume = {58},
Number = {4},
Pages = {715-730},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This article aims to specify the dynamics of the democratisation of
   expertise by analysing public bioethics as a form of deliberative
   democracy. Public bioethics refers to the whole range of bodies and
   procedures, such as national ethics councils, parliamentary ethics
   commissions or public consultations on `ethical issues', which are meant
   to inform and guide political decision making with respect to ethical
   considerations. The article draws from empirical research on three UK
   public bioethics bodies (the Human Genetics Commission, Nuffield Council
   on Bioethics and the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority). The
   article will show how public bioethics addresses some established
   problems of expert domination and rejects the aim of revealing
   substantial ethical unity in favour of facilitating and preparing public
   debate by representing the range of ethical positions on a particular
   issue, and as such seems to resemble more closely the `mixed' discursive
   spheres advocated by Hendriks. However, the article argues that problems
   of expertise are transformed but not removed. By assuming the authority
   to categorise different publics and arrange them in a hierarchy, and
   framing ethical questions such that some kinds of concerns appear
   legitimately ethical while others are merely political or transient
   matters of public concern, public bioethics may be reproducing problems
   of expert domination at the more rarefied level of the construction of
   ethical positions.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the impact of elections and particularly their
   administration on Nigeria's democratization process. It argues that
   elections under the Fourth Republic (1999-2007) were characterized by
   ineffective administration at all stages and levels (before, during and
   after), resulting in damagingly discredited outcomes. This was due in
   large part to the weak institutionalization of the primary agencies of
   electoral administration, particularly the Independent National
   Electoral Commission (INEC) and the political parties. INEC lacks both
   institutional and administrative autonomy, as manifested by its
   composition and funding by the presidency, as well as its gross lack of
   professionalism and security of tenure for its officials. Elections can
   only engender the consolidation of democracy in Nigeria if the electoral
   processes are reformed in ways that fundamentally address the autonomy
   and capability of INEC and related electoral agencies, particularly
   political parties, to discharge their responsibilities effectively. The
   recent trend towards challenging electoral fraud in the courts, however,
   does signal a strengthening of the rule of law and gives some reason for
   optimism.},

Abstract = {Common sense and much of the policy transfer literature suggests that
   learning from abroad delivers better policy at lower cost. In contrast,
   this article argues that policy transfer in tax blacklists has been a
   dysfunctional process tending to replicate errors. Rather than
   reflecting learning, normative mimicry, or market pressures,
   over-committed policymakers have responded to complexity and crisis by
   unreflectively cutting and pasting from foreign models. Facing a
   short-term political imperative to ``do something{''} about tax evasion
   in an environment of fiscal crisis, many policy makers have compiled
   blacklists of tax havens by copying lists of ``the usual suspects{''}
   from abroad. Evidence for both the process of transfer and the
   dysfunctional nature of resulting policy is provided by tracking
   recurring errors in these lists that are unlikely to have arisen
   independently.},

Abstract = {Borrowing the dominant theoretical frameworks of studies of voter
   turnout in the developed world, this paper tests the applicability of
   these frameworks to a transitional democracy in a Muslim society. Using
   logistic regression, we estimate an individual's likelihood of voting in
   Kyrgyzstan's 2005 parliamentary and presidential elections. We find that
   traditional rural networks, rather than networks of voluntary
   associations, play the central role in the mobilization of voters. In
   addition, turnout is affected by long-standing cultural cleavages based
   on religion and ethnicity, and by education, occupation, and trust in
   government. Our findings suggest that the political behavior of the
   people of the Kyrgyz Republic is supportive of democracy, in spite of
   elite-level obstacles to a successful transition. (C) 2010 Published by

Abstract = {This article is the first to study the positive correlation between
   nationalism and democratic revolutions using Ukraine's 2004 Orange
   Revolution as a case study. The Orange Revolution mobilized the largest
   number of participants of any democratic revolution and lasted the
   longest, 17 days. But, the Orange Revolution was also the most
   regionally divided of democratic revolutions with western and central
   Ukrainians dominating the protestors and eastern Ukrainians opposing the
   protests. The civic nationalism that underpinned the Orange Revolution
   is rooted in Ukraine's path dependence that has made civil society
   stronger in western Ukraine where Austro-Hungarian rule permitted the
   emergence of a Ukrainian national identity that was stymied in eastern
   Ukraine by the Tsarist empire. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd on

Abstract = {This article analyzes the power and legitimacy of the Regional
   Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI), explaining why local
   actors chose to comply and cooperate with the operation in its crucial
   first year. It argues that, to be effective, peace operations require
   the compliance of local populations, and finds that RAMSI's ability to
   shape the attitudes, incentives and interests of local actors was
   determined by the relationship between its three currencies of power:
   coercion, inducement and legitimacy. Focused on the exercise of power by
   RAMSI, this article enables much-needed analysis of the local dimensions
   of peace operations and affords serious consideration to processes of
   local legitimation. Within the local realm, the case of Solomon Islands
   provides three important insights on the power and legitimacy of peace
   operations. First, the design and implementation of RAMSI's
   communications strategies were central to its ability to exercise
   coercive and inducive power and, crucially, to legitimize its power
   relationship with local populations. Second, the manner in which RAMSI
   exercised authority affected local perceptions about its legitimacy,
   independent of the operation's outcomes. Third, the quality of treatment
   people received from RAMSI was influential in their decisions to comply
   and cooperate with the operation. This suggests that carefully examining
   the way that peace operations and local people interact can help to
   identify the determinants of an operation's effectiveness.},

Abstract = {One important feature of China's privatization process is that insider
   privatization prevailed, and that outsiders could hardly gain access to
   buying state enterprises. Why was a majority of small- and medium-sized
   public enterprises sold to the firms' former managers (and workers)? How
   did the tightened regulatory environment affect local privatization in
   China? Building on insights into institutional change, I argue that the
   choice of a specific privatization strategy results from political
   compromises among local officials, workers, and managers of public
   enterprises under specific regulatory constraints. Local officials'
   incentives for privatization and their reactions to the changing
   regulatory environment had a great impact on the dynamics of local
   privatization.},

Journal = {HUMAN RIGHTS QUARTERLY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {32},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {The traditional scholarly narrative on the relationship between cultural
   diversity and universal respect for human rights suggests a tension
   which must, at best, be managed. There is, however, no consensus among
   scholars as to the best way to reconcile or manage this tension and so
   creating an intellectual gap between universalist and cultural
   relativist schools of thought which has come to inform important aspects
   of diplomatic practice. This article analyses an alternative approach to
   the management of this tension based on the practice of the United
   Nations human rights treaty bodies. The working methods of these
   supervisory bodies, especially the constructive dialogue on national
   periodic reports, suggest that they adopt a legal approach in which
   cultural diversity and universal respect for human rights complement and
   reinforce each other. At the same time, focusing on effective
   protection, the treaty bodies challenge specific cultural practices that
   they consider to be harmful or contrary to human rights guarantees.
   Although the treaty bodies' approach to this subject is still evolving,
   it reveals interesting doctrinal lessons concerning the universality of
   human rights norms.},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {While the literature on political action committees' (PACs)
   contributions to congressional campaigns is substantial, one key
   variable has been missing: the ideology of the PAC. Such a measure is
   needed to evaluate a normatively important yet unanswered question: to
   what extent do PACs give to candidates with whom they agree
   ideologically, as opposed to candidates they may want to influence after
   the election? This study shows that many interest groups' preferences
   for an electoral strategy or an access strategy can be predicted by
   their left-right ideology and their level of ideological extremism. The
   analysis finds that more ideologically extreme groups and more liberal
   groups spend more money on PAC contributions relative to lobbying.
   Further, groups' underlying left-right ideology is also highly
   predictive of their allocation of PAC contributions between the two
   parties-even controlling for group type.},

Abstract = {This article suggests that Preventing Violent Extremism (PVE), the
   government's `hearts and minds' response to the threat of domestic
   Islamist terrorism within the wider CONTEST strategy, has been exposed
   as both failed and friendless by growing political and academic
   scrutiny. PVE's monocultural focus on Muslims is in stark contradiction
   to the overriding policy goal of community cohesion, while its
   implementation has provoked accusations both of surveillance and of
   engineering `value changes' within Muslim communities. Local conflicts
   relating to the operationalisation of PVE result from political
   disagreement over the balance between community engagement and policing
   within the Labour government, and these problems leave the future of
   this key anti-terrorism policy area unclear.},

Abstract = {In 2008, the Department of Tarija became the epicenter of national
   political struggles over political autonomy for lowland regions at odds
   with the Morales administration. In September, following a series of
   regional referenda on autonomy and a national recall election, citizen
   committees in Tarija mobilized urban-based sectors and organized a
   general strike against the central government. It is unhelpful to
   understand the strike as simply an act of political sabotage
   orchestrated by racist regional elites. The factors driving protest and
   interest in autonomy are varied and deeply related to patterns of
   hydrocarbons extraction in the department that have allowed for the
   mobilization of grievances and the cultivation of resource regionalism
   at departmental and intradepartmental scales. Alongside class and
   ethnicity, identities of place and region can be equally important in
   processes of mobilization, and the resonance of these spatialized
   identities is particularly important in resource-extraction peripheries.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this review essay is to examine the use of experimental
   methods and its contributions to international studies research.
   Following a general discussion of the experimental approach, including
   the advantages and disadvantages of experimentation in International
   Relations (IR), this review moves to a categorized discussion of the
   ways in which experimental methods have contributed to the field of
   international studies. By invoking economist Alvin Roth's three purposes
   of experiments searching for facts, speaking to theorists, and
   influencing policy debates this classification scheme helps to identify
   the overarching purposes of a wide variety of experiments in the field.
   However, this review seeks to move beyond merely presenting a basic
   review of the copious experimental literature by also providing an
   analytical assessment of the function that experimentation serves in IR;
   that is, to identify and elaborate on experimental research that serves
   an integrative function, as a bridge across the multiple divides in the
   landscape of IR. To this end, we introduce a second and original
   classification framework that allows us to profile in detail a number of
   singularly significant experimental studies. We then conclude the
   analysis by highlighting a set of ``growth areas{''} for experimental
   research that can maintain and expand the already significant
   contributions of experimental methods to our field.},

Abstract = {Existing research on foreign direct investment (FDI) focuses on how
   politics influences the supply of FDI inflows. In this article I shift
   focus to the demand for FDI inflows within recipient countries by
   examining individual preferences for FDI. I argue that FDI preferences
   are largely a function of FDI's effects on income. FDI raises wages,
   especially those of skilled labor because foreign firms require more
   highly skilled labor than their local counterparts. Accordingly, support
   for FDI should increase with respondents skills. Using three years of
   extensive public opinion data from eighteen Latin American countries, I
   provide robust evidence that preferences are consistent with FDI's
   effects on income. There is relatively little support for alternate
   explanations including concerns about job security, opposition to
   privatization, and the socializing effects of higher education on
   economic policy preferences.},

Abstract = {The demise of the USSR led to the collapse of its centrally organised
   retail system. With this collapse the supply of consumer goods dried up,
   especially in the remote parts of the former USSR. At the same time the
   advent of capitalism offered a new institutional framework for
   independent retail activities. In the Kyrgyz Republic, where the
   economic liberalisation followed strictly the Washington Consensus, a
   large number of small shops emerged in both urban and rural areas. This
   study analyses the reasons for this boom in retail start-ups as well as
   the constraints the mainly inexperienced merchants encounter. As will be
   shown, any success in retail activities depends greatly on the
   performance of other economic sectors. The main goal of starting a
   retail business is to minimize risks within the overall livelihood
   strategies of households in rural Kyrgyzstan. (C) 2010 Published by

Journal = {BUSINESS AND POLITICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The political economy of trade literature argues that the policy of
   compensating those who lose from trade is an important component of
   maintaining public support for free-trade, a linkage known as the
   compensation hypothesis or embedded liberalism thesis. This article
   tests the causal mechanisms underlying the compensation hypothesis by
   examining support for trade-related compensation using survey data from
   the United States. Expectations about the effects of trade strongly
   predict support for trade-related unemployment insurance, with those who
   expect to lose more likely to support and those who expect to gain more
   like to oppose, but has no influence on support for general unemployment
   insurance despite previous research suggesting it should.},

Abstract = {The authors analyze the optimal network structure of two types of
   terrorist organizations. In the centralized network, the leadership
   selects the level of individual effort and the level of group
   connectivity so as to maximize the expected net welfare of the
   organization's membership. Leaders in loosely connected networks will
   also seek to balance the trade-off between security and communications.
   However, with decentralized decision making, the individual nodes may
   not make optimal decisions from the group's perspective. As a
   consequence, the decentralized decision-making process is suboptimal
   from the overall perspective of the network. In particular, the
   leadership in a centralized network is able to coordinate the activities
   of all network members and to take advantage of important network
   externalities.},

Title = {Beyond the `Crisis of Youth'? Mining, farming, and civil society in
   post-war Sierra Leone},
Journal = {AFRICAN AFFAIRS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {109},
Number = {435},
Pages = {251-272},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Sierra Leone's conflict has often been characterized as a `crisis of
   youth'. For some, the post-war resurgence of grassroots associational
   life represents the unleashing of long-suppressed youth egalitarianism,
   yet this analysis tends to ignore the role of international aid in
   providing an economic incentive for impoverished Sierra Leoneans to
   embrace formal association. Case study evidence also shows that politics
   of `community' identification and moral economies of patronage continue
   to affect post-war aid. Evidence of post-war social change can
   nevertheless be found outside the development sector. Diamond mining has
   long served as a driver of cultural modernization in Sierra Leone and
   detailed examination of post-war associational life in Kono District
   reveals that new foci and techniques of social activism have emerged
   since the end of the civil war. The decline of artisanal mining, with
   the expansion of large-scale industrial mining, and renewed interest in
   farming are driving a parallel resurgence of associational life in rural
   areas. Given that most Sierra Leoneans continue to depend on farming,
   this rural resurgence could yet represent the most durable basis for
   democratic change in Sierra Leone.},

Volume = {20},

Abstract = {City managers' policy leadership has drawn great attention from scholars
   of public administration. However, what factors explain variation in
   managers' policy-making roles has not been systematically explored. This
   study investigates the mechanisms leading elected officials to defer to
   the manager in policy making. Survey data from Florida council-manager
   cities indicate that noninstitutional factors-such as mayors' political
   experience, managers' professionalism, and concordance of manager and
   council preferences-influence the likelihood that a council will allow a
   manager to exercise policy influence. The data reveal that city managers
   earn policy-making leadership at the expense of their administrative
   authority. Thus, managers must reconcile inherent tensions between
   responsibility and compliance.},

Abstract = {We present a simulation model of current conflict-torn Afghanistan in
   which a system-dynamics model is coupled with an agent-based model.
   Agent-based modeling techniques are applied to model individual
   cognition and behavior as well as group formation processes.
   System-dynamics modeling is used for representing macro conflict
   processes, such as duration of violence and combat success ratio. The
   cognitive and behavioral processes are couched in a socio-cultural
   context and feed into the system dynamics processes. This affords us
   exploring the relationship between local socio-culturally-driven
   cognition and behavior and (dynamic) macro properties of armed conflict.
   We demonstrate the importance of analyzing conflict-torn Afghanistan
   from an interplay of adapting ``traditional{''} socio-cultural
   mechanisms, political Culture and power structures, and
   politico-economic macro-processes. We find that variations in the
   conflict's superstructure can be explained through variations in
   socio-culturally dependent structures. The model indicates limitations
   with regard to classical prediction, but is promising with regard to
   explanatory-driven pattern forecasting.},

Abstract = {The Mexican coffee crisis that began with the liberalization of the
   international coffee market in 1989 led to the reorganization of the
   coffee sector under the control of transnational companies after state
   regulation has been replaced by policies aimed at allowing the survival
   of the small producers but not reactivating the sector. The resistance
   of the powerful roaster industry, dominated by the giant Nestle, has
   made it impossible to improve the quality of the coffee sold on the
   domestic market, and its importation of cheap robusta coffee for use in
   instant preparations has further reduced prices. The survival of the
   producer cooperatives depends on their capacity to enter the market
   through niches such as the organic and Fair Trade, where they receive a
   better price for their products. For the others, the only solution is to
   migrate to the North.},

Abstract = {Anticipating the future is both a social obligation and intellectual
   challenge that no scientific discipline can escape.(1) The field of
   international studies is no exception to this, and we believe that few
   other disciplines reflect so deeply about their own capacity to provide
   accurate forecasts and to deliver useful early warning schemes. One
   school of thought declares prediction to be an impossible aspiration,
   sometimes because certain events are a priori considered to be
   unforeseeable (cf. Beyerchen 1992). The ex post facto realization that
   dramatic singular events like the fall of the Berlin Wall (e.g., Gaddis
   1992) or the September 11 terrorist attacks (e.g., Herrmann and Choi
   2007) shape global politics dramatically nurture this radical
   skepticism. Government, IGO, and NGO officials often take the opposite
   view that academics could anticipate the future if they would accept
   their ``responsibility{''} of contributing something useful to society.
   Users of such forecasts in offices around the world are, for obvious
   reasons, convinced that anticipating the future is possible. In the
   words of one civil servant of the European Commission, ``it can safely
   be argued{''} that the implemented early warning schemes have},

Abstract = {The European state-building experience has led many scholars to argue
   that war forces states to increase their fiscal-administrative capacity,
   or what we might refer to as political development, in order to compete
   in the international system. War also requires states to generate wealth
   to support such competition, which should lead to progressively
   increased levels of economic development. Yet, in contemporary empirical
   studies, war is often studied as a dependent variable, with economic and
   political development modeled as affecting its origination. This reading
   of theory and empirical work suggests that war, economic development,
   and political development constitute an endogenous system. In this
   paper, we develop expectations about how these three processes interact
   and test them using a three-stage least squares regression model. The
   results show significant simultaneous relationships between the three
   processes. We conclude that war, economic development, and political
   development are mutually constitutive processes in the contemporary
   international system.},

Journal = {SURVIVAL},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {52},
Number = {6},
Pages = {15-44},
Abstract = {At the close of 2010, not much of the Obama administration's ambitious
   Middle East agenda had been accomplished. The most dangerous impasse was
   in the failure of the administration's attempt at engagement with Iran.
   Tehran was continuing, albeit with some technical setbacks, to progress
   towards a nuclear-weapons capability. There is every reason to worry
   that, in the coming years, Israel will conclude that it is cornered,
   with no choice but to launch a preventive war aimed at crippling
   Tehran's nuclear infrastructure. But the rise of the Green Movement in
   Iran and the events since the its 2009 elections suggest that some of
   the principles of Cold War containment are relevant to the developing
   confrontation with Iran. Build up strength and resilience in our allies
   rather than seeking recklessly to destroy our opponents. Keep the moral
   high ground and keep our nerve. Contain challenges against us `by the
   adroit and vigilant application of counter-force' and be ready to follow
   up with diplomacy. Do not go off half-cocked into ill-considered wars
   without understanding whom we are fighting, or how. If these principles
   are applied with prudence and historical patience, it seems reasonable
   to look forward to a `mellowing', if not the radical reform of, an
   Iranian regime that like the Soviet Union is riddled with contradiction.},

Abstract = {The responses of the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG), Petron, government
   line agencies, local government authorities and non-government
   organizations to the 2006 Solar I oil spill were moderated by their
   relative positions within overlapping and competing disaster-specific
   frameworks at the agency (PCG), local and regional levels. The regional
   Task Force Solar I Oil Spill (RTFSOS), once convened, overshadowed the
   other frameworks owing largely to national calamity funds channeled
   through its member line agencies. While the task force design allowed
   for better job delineation and horizontal coordination between a limited
   number of stakeholders, the framework nevertheless marginalized the PCG,
   local government authorities and NGOs while endowing Petron a legitimate
   basis for its involvement in response operations. The absence of a
   widely-accepted protocol for ameliorating the spill's environmental and
   human health impact created tension between line government agencies and
   academic/research communities. Unlike other disasters, the prospect of
   financial largesse from the International Oil Pollution Compensation
   Fund, either as reimbursements for response activities and compensation
   for livelihood losses, animated stakeholder and local reactions.},

Title = {Sudan's uncivil war: the global-historical constitution of political
   violence},
Journal = {REVIEW OF AFRICAN POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {37},
Number = {124},
Pages = {153-171},
Abstract = {It is commonplace to characterise political violence and war in Africa
   as `internal', encapsulated in the apparently neutral term `civil war'.
   As such, accounts of political violence tend to focus narrowly on the
   combatants or insurrectionary forces, failing to recognise or address
   the extent to which political violence is historically and globally
   constituted. The article addresses this problematic core assumption
   through examination of the case of Sudan, seeking to contribute to a
   rethinking of protracted political violence and social crisis in
   post-colonial Africa. The article interjects in such debates through the
   use and detailed exposition of a distinct methodological and analytical
   approach. It interrogates three related dimensions of explanation which
   are ignored by orthodox framings of `civil war': (1) the technologies of
   colonial rule which (re) produced and politicised multiple fractures in
   social relations, bequeathing a fissiparous legacy of racial, religious
   and ethnic `identities' that have been mobilised in the context of
   post-colonial struggles over power and resources; (2) the major role of
   geopolitics in fuelling and exacerbating conflicts within Sudan and the
   region, particularly through the cold war and the `war on terror'; and
   (3) Sudan's terms of incorporation within the capitalist global economy,
   which have given rise to a specific character and dynamics of
   accumulation, based on primitive accumulation and dependent primary
   commodity production. The article concludes that political violence and
   crisis are neither new nor extraordinary nor internal, but rather,
   crucial and constitutive dimensions of Sudan's neo-colonial condition.
   As such, to claim that political violence in Sudan is `civil' is to
   countenance the triumph of ideology over history.},

Abstract = {This article addresses the nature and limits of the contribution of big
   business to democratic consolidation by focusing on the role of TUSIAD,
   the major association of big business interests in Turkey, during the
   country's democratisation process in the 2000s. While TUSIAD has been an
   important pro-democratisation actor, big business's contribution to the
   consolidation process is contingent on the broader institutional and
   political environment. The issues of secularism and EU membership
   prospects play an important role in Turkish politics and in
   understanding TUSIAD's stance, as they have constrained its ability to
   act as the vanguard of democratisation reforms.},
