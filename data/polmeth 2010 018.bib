Title = {Symbiosis, re-use and evolution: administrators, politicians, citizens,
   and governance in post-colonial India},
Journal = {COMMONWEALTH \& COMPARATIVE POLITICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {48},
Number = {4},
Pages = {457-478},
Abstract = {Democracy, governance and citizenship in post-colonial states are
   crucially contingent on how civil servants and political leaders see one
   another. Civil servants and political leaders are important links in the
   national chain of governance, joining the modern state and traditional
   society. A trained, professional, politically neutral bureaucracy, held
   accountable to local, regional and national leaders, is the core of
   India's strategy of governance. Based on the management of order,
   welfare and identity, this design underpins the vast expanses of the
   Indian political system, reaching out to every corner of the country,
   constantly extracting and circulating new ideas and resources, and
   functioning as the veins and arteries of this complex body politic. The
   evolution of this complex system, the fortuitous result of the symbiosis
   of administrators and politicians, and the strategic re-use of the
   colonial and the pre-modern past, accounts for the puzzle of the formal
   continuity of a colonial institution in India's post-colonial context.
   The article examines this argument on the basis of narratives,
   conversations with regional elites (the empirical analysis draws on
   interviews with 150 of them, drawn from six states) and findings from a
   cross-section survey of the Indian electorate.},

   Norwegian Voters},
Journal = {INTERNASJONAL POLITIKK},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {68},
Number = {3},
Pages = {335+},
Abstract = {Historically, Norway's foreign policy has been an area of conflict
   within the electorate and, decades ago, actually played a role in
   elections. This is no longer the case; transformation of Norway's
   defence even takes place without public debate. Based on nationwide
   surveys in Autumn 2008/Spring 2009 and comparable historical data, the
   article analyses how aware Norwegians are of foreign and security
   policy, the attitudes and views they hold, and how these are affected by
   party sympathy. It is concluded that people are more interested than
   election campaigns would indicate; there is a noticeable swing towards
   national consensus on alliance policy and NATO membership, but
   participation in the war in Afghanistan is controversial; opposition to
   EU membership remains strong but divides the population differently from
   security/alliance policy. While Barack Obama's election contributed to
   more pro-US sentiment, the traditional left right ideological divide is
   still important. The Socialist Left Party and the left wing of the
   Labour Party remain `the foreign policy opposition'.},

Title = {How Electoral Systems Can Influence Policy Innovation},
Journal = {POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {38},
Number = {4},
Pages = {613-628},
Abstract = {This paper argues that in certain areas of policy, electoral systems can
   influence policy innovation (how early countries will adopt certain
   policies). Electoral systems influence the number of parties that win
   representation and thereby influence the diversity of perspectives
   included in the policymaking process. It is argued here that this
   diversity facilitates elite and public consideration of new issues and
   ideas, and consequently, it leads to earlier debate and action on these
   issues and ideas. This dynamic is particularly relevant to controversial
   issues and ideas that major parties may be hesitant to address and that
   minor parties may be more incentivized to promote. In this paper, two
   issues/ideas are considered: extending rights to same-sex couples and
   making material sacrifices to protect the environment. I show that
   countries with more proportional electoral systems tend to act earlier
   to protect the environment and that they tend to be early adopters of
   civil union legislation. These results are also supported by World
   Values Survey data showing public preference patterns that support these
   policy outcomes.},

Journal = {COMMONWEALTH \& COMPARATIVE POLITICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {48},
Number = {1},
Pages = {91-111},
Abstract = {Inter- and non-governmental anglophone Commonwealths have advocated
   democracy and development in both formal and informal networks,
   symbolised by their provision of five of the first chairs of the
   counterconflict diamonds Kimberley Process. Given the character of civil
   society-corporate as well as state-economy relations throughout the
   Commonwealths, they have been central to the definition and development
   of standard-setting norms and agencies through extensive heterogeneous
   coalitions such as the International Campaign to Ban Landmines. Klaus
   Dingwerth has recently characterised such certification, compacts,
   processes as `private transnational governance'. This paper analyses the
   roles of the Commonwealths in advancing such `global governance' through
   the Small Island Developing States and Kimberley Process as well as
   reflecting on parallel forms: the Ottawa Process and Extractive
   Industries Transparency Initiative. It also asks whether such
   heterogeneous forms of governance are democratic and transparent.},

Abstract = {In the post-Cold War world, Africa has been an important focus of
   Brazilian foreign policy. Having a significant historical weight in
   building our nation, African countries are also part of the moves
   adopted by Brazil's foreign policy. The main purpose of the present text
   is to show this relevant regional dimension regarding Brazil's
   international insertion during the Lula era. The work is divided in two
   parts: the first part approaches Africa's international insertion
   throughout recent years and the second analyses the dimension occupied
   by African affairs in Brazil during the Lula era. The main argument is
   that the new role played by Africa in the international scene coincides
   with a global Brazil.},

Abstract = {This article compares the relative explanatory power of structuralist
   and interpretative approaches to the study of policy change. By
   assessing the fit of these approaches against the actual reform of the
   formulation, approval, and implementation stages of Italy's budget
   process in the 1990s, the article shows that structural factors (such as
   fiscal pressures and changes in the electoral rules) played a key role
   in the reform of the formulation stage but not in that of the approval
   and implementation stages, where the content of reform followed the
   managerialist paradigm endorsed by the Italian reform community. Italy
   in the 1990s was under considerable pressure to achieve fiscal
   retrenchment, and the managerialist paradigm advocated measures that
   were largely antithetical to those that can be deduced from the changes
   in institutional context. Thus, the Italian case provides an excellent
   opportunity to assess the relative causal impact of ideas and structure
   on reform.},

Abstract = {In the 1990s there were two new ideas to make the Ixil Mayas of Nebaj,
   Guatemala, self-sufficient. The first idea, conceived by microcredit
   consultants, was to make it easier for the Ixils to borrow money so that
   they could become entrepreneurs. The second idea, conceived by Ixils,
   was to use the credits to smuggle themselves into U. S. labor markets.
   In the process, Ixils turned many of the credits into loans to other
   Ixils at 10 percent interest per month. By 2006-2007 many stateside
   Ixils were failing to find enough work to pay their loans, and their
   serial debts were collapsing back in Nebaj. Currently an association of
   Nebaj women is asking international organizations and the Guatemalan
   government to save their houses and land from foreclosure. The stories
   that Ixils tell suggest that migration is a highly competitive process
   not just in U. S. labor markets but in the sending population, where
   people are being forced to go north by remittance-and credit-driven
   inflation. Their stories also suggest that migration is a process that
   runs on debt, with migrants indebting themselves and their relatives to
   the migration stream in ways that many are unable to repay. The debts
   not only enable migration but require more people to migrate north, in a
   chain of exploitation that may suck more value from the sending
   population than it returns.},

Abstract = {This paper reflects on public service behaviour surrounding the early
   post-implementation period of the 2002 Freedom of Information
   {[}Scotland] Act. Drawing from research completed in September 2007 it
   examines the extent to which freedom of information (FOI) is generating
   new arrangements for managing information, thereby supporting
   government's broader modernisation agenda. By showing how FOI is managed
   within Scottish public bodies the paper also casts light on the practice
   of democratic government. It shows,too, how in three key aspects -
   administration, modernisation and democratisation - the delivery of FOI
   is infused by political behaviours and constrictions.},

Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {429-440},
Abstract = {This article considers the leadership requirements in a subregional
   context drawing on case study material from a range of research
   concerned with leadership of place. To better illustrate complexity and
   understand the impact of different spatial scales and leadership in a
   subregional context we draw upon work we have undertaken within a growth
   area. We assert that the leadership requirement differs according to the
   context of the given place and the degree to which the system is
   supportive of the place-shaping requirement. Drawing out of an
   understanding of why place matters, we identify the potential
   constraints and opportunities that can arise when leading within a
   subregional context. We suggest that the leadership of place is an
   iterative process and cannot be created around `false' economies or
   contrived geographical boundaries. We suggest that the sustainability
   and resilience of place will only become embedded when public actions
   and cross-sector interventions arise from a spatial literacy - an
   understanding of the requirement of a given place both in terms of its
   spatial context and community capacity. We conclude that leadership of
   place is a contextually-based, collective cross-cutting process and that
   the leaders need to be able to shape and develop a supportive system
   alongside the more physical and service-based interventions to shape and
   make place.},

Abstract = {The question of whether, and if so, how the European Court of Justice
   influences European integration has been a matter of long-standing
   academic dispute. Several more recent empirical studies have shown that
   the Court influences the integration path, but scholars have also
   documented that member states can successfully limit the practical
   relevance of activist Court decisions. Drawing on this literature, this
   paper argues that the Court eventually impacts integration in salient
   policy fields effectively when the legislator incorporates judicial
   considerations in the policy-making process. The theoretical section
   conceptualizes the leverage of the Court in the legislation process and
   the empirical section elucidates how the judiciary shaped legislation in
   the development of exchange students' social rights. Findings show that
   the Court can successfully promote distinct legislative outcomes.},

Abstract = {NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen has become a surprisingly
   strong advocate of missile-defence cooperation with Moscow, making it a
   core element of his programme to improve NATO-Russia relations.
   Nonetheless, the recurring obstacles that have long impeded extensive
   NATO-Russian BMD cooperation largely persist, making it unlikely the
   parties can realise Rasmussen's ambitious goals. Pursuing them risks
   generating yet another round of mutual recriminations resulting from
   frustrated expectations. It would be more profitable to focus on
   harmonising threat assessments, pursuing shared early-warning
   capabilities, strengthening barriers against accidental or unauthorised
   missile launches, and collaborating more to curtail ballistic-missile
   proliferation. Joint BMD projects cannot be used to create a political
   consensus on missile defense when it does not already exist.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},

Volume = {54},
Number = {4},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Past studies examining the international conflict behavior of
   parliamentary democracies have reported inconsistent findings and
   produced some empirical puzzles. One of the main puzzles is that,
   despite a strong theoretical basis for expecting coalitional majority
   cabinets to be less conflict prone than single-party majorities, most
   studies found no difference in their conflict behavior. Still others
   report coalitional governments to be more conflict prone than
   single-party ones. In this study, I show that these empirical
   inconsistencies can be resolved once we take into account the
   ideological composition of the cabinet. The main contention is that
   relatively marginal coalitional partners may have a disproportionate
   influence when the government faces risky decisions, such as the
   initiation of international disputes. The key lies in their greater
   bargaining leverage in intra-coalitional politics, which is subsequently
   reflected in their influence over foreign conflict decisions. More
   generally, this study shows how different degrees of ideological
   diversity or cohesion abate and/or accentuate a state's conflict
   behavior. The expectations are tested empirically, and the findings more
   robustly predict the conflict behavior of parliamentary regimes than do
   the results of previous research.},

Abstract = {A Random Digit Dialing survey (n = 794) examined the interracial contact
   experiences and racial attitudes of White South Africans. The survey
   measured racial attitudes not only in terms of individuals' prejudice,
   but also in terms of their perceptions of group threat, perceived
   injustice, and support for various government policies designed to
   rectify the legacy of apartheid. The results indicated that the
   frequency and quality of interracial contact predicted Whites' support
   for both race compensatory and race preferential policies of redress,
   and these effects were partly mediated by perceived threat, sense of
   fairness, and racial prejudice. The research points to a potential
   rapprochement between the social psychological theories of intergroup
   contact and group positioning theories derived from the work of Blumer.
   It also highlights the value of adopting a more expansive and
   politically nuanced conception of the ``consequences{''} of contact and
   desegregation.},

Abstract = {Despite advancements in the theorisation of political sovereignty
   brought about by the engagements of critical international relations
   theory, there remain significant lacunae in our understanding of the
   reproduction of this peculiar configuration of social life. This
   article, drawing on the collaborative work of Deleuze and Guattari,
   seeks to provide a more robust theorisation of the subjectivities
   underpinning modern political sovereignty here understood as capitalist
   sovereignty. It looks to their programme of `schizoanalysis', which
   interrogates the unconscious libidinal investments of capitalist
   reproduction. Specifically, Deleuze and Guattari argue that a factitious
   Oedipal configuration of desire allows the sovereign flow of capital.
   This article gathers insights from schizoanalysis in elucidating a
   dynamic affective relationship between sovereignty and the territorial
   state. It also suggests the potential of schizoanalysis for
   reconceptualising world politics and contributing to emancipatory IR
   scholarship. Journal of International Relations and Development (2010)

Abstract = {This article argues that Russia has a peculiar form of authoritarianism
   that exhibits pronounced technocratic features. The analysis places in a
   comparative frame the bases of regime legitimacy and the paths to
   political, administrative, and economic power in Russia. By locating the
   Russian state in a matrix that considers the ideology of governance on
   one axis and the backgrounds of elites on the other, the article
   highlights areas of overlap and separation between state-society
   relations in Russia and other regimes in the developed and developing
   world. It also illustrates the ways in which technocratic elites in
   Russia differ from their counterparts in other parts of the world. (C)

Abstract = {This article discusses John Locke's Letter Concerning Toleration (1689).
   It challenges what has been described as `the most influential critique
   of the argument of the Letter written by a contemporary philosopher' -
   that of Jeremy Waldron. It also engages with a recent response to
   Waldron's critique within the pages of Political Studies by Paul
   Bou-Habib. It argues that both Waldron and Bou-Habib are in error in
   their accounts of Locke's theory of toleration. It argues that Waldron
   is egregiously in error in his claim that Locke, in his defence of
   toleration, identified with the interests of the persecutors at the
   expense of their victims. Even Waldron's most recent work on Locke,
   which emphasises the religious foundations of Locke's defence of
   toleration, fails to overcome the shortcomings of his critique in this
   regard.},

Abstract = {Mainstream critiques of human security theory and practice have
   criticized how human security is being conceptualized, with a specific
   focus on how the absence of a precise and universally accepted
   definition hinders its practical application. Rejecting these critiques
   as an explanation for the policy failures of human security agendas,
   this article argues that the difficulties experienced in
   operationalizing human security lie in the myriad ways human security
   policies have revealed themselves to be subordinate to an existing,
   well-established and equally diffuse policy agenda: neoliberalism. The
   specific case study examines Canada, a prominent member of the human
   security vanguard, and its unwillingness to regulate transnational
   corporate conduct that contributes to human insecurity. International

Abstract = {The paper seeks to evaluate the scope and limits of the Russian state's
   capacity to use oil and natural gas as strategic resources to revive
   Russia's fortunes as a credible global power. It offers an analysis of
   the evolution of state-markets interactions in the energy sector from
   the late Gorbachev era to the present day. The paper briefly documents
   how Russian foreign policy became more assertive using energy as a
   strategic resource, particularly in crafting its relations with the
   European Union. Subsequently, the paper analyzes Russia's limits of
   using energy as leverage in securing foreign policy objectives. Finally,
   it points to the impediments to normalizing a Russo-EU energy dialog.

Abstract = {This article examines the extent to which the Lisbon strategy, with its
   utilisation of the Open Method of Coordination (OMC) as the new mode of
   governance' for supranational social policy, has delivered on the pledge
   of acting as a counterweight to neoliberal market integration in the EU.
   Adopting a critical political economy perspective, we transcend the
   focus on institutional form of existing approaches, and seek to explain
   the social purpose of Lisbon In this context we argue that both form and
   content of the Lisbon strategy reflect a hegemonic project of `embedded
   neoliberalism', inasmuch as the Lisbon strategy's institutional
   mechanisms such as the OMC reaffirm the asymmetric nature of European
   governance through the promotion of market-making rather than
   market-correcting policies, bolstering the power of transnational
   capital while simultaneously incorporating subordinate projects through
   limited forms of embeddedness The contradictions inherent in this
   strategy have come to test the limits of its legitimacy Journal of

Abstract = {Selectorate theory posits that leader accountability increases with the
   size of the winning coalition. Recent research contends that capitalism
   also increases leader accountability because leaders are more dependent
   on the public for revenue in more capitalist economies. The authors
   argue that extant tests of accountability arguments of interstate
   conflict initiation and targeting are flawed. Accountability theories of
   foreign policy expect leaders to selectively initiate disputes based on
   their probability of winning. Accountability arguments, then, expect a
   conditional relationship between the accountability mechanism and the
   balance of power. For example, if capitalism produces peace through
   accountability, then more capitalist states should be less likely to
   initiate militarized disputes as their power advantage decreases. The
   authors find that this is not the case. At the same time, the authors
   find robust support for selectorate theory's contention that larger
   winning coalitions are more selective about using military force.
   Political institutions induce accountability; capitalism does not.},

Abstract = {The idea that investing in employability is the answer to the insecurity
   caused by creative destruction originated in the context of Silicon
   Valley. Paradoxically, this `employacurity' discourse has taken root in
   the Netherlands, a country in which the employment system is firmly
   based on the norm of job security, the total opposite of Silicon
   Valley's employment system. Although management gurus have built an
   attractive discourse on employability, an associated collective action
   problem detracts from its realism. The Dutch case exhibits mechanisms
   that may alleviate such a collective action problem. These mechanisms
   are explored via an examination of policy documents, a quantitative
   analysis of collective labour agreements and two cases, one of a large
   bank and one of an industrial company. A craving among Dutch employers
   for flexibility, fuelled by the norm of security that impacts their
   perception of potential benefits of investments in employability, is
   crucial to our understanding of employacurity in the Netherlands.},

Abstract = {The article attempts to answer the question about the future of housing
   system in the Czech Republic. As other transition countries, the Czech
   Republic underwent the substantial reform of housing system leading to
   the change in tenure structure in favour of owner-occupied housing. The
   authors discuss the basis and implicit aspects of tenure reform. The
   change in tenure structure was more gradual than in most other
   transition countries and together with other specific conditions it gave
   the chance to rental housing becoming a real alternative to
   homeownership tenure in the future. Using the results from several
   attitude surveys and unique experiment, the authors tried to find out
   whether there is any chance of deviating from the path leading towards a
   housing system unilaterally based on homeownership tenure. The empirical
   results, however, show that people's tenure preferences remain strongly
   skewed in favour of owner-occupation. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd

Journal = {POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {58},

Abstract = {This article is concerned with the obligation of State Parties to report
   to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, and discusses the
   politics involved in the reporting process, showing what strategy each
   state chooses to employ. An empirical study shows that the reported
   improvements in children's rights depend not only on the State Party's
   economic means, but also on its will to report truthfully. Based on John
   Rawls' `The Law of the Peoples', I develop four ideal types of state
   with regard to the reporting process, and present game-theoretical
   explanations for their chosen strategies. The outcome is that a burdened
   state, illustrated by Burkina Faso, will tell the truth about children's
   rights in the state; a high-risk state, illustrated by Guatemala, will
   conceal or avoid eliciting sensitive information for its reports; a
   quasi-established liberal democracy, illustrated by Estonia, will also
   conceal information that shows its child rights record is not as clean
   as that of a liberal democracy; and a liberal democracy, illustrated by
   New Zealand, will tell the truth, provide all available information and
   point out existing problems. The article ends with a discussion about
   how to take the political factor out of the reporting process.},

Abstract = {In his article, ``Rethinking Indivisibility: Towards a Theory of
   Supporting Relations between Human Rights,{''} James Nickel challenges
   the common view that human rights are mutually linked in such a way that
   they are ``indivisible.{''} Although Nickel compellingly shows that the
   ideas of indivisibility and linkage arguments, as they have been used by
   many proponents, are ultimately unsatisfactory; I argue that we should
   not drop them or downplay their importance. We certainly must avoid
   exaggerated construals of indivisibility and linkage claims. They are
   not only false, but also could weaken the force of human rights
   discourse. But we should also avoid viewing such claims as too weak.
   Nickel warns against the first mistake, and I warn against the second.
   Rather, we should provide weaker, but still robust, versions of linkage
   arguments. I offer some hypotheses for those reformulations and suggest
   some examples of their fruitful application.
   In conclusion, this response maintains that the exploration of
   supporting relations between human rights retains great significance for
   the theory and practice of human rights.},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Evo Morales assumed office in January 2006 with a resounding mandate
   from marginalized indigenous peoples to reinvent Bolivia. Five hundred
   years of colonial and republican rule, combined with 20 years of
   neoliberal economic policy in this poorly consolidated democracy,
   constrained his ability to reshape the country during his first term in
   office. Morales still faces the fundamental challenges of (1) national
   oligarchies, (2) limited administrative capacity, (3) rent seeking and
   institutionalized corruption, (4) social movements, and (5)
   transnational actors. Rather than being distinct, these challenges are
   overdetermined: the economic challenges of transforming an extractive
   economy are intertwined with the lack of government capacity that is the
   legacy of exclusionary social and political processes since the Spanish
   conquest. Armed with the firm political will embodied in the new
   constitution, he has consolidated his support, and this has allowed his
   government to begin its second administration in a better position than
   almost all its predecessors as it attempts to create a more equitable
   society.},

Abstract = {Debate has raged over the extent to which New Labour has succeeded in
   incorporating an ethical dimension in British foreign policy. The
   assumption has been that New Labour at least changed the context of
   foreign policy by adopting a more moralistic language. However, there
   has been no attempt as yet to show this statistically. Using
   computer-assisted content analysis of Margaret Thatcher's, Robin Cook's
   and Tony Blair's foreign policy speeches, and assuming that Blair, as
   opposed to Cook, is the representative voice of New Labour, this
   research finds that New Labour has indeed changed the context
   significantly. However, this change did not occur until after the events
   of 9/11.},

Abstract = {A watershed in the politics of public management in France was crossed
   in 2001, when the French president and prime minister signed off a law
   initiated by the French Parliament to reform the planning and control of
   public expenditure. This legislation, the Organic Law on Laws of Finance
   of August 1, 2001 (generally known as the LOLF), requires public
   authorities to adopt performance-oriented ideas and public management
   approaches, and seeks to rebalance executive and parliamentary powers
   over the public purse. This article uses the LOLF as a case study to
   gain insight into the politics of public management policymaking in
   France as developed in recent decades. The article starts with an
   original historiographic account of the policymaking around the law,
   follows with a research argument explaining the policy choice, and
   concludes with some field-level research questions on the politics of
   public management reform in France.},

Abstract = {This study applies social cognitive theory to the study of voter
   turnout, examining the effects of self-efficacy on citizens decisions of
   whether or not to vote. Consistent with recent arguments in cognitive
   psychology (Fenton-O'Creevy, Nicholson, Soane, \& Willman, 2003, 2005),
   I argue that excessive perceptions of self-efficacy lead some citizens
   to overestimate their vote's impact in close elections and to vote as a
   consequence of these perceptions. This illusion of control is further
   engendered by the features of skill-based activities such as choice,
   personal involvement, stimulus familiarity, and exertion of effort
   (Langer, 1975) that are inherent in the act of voting. Employing both
   cross-sectional and panel data, I find that individuals with high levels
   of self-efficacy are more likely to be moved to vote by perceptions that
   an election will be close than are citizens with low levels of
   self-efficacy.},

Abstract = {This article argues that interdisciplinary collaboration can offer
   significant intellectual gains to political science in terms of
   methodological insights, questioning received assumptions and providing
   new perspectives on subject fields. Collaboration with natural
   scientists has been less common than collaboration with social
   scientists, but can be intellectually more rewarding. Interdisciplinary
   work with biological scientists can be especially valuable given the
   history of links between the two subjects and the similarity of some of
   the methodological challenges faced. The authors have been involved in
   two projects with biological scientists and this has led them critically
   to explore issues relating to the philosophy of science, in particular
   the similarities and differences between social and natural science,
   focusing on three issues: the problem of agency, the experimental
   research design and the individualistic fallacy. It is argued that
   interdisciplinary research can be fostered through shared understandings
   of what constitutes `justified beliefs'. Political science can help
   natural scientists to understand a more sophisticated understanding of
   the policy process. Such research brings a number of practical
   challenges and the authors explain how they have sought to overcome
   them.},

Abstract = {There have been heated debates on outcome and orientation of China's
   economic reforms which started in the late 1970s. Though most of the
   previous studies on Chinese politics concentrate on the role of elites
   in policy-making, I argue that the intellectual discourse over policy
   have become increasingly salient in the post-Mao period. The paper
   focuses on the following research questions: How and under what
   circumstances did the New Left and liberals emerge in China? What are
   the major debates between the two? To what extent have the New Leftists
   and liberals affected the economic reforms and what change they might
   bring to the political climate?},

Abstract = {This article discusses the probability of increased communal conflict in
   African states due to the ``political vulnerability{''} of groups to
   climate change. From an initial examination of communal conflicts in
   Sub-Saharan Africa, the risk of conflict depends largely on the size and
   political importance of ethnic groups. Environmental issues can be
   catalysts to low-level conflict in marginalized communities, but the
   critical factor is the extent of political and economic marginalization.
   Small, politically insignificant ethnic groups experience most conflicts
   related to environmental pressures. This framework informs a prediction
   of where we should expect to see high levels of politically induced
   vulnerability and resultant intra- and intercommunal conflicts.},

Abstract = {There is a comforting consensus among political commentators that the
   2007 presidential election marked the end of Jean-Marie Le Pen as a
   force in French politics. The shock election of the Front National
   leader to the presidential run-off in 2002, by contrast, is explained as
   a surge in the Le Pen vote specific to the prevailing electoral
   conditions. This article challenges that interpretation of both
   elections. It shows that, despite Le Pen's unforeseen success in 2002,
   there was no surge of support for him, and that despite Le Pen's
   supposed collapse in 2007, he won close to 4 million votes while popular
   agreement with his ideas rose to its highest recorded level. The article
   concludes that Le Pen remains a powerful presence in French politics and
   that his supporters continue to constitute a large and highly
   influential constituency.},

Title = {Negotiated capital: conflict, its resolution, and workplace social
   capital},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {21},
Number = {3},
Pages = {236-259},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the effects of
   conflict and conflict resolution on employee perceptions of unit social
   capital The paper aims to test the overarching proposition that social
   capital is affected by different types of conflict and by organizational
   methods used to manage them
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper's hypotheses were tested using
   survey data collected as part of a case study conducted in a large Ohio
   hospital that had adopted a conflict management system Survey data from
   791 hospital employees were used to test hypotheses regarding the
   relationship between conflict and its management and social capital
   Findings - Analysis of the data supports the paper's proposition that
   different forms of conflict affect perceptions of social capital
   differently Relationship and task conflict were significantly and
   negatively related to employee perceptions of social capital Conflict
   regarding patient care issues, on the other hand, was significantly and
   positively related to employee perceptions of social capital Results
   support the hypothesized direct and indirect effects of conflict
   management on social capital In addition to directly increasing
   perceptions of social capital, one of the conflict management options
   examined (supervisor-assisted) moderated the relationship between
   relationship and task conflict and social capital.
   Research limitations/implications - The research implies that
   organizational conflict affects social capital More importantly,
   different forms of conflict affect social capital in different ways
   Furthermore, the findings imply that organizational management of
   conflict plays an important role in increasing perceptions of social
   capital Shortcomings include the use of cross-sectional data and the
   generalizability of findings from one hospital to other settings
   Practical implications - The findings suggest that an organization's
   approach to conflict and conflict management will affect perceived
   levels of social capital. In addition, organizations must be nuanced in
   the way they manage and resolve different types of conflict Finally,
   findings suggest that supervisors play an important role in increasing
   unit social capital by assisting employees in resolving conflict
   Originality/value - The paper provides one of the first empirical
   examinations of the relationship between conflict, conflict resolution
   and social capital},

Abstract = {The process of internalisation of norms within different institutions is
   not homogenous, its speed and depth depending on several factors. Using
   the case of sustainable development in dams, this article analyses
   actors - here, dam promoters - whose institutional or disciplinary
   culture does not lend them to easily take these norms into account. The
   hypothesis is that the ``identity{''} and the disciplinary or
   ideological capacity of these ``technical{''} institutions play an
   important role in the internalisation of non technical, social, norms.
   This follows Young's recent arguments concerning the role the internal
   structure of international institutions plays in internalising and
   spreading environmental norms.},

   emphasizing the crucial role of their leadership style on the political
   management of Inquiries. After integrating theoretical and empirical
   findings on crisis management and political leadership styles, we
   illustrate our heuristic by applying it to the Bush administration's
   response to Hurrican Katrina in 2005. We conclude by offering
   suggestions for further research on the underdeveloped subject of the
   blame management challenges faced by political leaders in the wake of
   acute crisis episodes.},

Abstract = {This paper contributes to the environmental justice literature by
   addressing several outstanding issues in a single study. Using a
   cross-time data set that allows us to control for the prevalent
   ``chicken-and-egg{''} or ``which-came-first{''} problem, we analyze the
   relative importance of poverty and race/ethnicity in an analysis that
   includes economic costs, potential legal costs, and potential collective
   action. Because the most appropriate functional form is not obvious, we
   use several methods, including Tobit, Poisson, and ordinary least
   squares, on different forms of the dependent variable. In every case,
   controlling for the population present at the time of disamenity
   location and controlling the other factors mentioned, we find evidence
   of disproportionate collocation based on race/ethnicity, but not on
   poverty alone. We also find that the potential for collective action
   decreases the likelihood of receipt of the studied disamenities.},

Abstract = {Over the past decade, the dominance of `new localism', `partnerships'
   and `social inclusion' in policy discourse in countries of the
   Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has
   influenced Australian stated policy directions in employment services.
   In contrast to other OECD countries, however, Australian federal
   legislators have excluded local government in contractual service
   delivery and governance arrangements. In response, some Australian local
   governments draw on UK practice to guide social inclusion agendas and
   inclusive partnership models. There is irony in such use of policy
   transfer strategies given that the UK is currently reforming public
   employment services to emphasise the contractualism that typifies the
   Australian Job Network.},

Journal = {POLITICS RELIGION \& IDEOLOGY},

Pages = {203-212},
Abstract = {There are very few studies that have compared the UAE and Pakistan. This
   is surprising, given that these states enjoy close relations, while
   having distinctive differences. This article attempts to elucidate a
   clear theory of state formation in the political and historical routes
   to modernity and identity in post-colonial states with specific
   reference to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Pakistan, and with
   particular focus on the influence of religion (Islam) in state
   formation. What kinds of factors are most important to explain outcomes?
   The article emphasises the lessons that can be learned from a successful
   state (like the UAE) for a less successful state (like Pakistan) that is
   continually undermined by both factionalism and religious/ tribal
   formations. Although I stop short of calling Pakistan a `failed' state,
   I do examine the serious problems and dilemmas the government has faced
   -and continues to confront - in seeking to build the rule of law and
   control its territory. The differences between UAE and Pakistan have not
   been resolved in the context of both modernisation and globalisation. I
   conclude that, largely as a result of the impact of modernisation and
   globalisation, secularisation -the public decline of religiosity - has
   resulted in a far more successful state in the UAE than in Pakistan.
   This article explains: (1) why this is the case; and (2) under what
   conditions it has taken place. The comparative historical aspects of
   this account hopefully lead to a fuller understanding of: (1) state
   formation and development in both countries; and (2) the role of
   religion in this context.},

Abstract = {The aim of the paper is to analyse party attitudes towards the European
   Union (EU) and the issue of citizenship as voiced by the party central
   office in the official programmatic platforms. For this purpose,
   Euromanifestos have been coded by applying the common framework of the
   IntUne project. Accordingly, the article attempts to assess the degree
   of convergence between the attitudes of both the party central office
   and the MPs towards the EU in Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain. The
   article attempts as well to assess the validity of the main theoretical
   arguments available in the literature that explain these attitudes.},

Journal = {REVIEW OF AFRICAN POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {37},
Number = {123},
Pages = {71-85},
Abstract = {A common view of the developmental prospects of sub-Saharan Africa is
   that the crucial obstacle is political. Stronger states and
   representative institutions are a necessary precondition for
   development. This is a common view in both the media and in academe. The
   paper argues that this is to get things the wrong way round. Rather it
   is development, specifically the capitalist form of development, which
   is the necessary condition for strong states and democratic
   institutions. This is something which theorists of the state in Africa
   have got consistently wrong. Strong states require in the first instance
   neither the overthrow of patrimonialism nor of the bifurcated state.
   What they require is a radical change in the property relations that
   tend to prevail over most of the sub-continent: a change that would
   instantiate a process of capital accumulation but which is unlikely to
   be forthcoming.},

Title = {When `Bolkestein' is trapped by the French anti-liberal discourse: a
   discursive-institutionalist account of preference formation in the realm

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {17},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the bottom-up preference formation over the
   draft Directive over services liberalization and its impact on
   co-decision at the European Union (EU) level from the theoretical
   perspective of discursive institutionalism. Firstly, it is demonstrated
   that the anti-liberal discourse framed by the French left led President
   Chirac to reconfigure his strategic interests and embrace a strongly
   anti-liberal stance against the proposed Directive. Secondly, evidence
   that the anti-liberal discourse framed by the radical left was very
   efficient in politicizing the Directive proposal is provided. This
   forced the governments to act responsively towards public opinions while
   using communicative discourse in the intergovernmental realm. Since the
   French position overlapped some of the key actors' preferences, it
   played a crucial role in altering the initial balance of power. The
   quest for a compromise securing a super-qualified majority within the
   European Parliament implied both the use of communicative discourse
   against the Bolkestein proposal and the relative neutralization of its
   anti-liberal aspects.},

Pages = {542-570},
Abstract = {Despite an 88-year history, the Japanese Communist Party (JCP) {[}Nihon
   Kyosanto] remains largely unknown beyond Japan. Domestically, Japan's
   fifth largest party is saddled with an image that, for many, continues
   to provoke feelings of unease and doubt. During the past 13 years,
   following the 21st party congress of 1997, the party leadership of Kazuo
   Shii and Tetsuzo Fuwa, utilizing the phrase `Unity of principle and
   flexibility', has sought to temper this unease by means of a series of
   organizational and ideational reforms that are intended to present a
   softer and more pragmatic image to the outside world while reassuring
   the party core that the JCP brand remains intact. The sustainability of
   this Janus-like approach. in the face of the contextual realities of
   Japanese party politics, is coming under severe pressure.},

Pages = {1231-1252},
Abstract = {Postal regulation has changed dramatically within the European Union
   over the past decade. This article theorizes and empirically
   investigates domestic conditions which have shaped the institutional
   realization of regulatory reform. It seeks to explore how the
   commitment-control problem, inherent to any delegated setting, has been
   resolved in different countries. In which ways have national governments
   delegated regulatory powers to independent agencies and how do these
   operate in practice? Combining delegation theory and the variety of
   capitalism approach, expectations for three distinct varieties of
   delegation are formulated which are then exposed to empirical scrutiny
   studying the UK, Germany and France. The typology accounts for
   cross-country variance in de facto agency independence and regulatory
   practice, but contradicts patterns of formal delegation. In view of a
   striking discrepancy between formal arrangements and actual practice,
   the author makes a strong argument in favour of studying the dynamic and
   longitudinal effects of interaction.},

Journal = {REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE POLITICA INTERNACIONAL},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {53},
Number = {1},
Pages = {141-156},
Abstract = {The foreign policy options of Brazil are limited in view of the superior
   hard power of the established great powers. Brazil's soft balancing
   strategy involves institutional strategies such as the formation of
   limited diplomatic coalitions or ententes, such as BRIC, to constrain
   the power of the established great powers. The BRIC states have been
   amongst the most powerful drivers of incremental change in world
   diplomacy and they benefit most from the connected global power shifts.
   In a global order shaped by great powers through international
   institutions, those players who effectively operate within them as
   innovators, coalition builders and spokesmen while preserving great
   amounts of sovereignty and independence have the potential to
   substantially influence the outcomes of future global politics.},

   evidence confirming this expectation is lacking. By assessing the
   implementation of European transport legislation, this article provides
   an empirical insight into the role played by two EU agencies - the
   European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) and the European Aviation Safety
   Agency (EASA). The analysis shows that these EU-level agencies, although
   created as independent entities to enhance uniform implementation,
   remain highly dependent on the member states and the Commission. In
   terms of (legislative) enforcement their contribution has thus been
   limited. EU agencies such as EMSA and EASA currently seem to add more
   value by stimulating mutual learning processes among national regulatory
   authorities.},

Abstract = {This study examines public management challenges faced by educational
   agencies that are required to set up a market for providing choice in
   supplemental educational services (SES) for students in underperforming
   schools and to hold nongovernmental providers accountable for their
   performance in increasing student achievement. The operations and
   performance of SES providers in a large urban school district, as well
   as how their performance in increasing student achievement relates to
   their market shares, are examined empirically and through qualitative
   information gathered through focus groups, interviews, and student
   surveys. The study finds that SES provider market shares were not highly
   correlated with estimates of provider performance or other relevant
   vendor characteristics, and local educational agencies were not
   satisfied with their level of control over service quality and
   educational outcomes. Control over the flow of funds, which improved
   over time, was their primary lever for managing these third-party
   relationships.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the little-known plans formulated by Harold
   Wilson's Labour government to deploy Polaris submarines in the
   Indo-Pacific region. The scheme was first proposed in 1965 as a response
   to several problems faced by British policy-makers, including China's
   acquisition of a nuclear capability, Britain's wish to maintain a
   meaningful position `East of Suez' at reduced cost, and German pressure
   for equal treatment within NATO on nuclear matters. Despite extensive
   high-level discussion, the plans were finally abandoned in mid-1968, as
   Labour moved more decisively to forsake the world role.},

Abstract = {This article reviews the political-scientific literature on European
   competition policy (ECP) in the 2000s. Based on four journals and an
   upfront methodology, it analyses the literature both quantitatively and
   qualitatively. It shows that although a few sub-policy areas are still
   neglected, ECP is not the under-researched policy it used to be.
   Further, the literature has greatly improved since the 1990s: almost all
   articles now present a clear research question, and most advance
   specific theoretical claims/hypotheses. Yet, additional improvements can
   be made on research methods and, above all, theorizing (e.g., in the
   game-theoretical treatment of delegation problems, or social
   choice-theoretical treatments of the Commission). Indeed, it is
   paradoxical that ECP specialists do not pay more attention to
   theoretical questions which are so central to the actual policy area
   they study.},

Pages = {518-537},
Abstract = {Proponents of the cosmopolitan view of ecological citizenship claim that
   in order to fulfil the moral obligations of global justice, citizens
   must undergo deep attitude shifts and adopt green civic virtues. To test
   this empirically, a typology of four major combinations of environmental
   attitudes and ecological practise is constructed and the extent to which
   these four citizen types are found in Sweden is assessed using data from
   nationwide annual surveys. Discovery of a large group of citizens whose
   practice is green ecological but who exhibit grey environmental
   attitudes leads to the conclusion that, contrary to the assertions of
   proponents of the cosmopolitan view, citizens can indeed come out
   ecologically clean without undergoing deep attitudinal shifts, without
   turning green.},

Abstract = {What has changed is the way in which society is integrated, puts itself
   in order. A model of analysis is prepared with the concepts of
   diversification and social complexity that makes it possible to refer
   the transformations of different systems (political, economic,
   juridical) to the sphere of social integration. Due to the state
   centralization that governs it, the post-revolutionary order makes
   politics the key function of integration and its own system the
   predominant one. Social coordination is high, but the internal
   alternatives are restricted. Political hyperfunction decreases with the
   new order: the autonomy of the other systems self-limits it. Social
   coordination diminishes structurally and increasing it requires criteria
   and principles different from those of post-revolutionary society.},

Journal = {PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {88},
Number = {4},
Pages = {960-978},
Abstract = {This paper argues that `leaderism' - as an emerging set of beliefs that
   frames and justifies certain innovatory changes in contemporary
   organizational and managerial practice - is a development of
   managerialism that has been utilized and applied within the policy
   discourse of public service reform in the UK. The paper suggests that
   `leaderism' is an evolution of entrepreneurial and cultural management
   ideologies and practices. An analysis of the articulation of leaderism
   with public service reform in the UK is presented. The paper
   problematizes the construals of leadership contained within these texts
   and reflects on their promotion of leadership as a social and
   organizational technology. `Leaderism' is argued to be a complementary
   set of discourses, metaphors and practices to those of managerialism,
   which is being utilized in support of the evolution of NPM and new
   public governance approaches in the re-orientation of the public
   services towards the consumer-citizen.},

Journal = {REVIEW OF AFRICAN POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {37},
Number = {126},
Pages = {483-495},
Abstract = {This article interrogates the framing of the resource curse as a central
   causal mechanism in the resource abundance-conflict nexus in Africa. It
   is argued that explaining such conflicts on the basis of the ways
   natural resources either act as an incentive/motive for rebel groups, or
   erode and weaken states, does not adequately capture the complex
   histories, dimensions and transnational linkages to civil conflict in
   Africa. The article lays bare the attempts by a hegemonic discourse to
   obfuscate the reality of the fundamental and transnational underpinnings
   of the resource-conflict nexus. It is argued that the resource curse
   perspective cannot fully explain conflict in African oil states, and
   rather, a case is made for an alternative model based on radical
   political economy which lays bare the class relations, contradictions
   and conflicts rooted in the subordination of the continent and its
   resources to transnational processes and elites embedded in globalised
   capitalist relations.},

Abstract = {In their attempt to promote ``better regulation,{''} governments have
   ended up with increasing regulation of rule-making. Regulatory impact
   assessment (RIA) is a manifestation of this trend. This article draws on
   the positive political economy hypothesis that RIA is an administrative
   control device. Rational politicians-positive political economy
   argues-design administrative requirements to solve problems of political
   uncertainty. This is a rather abstract hypothesis but with clearly
   observable implications. Empirical analysis on Canada, Denmark, the
   Netherlands, Sweden, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the EU
   shows that the modes and level of control vary, with almost no evidence
   supporting the positive political economy hypothesis in Denmark and
   Sweden and more robust evidence in the other cases, especially the
   United States and the United Kingdom. The EU scores high, but control
   has both a political component and an infra-organizational dimension. In
   between the extremes I find modest levels of political control in Canada
   and the Netherlands.},

Abstract = {This article investigates a least likely case of non-governmental
   organization (NGO) influence on an intergovernmental organization (IGO).
   Specifically, it explores the puzzle of how the Roma (Gypsies)-a
   relatively poor, marginalized and unmobilized minority group-suddenly
   gained international attention and policy responses by the European
   Union. Based on field research and document analysis, this article
   connects the national, international and transnational to explain the
   role of NGOs, IGOs and the Roma themselves in bringing attention to the
   situation of the Roma in Central and Eastern Europe. The author finds
   that a small transnational advocacy network played a critical role, and
   provides both normative and practical explanations for the EU's
   response.},

   philosophy to Transition Towns},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {19},
Number = {6},
Pages = {869-887},
Abstract = {The contribution that the philosophy of Gilles Deleuze might offer to
   researchers studying social innovation in response to climate change is
   explored. Since the publication of the Stern report, it has been
   recognised that climate change requires major changes in the way our
   economy is organised, but it also requires significant social and
   behavioural change. Can this be usefully viewed through the prism of
   theories of social innovation? How might such social innovation affect
   the life chances of the socially excluded, and to what extent does it,
   therefore, offer a space for radical social change? Transition Towns - a
   community movement in response to climate change - is used as a
   test-case of these ideas.},

Journal = {ETHNOPOLITICS},

Volume = {9},

Pages = {379-399},
Abstract = {The main purpose of this article is to reassess the Israeli-Jewish
   Diaspora relations from the Israeli perspective and how these are
   conducted. From this point of view the article focuses on a number of
   issues, such as the Israeli public's attitudes toward the Diaspora; the
   current ideologies and agendas in this sphere; the formal positions of
   Israeli governments; and the debatable issues of interdependence and
   centrality of the two parts of the Jewish nation. On the basis of these
   and other connected aspects, the article suggests an analytical
   framework for the analysis of homeland-diaspora relations from the
   homeland's perspective. The more general argument is that the
   Israeli-Jewish case study can serve as an explanatory example according
   to which other homelands' relations with their diasporas may be
   researched and analysed.},

Title = {Policy discourse and public spheres: the Habermas paradox},
Journal = {CRITICAL POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {4},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-17},
Abstract = {Emerging attention to policy discourse and network models of governance
   render dubious Jurgen Habermas' claim that discourses do not govern. His
   position follows from a sharp delineation between civil society and the
   state and from a conceptual strategy, centering on a bifurcation of
   lifeworld and system, that tends to deflect attention from multiple,
   complex ways in which discourses connect public spheres with the policy
   process. Given his substantial influence on the emergence of critical
   policy studies, Habermas thus presents a paradox. Although his work has
   served to advance the critique of technocracy, his conceptual strategy
   tends to reinforce technocratic self-images in a way that would inhibit
   a move from monologue to dialogue in policy discourse. The potential for
   such a move suggests that the question to ask is not whether discourses
   govern, but which discourses are to be involved in governing.},

Abstract = {Notions of right, wrong, and moral are difficult to comprehend since
   these notions differ throughout the world, given the different cultures
   in which they are found. This difficulty is further complicated by
   inevitable social changes that characterize modern societies; changes
   that have sometimes challenged these notions as a consequence of
   secularization and pluralism, with some stemming from religious
   influences. Given this fact, one who chooses to live by cultural
   prescription may often find oneself in conflict with notions of social
   justice in another cultural setting. The need to understand cultural
   norms of a given society, community, or ethnic group is therefore
   necessary in order to interrogate notions of right, wrong, and moral in
   a given context. In this article I examine the tension between the
   African concept of the individual and the notion of the human rights to
   highlight possibilities in reconciling human rights values to the
   African social cultural context in effort to promote the common good
   that is embedded in social justice.},

Abstract = {We examine the commitments of transnational corporations to human

   commitment as a function of the nature of the firm's business activities

   adherence to the principles entailed in the UN Global Compact program by
   the world's 2000 largest companies. Our results suggest that the
   decisions to participate in and to take steps to comply with the Global
   Compact are influenced by the characteristics of the firm as it adapts
   to its institutional and political environment. Signing up to the
   program increases the likelihood of firms developing human
   rights-related company policies and receiving positive external
   assessments of their performance.},

Abstract = {In this research we hypothesize that aggregate PAC behavior is
   conditional in nature. PACs in a specific issue sector donate more to a
   certain political party's candidates the more that political party
   controls the legislature. However, the more active the legislature is on
   a specific set of issues the more people/groups/PACs are mobilized in
   response to the issue. Thus, a conditional relationship emerges where
   aggregate PAC donations to a political party are a function of party
   control, agenda activity, and an interaction of the two. We test this
   conditional theory using data from the Institute on Money in State
   Politics database on PAC donations to state legislative candidates
   divided into issue sectors. Our results provide support for our
   hypotheses that aggregate PAC donations to a political party's
   candidates are conditional on the level of agenda activity on the issues
   that concern the PACs.},

Abstract = {Issues remain at the core of armed conflict. Territory, in particular,
   appears to increase substantially the probability of inter-state
   violence and is concluded by many to be one of the most critical
   correlates of war onset. While scholars have called for an issue-based
   approach to the study of international relations for some time, recent
   data collection efforts allow the emergence and management of
   contentious issues over time to be studied more directly. Our argument
   and evidence suggest that territory is not necessarily contentious by
   itself, but is contentious in dyadic contexts characterized by rivalry.
   Using data from the Issue Correlates of War project, which codes
   specific government assertions of ownership to territory, river, and
   maritime locations, we find strategic rivalry, coupled with territorial
   claims, produces some of the most conflict-prone dyads. Further, jointly
   democratic domestic institutions do not appear to reduce the hazard of
   violent conflict over territorial issues within the context of rivalry,
   although they substantially reduce the hazard of violent conflict among
   states outside the context of rivalry.},

   is argued that a relative definition formalises the insight that poverty
   is a context-specific phenomenon, and that the understanding of what
   constitutes poverty changes with overall economic development. Yet this
   article argues that tagging a poverty line to mean or median incomes
   does not automatically anchor it in its social context. Relative
   measures rely on the implicit assumptions that social norms are formed
   at the national level, and that median income earners set social
   standards. A comparison with studies on `Subjective Well-Being' (SWB)
   shows that these assumptions are rather arbitrary. At the same time,
   relative indicators do not take account of changes in the product market
   structure that disproportionately affect the poor. If low-cost
   substitutes for expensive items become available, the poor will be
   relatively more affected than median income earners. Conventional
   `absolute poverty' indicators will be equally dismissed for not solving
   these problems either. A combined `Consensual Material Deprivation' and
   `Budget Standard Approach' indicator will be proposed as a more robust
   alternative.},

Abstract = {It is often argued that at the root of the Taiwan question are the
   myriad differences in politics, ideology, identity, and economy between
   mainland China and Taiwan. Any prospect for its peaceful resolution, it
   seems, hinges on bridging those differences through economic and/or
   political integration. Although the Taiwan conundrum has much to do with
   wide-ranging cross-strait divergence, this article argues that it cannot
   be disconnected from one important commonality between Beijing and
   Taipei, namely, a cross-strait normative convergence on the Westphalian
   notion of state sovereignty. Encompassing an exclusionary understanding
   of final authority, territory, and identity, Westphalian sovereignty
   provides both Beijing and Taipei with a common meaning that Taiwan is an
   issue of sovereignty, central to their respective national identity and
   political survival and hence not subject to compromise. As a
   consequence, it argues that this common meaning is paradoxically
   responsible for much of the mistrust, tension, and deadlock in
   cross-strait relations. In order to find a long-term solution to the
   Taiwan impasse, we need to pay attention to this particular normative
   convergence as well as to the many differences across the Taiwan Strait.},

Abstract = {Much thought has been put into developing rationales for the
   process-tracing method, but proponents of this narrative method have
   been agnostic about the criterial demands for `writing up' a case study.
   This article addresses that lack through a double reading. First, I show
   that `good' process-tracing prose mirrors a narrative voice found in
   Victorian fiction, most notably in George Eliot's Middlemarch. Then, in
   the second reading, I critique this narrative approach through a close
   reading of Middlemarch. In doing so, I explain how this style attempts
   (and ultimately fails) to mask its own pre-theoretical political
   commitments. For process-tracing to seem effective, its practitioners
   must turn a blind eye to the theoretical consequences of narrative style
   and must remain silent on the instability inherent in their prose.},

Abstract = {As politics continues to be intertwined with complex, rapidly advancing
   bodies of knowledge, the question arises of how we are to understand the
   relationship between democracy and expertise. Recent discussions have
   focused on the capacity for democratic political institutions to address
   complex technical and scientific issues. These discussions have a
   post-positivist starting point, emphasising the contested, varied and
   dispersed nature of technical-scientific knowledge and expertise. Yet,
   as this article explores with particular reference to the work of Hayek,
   the sources of tension between democracy, complexity and expertise
   involve complex economic as well as technical-scientific dimensions.
   Starting from a similarly `post-positivist' view of economic knowledge,
   Hayek famously concludes that over-reliance upon political expertise
   carries the danger of authoritarianism. He looks to the market as the
   most suitable institutional process for addressing complex economic
   choices, reflecting the various goals of individuals across society. As
   more recent writers have shown, this radically pro-market conclusion
   overlooks the profound social and environmental implications of market
   failure. Yet it is argued here that we can draw from the Hayekian
   understanding of complexity and its implications to enrich our
   understanding of how non-market, democratic institutions might handle
   those dimensions of complexity that cannot be adequately addressed
   through markets alone. Hence Hayekian insights can serve as an aid to
   re-conceptualising the concept of expertise as performing a potentially
   enabling role on behalf of political democracy.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to explain how the key characteristics of ``stem cell
   research{''} as an emerging technology facilitate the strategy of an
   Iranian organization, namely, ``the Royan Institute{''} to learn by
   interaction and to generate knowledge. It argues that the Royan could
   take advantage of the window of opportunity that stem cell research and
   technology had temporarily opened up but its endeavors are now being
   hampered by unfavorable international factors and weak domestic
   infrastructure. The article substantiates the case by giving an
   objective account of networking and gatekeeping in the process of
   learning/innovation at the Royan and concludes by questioning the
   continuity of the actual learning strategy in order to sustain the
   Royan's knowledge production.},

Abstract = {This article argues that the mainstream public sphere needs to provide a
   more accurate portrayal of public opinion on race and immigration.
   British newspapers are often accused of racism: that they might be
   representing the views of many of their readers is dismissed. The free
   circulation of ideas, however unpalatable some might be to `enlightened'
   thought, is essential. The press can play a key role in a more inclusive
   public debate by allowing readers' views greater prominence and by
   opening their news and comment pages to a wider range of opinion.
   Concerns that readers will be seduced by extremism say more about elite
   perceptions of the malleability of the masses than about concern for
   democratic debate.},

Abstract = {Public agencies increasingly perform their functions in partnership with
   other public, nonprofit, and private sector actors, prompting growing
   research interest in how these collaborations function. As yet, almost
   no one has thought it worth asking how collaborative partners perceive
   each other's performance, although these perceptions may themselves
   constitute important measures of agency effectiveness. Their
   determinants, in turn, could point to how agency effectiveness might be
   enhanced. This article examines these perceptions and their possible
   determinants for the partnerships between the state of Georgia's
   Department of Transportation and the state's local governments. Drawing
   from prior research on citizen satisfaction with local governments, the
   article proposes a preliminary theory of local government partner
   perceptions of state agency performance, including several principal
   dimensions of those perceptions-customer, partner, and overseer or
   principal-and hypotheses on possible determinants of those perceptions.
   The relevance of the dimensions and the hypotheses are then tested using
   data from two surveys of local government officials in Georgia. A
   concluding section offers speculations on the meaning of these findings
   for thinking about public service collaborations.},

Volume = {1},

Abstract = {This article presents an analysis of the multilateral system, arguing
   that multilateralism is going through a profound set of changes as a
   result of: (1) the emergence of new multilateral actors; (2) the
   development of new multilateral playing fields; and (3) the rise of new
   concepts of multilateralism. This has consequences for world politics:
   the world is moving from unipolarity towards a networked form of
   multipolarity. This article proposes to grasp these changes through the
   `Web 2.0' metaphor, as the existing multilateral system is contrasted
   with the emerging `Mode 2.0' of which the main characteristics are: (1)
   the diversification of multilateral organisations; (2) the growing
   importance of nonstate actors such as substate regions and supranational
   regional organisations; (3) the increased interlinkages between policy
   domains; and (4) the growing space for citizen involvement. The main
   upshot is that the multilateral system is moving from a closed to an
   open system. Both states and international organisations will have to
   adapt to this new reality.},

Abstract = {Ernesto Laclau's perspective on populism allows for a more accurate
   understanding of the current political scene in Bolivia than a focus on
   the concept of ``social movements.{''} In Santa Cruz, Bolivia's
   economically strongest department, certain historical and social
   characteristics have produced strong regionalist sentiment against the
   central government and a militant and absolutist identity discourse. The
   Cruceno opposition movement revolves around a civic institutionalism
   allied with the region's economic and cultural powers represented by the
   Comite Pro Santa Cruz (Pro-Santa Cruz Committee). Since the October 2003
   crisis, without being a political party, it has managed to position
   itself as a conservative actor with tremendous power of assembly in
   challenging the policies of the Morales government.},

Abstract = {This article examines the influence of extrinsic and intrinsic factors
   on decision-making conflict on governing boards in public organizations.
   Using survey data from more than 700 school board members in California,
   I investigate the degree to which various characteristics of the
   environment in which the board operates, processes the board implements,
   and traits of board members themselves predict how often the board
   experiences division among its members and how well its members report
   being able to work together. The findings point out that external
   characteristics play a large role in predicting intraboard conflict. In
   particular, boards in urban districts with large numbers of nonwhite
   students and more active interest group environments experience greater
   conflict. However, internal characteristics also make a difference.
   Boards that use more professional decision practices and whose members
   share a common vision for their work experience conflict at
   substantially lower rates. Also, whereas ideological heterogeneity among
   board members positively predicts conflict, contrary to expectations,
   racial diversity is associated with less division among board members.},

Abstract = {Ethnographic approaches to sovereignty have focused on de jure or de
   facto practices and relations of rule constituted through culturally
   mediated violence inscribing incorporation or exclusion onto human
   bodies. Sovereignty as such is historically and territorially
   variegated, even within nation-state borders, and observable as emergent
   processes that seek to (re) order authority, territoriality, and
   sociality within, against, or in complicity with the formal operations
   of the state. In post-neoliberal Bolivia, state and social-movement
   efforts to ``seat{''} (sentar) sovereignty and ``reestablish{''}
   (refundar) the state pose an interpretive challenge to critical
   ethnographers of power because sovereignty-making practices have
   instrumentalized the production of sacrificial subjects in alliance with
   subaltern movements rather than enactments of violence against them.
   Examination of a conflict over the Guarani territory of Alto Parapet
   reveals the way state and movement tactics of transnational witnessing,
   legal inscription, and the visualization of violence on the ground are
   deployed as strategies that shift conventional understandings of
   sovereign violence and its subjects on the margins of a state in
   transformation.},

Abstract = {The temporary suspension of diamond exports in Ghana in 2006 and 2007 is
   arguably the most significant move to address mounting criticisms of the
   Kimberley Process Certification Scheme (KPCS), an international
   initiative aimed at stemming the flow of rough diamonds used to finance
   wars. The ban, which took effect in November 2006, was much praised,
   particularly in civil society circles, where it continues to be seen as
   a genuine effort to prevent the smuggling of `conflict diamonds'. At the
   time, Ghana was accused of harbouring stones originating from rebel-held
   territories in neighbouring Cote d'Ivoire. No evidence was found in
   support of the case that it was a repository for `conflict diamonds',
   however, and exports resumed early in March 2007. This article examines
   the context for the accusations of Ghana's implication in the smuggling
   of illicit diamonds, and draws on recent fieldwork to explain how the
   suspension has affected Akwatia, the country's main diamondiferous area.
   The actions taken raise important questions about how suspected
   violators - particularly smaller diamond-producing nations - of the KPCS
   should be handled, and underscore how global compacts can have a host of
   negative repercussions at the village level.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {47},
Number = {4},
Pages = {363-375},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Large-n studies of conflict have produced a large number of
   statistically significant results but little accurate guidance in terms
   of anticipating the onset of conflict. The authors argue that too much
   attention has been paid to finding statistically significant
   relationships, while too little attention has been paid to finding
   variables that improve our ability to predict civil wars. The result can
   be a distorted view of what matters most to the onset of conflict.
   Although these models may not be intended to be predictive models,
   prescriptions based on these models are generally based on statistical
   significance, and the predictive attributes of the underlying models are
   generally ignored. These predictions should not be ignored, but rather
   need to be heuristically evaluated because they may shed light on the
   veracity of the models. In this study, the authors conduct a
   side-by-side comparison of the statistical significance and predictive
   power of the different variables used in two of the most influential
   models of civil war. The results provide a clear demonstration of how
   potentially misleading the traditional focus on statistical significance
   can be. Until out-of-sample heuristics - especially including
   predictions - are part of the normal evaluative tools in conflict
   research, we are unlikely to make sufficient theoretical progress beyond
   broad statements that point to GDP per capita and population as the
   major causal factors accounting for civil war onset.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {12},
Number = {2},
Pages = {193-217},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In the past 10-15 years, an increasing number of revisionist scholars
   have rejected the most significant elements of the argument about the
   centrality of the Peace of Westphalia (1648) to the evolution and
   structure of international society. At the same time, the prominence of
   this argument has grown in the English School and constructivist
   international relations scholarship. I deconstruct the function of the
   Westphalian narrative to explain its pervasiveness and persistence. I
   argue that it was first developed by nineteenth century imperial
   international jurists and that the Westphalian narrative perpetuates a
   Eurocentric bias in international relations theory. This bias maintains
   that Westphalia created an international society, consolidating a
   normative divergence between European international relations and the
   rest of the international system. This dualism is predicated on the
   assumption that with Westphalia European states had solved the anarchy
   problem either through cultural or contractual evolution. Non-European
   states, lacking this European culture and social contract, remained in
   anarchy until the European states allowed them to join the international
   society upon their achievement of the ``standards of civilization.{''}
   This Westphalian narrative distorts the emergence of the modern
   international system and leads to misdiagnoses of major problems of
   contemporary international relations. Furthermore, their commitment to
   the Westphalian narrative prevents international relations scholars from
   adequately theorizing about international interdependencies and
   accommodating global pluralism.},

   activists is their enthusiastic support for Putinism and a resounding
   rejection of the policies, symbols and political figures of the era of
   President Boris Yeltsin (1992-2000). The vast majority of youth
   activists are of college age (18-24), which means they were far too
   young to be aware of what was happening in the country in the 1990s, the
   period that while democratic and pro-Western, also represents a failure
   of the Russian state in their imagery. To what degree do the opinions
   and world views of politically active pro-Kremlin youth reflect the
   recently emerged, nearly ubiquitous interpretation of recent history as
   presented in the high school curriculum? To that end, we undertake a
   content analysis 0147 high school textbooks in Russian history, followed
   by open-ended interviews with 37 activists from the three most visible
   youth organizations, all of whom are pro-Kremlin in their orientation.
   Although demonstrating a causal relationship is methodologically
   unfeasible, we find a marked correlation between the views of both the
   Yeltsin and Putin eras presented in those textbooks and in the political
   beliefs of the youth groups. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd on

Abstract = {The Social Democratic/Green government which was in office in Germany
   from 1998 to 2005 announced that it would practise development policy as
   `global structural policy': as policy aiming to transform global
   economic structures in favour of poor countries. The article proceeds by
   analysing the attempts to do so in three areas: the reform of structural
   adjustment programmes and debt relief, the reform of the international
   financial architecture, and the `Development Round' in world trade
   negotiations. The article also analyses the accompanying discourse in
   order to identify the factors limiting this form of normative global
   governance. Journal of International Relations and Development (2010)

   able to increase the government's take of the country's hydrocarbon
   rents, its ability to use its natural gas and associated rents to alter
   the country's socioeconomic trajectory has been limited by the
   path-dependent effects of Bolivia's neoliberal turn and the

Abstract = {This article reviews the changes that have taken place in the federal
   public administration over the last three six-year terms and points out
   some of their limitations. First of all it includes a general reference
   to certain features which might be characteristic of the traditional
   model of public administration and which in many countries, including
   Mexico, continue in effect. It also points out new references for public
   actions, encompassed under the framework of New Public Management (NPM).
   These help shape the public administrations of countries where it has
   been adopted. Reference is also made to the tensions this transition
   causes, among other reasons because the two models coexist. The third
   section sets forth observations on what is happening in Mexico's case.},

Abstract = {The authors present and analyze a model of the frequency of severe
   terrorist attacks, which generalizes the recently proposed model of
   Johnson et al. This model, which is based on the notion of
   self-organized criticality and which describes how terrorist cells might
   aggregate and disintegrate over time, predicts that the distribution of
   attack severities should follow a power-law form with an exponent of
   alpha = 5/2. This prediction is in good agreement with current empirical
   estimates for terrorist attacks worldwide, which give (alpha) over cap =
   2.4 +/- 0.2 and which the authors show is independent of certain details
   of the model. The authors close by discussing the utility of this model
   for understanding terrorism and the behavior of terrorist organizations
   and mention several productive ways it could be extended mathematically
   or tested empirically.},

   The Slow Exclusion of Women Wearing Headscarves},
Journal = {POLITICS RELIGION \& IDEOLOGY},

Abstract = {Over recent decades, France has had to deal with the growing presence of
   immigrants from its ex-colonies - a phenomenon that has been affecting
   many former colonial powers and accentuated by globalisation. Starting
   in the late 1980s, this presence translated itself, among other things,
   through an increased visibility of Islam. For instance, numbers of
   second- and third-generation Muslim women, primarily of North African
   origin, have been expressing their religiosity by wearing a headscarf in
   the public sphere. Many members of the French state and society have
   perceived this as a threat to the secular settlement, as they understand
   the headscarf to be a sign indicating that the believer's first
   allegiance does not lie with the secular nation state, but with God and
   with a religious community (the ummah) that transcends national borders.
   This article argues that the headscarf controversy in France has been a
   way for the French secular state and elites to reinforce a certain
   exclusive understanding of laicite (secularism), as being more than a
   legal principle, which symbolises an ethic of collective life. This
   ethic succeeds in becoming stronger and more tangible because it is able
   to convey a sense of who can be included, and who has to be excluded
   from collective life. In this case women wearing headscarves have been
   identified as incapable of protecting and fostering Republican values
   while, in addition, also representing an external threat. They have
   therefore been slowly excluded from partaking in the activities of the
   polis, and deprived from enjoying their full citizenship rights' and
   duties. To conduct this investigation, the article takes the March 2004
   law banning visible religious symbols in public schools as a starting
   point, and analyses how from then onwards petitions, law proposals and
   governmental reports have recommended, in the name of laicite, excluding
   headscarf wearers from a variety of public spaces.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES},

Volume = {33},

Pages = {505-533},
Abstract = {In this article, the development of the Norwegian Armed Forces' Joint
   Doctrine of 2007 is analysed in order to illustrate some distinct
   characteristics of the development of small state doctrines. First,
   small states have limited freedom and limited institutional capacity to
   realise their own ideas about the use of their military forces.
   Furthermore, their contribution of forces to multilateral military
   operations signals political support for an institution (NATO) or a
   cause, but they are too small to make a real difference to the military
   operation. Hence, the operational experiences of these forces differ
   from those of larger countries. The stakes are lower, and they are
   unlikely to suffer military defeat in a decisive way. They may suffer
   losses, but they will not lose a war. As a consequence, small state
   doctrines at the strategic level have become detached from the question
   of operational effectiveness and are instead utilised for the purpose of
   promoting political, legal and ethical messages to the military, to a
   domestic audience, and to international allies.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the impact of red tape on governmental
   performance in the context of English local government. Both the red
   tape and performance constructs are multidimensional, so relationships
   between the concepts and their several dimensions are examined in
   detail. The results show that different types of red tape have varying
   impacts on governmental performance but that these effects are somewhat
   weaker than public management theory and conventional wisdom suggest.
   Moreover, some types of red tape affect some dimensions of performance
   in surprising ways. For example, internal red tape has limited effects
   on efficiency but inflicts considerable damage on equity. The results
   also show that red tape is a subject-dependent concept-known in the
   literature as stakeholder red tape. We contend that this alternative
   conceptualization of red tape opens new vistas for understanding the
   concept and should be explored further. The implications for public
   management research and practice are discussed.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {21},
Number = {2},
Pages = {124-146},
Abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to enrich the literature on negotiation by
   theorizing and empirically validating that power is an important
   moderator of the relationship between negotiator emotion and behavior.
   Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected from 322 students of
   an MBA program and executive education programs. The students
   participated in a two-stage, mixed-motive negotiation simulation during
   which they reported pre-negotiation emotion, as well as their
   negotiation behavior.
   Findings - The empirical analyzes showed that the relationship between
   negotiator emotion and behavior was stronger for high-power negotiators
   than for their low-power counterparts. Interestingly, high- and
   low-power negotiators' emotions were more predictive of their dominating
   and yielding behavior, respectively. Perhaps, because of their
   dependence, low-power negotiators were more sensitive and responsive to
   the emotions of their high-power counterparts than vice versa. The
   results also showed that low-power negotiators' gratitude substantially
   reduces their distributive outcome.
   Originality/value - The analysis revealed that the strength and the
   nature of the relationship between emotions and negotiator behavior
   depend on the power of the negotiator. The paper highlights the need for
   further theoretical specification with regard to boundary conditions for
   understanding the role of emotional states in the negotiation context.},

Abstract = {By the end of Putin's first term in office, Russia's regional
   authorities and representatives of large corporations had established
   effective non-institutional relationships. In response to these
   dynamics, the Kremlin launched a range of policy initiatives aimed at
   formalizing the political dialogue between the two sides and making
   their unofficial interactions less mutually beneficial. With the
   exception of changes that took place in the regional electoral systems,
   such policies have been predominantly borrowed from well-functioning
   Western models. However, it is clear that the political style and the
   context within which such ideas have been implemented have subverted the
   initial intentions and led to the emergence of alternative, and at times
   more sophisticated, forms of relational informality. The relationship
   between business and the Russian state continues to evolve, and depends
   on the intangible factors of culture and style as much as on
   institutional structures and rules.},

Abstract = {This article suggests that the study of transitional justice could
   benefit from the insights of memory studies, and proposes that
   transitional justice is a first step in ongoing `memory cycles', and
   that the politics of memory after state violence is qualitatively
   different from that which occurs in times of peace and normality. It
   illustrates some of the limitations of abstract normative approaches,
   and discusses how these and historically grounded and context-specific
   perspectives may be mobilised as two partial ways of looking at the same
   reality. It suggests Wilber's framework as a useful device to think in a
   multi-perspective and multi-disciplinary way about the topic.},

Abstract = {Conventional wisdom within neorealism has generally been that states
   will balance against the strongest state in the international system.
   This, however, has not been the case with the United States since the
   Cold War. This essay therefore constructs a model explaining why there
   will not necessarily be balancing in a unipolar system with abandoning
   any core realist assumptions. The conclusion reached is that balancing
   in a unipolar system can be compared to a prisoner's dilemma. Even
   though other states have a common interest in containing the unipolar
   state, no state will profit from making the first move. However, by
   applying a Schelling diagram it is shown that balancing is possible and
   stable after reaching a certain k-point. Thus, coordination problems can
   explain why states do not balance against the unipolar power.},

Abstract = {This article brings to the fore the role of experts as policy agents by
   analyzing the water management reform in three Brazilian states. Seeking
   to contribute to the recent ideational turn in political science, it
   contends that in studying the emergence and implementation of new policy
   ideas, more attention must be paid to the role of experts as policy
   innovators and to the interplay between experts' knowledge brokerage and
   the influence of party politics. To examine the interaction between
   knowledge brokerage and party politics, comparative case studies were
   conducted to trace back throughout their different phases the reform
   processes of the Brazilian states of Ceara, Parana, and Rio Grande do
   Sul. The purpose of this research design is to test the argument that
   experts are major reform agents and that what experts can effectively
   achieve depends on both the reform phase and the political context they
   find themselves in.},

Abstract = {State institutions mediate the challenges of globalization for the
   domestic political community: the concerns of specialists in comparative
   politics and in public administration are increasingly converging round
   an interest in the nature and functioning of state institutions. This
   paper draws on preliminary findings from a time-series database of
   national-level political institutions in Ireland to track continuity and
   change in state functions through analysis of state agencies. It also
   identifies four modes of state action: developmental, regulatory,
   adjudicatory, and moral advocacy, each of which has a traditional and a
   modern manifestation. While the first two modes are familiar in
   comparative context, the latter two are likely to merit further analysis
   cross-nationally.},

Pages = {139-162},
Abstract = {Around the time of Clausewitz's writing, a new element was introduced
   into partisan warfare: ideology. Previously, under the ancien regime,
   partisans were what today we would call special forces, light infantry
   or cavalry, almost always mercenaries, carrying out special operations,
   while the main action in war took place between regular armies.
   Clausewitz lectured his students on such `small wars'. In the American
   War of Independence and the resistance against Napoleon and his allies,
   operations carried out by such partisans merged with
   counter-revolutionary, nationalist insurgencies, but these Clausewitz
   analysed in a distinct category, `people's war'. Small wars, people's
   war, etc. should thus not be thought of as monopoly of either the
   political Right or the Left.},

   energy conflict in Australia and the United Kingdom},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1},
Pages = {21-44},
Abstract = {Wind energy has divided environmentalists. To understand why, disparate
   groups from Victoria, Australia and the United Kingdom are characterised
   as discourse coalitions, and their views and arguments are digested into
   compelling storylines. Drawing on the literature that explains
   environmental conflicts in terms of contrasting values, a discourse
   analysis approach is used to identify and define the hybrid and plural
   values held by the groups within wind energy discourse coalitions.
   Importantly for future policy development, influences and views that
   motivate groups to participate in policy and project assessment are
   identified, the current battles over facts between coalitions are
   analysed, and the present ignorance of or preference for certain views
   and types of values are shown as hindering the policy making process.},

   from the Perspective of Social Dominance Theory},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT AND VIOLENCE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {4},
Number = {2},
Pages = {205-219},
Abstract = {A full test of the Social Dominance Theory model addressed immigration
   as one of the most prominent current intergroup conflicts in Europe. The
   hypothesis that members of high status groups tend to discriminate
   members of low status groups because they are more prone to Social
   Dominance Orientation (SDO) and refer more to legitimising myths such as
   prejudice was tested using representative samples from eight European
   countries (N = 1000 each), considering income and migrant background as
   social status indicators, SDO, anti-immigrant prejudice and diversity
   beliefs, and the intention to discriminate immigrants. The results
   confirm that individuals with higher SDO are more likely to discriminate
   immigrants, partly because of stronger anti-immigrant prejudice and
   partly because they believe less in diversity. However, the results
   question the role of social status. Contrary to the expectations of
   Social Dominance Theory, individuals with lower income are more prone to
   SDO and have stronger anti-immigrant attitudes and weaker diversity
   beliefs. The impact of migrant background was weak and ambivalent. We
   suggest reconsidering the role of social status to stress status
   maintenance and enhancement as general social motives. Regardless of
   their social position, people seemingly try to enhance their relative
   position by devaluing lower status groups.},

Title = {Religious and Ethnonational Identification and Political Violence},
Journal = {ETHNOPOLITICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {71-83},
Abstract = {Religious and national identification are often elided when describing
   the Troubles in Northern Ireland: Catholicism with Irishness and
   Protestantism with Britishness. However, these categories do not
   coincide completely, and a third national identity label `Northern
   Irish' has recently been seen to emerge, with some respondents from both
   major religious groupings claiming this identity. A survey study of
   residents in Northern Ireland (n = 359) examined religious and national
   identification using a scale of collective self-esteem. This measure
   could be described as evaluating the relative strength or thickness of
   the identities across the various expected ( British Protestant;
   Catholic Irish), unexpected (Protestant Irish; Catholic British) and
   emerging ( Protestant and Catholic Northern Irish) national and
   religious combinations. Alongside these measures, respondents were
   sampled in wards that had historically high levels of political violence
   and in wards matched for socio-economic status and urbanization but with
   historically low levels of violence. The findings suggest that the
   relationship between national and religious identification in Northern
   Ireland is influenced by the sampling based on geographical experience
   of violence and that unexpected identity combinations and weaker
   patterns of identification are evident among participants in those areas
   with the least experience of violence.},

Title = {Geoengineering as global climate change policy},
Journal = {CRITICAL POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {4},
Number = {2},
Pages = {111-126},
Abstract = {The use of hydrocarbon-based energy systems is deeply embedded in the
   contemporary global capitalist world system. Billions of individuals
   always are already engaged in an on-going, essentially unplanned, and
   still uncontrolled (with regard to the negative impact of burning fossil
   on the global climate) collective experiment in the growing use of these
   sources of energy. The unanticipated, and yet still long observed,
   tendency for this energy system, to coincide with atmospheric global
   warming and other severe climate problems is becoming one of the most
   interesting developments of the early twenty-first century.
   In the absence of more effective, comprehensive, and bold efforts to
   prevent global climate change in a truly sustained manner, many
   communities around the world, ranging from the smallest localities, city
   governments, regional authorities, and even nation states are
   acknowledging that global climate change is a real problem. Yet, there
   is no consensus about how to mitigate and manage its effects. This study
   considers to what degree formal geoengineering is being treated as a
   workable approach to managing climate change. It explores an elaborate
   discourse trying to judge which high tech intervention might be more
   likely to succeed at averting, postponing, or merely managing the more
   destructive implications of climate change. Hence, the article advances
   a critique of such schemas as something like a `miracle cure' for global
   warming.},

Abstract = {Stability and change are key issues for policy analysts, but the
   literature on the relationship between the two is limited in both senses
   of the term. This article examines that literature, placing in it firmly
   against discussions about how to conceptualize time and arguing that the
   relationship between stability and change is best viewed as a duality,
   not a dualism. As such, the article strongly critiques the concept of
   punctuated evolution and defends a historical institutionalist position,
   against a constructivist institutionalist one.},

Abstract = {Knowledge about the ways in which suicide attacks are recruited and
   prepared and on the motivation of suicide bombers and the factors that
   influence the decisions of organizers of suicide attacks has so far been
   sketchy and sporadic, derived mostly from media sources. In this study,
   15 Palestinian would-be suicides and 14 organizers of suicide attacks
   participated in semi-structured interviews designed to fill this lacuna.
   The paper focuses on the self-reported feelings and behavior of the
   suicide bombers from recruitment to dispatching, as well as on the
   organizers' self-reported views and decisions concerning suicide
   attacks.},

Volume = {48},
Number = {2},
Pages = {227-256},
Abstract = {Flt. Lt. J.J. Rawlings and his fellow `revolutionaries' waged a
   sustained campaign against established Ghanaian entrepreneurs, insisting
   that they were corrupt. This narrative is misleading. The prime motive
   of these self-styled revolutionaries was to de-capitalise political
   opponents - a goal that they largely accomplished through control and
   manipulation of the state apparatus. During the 1990s, the same people
   who had launched a quasi-revolutionary campaign against Ghanaian
   capitalists became the most successful businesspeople in Ghana. This
   paper sheds light on a profound, yet ultimately transitory, revolution
   in Ghana that has largely escaped detailed scholarly examination.},

   post-democracy},
Journal = {CRITICAL POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {4},
Number = {4},
Pages = {319-343},
Abstract = {Two distinct visions of democratic politics, both of which are in sharp
   contrast to Schumpeter's competitive leadership model, are to be found
   at the heart of governance theory. The first advocates anti-democratic
   solutions, aiming to depoliticize public policy, while the second
   supports ultra-democratic reforms promoting the involvement of citizens
   in policy-making. The article pursues three main aims. First, it
   proposes a reading of the weaknesses attributed to Schumpeter's
   competitive leadership model. Second, it clarifies the nature of the
   innovations advocated by the anti-democratic camp in its attempt to
   build a regulatory state, and by the ultra-democratic camp in its
   struggle to engender a networked polity. Lastly, a critical evaluation
   of these solutions and their democratic visions is carried out. I argue
   that while anti-democratic solutions rest ultimately on disputed notions
   of social efficiency and contradictory appeals to pluralism,
   ultra-democratic solutions are either likely to undermine political
   equality, or incapable of supporting the claims associated with the
   ideal of a networked polity.},

Abstract = {This article argues that women's engagements with any religio-political
   movement, although often de-legitimised and silenced in hegemonic
   discourses and usually devoid of any reformist or feminist agenda,
   paradoxically, not only legitimise the movement and give it a mass base
   but also provide women with opportunities, `agency' and access to public
   spaces. Any discourse that inscribes `victimhood' on these women and
   that labels them as mere agents of patriarchy fails to capture the
   complicated nature of `agency' and `empowerment' and the gamut of
   politics and activism that women engage in, and is at best reductionist.
   I use examples of women's participation in three specific militant
   religio-political movements in India and Pakistan to illustrate my
   arguments. I conclude with a discussion on the importance of pushing the
   boundaries of feminist research to recognise and further unpack and
   complicate the ambivalent and often paradoxical nature of `agency' and
   `resistance' demonstrated by women actively participating in, and,
   enthusiastically reinstating a patriarchal agenda.},

Abstract = {This article revisits the debate, hosted by this journal in the 1990s,
   on whether the Provisional IRA campaign was sectarian. In the light of
   current debates about how Northern Ireland deals with its past, it
   challenges the analysis that emphasises the non-sectarian ideology of
   republicanism and ignores the effects of IRA violence. It uses research
   on the IRA campaign in Fermanagh and south Tyrone to argue that the
   campaign was unavoidably sectarian but rejects current attempts to label
   it a form of oethnic cleansing.o.},

Title = {Antelope, Poseidon or a Hybrid: The Upgrading of the British Strategic
   Nuclear Deterrent, 1970-1974},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {33},

Abstract = {It is the purpose of this article to illustrate how the British
   government reached its decision to upgrade the Polaris strategic nuclear
   deterrent in 1973. Using British and American documentation it is
   demonstrated that the strategic imperatives for upgrading Polaris were
   fundamental to the project. Existing accounts of the Polaris Improvement
   Project, however, have not given the appropriate attention to the wider
   US-UK political differences in this period. By doing so it is shown how
   in addition to the wider economic, strategic and political factors, this
   was of paramount significance in the Heath government opting for the
   `Super Antelope' method in upgrading Polaris.1.},

Journal = {POLICY STUDIES},

Volume = {31},
Number = {3},
Pages = {351-364},
Abstract = {The national minimum wage in the UK took effect from 1 April 1999. From
   the beginning it has treated workers under the age of 22 years as a
   separate group, now paying them a development rate, rather than the full
   adult rate. The Employment Equality (Age) Regulations 2006 contained an
   exception for the age-related pay levels. The issue discussed is whether
   the lower rates paid to 18-21-year-olds and 16-17-year-olds can be
   objectively justified in accord with the Framework Directive on Equal
   Treatment in Employment and Occupation. This objective justification
   requires a legitimate aim and a proportionate means of achieving this
   aim.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES},

Volume = {33},
Number = {5},
Pages = {759-775},
Abstract = {In the late 1950s, as intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs)
   replaced bombers, the development of Soviet ICBMs prompted fears of
   strategic vulnerability in the West. The Eisenhower administration's
   decision to deploy Intermediate Range Ballistic Missiles (IRBMs) on the
   territory of NATO allies sought to redress the perceived vulnerability
   until American ICBMs were ready. British deception planners considered
   how to enhance the threat posed by the IRBMs. An outline plan codenamed
   `Celestial' was intended to persuade the Soviets that the otherwise
   vulnerable missiles could not be readily neutralised. This article
   explores this deception and how such planning also sought to convey
   accurate information alongside disinformation. It also suggests that
   deception planners appear to have given little heed to the potentially
   counterproductive consequences of such an operation.},

Journal = {CRITICAL POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {3},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {290-308},
Abstract = {Social policy impact is partly determined by how policy is articulated
   and advocated, including which values are highlighted and how. In this
   paper, we examine the influence of policy framing and reframing on
   outcomes, with particular reference to the policies of the Delhi state
   government in India that target the practices of female feticide,
   infanticide and neglect that underlie the `daughter deficit'. Using Snow
   and Benford's categories for understanding reframing processes, the
   paper outlines and applies a `model' of reframing disputed issues
   derived from looking at two famous campaigns Gandhi's 1930 Salt March in
   the struggle for Indian freedom from British rule and the African-
   American civil rights struggle of the 1950s and 1960s. It argues that
   `carrot and stick' policy measures, such as financial incentives and
   legal prohibitions, to counteract the `daughter deficit' must be
   complemented by well crafted discursive interventions.},

Abstract = {Development Studies are well established in Norwegian universities and
   major institutes, particularly within the social sciences. Research on
   development, developing countries and regions is often fragmented, as
   are North South relations within the disciplinary departments of the
   universities; however, at most universities, separate, multidisciplinary
   centres of development (and the environment) have been established.
   Development research is also well established within a few relatively
   large multidisciplinary institutes outside the university system, but
   even this sector contains small and fragmented development research
   milieux. Funding opportunities have played an important part in both the
   growth and the direction of Norwegian development research. This article
   describes and discusses the emergence of development research in Norway
   up to the present. A key question is how the framework conditions -
   principally the financial arrangements - have influenced Norwegian
   research within this field of study: norms, approaches and the thematic
   orientation.},

   Responsible?},
Journal = {POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL},

Volume = {38},

Pages = {487-514},
Abstract = {This study examines the association between corporate social performance
   (CSP) practices and membership in Business for Social Responsibility
   (BSR) between 1992 and 2006. BSR is a business association that seeks to
   help its members adopt enhanced CSP practices. While there is an
   emerging literature examining voluntary initiatives as alternative
   policy mechanisms to regulations, most research is focused on
   initiatives that emphasize environmental protection. Further, studies
   suggest that membership in strictly voluntary initiatives tends to be
   associated with lower environmental performance because of
   ``free-riding{''} behavior by participants. BSR differs along two
   dimensions when compared with other voluntary initiatives examined in
   the literature. First, it is a comprehensive voluntary social initiative
   that helps firms from diverse industries address multiple CSP issues
   simultaneously. Second, it might limit opportunism by not offering
   blanket certification to its participants. Our results indicate that BSR
   members exhibit greater levels of positive social impacts without
   demonstrating significantly different levels of negative social impacts.
   This suggests that participation in voluntary initiatives that avoid
   granting blanket certifications may be associated with the adoption of
   new corporate social responsibility practices but not linked to the
   shedding of entrenched routines that produce negative externalities.},

Abstract = {U. S. military doctrine has recently elevated stability and support
   operations (SASO) to be a mission on par with the traditional combat
   missions, offense and defense. The new doctrinal approach to SASO
   represents a revolutionary change in the military's raison d'etre; now
   the armed forces' job is not only to win battles, but to create space
   for political negotiations and accords through the provision of
   controlled, nonviolent environments and other forms of military
   assistance to civilians. This article puts this change into context,
   looking at the American military's history of SASO and the longstanding
   debates about the military's priorities and roles.},

Title = {POLITICS BY HEURISTICS: POLICY NETWORKS WITH A FOCUS ON ACTOR RESOURCES,
   AS ILLUSTRATED BY THE CASE OF RENEWABLE ENERGY POLICY UNDER NEW LABOUR},
Journal = {PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {88},
Number = {3},
Pages = {764-781},
Abstract = {Policy network analysis is criticized for being a `heuristic' device,
   yet `heuristic' methods may be essential to achieve detailed
   understandings of specific policy outcomes. Rational choice modelling
   alone cannot perform a similar function. This paper develops a
   `heuristic' policy network approach that focuses on the analysis of
   actor resources. Changing contexts can alter the resource distributions
   of actors within a policy community. This can lead to new policy
   outcomes. Policy networks can therefore be rescued from criticisms made
   by, for example, Dowding, by re-visiting Rhodes's earlier emphasis on
   analysis of actor resources. This approach is illustrated in the case of
   UK renewable energy policy under the UK government of New Labour.
   Changing contexts have strengthened the resources of the main renewable
   energy interest groups to achieve higher targets and more
   technology-specific means of financial incentives. The Renewable Energy
   Association has achieved legislation favouring feed-in tariffs as is the
   practice elsewhere in Europe for small renewable generators.},

   change as a policy problem in Russian public discussion},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {19},
Number = {2},
Pages = {179-195},
Abstract = {The ways in which Russian public discussion translates climate change
   into a policy problem that identifies the phenomenon and defines a
   course of action are examined in order to shed light on the underlying
   structures of belief, perception and appreciation that shape Russian
   conduct toward global climate policy. The discussion distinguishes
   between three frames: the mission, national interest and duty. The
   mission frame defines climate policy as a means to improve Russia's
   international image, while the national interest frame focuses on
   economic and political costs. Only the duty frame defines climate change
   as a problem that Russia must help solve. Despite these differences, a
   central premise of all three frames is the centuries-old idea of Russia
   as a Great Power with a special mission in the world.},

Abstract = {Deterring Al Qaeda from using a nuclear weapon, should it acquire one,
   is a harder challenge than analysts have argued. Suggestions for

   not a state, has no clear command authority, and has no clear nuclear
   weapons-employment doctrine. Most analysts also ignore the dynamic of
   ocrisis instabilityo (ouse it or lose ito): should the West believe Al
   Qaeda has an improvised nuclear devise, it is unlikely (regardless of
   whether Al Qaeda leadership claimed the weapon would be held as a
   deterrent only) that the West would accept a
   mutually-assured-destruction relationship with the group. The West would
   hunt the weapon down, forcing Al Qaeda's hand. The best counter-Weapons
   of Mass Destruction-Nuclear Terrorism defense, therefore, is good
   counterinsurgency policy to starve it of recruits until the group dies.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT AND VIOLENCE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {4},
Number = {2},
Pages = {191-204},
Abstract = {This paper compares a psychological explanation of support for a ban on
   headscarves in the United Kingdom, France, Germany and the Netherlands.
   This study examines how perceptions of threat posed by Muslims and Islam
   and the overall attitude towards Muslims explain support for a ban on
   headscarves. In addition, cross-national comparisons are made to study
   how these relations are affected by contextual differences. Analyses are
   based on the 2005 survey on Islamic extremism by the Pew Research
   Center. Results show that the countries have a large influence on
   whether someone supports the ban on headscarves, indicating that
   contextual differences matter. In addition, having a negative attitude
   towards Muslims makes it more likely to support a ban on headscarves. In
   general, perceived threat contributes to stronger support, although
   there are slight differences in effect between the countries. Finally,
   perceived threat equally influences support for the ban on headscarves
   among prejudiced and non-prejudiced people.},

Title = {Falling Incapacity Benefit claims in a former industrial city: policy
   impacts or labour market improvement?},
Journal = {POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {31},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {163-185},
Abstract = {This article provides an in-depth study of Incapacity Benefit (IB)
   claims in a major city and of the factors behind their changing level.
   It relates to the regime prior to the introduction of the Employment and
   Support Allowance (ESA) in 2008. Glasgow has had one of the highest
   levels of IB in Britain with a peak of almost one fifth of the working
   age population on IB or Severe Disablement Allowance (SDA). However,
   over the past decade the number of IB claimants in Glasgow, as in other
   high claiming areas, has fallen at a faster rate than elsewhere, and
   Glasgow now has twice the national proportion of working-age people on
   IB/SDA rather than its peak of three times. The rise in IB in Glasgow
   can be attributed primarily to deindustrialisation; between 1971 and
   1991, over 100,000 manufacturing jobs were lost in the city. Policy
   response was belated. Lack of local statistics on IB led to a lengthy
   delay in official recognition of the scale of the issue, and targeted
   programmes to divert or return IB claimants to work did not begin on any
   scale until around 2004. Evidence presented in the article suggests that
   the reduction in claims, which has mainly occurred since about 2003, has
   been due more to a strengthening labour market than to national policy
   changes or local programmes. This gives strong support to the view that
   excess IB claims are a form of disguised unemployment. Further detailed
   evaluation of ongoing programmes is required to develop the evidence
   base for this complex area. However, the study casts some doubt on the
   need for the post-2006 round of IB reforms in high-claim areas, since
   rapid decline in the number of claimants was already occurring in these
   areas. The article also indicates the importance of close joint working
   between national and local agencies, and further development of local
   level statistics on IB claimants.},

Abstract = {Despite recent attention, the Korean War (1950-53) remains
   underappreciated and further explanation of its `forgottenness' is
   needed. Korea originally faded to gray because there was no satisfying
   victory. National security planners had ample reason to try and
   rehabilitate the war in the mind of the public, but had little success.
   This was because a primary accomplishment of the second half of the
   war-forcing the enemy to accept so-called voluntary repatriation of POWs
   (prisoners of war)-was semi-secret and never declared as a major war
   aim. Since the nation was never united around securing voluntary
   repatriation, there was little raw material for creating a memory of
   success.},

Title = {A Stronger Second Chamber? Assessing the Impact of House of Lords Reform
   in 1999 and the Lessons for Bicameralism},
Journal = {POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {58},
Number = {5},
Pages = {866-885},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The UK's second chamber is generally seen as a historical curiosity and,
   as Labour governments post-1997 have failed to introduce elected
   members, continues to be seen as `unreformed'. But a `first stage'
   reform of the House of Lords in 1999 removed most of its hereditary
   members, leaving it almost wholly made up of appointed life peers.
   Although many at the time claimed that this would neuter the upper
   house, since most of those evicted were Conservatives, it instead seems
   to have had the opposite effect. This article examines whether the 1999
   reform strengthened the House of Lords, how we can assess this and why
   it might have happened. The article concedes that measuring legislative
   influence is notoriously difficult. The analysis it constructs seeks to
   overcome this by using a range of indicators on two dimensions: the
   assertiveness of the House of Lords to use its powers, and the
   executive's responses to the chamber. This analysis indicates that the
   1999 changes strengthened the Lords against the government and, in doing
   so, strengthened parliament as a whole. The most obvious consequence is
   that our understanding of British politics now needs revision. But if
   the Lords was strengthened by reform this also demonstrates a need to
   revise established comparative politics theories of bicameralism -
   particularly that of Arend Lijphart, which would have predicted the
   reverse. The recent developments in Britain validate George Tsebelis'
   approach of recognising `partisan veto players' and the critical role of
   partisan balance in inter-cameral relations. But they also demonstrate
   that a more nuanced understanding of both legitimacy and legislative
   influence is needed in order to understand second chambers' (and indeed
   first chambers') de facto power.},

Journal = {POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2010},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This article examines the `policy networks' that existed between 1997
   and 2007 in UK asylum, economic migration and immigrant integration
   policy. The analysis shows that employers and businesses (together with
   other state and non-state actors) were part of a tightly organised,
   ideologically cohesive economic migration `policy community'. This
   policy community was crucial to the development of economic migration
   policy, in contrast to the development of asylum and integration
   policies. The central argument of this article is that the mainstream
   interpretation of UK immigration policy change (that change was driven
   by an elite-led, powerful executive) is correct in tracing the dynamics
   of asylum policy development between 1997 and 2007 under New Labour, but
   wrong for the development of immigration policy as a whole, which was
   more complex, and where businesses played a key role.},

Abstract = {This article presents an analysis of qualitative interviews carried out
   with citizen jurors at least three years after they participated in a
   jury. Theoretical work on deliberation tends to emphasise the
   transformative effect of deliberation. Much empirical work has focused
   on this transformation conceived as the re-prioritisation of
   preferences, and examines whether and how jurors change their personal
   and political commitments as a result of their participation on a jury.
   Another approach to transformation is more discursive, and hypothesises
   that the concepts and perspectives that jurors use to evaluate norms may
   also be transformed. This article presents qualitative data that
   illuminate this latter hypothesis. Specifically, the article analyses
   the stories ex-jurors told of their participation in citizen juries, in
   order to chart changes in the concepts and perspectives that jurors use
   to evaluate norms. By analysing these stories we identify four juror
   roles - envoy, regulator, advocate and deliberator - and we elaborate
   these using Habermas' learning theory. Overall our argument is that the
   citizen juror is given the opportunity to undertake a learning process,
   and through this process they are furnished with new concepts and
   perspectives with which to evaluate norms. Moreover, Habermas theorises
   that this learning process cumulates with the formation of a
   deliberative citizen who thinks using the characteristics described in
   discourse ethics. Here we identify discourses that support this claim.},

Abstract = {As important players in the policy process, many studies have
   investigated the determinants of bureaucratic behavior. One intriguing
   set of findings suggests that behavior is linked to bureaucrats' views
   of themselves as government officials and their views of the people who
   they serve. Despite the importance of workers' perceptions, we have
   little understanding about how bureaucrats develop psychologically. From
   a theoretical perspective, workers' views may be associated with
   extraorganization influences (like their personalities and
   preorganization experiences) or organization influences (like training,
   peers, and culture). However, few studies have examined how workers
   develop during organization socialization, so it is difficult to
   disentangle the impact of these various influences. This article
   improves our understanding of bureaucratic psychology by studying how
   police officers and welfare caseworkers develop their default
   rule-following identities: the typical rule-following selves that
   bureaucrats project during interactions with citizens. This article's
   findings show change and continuity during socialization: though many
   workers shifted their default rule-following identities, and some
   organization influences were associated with the identities that workers
   developed, they remained tethered to their entering rule-following
   expectations. The article concludes by discussing the theoretical
   implications of these findings for our understanding of bureaucrats as
   well as the practical implications for how public organizations recruit
   and manage their workforces.},

Abstract = {Despite a rich volume of scholarship on strategic culture and security,
   scant attention has been paid in such studies to explore the
   representations of strategic cultures and insecurities in international
   politics. To address this lacuna, I follow in this article a critical
   constructivist reading of strategic culture and insecurity, with an eye
   at examining some of its conceptual, theoretical and analytical
   premises, which, despite incorporating how various aspects of strategic
   cultures define security choices, have shared the realist notion of
   anarchy as given in international politics. In doing so, I offer a
   critical constructivist analysis highlighting the socially constructed
   nature of and the mutually constitutive relation between the
   representations of India's strategic culture, statist identity,
   insecurities and nuclear policies. Drawing from my case study, I
   conclude by offering some suggestions along a critical constructivist
   line to conceptually, theoretically and analytically broaden the
   existing understandings of strategic cultures and states' security
   practices. International Politics (2010) 47, 472-496.

Abstract = {Following the international deregulation act of 1994, the structure of
   the Norwegian aviation system has undergone several important changes.
   This paper describes the terms dictated by the political environment and
   the different administrations for implementing the changes. Our analysis
   addresses the inclusion of safety considerations in the specific
   decisions, and questions whether safety evaluations have had any impact
   on the change processes. The changes included the restructuring of
   airlines, new terms of competition, regulatory changes, the separation
   and relocation of the civil aviation authority, and privatization and
   efficiency reforms in the new infrastructure company. Safety in aviation
   and the risk of aviation accidents were not issues that featured
   prominently during the early change management processes. These aspects
   were first considered when the parties realized that changes were
   imminent and conflicts began to emerge. The different parties involved
   used the safety concept in various ways to legitimize or counteract
   changes. Our analysis concludes that risk is a complex concept that is
   difficult to communicate in a rational political decision process, but
   the emotive element in the risk concept opens for political speculations
   that facilitate discussion of ethical responsibilities.},

Abstract = {States typically issue compellent threats against considerably weaker
   adversaries, yet their threats often fail. Why? Expanding on a standard
   model of international crisis bargaining, I argue that a theory of
   reputation-building can help shed light on this puzzle. The model casts
   reputation as a strategic problem, showing that challengers issuing
   compellent threats have incentives to anticipate the reputation costs
   that target states incur when appeasing aggressors. If challengers can
   recognize these costs and offset them with side payments or smaller
   demands, then even reputation-conscious targets will acquiesce. I argue,
   however, that military strength contributes to information problems that
   make challengers more likely to underestimate their targets' reputation
   costs and insufficiently compensate them. In this way, military power
   can undermine the effectiveness of compellent threats. The logic is
   illustrated by the 1939 Russo-Finnish crisis, and the argument's
   implications for the study of coercive diplomacy are explored.},

Abstract = {This article is designed to explore the usefulness of an alternative
   conceptualization of the foreign assistance policy process. The common
   assumption is that US foreign aid outputs are rationally determined in
   response to external stimuli such as US security or economic interests
   or human need in a country. Yet, consistent with the logic of two-level
   games, foreign aid policy can become ensnared in domestic politics,
   especially those of a partisan distinction. In this article, I build an
   interactive model of foreign policy where external stimuli and domestic
   partisan differences are coupled to explain foreign assistance behavior
   toward Africa over the fiscal 1982-2003 period. I find that shifts in
   party control of the Presidency and the Congress lead to different
   valuations of the importance of external factors in making economic
   assistance policy. This interaction of domestic and foreign inputs
   serves to offer a fundamental reassessment of explanations concerning
   foreign assistance policy specifically, and foreign policy generally.},

Abstract = {Political and organizational theories suggest that the turnover of chief
   executives and other members of senior management teams are likely to be
   influenced by public service performance. We use a panel data set of 148
   English local governments over 4 years to test this proposition. The
   empirical results show that performance has a negative effect on
   turnover, but that this effect is weaker for chief executives than for
   members of their senior management teams. In addition, top team turnover
   is higher in the years following a chief executive succession. The
   evidence suggests that chief executives can influence top team turnover
   by attributing responsibility for poor organizational performance to
   other senior managers.},

Abstract = {This article examines the ways in which International Scientific
   Collaboration, as observed by the co-authorship of journal articles
   written by local scientists and partners located overseas, affects the
   ability of research teams to produce bibliographic outputs and to
   contribute to local knowledge. A sample of 672 teams was randomly
   selected for the analyses. In addition, 20 interviews with experts and
   team members were administered to discuss models and results. Results
   show that co-authoring with partners located overseas increases team
   output by nearly 40\% and by between three and five bibliographic
   products. It also shows that a team's odds of involving Colombia in its
   research process are 2.2 times larger for those co-authoring with a
   partner located overseas than for those that do not. Theoretical and
   policy implications are discussed.},

Abstract = {Scotland bears many hallmarks of a case of successful feminist
   constitutional activism: high levels of women's descriptive
   representation in the devolved parliament and a gender-inclusive
   institutional design mutually reinforced one another, opening up the
   political process. In this article domestic violence policy is examined
   in order to address the question as to whether political devolution has
   led to positive gender outcomes, in respect of substantive gains for
   women. The actors, institutions and outcomes of Scottish initiatives
   (1998-2007) are traced and it is argued that policies have been
   distinctive in the UK with respect to timing, framing and approach.
   Domestic violence, therefore, provides a striking case where devolution
   `has made a difference' to the substantive representation of women, with
   positive - albeit fragile - outcomes.},

Abstract = {This article analyses whether greater international trade, democracy and
   reduced military spending lower hostility between India and Pakistan.
   Conflict between the two nations can be best understood in a
   multivariate framework where variables such as economic performance,
   multilateral trade with the rest of the world, bilateral trade, military
   expenditure, democracy scores and population are simultaneously taken
   into account. The empirical investigation is based on time series
   econometrics from 1950-2005, allowing causality to be examined. The
   results suggest that reduced bilateral trade, greater military
   expenditure, less development expenditure, lower levels of democracy,
   lower growth rates and less general trade openness are all conflict
   enhancing, albeit with lags in some cases. Moreover, there is reverse
   causality between bilateral trade, militarization and conflict; low
   levels of bilateral trade and high militarization are conflict
   enhancing, but conflict also reduces bilateral trade and raises
   militarization. Economic growth is conflict mitigating, but the reverse
   is not true. Globalization, or greater openness to trade with the rest
   of the world, is the most significant driver of a liberal peace,
   corroborating a modified form of the capitalist peace, rather than a
   common democratic political orientation suggested by the pure form of
   the Kantian liberal peace.},

Abstract = {The Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) has been a global symbol of perpetual
   conflict, hatred and distrust since its establishment in 1953 after the
   Korean War. The 155-mile ceasefire line has given birth to moral
   pathologies in the minds of Korean people that include `otherness is
   evil', `containment of war is peace' and `restoration of the same is
   unification'. The purpose of this article is to reduce these moral
   pathologies through Jacques Derrida's deconstructive approach and
   Emmanuel Levinas's ethics of the Other. Through tripartite reduction of
   these moral ideologies of the DMZ, an ethical thesis is developed that
   peace is not a mere state of the absence of war, but rather a welcoming
   of radical others and differences. It is also argued that unification is
   not about restoring the same `original we', but about co-reconstruction
   of the `democratic we'.},

Abstract = {Much of the scholarship on democratization has a myopic focus on
   economic conditions. Using Afrobarometer and Latinobarometro survey
   data, the article examines how crime victimization and perceptions of
   crime influence citizens' attitudes toward democracy. After elaborating
   on several theoretical frameworks that help illuminate the relationship
   between crime and support for democracy, the article applies fixed
   effects and generalized hierarchical linear models to the cross-national
   survey data. The results show that a citizen's perception of public
   safety is as important a factor as any socio-economic variable in
   predicting support for and satisfaction with democracy. This finding is
   important because widespread support for democracy among the citizenry
   is considered a requisite for the consolidation of democracy.},

Abstract = {The debate on how globalization affects the welfare state has so far
   largely neglected to examine the microlevel causal mechanism underlying
   different macrolevel claims. Based on survey data from Switzerland, this
   article provides empirical microfoundations for the so-called
   compensation hypothesis. It finds that globalization losers are more
   likely to express feelings of economic insecurity. Such feelings, in
   turn, increase preferences for welfare state expansion, which in turn
   increase the likelihood of voting for the Social Democratic Party. The
   analysis also shows that globalization losers and winners differ
   significantly with regard to their social policy preferences and their
   propensity to vote for left parties. The article is innovative on two
   counts: First, it uses a number of different and more nuanced indicators
   measuring individuals' positions as beneficiaries or losers of
   increasing global competition. Second, rather than focusing on one
   particular part of the causal chain, it tests the entire
   individual-level causal mechanism implied by the compensation
   hypothesis.},

   five outcomes: crime, education, health, worklessness, and housing and

   areas continue to see positive change, but show only modest improvements
   against other benchmarks, notably similarly deprived comparator areas.
   Regeneration has been complex because of a range of `barrier sets' of
   which the most insistent has been the relationship between NDC
   Partnerships and central government. This relationship informs wider
   debates surrounding interpretations of the programme},

Abstract = {The article assesses NAFTA'S results sixteen years after its entry into
   force, for the three economies, particularly Mexico's. Although the
   agreement favored an exponential increase in trade and investment flows
   between the three countries, the study shows how it was insufficient to
   generate economic growth to benefit the majority of the people in
   Mexico. The study makes an analysis of Mexico's challenges and
   opportunities in its relations with the United States in the 21st
   century. The paper also broaches the urgency of formulating new policies
   to address the most pressing problems facing Mexico and the United
   States in the economic, social and security spheres.},

Abstract = {Understanding the relationship between organizational performance,
   gender, and management is crucial to scholars and practitioners alike.
   In this article, we focus on whether women manage differently than their
   male counterparts and whether these varied behaviors translate to
   organizational outcomes. With respect to management activities, we
   examine internal management as well as external networking patterns with
   peers and political principals. Through our investigation, we also
   address a number of theoretical issues related to previous research on
   management and performance, particularly the work on modeling public
   management. This analysis offers avenues for expansion, explanation, and
   evaluation of its theoretical and empirical implications. We find
   evidence that female managers spend less time on internal management and
   networking relationships than their male counterparts. We also see that
   networking with citizens and clientele groups has a positive effect on
   organization outcomes for men, whereas networking with peers is more
   beneficial for women.},

Abstract = {International mediation is not conducted solely by official actors such
   as states or international organizations. Non-official parties such as
   individuals and non-governmental organizations increasingly intervene as
   third-party mediators in conflicts. Both official and unofficial
   interventions are conceptualized as tracks of diplomacy (ToDs). Even
   though there is a vast quantitative literature on international
   mediation, most studies focusing on ToDs have been qualitative and
   produced few generalizable insights. This article extends the existing
   literature on third-party intervention by developing a theoretical model
   to explain the effectiveness of different ToDs, which is then
   empirically tested in a first large-N study. The findings indicate that
   the leverage and resources of ToDs determine outcome effectiveness.
   Track One Diplomacy, that is, efforts by official actors, tends to be
   the most effective form of intervention as greater leverage and more
   resources invested can make track intervention more effective. It is
   also found that combined mediation efforts of both official and
   unofficial tracks can be more effective than independent track actions.
   Since conflicts with mediation are unlikely to be a randomly selected
   set, a selection estimator is used to test the hypotheses on
   effectiveness. The empirical findings support the theory and demonstrate
   that the specific type of mediating actor seems highly important.},

Abstract = {This study focuses on the relationship between national identity and
   intractable conflict. Abdelal's definition of collective identity that
   refers to the level of agreement regarding the purposes, practices,
   relational comparisons with other entities, and narratives that define
   collective identity was adapted to national identity during intractable
   conflict and was later applied to Israel's national identity. A review
   of the Israeli 1969-2006 election platforms shows that in the 1980s and
   1990s significant changes occurred in Israel's national identity. The
   most significant changes included: changes regarding the territorial
   purpose of Israeli identity; changes in practices on who may become an
   Israeli citizen; changes of perception of the relationship between
   Israel and the Arabs; and a growing Israeli acceptance of Palestinian
   identity. Since 2000, following the failure of the Israeli-Palestinian
   peace process, some components of Israeli national identity have
   reverted to their original form. The study indicates that the
   Arab-Israeli conflict triggered changes in Israel's national identity,
   but the conflict also seemed affected by changes in that identity. The
   article connects the changes in Israeli national identity to specific
   mechanisms and conditions of conflict resolution and reconciliation.},

Journal = {POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {31},
Number = {1},
Pages = {59-84},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Much attention has been paid to the effects of political efficacy and
   trust on political participation. Most studies tend to use efficacy or
   trust as an independent variable to explain political actions such as
   voting, campaign involvement, and the like. Despite their importance in
   explanations of political behavior, relatively little is known regarding
   mechanisms through which social involvement may influence trust and
   efficacy. If efficacy and trust are of value, then it is important that
   we determine how their development can be fostered, and especially
   whether their development can be promoted through social
   interaction-such as a sense of community. Borrowing from the field of
   community psychology, I employ the Sense of Community Index to provide a
   more nuanced measure of community based on individual perceptions of
   their community that previous studies were unable to capture. Analyzing
   original survey data, this paper examines to what extent, if any, a
   sense of community matters for trust and efficacy. The results
   demonstrate that social forces, such as community, exert positive and
   significant effects on internal and external efficacy and personal and
   political trust, independently of individual traits such as income, age,
   gender, and education.},

Title = {Angry White Men: Individual and Contextual Predictors of Support for the
   British National Party},
Journal = {POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {58},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-25},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The British National party (BNP) is the most successful extreme right
   party in Britain's electoral history and is the fastest growing
   political party in twenty-first century Britain. This article presents
   the first ever individual-level analysis of BNP supporters, utilising a
   survey data set uniquely compiled for this purpose. We find that support
   for the BNP is concentrated among older, less educated working-class men
   living in the declining industrial towns of the North and Midlands
   regions. This pattern of support is quite distinct from that which
   underpinned the last electorally relevant extreme right party in Britain
   - the National Front (NF) - whose base was young working-class men in
   Greater London and the West Midlands. Extreme right voters in
   contemporary Britain express exceptionally high levels of anxiety about
   immigration and disaffection with the mainstream political parties.
   Multi-level analysis of BNP support shows that the party prospers in
   areas with low education levels and large Muslim minority populations of
   Pakistani or African origin. The BNP has succeeded in mobilising a
   clearly defined support base: middle-aged working-class white men
   anxious about immigration, threatened by local Muslim communities and
   hostile to the existing political establishment. We conclude by noting
   that all the factors underpinning the BNP's emergence - high immigration
   levels, rising perceptions of identity conflict and the declining
   strength of the cultural and institutional ties binding voters to the
   main parties - are likely to persist in the coming years. The BNP
   therefore looks likely to consolidate itself as a persistent feature of
   the British political landscape.},

Title = {Policies with Rights Approach and its Incidence in the Public
   Institutions},
Journal = {REVISTA DEL CLAD REFORMA Y DEMOCRACIA},
Year = {2010},
Number = {46},
Pages = {41+},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The focus on which this paper is centered is the kind of public
   institution that needs to be built in order to implement policies with
   rights approach. It tries to provide a conceptual framework in order to
   design institutions that are consistent with the guarantee of rights
   and, therefore, to endow feasibility to its real exercise.
   The institutional reforms that have occurred in recent years in most
   Latin American public sectors on behalf of client power, have sought to
   alter relations of accountability in the public sector by adopting a
   target value to cost-efficiency and prescribing emulation type of
   accountability relationships and logic that operate in the market.
   The literature agrees that the principles, on which public policies with
   rights approach are based, in addition to universality, include
   liability, social participation, inclusiveness and progressiveness.
   These principles create, at least nominally, a new field of social
   power.
   Such exercise of this new field of citizen power is directly dependent
   on the type of institutions that is designed to implement this new
   policy, as well as by the values and practices of the actors who are
   part of this institutional framework. The values and institutions are
   not independent of each other.
   Therefore, each of these principles must have its counterpart in an
   organizational attribute and the corresponding institutional incentives
   to lead to new public institutions that can cope with the implementation
   of public policy with emphasis on rights.
   Systemic governance, accountability and a vigorous public space are the
   attributes that, respectively, can give consistency to the principles of
   comprehensiveness, the enforcement and social participation, in pursuit
   of increased citizen power and the construction of a so called social
   citizenship. The article is devoted to show how these attributes could
   be deployed to give substance to new public institutions.},

Abstract = {Various studies suggest that while institutionalised and electoral forms
   of political participation are in decline in Western societies,
   non-institutionalised forms of participation (like demonstrating,
   political consumerism or signing petitions) are on the rise. However,
   this expansion of the political action repertoire of citizens also
   entails the question of equal participation opportunities. It can be
   argued that contemporary ideals of democratic participation assume an
   equal representation of citizens' interests. In this article we analyse
   the equality of participation patterns using comparative data from the
   2004 ISSP survey. Our results suggest that non-institutionalised forms
   of participation increase patterns of inequality due to education but
   strongly reduce or even reverse gender and age inequalities. As such,
   both institutionalised and non-institutionalised forms of participation
   have specific (dis)advantages from the perspective of preserving equal
   access to democratic decision-making procedures.},

Abstract = {The authors examine the effect of educational attainment and income on
   support for suicide bombing among Muslim publics in six predominantly
   Muslim countries that have experienced suicide bombings: Indonesia,
   Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Pakistan, and Turkey. The authors make two
   contributions. First, they present a conceptual model, which has been
   lacking in the literature. Second, they consider attitudes toward two
   different targets of suicide bombings: civilians within the respondent's
   country and Western military and political personnel in Iraq. The
   authors find that the effect of educational attainment and income on
   support for suicide bombings varies across countries and targets.The
   findings therefore draw attention to the difficulties of making
   generalizations about Muslim countries and the importance of
   distinguishing between targets of suicide bombings.},

Abstract = {The role of women in the Zionist heroic narrative has long been an issue
   of debate between those viewing them as equal partners in an emerging
   socialist state v.s others who equate them primarily with the task of
   national reproduction on the biological and cultural levels. This
   article claims that the ultimate template of a Zionist heroine must only
   include elements which are suitable for mythologizing and consequently
   for national reproductions. As women are conduits for national
   reproduction, the female heroic images that construct the basis for
   their national identity must be nationally and morally above all
   reproach. In order to investigate this claim the article analyzes the
   stories of four Zionist heroines, one sectoral, another local, a third
   grassroots and a fourth national, all of whom became part of the Zionist
   pantheon during different periods. By analyzing how their gendered
   images were presented to the public through the agents of national
   memory, and the amount of re-writing that their personal histories
   necessitated, I will expand upon the gendered components of their heroic
   myths as presented in these frameworks, and the various implications of

Abstract = {In 2007 the Spanish Congress discussed and approved its controversial
   Law of Historical Memory. Promoted by a Socialist government, the law
   implies an important change in the way in which Spain confronts its past
   of civil war and dictatorship. During the transition to Spanish
   democracy, the war became a threatening, divisive past that had to be
   silenced and averted before understanding or commemorating it. The
   return of the subject of the Civil War to Spanish public debate has an
   undoubted political component. In view of the fact that there is no
   consensus among the Spanish political elite regarding the significance
   of the events, its interpretations are used to link political positions,
   as well as screens where current differences and conflicts can be
   expressed.},

Abstract = {In an era where female suicide terrorism is on the rise in conflict
   regions such as the Middle East, the North Caucasus, and South Asia, why
   has Afghanistan been largely immune to this trend? Why do some violent
   groups use female suicide terrorism and others avoid it? This is a
   critical question for policy makers and analysts attempting to
   understand a dangerous terrorist phenomenon and how it may evolve in
   Afghanistan. During the anti-Soviet jihad, narratives were woven of men
   and women marching through the mountains of Nuristan to ooffer their
   blood for the Islamic revolution like red tulips at springtime.o But
   today, women are wholly absent from the Taliban and their jihad in
   Afghanistan. This article analyzes, in particular, the absence of women
   in Taliban martyrdom operations. There are three primary findings from
   this study that explain the low propensity for female suicide bombers in
   Afghanistan. First, a permissive social and geographic environment in
   Afghanistan gives insurgents freedom of mobility and a resistance
   capacity characterized by a reduced necessity for female suicide
   bombers; second, the capacity of a fiercely conservative culture
   restricts female participation in both Afghan society and within
   insurgent organizations; and third, the pronounced absence of a female
   culture of martyrdom limits women from participation in insurgent
   actions and narratives.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the advocacy coalition framework is to explain policy
   change over time through an examination of the stability of advocacy
   coalitions within policy subsystems. Recently, scholars have confirmed
   that advocacy coalitions are held together by shared belief systems,
   specifically in distributive policy arenas. We contend that federal
   agencies, in distributive policy arenas, provide both the anchors and
   support systems for the development and maintenance of belief systems.
   This anchoring helps provide adequate resources, access to political
   institutions, ability to control administrative process, and/or the
   capacity to deliver public goods and services. We conducted an analysis
   of the policy changes that occurred during the implementation of the
   National Environmental Policy Act for the construction of the Bureau of
   Reclamation's Animas-La Plata project. This is an example where
   administrators, through the management of information, were able to
   control the policy process. The analysis provides a needed replication
   of previous findings regarding policy change and offers new insights
   into how institutions are critical to subsystem stability over time.},

Abstract = {The article focuses on the effects of Eastern enlargement on EU trade
   policy-making. On interest constellation, the article makes a case that
   protectionist forces have been strengthened relative to liberal forces.
   This slight protectionist turn is mostly witnessed in the area of
   anti-dumping and with respect to the Doha trade round. On preference
   aggregation, guided by a principal-agent framework, it is argued that
   the growth in the number of actors (principals and interest groups) has
   not constrained the role of the European Commission (agent). However, it
   has led to an increase in informal processes and has empowered large
   trading nations vis-a-vis smaller and less `comitology-experienced'
   member states.},

Title = {Political Religion and Politicized Women in Turkey: Hegemonic
   Republicanism Revisited},
Journal = {POLITICS RELIGION \& IDEOLOGY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {311-326},
Abstract = {Since its establishment in 1923, the Republic of Turkey has assumed a
   sacred character, owing primarily to the influence of republicanism, the
   country's dominant political religion. Processes of modernization,
   inherent in republicanism, became the main instigators for the
   improvement of women's rights in Turkey from the 1920s and 1930s
   onwards. However, thanks to the subsequent Europeanization process in
   Turkey, coinciding with the new millennium, modernization has acquired
   new meanings. The new interpretations of modernization, do not
   necessarily support the dominant political religion in Turkey. Gender
   policy is a crucial area to gauge how modernization and republicanism
   clash and/or converge with each other. This article comprehensively
   examines how, very recently, the demands of gender rights activists have
   accentuated differences between republicanism and modernization. We
   argue that the schism among womens' groups in the public sphere
   regarding rights has been important for triggering debate and
   questioning the ongoing salience of republicanism. The article
   contributes to literature on political religions by suggesting that the
   sacralization of the republic, driven by Turkish nation-building
   processes in our case, may be hampered by the process of modernization
   once this process becomes autonomous from sacralization and generates
   its own momentum.},

Abstract = {Networks are becoming a popular organizational form for structuring
   human activities. To date, scholars have addressed networks in a variety
   of fields, including sociology, economics, public administration,
   criminology, political science, and international security. However,
   little has been done so far to systematically examine the similarities,
   differences, and connections between network forms of organization
   across different academic disciplines. This has important implications
   for both theory and practice. The lack of attention paid to
   organizational similarities and differences prevents the exchange of
   knowledge developed across fields. In turn, policy-makers cannot take
   full advantage of existing research, and may miss opportunities to
   improve the work of some networks and combat that of others. To address
   this gap in the literature, this paper uses the combination of
   organizational environments and organizational goals to develop a new
   typology of inter-group networks, and thus improve our understanding of
   how human behaviour is coordinated through networks.},

Abstract = {Plagued by systematic state failure, sub-Saharan Africa's failed states
   have helped facilitate internationally sponsored terrorist networks and
   operations. However, until recently, this type of activity was primarily
   relegated to North Africa and the Horn. But that has begun to change.
   Now, what was once a seemingly benign terrorist presence in sub-Saharan
   Africa is starting to transform into a movement, with states such as
   Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo
   (DRC) now lending arms, financial support, and radical militants to the
   extremist jihadist movement of internationally sponsored terrorist
   organizations such as Al Qaeda. Further, with the recent bombings in
   Kenya and Somalia, and the failed bombing attempt on a U.S. airliner by
   a Nigerian national, it is becoming increasingly evident that
   internationally sponsored terrorist networks have found a permanent home
   in sub-Saharan Africa and within the hearts and minds of its people,
   which poses significant challenges for the international community,
   given the region's patchwork of failed states, where terrorists can
   easily hide and thrive. Consequently, this study discusses how the
   conditions of state failure have fostered support for internationally
   sponsored terrorism in sub-Saharan Africa. Terrorist groups are now
   actively recruiting more militants from within the region and popular
   support for extremist acts is on the rise in sub-Saharan Africa. Thus,
   the article argues sub-Saharan Africa will soon become the site for the
   next generation of terrorists, and the next wave of terrorist activity.},

Abstract = {Progress in market integration over the past two decades has come at the
   expense of growing flexibility in the laws that govern the single market
   (SM) as well as the way that these laws are implemented. This
   differentiated integration comes in four forms: soft; informal;
   multi-speed; and opt-out differentiation. We examine how the completion
   of the SM has been held back in the varied implementation of EU
   competition policy and variation in national corporate law, energy
   markets, services and taxation. These sectors and issue areas form the
   frontier in which the main political struggles over the future shape of
   the SM take place, and in which differentiation is most clearly
   manifested. The SM notion supposedly entails a concrete set of
   substantive policy commitments that form the basis of the `ever closer
   union'. However, increasing differentiation undermines the
   identification of the EU's core constitutional commitments.},

Abstract = {This article compares local government reforms in three European
   countries: France, the United Kingdom (England), and Germany. In the
   analysis, the author distinguishes between two different types of
   reform. Firstly, the vertical dimension of the reform refers to the
   decentralisation of public tasks from the state/central government to
   local authorities. Secondly, in an illustration of the horizontal
   dimension, the readjustment of competencies between local authorities
   and market or non-profit actors is investigated by focusing on the
   development of privatisation, corporatisation, and contracting out. The
   paper pursues the following questions: What effects did the
   decentralisation and privatisation processes cause in the three
   countries, and did they contribute to performance improvements at the
   local level? The author reveals that the anticipated positive outcomes
   of the reforms have proven to be only partially accurate, and that in

Title = {Transaction-cost efficiency and the democratic deficit},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {17},
Number = {2},
Pages = {150-175},
Abstract = {The extensive literature on the European Union's (EU) democratic deficit
   suffers from two serious limitations. First, it proposes to solve the
   problem by analogy with national practices instead of looking for its
   roots, and possible solutions, in the integration process itself.
   Second, this literature considers only the normative aspects of a
   condition that also has significant efficiency implications. Analogical
   reasoning has led to a continuous expansion of the powers of the
   European Parliament (EP) without any notable increase in democratic
   legitimacy. The origin of the democratic deficit is, quite simply, the
   failure to convert a majority of voters to the cause of political
   integration. This failure forced integrationist elites to sacrifice
   democracy on the altar of deeper integration in the hope of `making
   Europe without Europeans'. The strategy of pursuing political
   integration under the guise of economic integration backfired when it
   became evident that the EU kept falling behind its major international
   competitors in spite of ambitious projects like the Single European
   Market and Economic Monetary Union (EMU). One reason for this
   unsatisfactory performance is that in sacrificing democracy for the sake
   of deeper integration, EU leaders also sacrificed many formal and
   informal methods developed by democratic regimes in order to reduce
   various political transaction costs. Thus delegation of monetary policy
   to an independent central bank is a well-known method for solving the
   time inconsistency problem. In case of serious external shocks, however,
   a balance must be struck between commitment to monetary stability and
   flexibility. This is possible in a democracy, where elected
   policy-makers are able to provide the necessary political counterweight
   to the central bank's technocrats; this is impossible in the EU, where
   the European Central Bank (ECB) operates in a political vacuum. In turn,
   exclusive commitment to monetary stability further undermines the
   legitimacy of the Union. At present it seems that the only feasible way
   of reducing the democratic deficit is to reduce the mismatch between the
   extensive commitments of the EU and its limited normative and
   institutional resources.},

   point of strong agreement, an assessment of the key issue of dealing
   with the probability of a terrorist act, and corrections of some of
   their mischaracterizations of my argument.},

Abstract = {By mid-2003, the legal orders (the entire bodies of legislation in
   force) of three EU member states - Austria, Denmark, and The Netherlands
   - contained between 10.5 and 14.2 per cent of rules devoted to the
   transposition of EU directives. Only a few ministerial jurisdictions
   contain more than 20 per cent of Europeanized rules. The member states
   show remarkable differences in the use of parliamentary versus delegated
   legislation as a means of transposition. The comparison of the three
   cases tentatively suggests that different legal traditions and the
   parliamentary involvement in EU affairs are important factors that
   account for cross-national differences.},

Journal = {CAMBRIDGE REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS},

Volume = {23},

Pages = {299-323},
Abstract = {Historically, empires recruited scholars to capture artworks as a
   complement to military victory. Over the past century, cultural scholars
   have integrated fine art and antiquities into campaigns of conquest and
   assessed the political ramifications of damage to historic sites and
   religious monuments in military intervention. Consequently, historians,
   archaeologists and legal scholars have advanced the role of cultural
   patrimony in international conflict from a rite of conquest to a means
   of combat. In World War II, art historians in the Nazi regime planned
   plunder of artworks and destruction of historic structures as a tactic
   for conquest. During the Cold War, archaeological discoveries in
   developing nations enabled looting of cultural artifacts, and subsequent
   legal studies on the transfer of cultural property developed the value
   of cultural patrimony in the covert battle for control of the Third
   World. Since the Cold War, as transnational organized crime and
   terrorism exploit antiquities trafficking and target cultural sites in
   acts of political violence, scholars in international relations have
   considered culture in security theories. Across the three periods of
   international conflict, cultural scholars have actively developed the
   tactical value of cultural patrimony and played a role in transforming
   the perception of plunder in the context of military victory.},

Journal = {SOUTH EUROPEAN SOCIETY AND POLITICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {15},
Number = {2},
Pages = {289-307},
Abstract = {In recent years, waste collection and disposal have met unprecedented
   challenges in southern Italy. Illegal dumping is widespread, and waste
   trafficking is a key activity of organised crime. At the same time,
   landfills approach capacity. Yet, the transition to industrial treatment
   and recycling is slow. This paper examines the political reasons for a
   delay that deeply impacts on citizens' welfare, with a focus on the
   regions of Campania and Sicily. After tracing the process of elite
   decision-making, it argues that while the two regions face different
   institutional features the crisis is explained in both cases by
   institutional proliferation, clientelism and fragile executives
   favouring political expedience over technical expertise.},

Abstract = {Building on a previously proposed methodology for an index of economic
   and social rights fulfillment, this article presents country scores and
   rankings based on the Economic and Social Rights Fulfillment Index (ESRF
   Index). Unlike socioeconomic indicators, which are often used as proxies
   for the extent to which rights-holders enjoy economic and social rights,
   the ESRF Index incorporates the perspective of the duty-bearer as well
   as the rights-holder and takes into account the principle of progressive
   realization. The resulting scores and rankings provide important new
   information that complements other measures of economic and social
   rights fulfillment. The ESRF Index is an important conceptual and
   methodological breakthrough; although it still does not capture all key
   human rights principles, such as the rights to participation,
   nondiscrimination, and equality. The article also analyzes the results
   of the global ranking and outlines some priorities for further research.},

Title = {Evaluating Comanagement for Social-Ecological Fit: Indigenous Priorities
   and Agency Mandates for Pacific Walrus},
Journal = {POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {38},
Number = {2},
Pages = {257-279},
Abstract = {Governance arrangements such as comanagement are regarded by many as
   promising arenas for effective natural resource management. However,
   measuring comanagement's success at achieving conservation goals has
   been equivocal. Our research evaluates the lack of conclusive outcomes
   through a critical consideration of how different goals and values
   inherent in comanagement affect the institutional (or policy) diagnostic
   of ``fit.{''} More narrowly, sustaining natural resources requires that
   management policies foster fit between the scales of sociopolitical
   processes governing resource use and the scales of ecological processes
   regulating a resource. Without a process that encourages such
   harmonization, theoretical and empirical evidence suggests that
   comanagement regimes are unlikely to accomplish long-term conservation
   goals. We use a case study of walrus comanagement under the U.S. Marine
   Mammal Protection Act to demonstrate that when the formal institutions
   preconditioning comanagement do not develop out of a deliberative
   process among comanagement partners, two major problems can arise: (i)
   Policy institutions mismatch ecological and social processes relevant to
   resources and communities; and (ii) data to assess the fit of
   institutions and support learning is more difficult to acquire. In our
   case study, both these factors constrain the ability of comanagement to
   foster walrus conservation or support the capacity of Native Alaskans to
   adapt to contemporary social and environmental conditions. Our research
   concludes that to achieve marine mammal conservation, previous
   institutional arrangements framing comanagement that are predicated on
   static conceptions of people and ecosystems must be redesigned to
   provide better policy fit across local to international priorities. To
   do so requires opening up deliberative spaces, where Western science and
   priorities are confronted with indigenous perspectives. However, the
   benefit of enhancing deliberation carries risks and costs related to
   trade-offs between the values of democratic process, and protections for
   both wildlife species and indigenous groups.},

Abstract = {Some scholars argue that terrorism has few adverse consequences for
   political and civil liberties in democracies and that fears about a
   reversal of freedoms due to counterterror programs are unjustified.
   However, anecdotal evidence suggests that democracies respond to
   terrorism in ways that curtail at least some of the rights that define
   democratic governance. In an analysis of a large sample of the world's
   nations, this study finds that terrorism has deleterious effects on
   regimes' respect for civil and human rights but few consequences for
   overall political access. I conclude that terrorism has measurable
   negative influences on particular aspects of democracy.},

Abstract = {Political representation in Western democracies is largely accomplished
   through and by parties. Surprisingly, however, few studies directly
   examine how well parties in post-communist democracies function as
   effective agents of representation. Furthermore, the few exceptions to
   this rule focus on one time point only even though the concept of
   representation contains a dynamic component: parties need to offer
   consistent choices in order to communicate with voters in ways that
   provide clear alternatives to voters, and that establish incentives for
   parties to follow through on election promises. We therefore examine
   party stances towards European integration between 2003 and 2007.
   Contrary to the predominantly negative assessments in the research
   literature, we find that parties' policy stances establish several
   preconditions for political representation in new democracies in Central
   East Europe (CEE).},

Title = {The Evolution of Israeli Targeted Operations: Consequences of the Thabet
   Thabet Operation},
Journal = {STUDIES IN CONFLICT \& TERRORISM},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {33},
Number = {2},
Pages = {111-133},
Abstract = {This article examines, from an Israeli counterterrorism and legal
   perspective, the evolution of Israeli otargeted killingso (TK) as
   distinct from past oassassinationo and oliquidationo operations. The
   article traces the evolution using distinct phases. In phase one, the
   article briefly traces the history of targeted operations, beginning
   with the Yishuv in the 1920s, working forward to the outbreak of the
   al-Aqsa armed conflict in 2000. The study then shifts to phase two, the
   most critical aspect of the story of TKsthe radical changes that
   occurred as a result of the consequences of the Thabet Thabet Operation
   in December 2000, showing precisely how, when, and why Israeli furtive
   oassassinationso morphed into overt TKs. The third phase describes the
   radical changes and reactions of the Thabet Thabet Operation; of how it
   marked the end of the quasi-institutionalization of oassassinationso and
   oliquidationso and began the path to the legalization of a progressively
   expanded counterterrorism tactic. The study then shifts to the fourth
   phase, which describes how the creation of an Israeli Defense Forces
   (IDF) olegal opiniono eventually led to the Israeli High Court of
   Justice's (HCJ) 2006 verdict on TK. It also covers how the Israeli
   decision-making process on TK evolved. Finally, phase five analyzes the
   aftereffects of the HCJ's decision on TK, which is ultimately a
   consequence of the December 2000 Thabet Thabet operation. Lacking a
   contemporary historical understanding of this operation and its
   consequences, the tactic cannot be wholly understood. The purpose of
   this article is to offer an understanding of how TKs differ from past
   targeted operations and why they evolved, terminologically, legally, and
   operationally, specifically as a result of the Thabet Thabet Operation.},

Title = {Of `witch's brews' and scholarly communities: the dangers and promise of
   academic parrhesia},
Journal = {CAMBRIDGE REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Pages = {49-68},
Abstract = {In a series of lectures in the early 1980s, Michel Foucault resurrected
   the Greek word for frankness or truth-telling-'parrhesia'-to investigate
   the inter-relationships and tensions that existed between freedom,
   truth-telling and political power. He concluded that in order for one to
   `tell the truth' against a powerful superior, one needs the courage to
   oppose a community of which the parrhesiastes ('truth teller') is a
   member. This paper uses parrhesia to investigate the practice of the
   international relations (IR) scholar in speaking out against his or her
   scholarly community. Tony Smith's 2007 book Pact with the devil is used
   as an example of academic-intellectual parrhesia not only to illustrate
   the content of a potential form of parrhesia, but to demonstrate the
   challenges IR scholars who wish to practise academic parrhesia face in
   criticizing members of their academic community. Smith's critique of
   democratic peace theory specifically, and liberal IR theory more
   generally, is particularly noteworthy considering Smith's former
   position as a leading liberal proponent. The paper reviews, and then
   supplements and extends, Smith's critique of democratic peace theory.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},

Volume = {19},

Pages = {831-849},
Abstract = {The implosion of Communism in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe opened
   the closed frontier imposed by early Bolshevik policy and which was a
   key factor supporting the top-down nature of Communist rule. Behind it
   the market was abolished and the centrally determined plans were
   protected from world markets and other external influences. These states
   thus played no part in the development of globalisation, but their
   Communist parties fell from power just as globalisation was becoming a
   major factor in world affairs. The upshot was a marked asymmetry as
   Western influence entered the post-Communist space. The environmental
   issue was powerfully affected, as donor NGOs came to operate most
   congenially at intermediate level between government and grassroots
   groups. The outside-in operation of transnational NGOs thus replaced the
   incipient bottom-up activism in Eastern Europe from the Helsinki
   Agreements in 1975 onwards, and the `informals' in the Soviet Union
   responding to Gorbachev's glasnost. This raises questions about the
   definition of participation and representation in a global age.},

Abstract = {This article tests two competing hypotheses in the study of the
   institutional design of regulatory agencies. Political explanations
   consider the degree of institutional design of regulatory agencies as a
   function of political factors, such as the degree of policy conflict and
   political uncertainty. By contrast, historical-cultural explanations of
   institutional design claim that the design of regulatory agencies is a
   function of path dependency and national administrative traditions. In
   this article, we test these hypotheses on a data set of 293 regulatory
   agencies that were created between 1945 and 2000 in Sweden, the
   Netherlands, and Denmark. We find strong support for historical-cultural
   explanations, while our findings suggest that political factors play
   almost no role in the institutional design of regulatory agencies within
   parliamentary regimes.},

Title = {From The Twenty Years' Crisis to Theory of International

Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AND DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {13},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {378-404},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The idea behind this article is to employ a series of Deleuzo-Guattarian
   principles, primarily the concept of the rhizome, to the articulation
   and development of Realism as a theory of IR. The article makes the
   claim that using rhizomatics allows those interested in Realism to
   reconceptualise the relationship between Realism and Neorealism. The
   article argues that the publication of The Twenty Years' Crisis by E.H.
   Carr and Theory of International Politics by Ken Waltz represent two
   `intense' moments in the descent of Realism. The article argues that
   despite the attempted `territorialisation' of Realism into the static,
   paradigmatic Neorealism, Realism remains a heterogeneous set of
   concepts. The territorialisation process has met with some resistance;
   for example, just as Waltz was trying to territorialise Realism, his
   theory was being deterritorialised by Richard Ashley. The article also
   examines James Der Derian's attempt to save realism by deconstructing
   it, advocating an `affirmative leap into the imaginary'. The article
   concludes that despite the Neorealist moment, attempts to splice
   together constructivism and realism provide evidence that Realism
   remains mutative, heterogeneous, open and vital. Journal of
   International Relations and Development (2010) 13, 378-404.

Abstract = {This paper develops Deleuze's critique of the political ideal of
   sovereignty by examining his philosophy of nature. In their exultation
   of the ideal of sovereignty, traditional forms of political theory
   reflect only one aspect of nature. That is, its tendency toward unity.
   As such, they obscure what is most `true' of nature, and what is most
   `true' of peoples and individuals, which is their tendency toward
   multiplicity. While Deleuze's work has received significant attention in
   IR, the value of his philosophy of nature for the more concretely
   political problem of sovereignty is still to be fully realised. Beyond
   its under-representation in debates concerning political problems,
   Deleuze's work also suffers from misrepresentation. There is an abiding
   misconception of Deleuze as a theorist of the possibility of a `world
   without sovereignty'. This paper dispels that particular misconception
   by demonstrating Deleuze's attention to the necessity of the recurrence
   of the problem of sovereignty as a condition for an understanding of
   political agency. Journal of International Relations and Development

Journal = {BUSINESS AND POLITICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {12},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This contribution is a reaction to the striking fact that the political
   aspect of CSR has remained largely hidden in most of the scientific and
   practice-oriented management literature. This work intends to illuminate
   the political dimension of CSR in that the changing stance of the
   European Commission toward CSR between 2001 and 2006 is analyzed and
   interpreted as a result of political processes within an ``issue
   arena{''}. For this case study written documents from the most important
   actors are used (EU Commission, EU Parliament, the Council, advocacy
   groups and lobbies for industry and civil society CSR platforms) as well
   as interviews with high ranking representatives of these institutions
   (conducted in the spring of 2008).},

Abstract = {India's gradual rise as a new great power can be explained by domestic
   and international changes. India's economic reforms after 1991 and the
   end of the Cold War increased its international attractiveness and its
   room for manoeuvre. India became an important partner not only for the
   United States and the developing countries but also for China. The
   growing convergence of ideas and interests with the peer group of great
   powers has promoted India's gradual rise by a process of co-optation and
   co-operation into institutions of global governance and great power
   status.},

Abstract = {China is one among many other countries that have recognised the
   necessity in aligning national scientific progress with that of global
   development. As China is striding along the path of scientific
   development with determination and initial success, a key concern
   confronted by international scientific community is how China will
   transform existing global scientific atlas. Based on a project carried
   out in six Chinese cities, this paper mainly employs Ulrich Beck's
   cosmopolitan theory in examining China's life sciences' development in
   the last decade to investigate how Chinese stakeholders have developed a
   (cosmopolitan) sensibility to rival ways of scientific reasoning, and in
   what way Chinese stakeholders have contributed to the
   cosmopolitanization of science.},

Abstract = {The Progressive Unionist party (PUP) was formed in the late 1970s and is
   one of the smallest political parties in Northern Ireland, both in terms
   of its membership size and its share of the vote, which translates into
   only a tiny number of elected representatives. Yet, supporters and
   critics alike have marked it out as one of the most distinctive voices
   in Northern Irish politics-in the main because of its democratic
   socialist ideology and its class-based character. This article examines
   the PUP's political programme, its membership and support base, its role
   in the peace process and its relationship with illegal loyalist
   terrorist organisations. It does so by drawing on current debates in the
   political science literature about ethnic parties in divided societies.
   Moreover, it focuses on the often neglected relationship between
   ethnicity and class in the PUP in order to explain how the party
   understands and contributes towards the peace process and democratic
   stability in Northern Ireland.},

Abstract = {Why has Serbia's path toward European integration been fraught with so
   much difficulty? This article explains Serbia's reluctance to
   Europeanize by exploring why Serbian elites persistently refused to
   fulfill the European Union's principal requirement-full cooperation with
   the Hague war crimes tribunal-even when it meant getting off the road to
   Brussels. The article offers a theoretical framework that incorporates
   domestic political identity, power of veto players, and competing elite
   strategies to explain how Serbian political actors used European Union
   norms and institutions to advance local political agendas. The article
   concludes that, instead of being a successful change agent that brought
   about policy shift in the areas of democratization and human rights, the
   European Union was used on many occasions by Serbian political elites to
   pursue strategies far removed from EU norms and standards.},

Abstract = {The Arctic Ocean has been described as undergoing a fundamental `state
   change' - with particular reference to the loss of sea ice. Recent
   events suggest that the five coastal states (Canada, Denmark/Greenland,
   Norway, Russia and the United States) and other stakeholders are
   fundamentally reconsidering their relationship with the Arctic Ocean.
   The prevailing governance of the Arctic Ocean is quite different to the
   Antarctic and Southern Ocean. The Arctic Ocean is not a global common
   and there is no equivalent to the 1959 Antarctic Treaty. If the Arctic
   Ocean is in a state of flux then it is due to three interlocking
   vectors: the role of science and technology in generating knowledge
   about the region (accessibility); international law and rights of
   coastal states (resources); and the role of domestic and international
   audiences (sovereignty).},

Title = {Strategic Governance for Development: from the European to the Latin
   American Experience},

Abstract = {Strategic governance is crucial for a successful development and
   catching-up process. This paper starts by highlighting some of the
   critical points in the current preparation of the new development
   strategy of the European Union, the EU2020. Building on this past and
   present experience of strategic governance involving 27 countries, this
   article elaborates on a more general approach which might be relevant
   for the Latin American countries.
   The countries of Latin America face tremendous social and regional
   disparities, environmental imbalances, and the challenge of better
   global economic insertion. Responding to these problems means promoting
   broad long-term reforms, in turn requiring an integration development
   strategy and the establishment of strategic governance systems.
   In this context, this work aims to: first, propose and detail
   methodological points of reference for a development agenda covers the
   policy definition, implementation, monitoring and evaluation phases,
   which means identifying the kinds of institutional mechanisms that can
   conduct the process of strategic governance, specifically mechanisms of
   representative democracy, participatory democracy, and mechanisms to
   modernise public administration systems. Second, it specifies how such
   mechanisms might operate at the federal, state and local levels.
   Building a system of strategic governance necessarily involves a
   multiplicity of actors and various layers of governance, and interaction
   between them. Finally, the document explores possible ways to define a
   development agenda, and examines strategic governance at the
   macro-regional level in a context of regional cooperation and/or
   integration. To that end, the experience of other macro-regions
   worldwide, particularly of the European Union, is invoked.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH},

Volume = {47},
Number = {5},
Pages = {535-546},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {While there has been extensive interest in the role of democracy in
   reducing interstate violence, the role of democracy in reaching higher
   levels of peace has received much less attention. Since many countries
   have less than amicable relations, it is necessary to consider how the
   quality of peace can be improved. The quality of peace becomes
   particularly relevant when assessing relations of countries with a
   bellicose past. In order to capture improvement in relations, this
   article relies upon a framework that captures the various levels of
   peace that countries experience. The study maintains that democracy
   contributes to former belligerents reaching the highest levels of peace
   but that it is not helpful at the lower levels especially if only one
   side is a democracy. The article tests arguments on a dataset that
   captures the transitions from one level of peace to another for all
   former belligerents since 1816 and relies upon event history analysis.
   The results for peace are not the opposite of what is found for war. The
   findings demonstrate that democracy plays a substantial role in peaceful
   transitions at all levels. However, while joint democracy is important
   for reaching the highest levels of peace, democracy can hamper the
   progress of relations at the lowest levels of peace.},

Title = {Informal Norms as a Bridge between Formal Rules and Outcomes of
   Government Financial Operations: Evidence from State Balanced Budget
   Requirements},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION RESEARCH AND THEORY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {20},
Number = {3},
Pages = {655-678},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Both formal rules and informal norms guide government operations; formal
   rules often function through informal norms. Balanced budget
   requirements (BBRs) are formal rules, but they are implemented via the
   intermediary of informal norms-interpretation of BBRs by state
   officials. This article examines the fiscal implications of informal
   norms that govern budgetary balance. We propose that informal norms have
   substantive implications in policy making and implementation. To test
   the proposition, we obtain state self-reported, time-varying data on
   balanced budget provisions as observations of informal norms, compare
   them against formal, codified balanced budget requirements from recent
   research to identify gaps between rules and norms, and decompose the
   gaps using two categories-{''}interpretations{''} and ``reverse
   interpretations{''} of formal balanced budget requirements. We then
   conduct probit estimation to obtain the effects of informal norms as
   well as the interpretations and reverse interpretations on two measures
   of budgetary balance. Results show that informal norms do affect
   outcomes of government financial operations; the two-step decomposition
   of the gaps between formal rules and informal norms provides further
   information on the locus of these effects. The article identifies the
   interpretation of formal rules as a new research area, thus contributing
   to the budgetary institutions and policy implementation literatures.},

Abstract = {Well-governed countries are more likely to make use of foreign aid for
   the purposes of economic development and poverty alleviation. Therefore,
   if aid agencies are providing funds for the sake of development, these
   countries should receive more aid and categorically different types of
   aid as compared with poorly governed countries In poorly governed
   countries aid should be given in forms that allow for less discretion
   Using an original data set of all World Bank projects from 1996 to 2002,
   the author distinguishes programmatic projects from investment projects
   and national from subnational Investment projects If the World Bank
   allows more discretion in well-governed countries, then it will choose
   to provide programmatic and national aid for these recipients The author
   presents evidence that the World Bank provides a larger proportion of
   national investment lending in better-governed countries With regard to
   programmatic lending, he finds mixed evidence Among counties eligible
   for International Development Association (IDA) aid, good governance
   surprisingly is associated with a lower proportion of programmatic aid,
   whereas for International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (imp)
   borrowers, good governance is associated with a higher proportion. The
   author subjects these results to a number of robustness checks Although
   he confirms the existing result in the literature that the World Bank
   provides larger overall amounts of aid to better-governed countries, his
   examination of the disaggregated data leads to questioning whether both
   lending wings of the World Bank are designing aid programs in the most
   prodevelopment way possible},

Abstract = {The goal of this paper is to analyze the impact the EU has had on Czech
   women's groups since the 1990s. Drawing on both Europeanization and
   social movement theories, the first section defines the theoretical
   framework of the paper. The second section is focused on the impact of
   changes in the funding of women's groups which, since the end of the
   1990s, have relied more than before on European funding. The third
   section analyzes the shift in the political context and the domestic
   political opportunity structure in the Czech Republic that has occurred
   in connection with the accession process. The fourth section analyzes
   transnational cooperation for which new opportunities have appeared with
   the EU's eastward expansion. The paper concludes by summarizing its main
   findings. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Regents of

Abstract = {Adopting a cross-regional and global perspective, this article
   critically evaluates one of the core assertions of political economy
   approaches to welfare-that support for redistribution is inversely
   related to income. We hypothesize that economic self-interest gives way
   to more uniform support for redistribution in the interest of ensuring
   that basic or relative needs are met in less developed and highly
   unequal societies. To test this hypothesis, we analyze individual-level
   surveys combined with country-level indicators for more than 50
   countries between 1984 and 2004. Our analysis shows that
   individual-level income does not systematically explain support for
   redistribution in countries with low levels of economic development or
   high levels of income inequality. These findings challenge the
   universality of the assumption of economic self-interest in shaping
   preferences for redistribution that has been so pervasive in the
   literature.},

Abstract = {It is argued that ethnic competition, triggers for ethnic mobilization,
   and political institutions together affect changes in government-imposed
   political and economic restrictions on ethnic groups worldwide. Due to
   the fact that the only existing comparative data set on ethnic
   discrimination, produced by the Minorities at Risk project, uses
   discrimination as a criterion for including ethnic groups, a new data
   set of 620 additional groups has been created to predict the selection
   process through a full-information, maximum-likelihood Heckman probit
   model, but selection bias is found not to affect the results.
   Discrimination is modeled as a dynamic Markov process, and central and
   regional government institutions, economic conditions, and minority
   group characteristics are found to influence the initiation and
   continuation of discriminatory policies.},

Abstract = {Tony Blair's New Labour government came to power in 1997, promising a
   new attitude towards Europe, distinct from the `Euroscepticism'
   associated with its predecessors, the Conservative party. Analysts were
   keen to highlight this as a significant shift in British politics,
   pointing in particular to Blair's instrumental role in the development
   of the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) as evidence of the
   change. This article examines Labour attitudes towards both the Common
   Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and the ESDP in comparison with those
   of its Conservative predecessors to argue that Blair's actions
   represented more a policy of adaptation than a momentous change in UK
   policy.},

Abstract = {In the immediate post-liberation period, Eritrean intellectuals, with
   the concurrence of the state, showed deep interest in developing
   archaeological studies and an enhanced capacity to manage heritage
   resources. Through a focus on the National Museum, this article
   investigates the ensuing struggles for the control of history and
   heritage in Eritrea. Originally an initiative of ex-fighters who
   rendered liberation history in artistic form, the National Museum later
   came under the authority of the University of Asmara. While other
   museums involving those who survived displacement and conflict, such as
   the District Six Museum in Cape Town, often contest the expert authority
   of intellectuals and invite public participation, the National Museum
   became an instrument of the state that suppressed public participation.
   The struggle between the National Museum and the University provides
   penetrating insights into state hostility towards intellectuals and
   containment of public education using the media of archaeology and
   heritage studies, a conflict that prefigured state/university conflicts
   leading to the dismantling of the University of Asmara.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {54},
Number = {1},
Pages = {241-265},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This article addresses the influence wielded by the formal leaders of
   international cooperation-those state or supranational representatives
   that chair and direct negotiations in the major decision bodies of
   multilateral organizations and conferences. This is a topic that so far
   has received limited systematic attention by IR theorists, who have
   tended to treat bargaining parties as functionally and formally
   equivalent, leaving little theoretical space for formal leadership.
   Drawing on rational choice institutionalism, I introduce a theory that
   develops a coherent argument for the delegation of authority to the
   chairmanship, the power resources of negotiation chairs, and the
   influence of formal leaders over outcomes. I assess the explanatory
   power of this theory through evidence on formal leadership in three
   alternative organizational settings: the European Union, the General
   Agreement on Tariffs and Trade/the World Trade Organization, and the
   United Nations environmental conferences. I find in favor of the
   chairmanship as a source of independent influence in international
   cooperation. Formal leaders perform functions of agenda management,
   brokerage, and representation that make it more likely for negotiations
   to succeed, and possess privileged resources that may enable them to
   steer negotiations toward the agreements they most prefer.},

Abstract = {This article looks at questions of politeness, conduct and civility in
   the 18th century to explore how individuals imagined owning themselves
   as market actors and as members of an emerging civil society. It focuses
   on how they managed the contradictions of participating in the
   capitalist market without being branded as gamblers. It argues that a
   moral economy of rational improvement and a disciplined self was crucial
   to this process, to counter the fragility of self-ownership and the
   unpredictability and riskiness of property not based on land ownership.
   This disciplined and rational self-ownership was inextricable from the
   development of gender relations, which rested on the division between
   the public and private spheres, and from the disavowal of `bad
   femininity' from the account of property.},

Abstract = {In countries around the world it is common practice for victims of human
   trafficking who have been ``rescued{''} or who have escaped from
   situations of exploitation to be placed and detained in public or
   private shelters. In the most egregious situations, victims can be
   effectively imprisoned in such shelters for months, even years. This
   article uses field-based research to document this largely unreported
   phenomenon. It then considers the international legal aspects of victim
   detention in shelters and weighs the common justifications for such
   detention from legal, policy, and practical perspectives.},

Abstract = {How does variation in the strength of a court's jurisdiction and
   enforcement affect strategic behavior by states involved in
   international disputes? The authors construct a formal model and
   identify three important ways that legal institutions can have a
   deleterious effect on international cooperation by magnifying the
   bargaining problems arising from incomplete information about the
   quality of the legal claims. First, strong courts create less
   information revelation in pretrial bargaining. Second, strong courts
   reduce the likelihood of pretrial settlements between states. Third,
   strong courts lead to more brinksmanship over high-value assets, which
   leads to conflict if the court refuses to intervene. The authors argue
   that a key policy implication of their model is that attempts to
   strengthen international courts must be accompanied by increased
   precision of international law to ameliorate the deleterious effects of
   strong courts.},

Abstract = {Reexamination of the notion of ``illegality{''} reveals the important
   role of state in crafting an ``illegal{''} class and opens the way for a
   structural interpretation of recent Latin American migratory flows to
   the United States heartland. A case study of the effects of
   anti-immigrant legislation passed in Oklahoma in 2007 reveals that
   ``getting tough on illegals{''} can have unintended consequences,
   causing both illegal and legal migrants to leave the state and diverting
   attention from issues of wages, organizing rights, and health and safety
   standards that affect all workers, Latino and other. Extending labor
   protections to all workers could reduce the incentive to prefer
   undocumented migrants over U. S. workers.},

Abstract = {This paper aims at some general understanding of the phenomenon of
   politicians using land rights as a patronage resource in attempts to
   mobilise electoral support. Using Zimbabwe and Cote d'Ivoire as case
   studies, it argues that the increasing visibility of land as a patronage
   resource in African multiparty elections may be at least partly
   explained by the convergence of three specific constraints and
   incentives confronting politicians. First, weak legal restraints on
   rulers' ability to allocate land rights create opportunities for
   politicians to use land as a patronage resource. Second, competitive
   multiparty elections mean that politicians must work to mobilise
   constituency support in order to win. Third, the dwindling fiscal
   capacity of the state can heighten the attractiveness of land as a
   patronage resource. Land can be offered as a patronage resource even
   when state coffers run low.},

Journal = {COMMONWEALTH \& COMPARATIVE POLITICS},

Number = {4},
Pages = {404-432},
Abstract = {How was it that the Indian Civil Service (ICS), involved as it was in
   various activities to secure the British Raj against the pressures of
   Indian nationalism, was able to survive and flourish in the new
   political order after independence? This article argues that part of the
   explanation lies in the fact that it was, and was seen to be, a
   `politically neutral' institution. In the course of making this
   argument, it surveys the changing role of the ICS vis-a-vis the
   nationalist movement before independence, and also considers the
   theoretical question of what is meant by the claim that bureaucratic
   work is `apolitical' or `neutral' with respect to politics.},

Abstract = {The most sophisticated philosophical defence of Marx's theory of
   history- G.A. Cohen's - deploys functional explanations in a manner that
   accords explanatory primacy to technological development. In contrast,
   an anarchist theory can be developed that accords explanatory primacy to
   the state. It is, however, possible to develop a theory of history that
   accords explanatory primacy neither to the development of technology nor
   to the state but which nevertheless possesses the explanatory powerof
   both the Marxist and the anarchist theories. Such a theory can also
   provide the foundations for a radical environmentalist political theory.},

   has undergone significant changes. These changes have allowed the

   globalization became the mainspring of Brazilian foreign policy. In the
   scope, President Lula has maintained the tradition of formulating and
   programming foreign policy as a State policy, and also has fostered the

Abstract = {The death of President Levy Mwanawasa in August 2008 plunged Zambian
   politics into a state of flux. This article argues that the way the main
   parties responded to the challenge of the resulting presidential
   by-election has three lessons to teach the emerging literature on
   political parties. First, Rupiah Banda's rise to power within the MMD
   demonstrates the extent to which intra-party machinations can leave a
   party saddled with an unpopular leader, and hence illustrates the great
   significance of succession struggles within dominant-party systems.
   Second, the main parties' continual repositioning of their electoral
   platforms reveals that not all African elections take place in an
   ideological vacuum, and shows that the platforms parties adopt can only
   be fully understood in the context of the wider party system and the way
   in which parties interact over time. Finally, the ability of
   controversial opposition leader Michael Sata to mobilize a diverse
   support base - by employing a `populist' message in urban areas at the
   same time as receiving the support of his ethno-regional community in
   rural areas - lays bare the complexity of party strategies and the
   limits of the `ethnic census' model of party support. Taken together,
   these findings suggest that the tendency to divorce the study of
   elections from the study of how parties function and interact
   impoverishes our understanding of African politics.},

Journal = {PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {88},
Number = {1},
Pages = {18-35},
Abstract = {Membership of the EU and the scope of European integration are still
   contested issues in Danish politics. However, the impact of EU
   legislation on Danish legislation is relatively modest and highly
   concentrated within the field generally related to the regulation of the
   internal market. Strong upstream procedures at both the
   interdepartmental and the parliamentary level have been installed that
   effectively protect Danish policy-makers against political surprises in
   EU legislative politics. Upstream procedures are much stronger than the
   downstream ones for overseeing the implementation of EU policies and
   they ensure a high degree of consensus on specific EU legislation, both
   among the political parties in the Danish Parliament and among affected
   interests. As a result the transposition of directives is mainly a
   ministerial responsibility, and within the well-established fields of
   cooperation, the decree is the preferred legal instrument.},

Title = {Local Media and Experts: Sources of Environmental Policy Initiation?},
Journal = {POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {38},
Number = {1},
Pages = {143-164},
Abstract = {Research on the process of policy change often involves a direct or
   indirect analysis of the roles of policy entrepreneurs and the mass
   media. In Colorado, beginning in 1998, twelve communities decided to
   obtain water rights for recreational in-channel purposes such as
   kayaking and whitewater rafting. These water rights stirred political
   controversy within some communities in Colorado related to spending
   public money, appropriate uses of water, and the role of recreation in
   local economies. Using a comparative case study research method, this
   research analyzes the role that policy entrepreneurs and local media
   coverage of recreational water rights played in initiating policy change
   in local communities. The most critical finding from this study is that
   in communities where citizens acted as policy entrepreneurs there was
   more controversy, less positive media coverage, and more media coverage
   early in the process. This case contradicts the assumption that local
   media coverage helps to highlight policy problems within communities. It
   supports the idea that experts wield higher levels of influence than
   citizens in promoting policy agendas.},

Abstract = {State-and nation-building historical policies clash with the
   perspectives of minorities. Negative group stereotypes affect the trust
   required for multicultural societies to function. How do groups mediate
   differences and cope with hate-prone interpretations of history? Linking
   the often separate literature on social capital, identity, ethnic
   conflicts and resolution, and on symbolic politics and historical
   reconciliation, this article develops a framework for intercommunity
   trust-building research. Observing controversies surrounding collective
   memories and memorials in Eastern Europe, it argues that integrative
   processes occur `from below': when groups build mutual horizontal trust
   through common management of their shared past and landscapes; when the
   state participates, and does not impose.},

   country's new development model. The country has been using multilateral
   forums as a way to achieve international projection and support for its
   development project, highlighting bargaining aspects, variable geometry

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The Wassenaar Arrangement (WA) is a multilateral regime designed to
   control exports of conventional arms and dual-use goods and technologies
   to contribute to regional and international security and stability.
   Unlike traditional arms control and disarmament agreements WA is not
   legally binding. It has to rely on cooperation and voluntary compliance
   of the actors concerned - principally states and industries. For them
   the WA provides guidance for cooperation and compliance. The question is
   whether the actors involved are interested in complying with the
   guidelines. The article applies two IR theories to address this
   question, liberal institutionalism and realism. One argument of liberal
   institutionalism is that international institutions and regimes not only
   have a vital catalytic role to play in promoting cooperation among
   states, but they also develop synergetic effects and reinforce each
   other in the framework of effective multilateralism. In many ways this
   might well be the case, but the opposite is also true. The economic
   interests of member states and jealousy between them have long hampered
   cooperation among the various regimes that have been designed to act as
   the multilayered export control and non-proliferation system that all
   involved have agreed is necessary. But it is not only liberal
   institutionalism that fails to explain the behavior of states,
   international institutions and regimes. For realists, it is states'
   interests that matter, with common norms, rules and principles mattering
   less, if at all. But contrary to the realist argument, states do also
   support the general guidelines and best practices of the international
   institutions that have been created to avoid the destabilizing effects
   of the accumulation of certain categories of conventional arms and the
   proliferation of dangerous weapons. Neither realism nor liberal
   institutionalism is fully able to capture the complex relationship
   between the interests of individual countries and general principles and
   norms. The diplomatic delegations in multilateral fora have the
   difficult task of identifying the cumulative interests of the countries
   they represent. They have to support and reject cooperation with states
   and other export control regimes and institutions, often at the same
   time. International Politics (2010) 47, 125-143. doi:10.1057/ip.2009.25},

Abstract = {Defence planning attempts the impossible - to meet `requirements' that
   can only be known in the light of events that have yet to occur. Ways in
   which the prospect for defence planning can be improved include (1)
   distinguishing the most important defence decisions, and getting them
   right enough; (2) developing a sufficiently flexible planning capability
   and dynamic military posture; (3) balancing short- and long-term
   investments; (4) insisting upon education in general strategic theory as
   a qualification for the practice of strategy; (5) appreciating that a
   country can afford to spend on security and defence however much it
   chooses politically so to do; and (6) recognising that, although defence
   and security are closely related, they are not synonymous.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the question of transitional justice and
   politics of the past of the post-Franco democratic regime in Spain and
   particularly the reappearance of questions related to the authoritarian
   past in recent years. Particular emphasis will be given to the complex
   relationship between the media, the political sphere and social demands
   when it comes to explaining the recent eruption of memory. It identifies
   the changes in the positions of the main political parties with respect
   to their attitudes towards the authoritarian past and investigates the
   reasons behind these changes.},

Abstract = {From the mid-1960s through 1980, major policy changes were adopted as a
   result of federal and state public lands protection statutes. This
   article analyzes the impact these policy changes have had upon the
   economies of gateway communities, a subject of limited discussion in the
   scholarly literature. One conclusion is that gateway community economies
   have become less dependent on resources extraction. This analysis finds
   that several factors-beyond policy change-have influenced the shift away
   from resources extraction. Likewise, there is the question over what
   economic mainstays have stepped in to fill the resources extraction
   void? For many gateway communities, it appears that the answer has been
   recreational tourism. The implications of this economic shift within
   gateway communities are explored.},

Pages = {117-136},
Abstract = {At first glance the European Union's (EU's) compound form of
   representation allows a wide-ranging spectrum of actors to claim to be
   representative, and allows different channels to feed their demands and
   interests into the political system. While this may be understood as a
   redeeming feature of supranational politics, this article sounds a note
   of caution. The historically developed system of representation
   comprising different principles and practices may combine in ways that
   undermine standards by which claims to political representation can be
   justified. First, it is demonstrated that the urge to combine multiple
   channels of representation has its roots in the history and theory of
   representation itself. Second, we show the development of the EU's
   compound form of representation. Third, tests of how well principles and
   practices of representation combine in the European arena are proposed.
   It is shown that the EU's specific combination of representative
   practices hardly allows for ensuring public control with political
   equality.},

Abstract = {The Muslim Brotherhood poses a unique challenge to efforts to combat Al
   Qaeda and like-minded groups. It is one of the key sources of Islamist
   thought and political activism, and plays a significant role in shaping
   the political and cultural environment in an Islamist direction. At the
   same time, it opposes Al Qaeda for ideological, organizational, and
   political reasons and represents one of the major challenges to the
   salafi-jihadist movement globally. This dual nature of the Muslim
   Brotherhood has long posed a difficult challenge to efforts to combat
   violent extremism. Does its non-violent Islamism represent a solution,
   by capturing Islamists within a relatively moderate organization and
   stopping their further radicalization ( a ``firewall{''}), or is it part
   of the problem, a ``conveyor belt{''} towards extremism? This article
   surveys the differences between the two approaches, including their
   views of an Islamic state, democracy, violence, and takfir, and the
   significant escalation of those tensions in recent years. It concludes
   that the MB should be allowed to wage its battles against extremist
   challengers, but should not be misunderstood as a liberal organization
   or supported in a short-term convergence of interests.},

Abstract = {This article presents a comparative analysis of the evolution of two
   community mental health networks that both have similar contracts from
   the State of Arizona. One of the networks is governed by a for-profit
   firm that buys needed services from a network of largely nonprofit
   agencies. The other network is governed by a community-based nonprofit
   that contracts with four separate nonprofit agencies to provide services
   directly or through a network of other providers, most of which are
   nonprofit. These two networks are analyzed, using social network
   analysis, when each system was first formed and again, 4 years later.
   The for-profit governed network is then compared to the nonprofit
   governed network on four dimensions: sector, nonprofit or for-profit,
   relationships and trust, the evolution of the structure of the networks,
   and a limited comparison of the two networks' performance.},

Journal = {ETHNOPOLITICS},

Volume = {9},

Pages = {53-69},
Abstract = {This study uses the case of a largely religiously non-practising group,
   working class loyalists in Northern Ireland, to explore the relationship
   between religion and ethnicity in divided societies. It finds that
   loyalists often turn to religion habitually in times of insecurity to
   provide justification for conflict. But religion does not just prop up
   deeper ethnic identities. Religion has meaning and content itself that
   is sometimes in tension with oppositional ethnic identities and, in some
   cases, can transform them totally. This produces a complex set of
   relationships in which religion and ethnicity push and pull against one
   another in the lives of individuals, neither dominating fully over the
   other.},

Journal = {POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {31},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {413-428},
Abstract = {This article contributes to the development of ideas about place
   leadership by focusing on the role played by housing associations within
   `place-shaping networks' in neighbourhoods that have faced a long
   history of regeneration interventions in two cities in the Netherlands
   and England. It maps key features of place leadership in comparison with
   the more established paradigm of network governance. It explores the
   origins and purpose, content and approaches, and some key challenges
   faced by each of these perspectives. Longitudinal research on
   neighbourhood regeneration in priority neighbourhoods in Groningen and
   Birmingham is used to consider seven themes derived from our conceptual
   mapping. The article draws some conclusions about the value that place
   leadership and network governance concepts add to understanding
   neighbourhood regeneration, and reflects on the notion of `successful
   places' as the ultimate outcome of place leadership activities.},

Title = {The implicit normativity of political practices. Analyzing the dynamics
   and power relations of committee decision-making},
Journal = {CRITICAL POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {3},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {357-374},
Abstract = {If one understands political decisions as normatively binding, the
   question arises as to how bindingness in this sense is produced.
   Political decisions are not only binding for the citizens concerned.
   First of all, mutual bindingness has to be achieved between the
   political agents involved. This paper aims to present a process-oriented
   analysis of the normative forces at work in political face-to-face
   decision interactions. In this context, we introduce a two-dimensional
   conception of political normativity. The dimension of implicit,
   in-process normativity complements the dimension of explicit,
   rule-following normativity. The second part of the paper provides an
   empirical illustration of a typical political practice of
   decision-making, taken from an analysis of actual committee meetings.
   This illustration serves to exemplify the processual character and the
   dynamics as well as the internal power relations of
   bindingness-production.},

Abstract = {Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) has shifted its structure and strategies several
   times since its inception, and its ability to evolve over time has
   ensured its survival. This article evaluates the evolution of JI's
   influence in Indonesia and its shift in strategy, in an attempt to
   address the broader issue of its survival as an organization. It
   hypothesizes that while internal factors initiated the current strategy
   shift to an ideological and political focus, external factors have
   successfully exploited and solidified that shift. Explaining JI's
   historical evolution in four phases, it concludes by considering
   possibilities for a ofifth phaseo of peaceful political participation.},

Abstract = {New European Union policy is to be subject to equality impact assessment
   for all strands of inequality and multiple discrimination (European
   Commission, 2006). This article discusses research that tested a gender
   mainstreaming model for its ability to reveal intersectional
   inequalities. The resulting collaborative multi-strand model situates
   intersectional enquiry at a structural level, enables the integration of
   equalities and human rights approaches and supports prioritisation
   without reductively homogenising `strand' specific inequalities. This is
   a step towards intersectional working. Gaining satisfactory
   intersectional evidence will require improved quantitative data
   collection, the revaluing of qualitative data, and collaborative working
   between `equality makers and policy makers'.},

   considered firstly from the world politics perspective. This means
   examining the dysfunctional forms of human behaviour manifest there-both
   individual and collective/communal. It means examining how such
   behaviour can be described and explained in psychiatric or
   psychological/psychoanalytical terms. The relationship between
   psychopathology and world politics can also be considered from the
   psychopathology perspective. This means examining some of the key
   psychopathological concepts that are of relevance to world affairs. It
   means examining paranoia or narcissism, for example, and the way

Journal = {PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION},

Volume = {88},
Number = {2},
Pages = {315-330},
Abstract = {A key motive for establishing the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)
   was restoring public confidence in the wake of multiplying food scares
   and the BSE crisis. Scholars, however, have paid little attention to the
   actual political and institutional logics that shaped this new
   organization. This article explores the dynamics underpinning the making
   of EFSA. We examine the way in which learning and power shaped its
   organizational architecture. It is demonstrated that the lessons drawn
   from the past and other models converged on the need to delegate
   authority to an external agency, but diverged on its mandate, concretely
   whether or not EFSA should assume risk management responsibilities. In
   this situation of competitive learning, power and procedural politics
   conditioned the mandate granted to EFSA. The European Commission, the
   European Parliament and the European Council shared a common interest in
   preventing the delegation of regulatory powers to an independent EU
   agency in food safety policy.},

Journal = {SOUTH EUROPEAN SOCIETY AND POLITICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {15},

Pages = {11-33},
Abstract = {The aim of this article is to analyse the attitudes of Italian political
   and economic elites towards European citizenship through the results of
   a survey conducted in 2007. We begin with a discussion of the changing
   patterns of pro-Europeanism among Italian elites, within the framework
   of the recent deep transformations of the domestic political system. In
   order to understand how these transformations have affected the elites'
   attitudes towards European citizenship, we investigate the analytical
   dimensions covered in this special issue: identity, representation and
   scope of governance. We reach the conclusion that the Italian elite are
   still characterised by a clear pro-European profile. However, some hints
   of change are evident: in comparison with politicians, economic elites
   are more certain about their degree of support. Moreover, a growing
   difference emerges within the political class, as centre-left MPs are
   more oriented towards full pro-Europeanism.},

Pages = {368-382},
Abstract = {Competitive interdependence characterizes the EU-US relationship
   vis-a-vis third markets. Each defines success in relation to the other
   while each also views the other as its key geo-economic competitor in
   the world economy. CI has developed as the EU has attempted to manage
   globalization in the field of trade policy by focusing on the
   multilateral level and then by reversing course and privileging the
   regional, which in turn has expanded the EU's territorial influence. The
   reversal occurred largely because the Bush Administration in Washington
   pursued free trade agreements (FTAs) in a process of `competitive
   liberalization'. The US outflanked the EU by negotiating FTAs that
   favored US firms in third markets. The EU, to protect its own firms,
   then began to negotiate FTAs itself. Geo-economic competition between
   the EU and the US is thus key to shaping EU trade policy.},
