Title = {Private-Public Interaction in Global Governance: The Case of
   Transnational Commercial Arbitration},
Journal = {BUSINESS AND POLITICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {12},
Number = {3, SI},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Scholars of international relations and global governance are
   increasingly interested in the transnational commercial arbitration
   system. So far, they have tended to characterize the system as a form of
   private global governance. However, using a combination of empirical and
   legal analysis, this article draws attention to the critical role of the
   state in the transnational commercial arbitration system, and shows that
   both rule-making and enforcement in the system depend largely on
   interactions between private and public actors. By treating arbitration
   as a form of private governance, scholars run the risk of obscuring
   these interactions and hindering their understanding of how
   transnational economic activity is governed. This article therefore
   argues for a modest reorientation of global governance scholarship on
   transnational commercial arbitration in a direction that focuses more
   closely on private-public interaction. More broadly, this article
   suggests that understanding interactions between private and public
   actors is a key to understanding global governance in general, and it
   raises doubts about the analytical desirability of a sharp distinction
   between private and public forms of global governance.},

Abstract = {The article investigates the role of pro-arms control non-governmental
   organisations (NGOs) in furthering the domestic ratification of the
   Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty
   (CTBT) in the United States The study starts out from the two-level
   framework for analysing domestic ratification processes of international
   agreements, and it introduces the concept of audience gains to
   complement this framework being the counterpart of audience costs,
   audience urns denote positive contributions of domestic non-state actors
   to formal ratification processes The article distinguishes two
   complementary pathways for NGOs to generate audience gains, that is, the
   pathways of `mobilising consensus' and of `persuading veto players' Two
   in-depth case studies on the ratification of the CWC and the CTBT in the
   US explore the extent to which pro-agreement NGOs were indeed successful
   in employing the two pathways The evidence of the case studies is that
   NGOs were more influential catalysts of the ratification of the CWC than
   with respect to the CTBT The article's findings on the prospects for
   NGOs to push the domestic ratification of international agreements are
   expected to be of more general relevance beyond the field of arms
   control Journal of International Relations and Development (2010) 13,

Abstract = {Since the 1980s public investment expenditures have been cut back in
   many OECD democracies. One explanation is a priority for fiscal
   stringency in order to curb big government in the context of neo-liberal
   ideas, which is reinforced by EMU requirements in the 1990s. Another is
   the potential impact of left and right partisan politics on investment
   policies. The main finding here is that the overall decrease in public
   investment expenditure appears to be caused by collateral damage due to
   the downsizing of total government outlays. This is particularly the
   case where there is a policy legacy of the Left with high levels of
   total public spending on the welfare state prior to the 1980s. Where the
   Right in government has been dominant after 1980, this downward
   development in public investment is particularly noticeable.},

Abstract = {The Franco-Congolese agreement to enshrine the corpse of Pierre
   Savorgnan de Brazza in a grand memorial tomb in Brazzaville (2006) has
   been decried by many observers as neo-colonial farce. This article
   interprets France's agenda to propose a `suave reconquest' of its former
   colonies, and Sassou Nguesso's forceful mobilization of national and
   regional support. Beyond the immediate political significance of the
   episode, however, the article proposes new ideas on the ways in which
   modern states, North and South, depend on `tournaments of value' that
   assign polarized worth to persons, and often back up international deals
   with transactions in sanctified human remains. The tactic, forged in
   part during the colonial era, illuminates important aspects of today's
   global imaginaries of domination. Brazza's bones work, in France and
   Africa, as a carnal fetish that, borrowing form various philosophies of
   power, merges Western and African beliefs in the body politic.},

Abstract = {The safety of patients is an important responsibility of health care
   providers, and significant compensation costs may arise if providers are
   negligent. A widely debated option involves liability for such
   compensation being placed with the hospital rather than the individual
   clinician, a system known as ``enterprise liability.{''} In the United
   States, partial adoption of enterprise liability and proposals for its
   universal introduction have accompanied high-profile ``malpractice
   insurance crises{''} in the last two decades. Hospitals in England and
   Wales have been subject to this system since 1990, and risk-pooling
   arrangements have emerged subsequently allowing hospitals to transfer
   their liability risk to an agency known as the National Health Service
   Litigation Authority. We explore some of the mechanisms used by this
   agency to provide hospital management with financial incentives to take
   care. We estimate the influence of these arrangements on the use of
   diagnostic imaging tests within hospitals, using a panel data set
   covering the period 2000-04, during which period a policy shift took
   place leading to a form of ``natural experiment.{''} Our results suggest
   that the use of diagnostic tests did not respond to the incentives
   created during this period. We speculate that certain types of patient
   care activity, including the use of diagnostic tests, may be less
   responsive to incentives placed at the level of the hospital by
   comparison with incentives placed at the level of the clinician. Our
   findings may have implications for jurisdictions contemplating a move to
   enterprise liability as well as wider implications for public-sector
   organizations faced with financial incentives to improve service
   quality.},

Abstract = {Many who discuss global democracy think in terms of a Reform-Act model
   of democracy, with the ideal being `one person one vote for all affected
   by the decisions' as in, for example, a second popularly apportioned
   chamber of United Nations. Politically, that is dismissed as wildly
   unrealistic. Remember, however, the Reform Acts came very late in
   process of democratization domestically. Among early steps that
   eventually led to full democratization of that sort domestically were:
   (a) limiting the arbitrary rule on the part of the sovereign; and (b)
   making the sovereign accountable to others (initially a limited set of
   others, which then expanded). Globally, there are moves afoot in both
   those directions. Crucially, once those pieces are in place, the circle
   of accountability basically only ever expands and virtually never
   contracts.},

Abstract = {The article analyses the impact of international justice on the debate
   about public memory and visions of reconciliation in Namibia. Focusing
   on a recent submission to the International Criminal Court, it shows how
   domestic actors used international justice to advance their claims for
   reconciliation and it thus challenges the common assumption that
   reconciliation is an entirely domestic process. The article discusses
   how the ICC submission individualized guilt for past human rights abuses
   and neglected structures of suspicion and denunciation within the
   guerrilla movement SWAPO. The submission also challenged once more the
   government's efforts to reduce the complex history of the country's
   anti-colonial war to a narrative of a unified struggle, and showed that
   the official policy of active forgetting was still questioned after
   almost two decades of imposed silence.},

Abstract = {Theory and empirical evidence show that low inflation is a precondition
   for economic growth. Independent central banks and fixed exchange rates
   are institutional mechanisms that help keep inflation low by lending
   monetary policy credibility to governments. However, the two
   institutions are commonly analyzed as substitutes that tie the hands of
   inflation prone governments. Thus, the literature has difficulties
   describing why governments would adopt both institutions and the
   interaction between them. This paper presents a model that allows
   policymakers the simultaneous choice of monetary institutions and shows
   that imperfectly credible institutions will overlap: when exchange rates
   are fixed but adjustable and central bank independence is not fully
   ascertainable, governments choose both institutions. More generally, the
   paper generates hypotheses about the conditions that make fixed exchange
   rates and independent central banks complements or substitutes, thus
   contributing to an explanation of the diversity of global monetary
   institutions in the post-Bretton Woods period.},

Abstract = {Recent research suggests that a crucial factor in understanding the
   outcomes of military conflicts is the extent to which militaries are
   mechanized-that is, their relative dependence on tanks and armored
   vehicles compared to manpower. Since World War II, militaries have
   become increasingly mechanized both among the great powers and in
   unexpected quarters of the developing world. Yet the extent of military
   mechanization varies widely across states. Why have some states adopted
   highly mechanized force structures, while others have not? This paper
   tests several hypotheses about the determinants of military
   mechanization. One perspective suggests that strategic factors-including
   the force structures of adversaries and neighbors, recent combat
   lessons, and internal insurgency threats-shape a military's mix of
   manpower and vehicles. A second set of hypotheses points instead to
   domestic institutions such as democracy and civilian control of the
   military. Still other theories emphasize economic forces and
   international norms. To test these and other hypotheses, we construct a
   new data set containing mechanization rates for more than 150 militaries
   from 1979 to 2001. Broadly, we find significant support for the
   strategic perspective and little support for domestic institutional
   explanations. In addition, the results suggest systematic and
   predictable differences in the ways states structure their militaries in
   response to security pressures.},

Abstract = {Contrary to the conventional wisdom, we argue that democratic
   institutions are not a prerequisite to an independent judiciary. Rather,
   the need for foreign investment is a necessary and, in some cases,
   perhaps sufficient condition for the establishment of at least nominally
   independent judicial institutions. We consider Chile immediately after
   Pinochet and the Philippines at the outset of the Marcos regime. We
   consider the similarity of court reforms implemented by these two
   regimes. These cases illustrate two distinct points in the life span of
   an authoritarian government. The Chilean case features the time period
   that begins a transition to democracy prior to consolidation. The
   Philippine case features the time period of ascension of the
   authoritarian. Despite the different environments, both regimes
   implemented court reforms primarily designed to attract foreign direct
   investment into their troubled economies. Journal of International

Journal = {AFRICAN AFFAIRS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {109},

Abstract = {It is generally assumed that violent conflict has a negative effect on
   social capital, and war zones are considered to be `zones of social
   capital deficiency'. This article challenges this position, and attempts
   to develop a more nuanced understanding of the status of social capital
   in the context of Sudan's civil war. The empirical findings clearly
   question any simplistic assumption that conflict erodes social capital.
   While it is true that certain types of social capital have been a
   casualty of civil war, the opposite is the case in other communities.
   The article explains this difference by drawing a distinction between
   `endogenous' and `exogenous' counter-insurgency warfare. Communities in
   southern Sudan that were exposed to endogenous counter-insurgency
   warfare experienced a loss of social capital, but where exogenous
   violence dominated, there has been a deepening and strengthening of
   bonding social capital among and within communities.},

Year = {2010},

Abstract = {This case study focuses on extending research knowledge about the
   politics of public management policymaking in Spain. The case involves
   legislating to change politically sensitive features of the central
   government and administration. The study explains such analytically
   significant event conditions as: an agenda-setting process that made a
   policy issue of the formal, structural attributes of state
   administration, an alternative-specification process that proceeded
   without complication, and a decisional process that lasted five years
   and in which political leaders' positions on the issue flip-flopped.
   Broadly speaking, the case analysis demonstrates that when policy
   proposals take the form of legislation, the politics of public
   management policymaking in Spain are highly influenced by political
   stream factors, themselves reflecting Spain's parliamentary form of
   government and relations between statewide and regional political
   parties.},

   Perspective},
Journal = {POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {31},
Number = {2},
Pages = {175-207},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {There has been considerable debate regarding whether Social Dominance
   Orientation (SDO) constitutes a global individual difference that
   predicts prejudice or is instead a product of self-categorization
   processes. Two studies addressed this issue by contrasting the
   predictive and discriminant validity of SDO and reworded SDO items
   assessing prescriptive attitudes toward inequality and dominance based
   on specific stratifications. Consistent with a global individual
   difference perspective, SDO predicted systematic between-person
   consistencies in attitudes toward inequality based on specific
   group-based stratifications. Moreover, SDO and specific stratification
   attitudes exerted reciprocal cross-lagged effects on one another over
   five months (Study 1, N = 252). These results indicate that SDO is
   partially derived from specific attitudes and experiences (a bottom-up
   effect), but once formed, SDO exerts a reciprocal (top-down) effect on
   specific attitudes and cognitions about group-based dominance across a
   range of stratifications. Cross-sectional analyses indicated that SDO
   also predicted generalized prejudice toward ethnic groups after
   controlling for ethnic stratification attitudes (Study 2, N = 138).
   Taken together; these results indicate that SDO reflects a global
   motivation to achieve group-based dominance that is partially determined
   by situational factors but not reducible to self-categorization
   processes associated with attitudes towards specific social groups or
   categories.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PUBLIC POLICY},

Volume = {30},
Number = {1, SI},

Abstract = {While there is much research on the developmental trajectories of
   post-Communist state institutions and the external and domestic
   influences that have shaped their paths, much less is known about
   institutional performance, that is, the manner in which institutions
   operate and the extent to which they produce predictable patterns of
   effects. Academic analysis has been reluctant to shift attention from
   institutionalisation to effects, not least because of the fluidity of
   many formal institutions. The present article documents that over the
   last decade state institutions in East Central Europe have increasingly
   stabilized, especially at the macro-institutional level. The analysis
   highlights insights from institutional theory - notably how degrees,
   time, preferences and resources matter - to encourage further research
   in the field.},

Abstract = {Many in the media have depicted conflicts between the Western and Muslim
   worlds as a `Clash of Civilizations' (CoC), and this has revived many of
   the questions surrounding the value of Samuel Huntington's CoC theory.
   Previous empirical tests have analysed his theory using low-level
   conflict at the interstate level or violent conflict at the subnational
   level. The former have demonstrated little or no empirical support for
   his theory, while the results in the latter group are mixed. This
   analysis adds to previous empirical studies in a number of ways. One,
   the empirical models test CoC exclusively in the post-Cold War era. Two,
   along with examining the civilizational determinants of military
   interstate disputes, as prior studies have done, I include models that
   focus exclusively on interstate wars, because Huntington frequently
   points out that a CoC between states will lead to violent political
   conflict. Finally, this study directly tests Huntington's civilizational
   `fault lines' and Islamic `bloody border' hypotheses. I include an
   extension and find that intra-civilizational conflict is relatively rare
   in the post-Cold War era. Contrary to earlier analyses, the data show
   strong empirical support for CoC, particularly when focusing on violent
   international conflict in the post-Cold War era, and the results are
   robust when testing the hypotheses with alternative data on
   international crises.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL THEORY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {2},

Pages = {32-49},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {I examine enforcement and capacity building in international
   cooperation. In a game-theoretic model, a wealthy donor gives foreign
   aid in exchange for policy implementation by a poor recipient. The
   recipient has limited capacity to comply with international agreements,
   so the donor is not sure if cooperation failure is caused by willful
   disobedience or unintended error. I show that if perceived cooperation
   failure prompts reciprocal suspension of cooperation, the donor and
   recipient have a common preference for capacity building. But when the
   donor can request compensation for perceived cooperation failure, it
   only chooses to build capacity if cooperation is otherwise impossible.
   Consequently, the choice of enforcement mechanism shapes capacity
   building. This result lays a foundation for a genuine synthesis between
   the enforcement and managerialist schools of compliance. It generates
   falsifiable hypotheses and explains why reciprocal enforcement, which
   unfortunately inflicts collateral damage on the victim, is often
   considered legitimate.},

Abstract = {This article probes the importance of various categories of security and
   economic concerns in EU and US responses to non-compliance with human
   rights and democracy norms in third countries. Two research questions
   guide the analysis. First, what concerns influence the determination of
   EU and US to respond to non-compliance? Second, to what extent is the
   EU's response pattern different from that of the US? In answering these
   questions, the article uses bi- and multivariate regression analysis
   that builds on an original dataset of non-compliance events in over 40
   target countries. Findings point to the fact that both actors are
   influenced, in particular, by similar security concerns, above all
   geographic proximity and threat-posing regimes. The US, however,
   responds more often and with more costly instruments to non-compliance
   and therefore seems to be more receptive to such concerns than the EU.},

Abstract = {In this article, I discuss how Locke's account of virtuous moral
   obligation fits with his theory of individual rights, with specific
   attention to his account of ownership. I suggest that the best way to
   make sense of the relationship between the competing concepts of rights
   and virtue in Locke's thought is through the idea of imperfect duties:
   moral duties that do not necessarily have a legal equivalent. These
   duties indicate how a teleological account of morality can exist within
   the framework of a commitment to individual rights while also raising
   questions about how a Lockean government should act in regard to them. I
   identify the imperfect duties involved in the ownership of property and
   tentatively explore Locke's scattered recommendations for `the art of
   governing' individuals.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},

Volume = {17},
Number = {4},
Pages = {487-505},
Abstract = {This article analyses to what extent comitology is an accountable form
   of governance. Past research related to this question exclusively
   focused on the formal arrangements between European institutions and the
   comitology committees, and showed that accountability is on the increase
   but still quite poorly developed. However, it took no notice of an
   equally important set of actors: the superiors of the committee
   participants working in national ministries. This article uses new
   survey and interview data collected among Dutch and Danish superiors of
   committee participants. It shows that superiors are generally able to
   sanction or reward the behaviour of their subordinates, but they do not
   actively process information and they do not often discuss the input of
   the committee participants. This article concludes that accountability
   for this multilevel governance setting is lost somewhere between the
   European and national levels.},

Abstract = {The article analyses how Brazilian state actions and policies regarding
   peace operations during the Presidency of Lula da Silva relate to the
   country's positions and attitudes towards United Nations peacekeeping.
   It argues that the inconsistencies identified on the Brazilian positions
   reflect the lack of a clear strategic horizon guiding the country's
   participation in UN peacekeeping, which consequentially hinders the
   country emergence as a great power.},

Journal = {WORLD POLITICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {62},
Number = {1},
Pages = {87+},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Much of the quantitative literature on civil wars and ethnic conflict
   ignores the role of the state or treats it as a mere arena for political
   competition among ethnic groups. Other studies analyze how the state
   grants or withholds minority rights and faces ethnic protest and
   rebellion accordingly, while largely overlooking the ethnic power
   configurations at the state's center. Drawing on a new data set oil
   Ethnic Power Relations (EPR) that identifies all politically relevant
   ethnic groups and their access to central state power around the world
   from 1946 through 2005, the authors analyze outbreaks of armed conflict
   as the result of competing ethnonationalist claims to state power. The
   findings indicate that representatives of ethnic groups are more likely
   to initiate conflict with the government (1) the more excluded from
   state power they are, especially if they have recently lost power, (2)
   the higher their mobilizational capacity, and (3) the more they have
   experienced conflict in the past.},

Journal = {TERRORISM AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {This article examines: (1) the obvious reasons for, and curious absence
   of, a dialogue between scholars studying new religious movements (NRMs),
   particularly those responsible for acts of mass violence, and those
   studying processes of radicalization in home-grown terrorist groups; (2)
   the substantial parallels between established understandings of who
   joins NRMs, how, and why and recent findings about who joins terrorist
   groups in a Western context, how, and why; and (3) the ways in which
   explanations of the causes of violent behaviour in NRMs are pertinent to
   securing a more systematic and complete grasp of the process of
   radicalization in terrorist cells. The latter discussion focuses on the
   role of apocalyptic belief systems and charismatic forms of authority,
   highlighting the behavioural consequences of this dangerous combination
   and their possible strategic significance. Recommendations are made for
   further research, integrating insights from the two fields of study.},

Journal = {ETUDES INTERNATIONALES},

Number = {1},
Pages = {79-96},
Abstract = {The possession of nuclear weapons is not to be considered as an
   irreversible phenomenon. Taking this idea as a point of departure, we
   have decided to investigate not why France has acquired nuclear weapons
   but instead the reason for which she retains them. More specifically,
   our attention was directed to the years 1990-2000. During those years, a
   relatively important nuclear strategic debate occurred. It was an
   opportunity for strategists to reaffirm how useful the weapon is. Trough
   this debate, strategists described an uncertain international context
   that they consider unfit to question the relevance of the nuclear
   armament.},

Title = {Ethnoreligious Change in Northern Ireland and Zimbabwe: A Comparative
   Study of How Religious Havens Can Have Ethnic Significance},
Journal = {ETHNOPOLITICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {103-120},
Abstract = {This study compares the internal dynamics of religious change in the
   `post-evangelical' Ikon community in Belfast, Northern Ireland, and a
   charismatic, multiethnic congregation in Harare, Zimbabwe. Although the
   theological ideas behind Ikon and the congregation vary widely, the
   processes whereby both groups manage change are broadly similar and have
   wider theoretical significance. Accordingly, this article analyses how
   people use the religious resources of their traditions to construct
   `havens' in which change is facilitated. Havens are conceived of as safe
   spaces where people use religious resources to challenge ethnic
   boundaries and power structures. They can be seen to function as
   mechanisms for disrupting long-entrenched feedback patterns of
   opposition and conflict.},

Abstract = {The elevation of Lt-General Ian Khama to the presidency in April 2008
   brought an escalating emphasis on security. A Directorate of
   Intelligence and Security was operationalised under the aegis of the
   President, and a spate of extra-judicial killings followed. Khama
   simultaneously asserted his control over the ruling Botswana Democratic
   Party (BDP), despite the fact that a pro-democratic faction - Barata
   Phathi - emerged victorious at the BDP congress in Kanye in July 2009.
   In an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty, Khama aimed at 70 per cent of
   the vote in national elections in October 2009 but achieved just 53.4
   per cent. Evidence emerged in early 2010 indicating that Sir Ketumile
   Masire had been in the pocket of the De Beers corporation throughout his
   presidency, 1980-98, and that his indebtedness and De Beers' concerns
   over this had influenced the transition to Ian Khama. This suggested
   that diamond dependency and corruption were at the core of the autocracy
   and insecurity, and that together they characterised the debilitating
   premodernity in which the economy and society was trapped.},

Abstract = {Although the Hungarian revolution of 1956 ultimately shaped Austria's
   new identity as a uniquely neutral - yet not `spineless' - country that
   could now help other countries in need, it also unravelled the earlier
   Austrian rapprochement with Hungary and the USSR that had facilitated
   the signing of the Austrian State Treaty on 15 May 1955. The uprising
   and subsequent Soviet crackdown revived Austrians' fears and memories of
   their own occupation by the Soviet Union and three Western Allies,
   stymied diplomats in Budapest, and gave communist authorities an excuse
   to accuse Austria of violating its oath of neutrality, stressing the
   issues of espionage and anti-communist propaganda. The crisis arguably
   gave the Khrushchev leadership second thoughts about the wisdom of
   withdrawing Soviet troops from eastern Austria. To pass its first test
   of neutrality, the Austrian government conducted its foreign policy
   discreetly, striving neither to coddle nor to offend the communist world
   and the `free world'.},

Journal = {CAMBRIDGE REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {23},
Number = {2},
Pages = {259-280},
Abstract = {This paper explores the role of academic scholarship and practice in
   constituting, aggravating, and resolving the Israeli-Palestinian
   conflict. The first section of the paper examines how scholarly
   discourse and methods of analysis contribute to shaping
   (mis)understandings of on-the-ground conflict dynamics. To demonstrate
   this point, the paper first overviews conventional social science
   methods used in mainstream international relations (IR) scholarship that
   tend to reify, freeze and homogenize `the conflict' as well as conflict
   parties and then uses a different scholarly approachnamely a processual,
   peace-studies-oriented methodologythat provides a very different
   `picture' of the conflict, its parties and appropriate strategies of
   engagement in the pursuit of peace. The second section of the paper uses
   three brief case studies to demonstrate how Israeli and Palestinian
   academics help constitute `the conflict' and its parties not only
   through their scholarship but also through their `practice'. These
   examples also show the importance of re-evaluating analytical models to
   include contextual dynamics such as time, place and sources of available
   power as well as to recognize the diversity of Palestinian and Israeli
   views regarding the sources ofand best approaches for addressing'the
   conflict'.},

Abstract = {Observers argue that the business of news is responsible for worsening
   the coverage of terrorism, but exactly how economic considerations
   influence coverage is controversial. Based on an analysis of over 1600
   articles from The Washington Post and USA Today, we find that concerns
   about the effects of economic pressures on terrorism reporting are
   exaggerated. The business climate affects coverage, but the long-term
   impact of market pressures on coverage is modest. Articles about
   terrorist violence are increasingly prominent, but coverage of
   counterterrorism remains robust. Efforts to inoculate the press against
   the worst excesses of the market are unnecessary.},

Title = {From competition state to competition states?},
Journal = {POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {31},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {57-76},
Abstract = {The perceived global and demographic upheavals of the last 30 years have
   fuelled fierce debate as to whether many developed countries still have
   a welfare state, and if not, what they now have in its place. Such a
   controversial debate is marked by the most fragile consensus; advanced
   nations have begun to depart from the trajectories they followed during
   what has been termed the `golden age' of welfare states. The competition
   state thesis has featured prominently amongst the more pessimistic
   accounts of the modern welfare state. This extreme view of the
   relationship amongst globalisation, the welfare state and the nation
   state, suggests that the welfare state no longer exists, having been
   succeeded by the competition state. Such an assertion sat well with the
   `crisis literature' that surrounded the welfare state during the late
   twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. The privileged position held
   by the competition state thesis within this literature may owe much to a
   primarily theoretical body of work to date. This has left many questions
   unanswered, such as: can the competition state be measured? What does
   such measurement tell us about the competition state? And, is there more
   than one type of competition state? This article attempts to furnish the
   theoretical claims of the competition state thesis with data from a
   variety of sources, most notably the Organisation for Economic
   Co-operation and Development (OECD). This data has been used to index 25
   countries in terms of their `competition stateness' providing a fresh
   perspective with which to view the claims of the competition state
   thesis. This article represents the first, tentative steps towards fully
   operationalising and measuring the competition state and interestingly,
   uncovers two seemingly distinct forms of the competition state.},

Abstract = {Russian interest in the High North is not centred on its supposedly vast
   natural resources, which have been exaggerated and overhyped. Much more
   important are the strategic implications of climate change in the
   region. As regional ice retreats, a new frontline is emerging with which
   Kremlin strategists must contend. Potentially it will bring important
   new benefits to Russia, such as the logistical ability to move resources
   from east to west much more easily than before, but it will also open a
   gateway through which a hypothetical aggressor could attack the Russian
   mainland. The outside world needs to recognise these strategic
   implications of climate change and find ways of reassuring Russia.},

Pages = {299-317},
Abstract = {European policy-makers often speak of their efforts to `manage
   globalization'. We argue that the advocacy of managed globalization is
   more than a rhetorical device and indeed has been a primary driver of
   major European Union (EU) policies over the past 25 years. We sketch the
   outlines of the concept of managed globalization, raise broad questions
   about its extent, and describe five major mechanisms through which it
   has been pursued: (1) expanding policy scope; (2) exercising regulatory
   influence; (3) empowering international institutions; (4) enlarging the
   territorial sphere of EU influence; and (5) redistributing the costs of
   globalization. These mechanisms are neither entirely novel, nor are they
   necessarily effective, but they provide the contours of an approach to
   globalization that is neither ad hoc deregulation nor old-style economic
   protectionism.},

Title = {Toward an ecological political economy: accommodating nature in a new
   discourse of public philosophy and policy analysis},
Journal = {CRITICAL POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {4},
Number = {1},
Pages = {77-85},
Abstract = {The political economies of the contemporary world - most especially the
   advanced capitalist nation states - are on a collision course with
   natural limits, biodiversity conservation, and ecosystem health. If they
   undermine their own natural and biological foundations, they will erode
   their institutional and normative foundations as well. This paper
   discusses an agenda of critical theoretical and conceptual inquiry
   designed to address this conundrum that looms over our current modes of
   economic thinking. It considers two options: a discourse of economic
   adjustment to natural limits and a discourse of ecological
   accommodation. Behind the discourse of adjustment stands a narrative of
   human science and technology as a continuous process of adapting nature
   to human action rather than accommodating human action within the
   context of nature. Behind the discourse of accommodation stands a
   narrative of transition and discontinuity, which maintains that the
   technological and economic future will be different from the past, not
   simply in degree, but in kind. The paper discusses aspects of economics
   and democratic governance that require reconceptualization in the light
   of ecological limits, including the notions of fungibility of system
   functions, discounting, intergenerational equity, and external costs. It
   also discusses the question of the continuing viability of democratic
   governance systems to meet the requirements of ecological accommodation.
   Overall, the paper defends the thesis that by continuing to ignore
   fundamental aspects of the natural world upon which human economic
   activity draws, the management and governance of contemporary political
   economies will gradually erode the capacities to perform these functions
   and to fulfill these goals, and they will lose their social and ethical
   legitimacy.},

Abstract = {Examining core executive organization for EU affairs in Finland and
   Sweden, this article uncovers how change agents used European
   integration deliberately to strengthen their role in the domestic
   settings through taking control of EU policy co-ordination. In both
   countries, EU membership was an exogenous factor that enabled the
   offices of the PM to secure a more powerful position and advance their
   own institutional agendas. This strengthened their leadership role and
   weakened the respective foreign ministries, whose legitimacy in EU
   co-ordination was undermined by the discourse that matters pertaining to
   this co-ordination should be treated as domestic policy instead of
   foreign policy. This discourse proved instrumental in the organizational
   reforms and core executive restructuring. Both countries also provide
   evidence of intra-Nordic organizational learning since the Finnish
   co-ordination system was based on lessons drawn from Denmark whereas the
   subsequent Swedish reform was inspired and legitimized by changes in
   Finland.},

Abstract = {Beyond wide agreement that many areas of contemporary policy making are
   unintelligible if processes that transcend the boundaries of individual
   states are not taken into account, analysts often disagree on how
   various `global' and `local' factors interact to produce policies and
   policy outcomes. The disagreement stems in part from the use of
   different analytic lenses, and specifically from the choice between
   `state-centric' and `polycentric' lenses. This article examines the
   fundamental assumptions of these general perspectives with regard to the
   polity, politics and policy dimensions of global policy making, and
   surveys some of the research questions and findings that resulted from
   their use. It concludes that scholars and policy makers should treat the
   two analytical lenses as complementary, as each of them stimulates the
   analyst to ask questions and look for entities and causal connections
   that the other lens may miss.},

Abstract = {This article examines how the entry of former First World War veterans
   into the inter-war Hungarian parliament shaped the ideological
   tendencies of the parties represented in that institution. On the basis
   of research into the biographies of every MP elected to Hungary's
   parliament between 1920 and 1939, it considers whether the shifting
   proportions of veterans within the various parliamentary fractions and
   the parliament as a whole reflected and influenced the ideologies both
   of the groups they joined as well as of the wider parliament. It
   concludes that veterans were more strongly represented in the
   parliamentary fractions of rightist parties and that the dramatic
   increase of veterans into parliament during the 1930s coincided with a
   `turn to the Right' in Hungarian parliamentary politics. Overall, this
   study provides evidence that in Hungary, as elsewhere in Western Europe,
   First World War veterans were radicalised by their experiences in the
   war and gravitated towards more extremist parties and ideologies,
   especially the parties of the right.},

Abstract = {This article examines the proposal suggesting that policy designs are
   consistent with the social construction of target groups. Associated
   with policy design theory, the proposal pessimistically suggests that
   underprivileged citizens will be targeted with policies that do little
   to help them, creating a vicious circle of degenerative politics. This
   article argues that the prevalence of degenerative politics depends on
   policy styles. Significant where the adversarial style prevails,
   degenerative politics is less common in consensual systems. This
   proposal is examined through a systematic content analysis of action
   plans to reduce poverty in Newfoundland and Quebec.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to present and discuss the data for
   Portugal of the IntUne survey on elite attitudes towards European
   integration. Despite some differences between the Portuguese and the
   European results of the survey, we find that the concept of `compound
   citizenship' (M. Cotta, `A ocompoundo model of citizenship? European
   citizenship in the eyes of national elites', Lisbon IntUne General
   Assembly, 27-30 November 2008) may be applied to the perceptions of
   Portuguese elites regarding the European Union, and the postulated
   combination of an indirect European citizenship with a direct one is
   also verifiable in Portugal. We hypothesise that this European `compound
   citizenship' is not conflictive with national citizenship, possessing
   instead elements for strengthening the linkage between them.},

Abstract = {In these concluding remarks on authoritarian legacies and related
   politics in Southern Europe the definitions and dimensions of
   authoritarian legacies and politics of the past conclusions are
   recalled; the legacies and politics of the past are related to
   democratic quality and the influence of the former on the latter is
   assessed; the contextual dimensions influencing and conditioning the
   authoritarian legacies and the politics of the past in each country are
   also analysed; attitudes towards the past are reconsidered; and,
   finally, how the problem of the fading of legacies largely remains open
   is noted by elucidating some ironic aspects of the phenomena.},

Abstract = {The contest for the `soul' of oil and its revenues in Nigeria have

   and environmental polities in the Niger Delta. The contention revolves
   mainly around the interpretations ascribed to the current but
   unprecedented wave of violence in the region by the contending forces in
   oil and environmental politics. In the reading of militias' activities,
   there is a simultaneous convergence and divergence between the state and
   the oil majors. Both refuse to attribute rising violence to liberation
   struggles, as claimed by the militants. They, however, differ over the
   best tactical approach to the problem. The oil majors seem to prefer a
   more violent approach to taming the monster, which violence in the Niger
   Delta has become. This is in sharp contradiction to the states'
   preference for a relatively less violent approach. This `new'
   disposition of the state makes it all the more interesting, given the
   fact that the Nigerian state is notoriously reputed for its excesses in
   the Niger Delta over dissent. Overall, rising violence in the Niger
   Delta represents the continuation of the resource struggle by another
   means. Notable criminal tendencies became inevitable due to the
   insensitivity of the government and in order to sustain the struggle.},

Abstract = {Literature on democratisation claims that the dictatorship's police
   forces are difficult to reform and that modes of transition and
   authoritarian legacies are linked. It predicts that a continuous
   transition will leave greater legacies than a discontinuous one. This
   paper analyses the police reforms during democratisation in Spain and
   Portugal, comparing them in several dimensions: symbolic changes,
   demilitarisation, decentralisation, accountability, professionalisation
   and new service role. In both countries a democratic police was built;
   yet, contrary to predictions, the Spanish police underwent a faster and
   deeper reform than the Portuguese, a result explained by the double
   legacy of dictatorship and revolution in the Portuguese transition, the
   credibility dilemmas of the Spanish reformers and the impact of regional
   devolution.},

Abstract = {Framing separatism as terrorism presents numerous opportunities for
   governments facing ethno-nationalist challenges. Namely, such framing
   allows states to avoid addressing the ethno-nationalist roots of
   separatist conflicts. This article analyzes incentives and opportunities
   that terrorism presents for states involved in ethno-nationalist
   separatist conflicts. The article investigates how the framing dynamics
   proved to be successful in the cases of the Kurdish and Chechen
   separatist conflicts. The case of Kosovo is examined as illustrative of
   a different outcome: the international presence in the Kosovo conflict
   made it substantially different from the previous cases and served as an
   intervention in the Serbian framing dynamics.},

Abstract = {The history and identity of fundamentalism is complex. Religious
   fundamentalism names an ideological perspective found in most, if not
   all, major religions and is currently associated with variant forms of
   extremism and religiously-motivated acts of violence, including
   terrorism. Following a discussion of religious extremism per se, a
   typological paradigm of religious fundamentalism that attempts to
   demonstrate the ideological development from what might be referred to
   as an oinitialo and relatively benign fundamentalism into extremism and
   thence to terrorism, will be presented. A discussion of a model of
   fundamentalism as applied to Islam will provide a comparative basis for
   assessing Christian fundamentalism and extremism, so setting the scene
   for an applied exploration of religious extremism and terrorism with
   particular reference to Christian contexts and examples.},

Title = {What are Cultural Rights? Protecting Groups With Individual Rights},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {65-80},
Abstract = {This article explores the notion of cultural rights and argues for a
   particular way of conceiving of them. Cultural rights are mentioned in
   several international human rights covenants and declarations but these
   do not provide a detailed conception of what cultural rights are. It is
   argued that the best way to protect cultural groups is by conceiving of
   cultural rights as primarily individual rights and using this
   determination as the key to balancing between the interests of
   individuals and groups when working to protect culture. The protection
   of culture entails safeguarding an individual's ability to form, to
   maintain, to reinterpret, and even to leave a cultural group. The
   protection of the traditions and institutions that are the expressions
   of a culture is secondary to this goal. By making individual autonomy
   the center of the preservation of culture, it is possible to avoid the
   risks associated with reifying culture and possibly preventing it from
   evolving naturally.
   This argument will proceed in three parts. First, the use of the term
   ``cultural right{''} in international human rights documents will be
   discussed. Second, some of the key concepts underlying cultural rights
   will be examined, including the meaning of culture and the distinction
   between individual and group rights. Finally, the conceptual and
   substantive meaning of cultural rights will be considered and discussed.},

Volume = {38},

Pages = {515-535},
Abstract = {The open, multilevel nature of U.S. policymaking enables interest group
   activity throughout the policy process. At policy implementation, groups
   attempt to secure benefits or ameliorate legislated effects by devising
   cooperative or conflictual strategies to influence outcomes, especially
   when agency officials have discretion to design rules and negotiate
   agreements. Investigating group ``street-level{''} activity with respect
   to the Endangered Species Act, this research finds that policy context
   and resources shape the degree of information and access available to
   groups, which influences the strategies groups adopt. Groups with access
   and specialized information will attempt to change or influence policy
   outcomes cooperatively. Groups with limited technical information are
   more likely to fight implementation.},

Abstract = {China's entry into the Korean War, together with the involvement of the
   Soviet Air Force, constituted not only the base of Chinese and Soviet
   joint assistance to North Korea but also the formation of the
   Sino-Soviet-North Korean triangular alliance. Recently declassified
   Russian Defense Ministry archives show that Stalin wavered on
   dispatching the Soviet Air Force for fear of a direct confrontation with
   the US/UN forces. It was 12 days after Chinese troops entered the war
   that Stalin finally allowed the Soviet Air Force to provide air cover.
   New documents that shed light on this enormously significant historical
   process demonstrate that the Sino-Soviet-North Korean triangular
   relationship was extremely delicate and weak.},

Title = {Single market, global competition: regulating the European market in a
   global economy},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {17},
Number = {7},
Pages = {936-953},
Abstract = {Development of Europe's single market induces a range of regulatory
   measures to help the market function effectively and meet policy goals.
   However, the European market is nested inside a global economy; some
   rules designed to perfect the single market may generate competitive
   disadvantages as producers interact outside the European market. How
   does the EU address this tension? Examining cases of chemicals
   regulation, the single market in public procurement, and regulation of
   end-of-life vehicles recycling, this contribution identifies three
   mechanisms: regulatory accommodation; compliance deficits; and
   international uploading of EU regulation. The first involves revisions
   of proposed regulation following objections from organized business
   interests; the second entails temporary European Commission toleration
   of non-compliance; and the third consists of efforts to establish global
   regulation coinciding with single market rules. The distribution of
   these mechanisms varies across sectors and over time, but reconciliation
   measures are politically essential to the continued construction of the
   single market in a global economy.},

Abstract = {Revolutionary advances in the life sciences are poised to have a
   transformative global impact. However, today's cutting-edge
   life-sciences techniques, knowledge, materials and equipment can also be
   deliberately or inadvertently misapplied, with potentially catastrophic
   effects. Several recent experiments have sparked debate over the need
   for stepped-up oversight of life-sciences research. With varying degrees
   of success, in advance of regulatory requirements industries and
   professional associations have acted to address societal concerns about
   various products and to police the conduct of practitioners of select
   disciplines. Life-sciences communities are currently coming to grips
   with how to respond to the potential for the deliberate misuse of their
   know-how, technology, materials and equipment.},

Abstract = {This article comprises a reply to those who seek to use the British
   historical experience in Afghanistan in order to draw parallels with
   current operations in that country. It argues that, while the conceptual
   and physical response to the issue of Afghanistan on the part of Empire
   policy-makers during the period 1839-1919 was characterised by periods
   of indecision and mistaken assumptions, their grasp of strategic
   principles allowed the formulation of a series of Afghan policies that
   would serve to protect and indeed enhance British interests in the
   region for over a century and which stand in stark contrast to the
   seemingly incoherent Afghan strategy articulated by the current British
   government.},

Volume = {19},

Pages = {449-467},
Abstract = {Since 2007 France has been systematically renovating government policy
   under the banner of sustainable development. This process, called the
   Grenelle de l'environnement, extends the official role given to
   environmental associations in certain of the State's advisory bodies.
   The institutional roots of the Grenelle are located in various
   precedents for consultative environmental practice in French
   administration. The role of Nicolas Hulot's 2006 ecological pact in
   making democratised environmental policy a higher presidential priority
   is then reviewed. At a procedural level, the Grenelle is shown to take
   France's meso-corporatist practices in the direction of deliberative
   democracy. Its newly adopted Energy-Climate tax shows how environmental
   groups can use discursive power to shape environmental legislation.},

Abstract = {We argue that international organizations decrease the duration of
   international conflicts by mitigating commitment problems and
   encouraging combatants to cease hostilities more quickly. Empirical
   analyses of militarized interstate dispute duration (1950-2000) reveal
   that increasing shared international organization (IO) participation
   reduces the length of disputes, even after accounting for selection into
   international conflict. We also find that international organizations
   designed to mitigate commitment problems decrease dispute duration,
   while IOs capable of reducing information asymmetries do not influence
   dispute length.},

Abstract = {This article examines the relationship between social justice norms and
   the perceived legitimacy of the social stratification system in the
   Czech Republic. Despite the fact that meritocratic values have remained
   the dominant part of ideology in the Czech Republic throughout the
   transformation process, those values have played only a very minor role
   in fostering evaluations of system legitimacy, such as perceptions of
   system closure and widespread inequality. This article argues that
   perceived corruption is the key factor that negatively mediates the
   relationship between norms of distributive justice and beliefs about
   social legitimacy, and ultimately plays a major role in reducing the
   legitimacy of the social stratification system. The main analysis uses a
   structural equation model based on Czech data from the ISSP Role of
   Government Survey in 2006. The evidence lends support to the path
   dependency view of the social transformation process, according to which
   rampant corruption, which was a core legacy of the market transformation
   process, continues to shape system legitimacy even in the face of
   relative economic prosperity of the mid 2000s. (C) 2010 Published by

Abstract = {One contemporary issue confronting global finance is the nature and
   extent of its participation in and contribution to a global war on
   terror. To date, efforts have involved a variety of methods, including
   both an increase in the surveillance of financial transactions and the
   regulation of previously unregulated methods of financial exchange. This
   paper offers a conceptualisation of one informal value transfer method
   (known by its Arabic name - hawala) in the form of a rhizome, using the
   concept as developed by Deleuze and Guattari in A Thousand Plateaus.
   This paper argues that the ability of hawala to regenerate itself along
   multiple paths situates the procedure as a rhizome, and that standard
   methods for financial regulation fail to appreciate the crucial
   difference this regenerative ability makes for attempts at control and
   regulation. Consequently, the activity that the state is seeking to
   control will merely be displaced, to reform and regenerate itself yet
   again. To ground this argument in the present condition of the global
   political economy, the specific example considered is Al Barakaat, a
   transnational Somali firm that fell victim to the global war on terror
   in late 2001. Journal of International Relations and Development (2010)

Title = {Transitional justice in the world, 1970-2007: Insights from a new

Abstract = {This article presents a new dataset of transitional justice mechanisms
   utilized worldwide from 1970-2007. These data complement the growing
   body of quantitative and comparative analyses of transitional justice.
   This article summarizes three important contributions made by the
   dataset. First, it includes five transitional justice mechanisms
   (trials, truth commissions, amnesties, reparations, and lustration
   policies), allowing scholars to avoid many of the methodological errors
   committed by performing single-mechanism studies. Second, it provides an
   expanded sample, both temporally and geographically, to facilitate
   greater comparative and policy impact. Third, the dataset enables
   scholars to analyze transitional justice across a variety of political
   contexts, including democratic transitions and civil wars. These data
   illuminate a new set of general trends and patterns in the
   implementation of transitional justice worldwide. The findings show that
   countries adopt amnesties more often than other mechanisms. They
   predominantly grant them in the context of civil war and to opponents of
   the state, rather than state agents. Courts rarely prosecute those
   currently in power for human rights violations. In civil war settings,
   rebels, rather than state actors, face trials. In post-authoritarian
   settings, courts try former authoritarian actors, but do not address
   crimes committed by the opposition to authoritarian rule. The dataset
   also reveals regional patterns of mechanism usage. Trials, lustration
   policies, and reparations occur most often in Europe. Non-European
   countries more frequently adopt truth commissions and amnesties than do
   their European counterparts, with a particularly high number of
   amnesties granted in Latin America.},

Title = {VARIETIES OF ELECTIONEERING Success Contagion and Presidential Campaigns
   in Latin America},
Journal = {WORLD POLITICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {62},
Number = {4},
Pages = {636+},

Abstract = {Existing theories of change in campaign strategies predict
   cross-national convergence in candidates' linkages to voters and the
   degree of policy focus and cleavage priming in their appeals. However,
   the prevailing national patterns of electioneering in Chile, Brazil, and
   Peru have actually diverged from one another since their transitions
   from authoritarian rule. Based upon content analysis of television
   advertising, interviews with campaign staff, and case studies of
   specific elections in these three countries, this article develops a
   theory of success contagion that can explain the evolution of
   presidential campaign strategy in third-wave democracies. The author
   argues that the first politician to combine a victorious campaign with a
   successful term as president establishes a model of electioneering that
   candidates across the ideological spectrum are likely to adopt in the
   future. Such contagion can occur directly, through politicians'
   imitation of each other's strategies, or indirectly, with communities of
   campaign professionals playing an intermediary role. Strategic
   convergence is less likely in cases of repeatedly poor governing
   performance. Instead, candidates tend to choose strategies through an
   inward-oriented process of reacting against previous errors. Initial
   testing suggests the theory is generalizable to other new democracies
   with at least moderate organizational continuity across elections.},

Abstract = {Empirical research is crucial for understanding the personality
   foundations of political preferences in modern democracies. However, few
   studies have addressed the personality of top politicians using standard
   methods to assess basic traits and personal values. In the current
   research, traits and values of 106 female members of the Italian
   Parliament were assessed in accordance with the Five-Factor Model of
   personality and Schwartz's taxonomy. The same variables were measured in
   a sample of 864 voters taken from the general population. We investigate
   the extent to which differences in traits and values contribute to
   ideological orientation of politicians and voters of rival coalitions. A
   similar pattern of relations was found in both groups. Yet, traits and
   values contributed to partisanship of politicians much more than to
   political preferences of voters. Whereas values fully mediated the
   contribution of traits to voting, energy/extraversion and agreeableness
   contributed to political partisanship both directly and indirectly,
   through values.},

Abstract = {This article considers how civil society can bring about local-level
   democratic change when national political systems remain authoritarian.
   Existing literature has tended to focus on democratic characteristics of
   civil society that reinforce political democratisation. A close reading
   of the literature on sub-Saharan Africa, along with a Cameroonian case
   study, illustrates how a civic association can provide opportunities for
   democratic change by emphasising accountability. This article addresses
   an important gap in the literature by showing where democratisation
   opportunities may be limited to the local level but can still improve
   citizens' quality of life.},

Abstract = {Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) has been conceptualized and measured
   as a unidimensional personality construct comprising the covariation of
   the three traits of authoritarian submission, authoritarian aggression,
   and conventionalism. However, new approaches have criticized this
   conceptualization and instead viewed these three ``traits{''} as three
   distinct, though related, social attitude dimensions. Here we extend
   this approach providing clear definitions of these three dimensions as
   ideological attitude constructs of Authoritarianism, Conservatism, and
   Traditionalism. These dimensions are seen as attitudinal expressions of
   basic social values or motivational goals that represent different,
   though related, strategies for attaining collective security at the
   expense of individual autonomy. We report data from five samples and
   three different countries showing that these three dimensions could be
   reliably measured and were factorially distinct. The three dimensions
   also differentially predicted interpersonal behaviour, social policy
   support, and political party support. It is argued that conceptualizing
   and measuring RWA as a set of three related ideological attitude
   dimensions may better explain complex sociopolitical phenomena than the
   currently dominant unidimensional personality based model.},

   Organizations: Distinctions Due to Institutional and Political

Abstract = {Academics and journalists have depicted government bureaucracies as
   particularly subject to administrative constraints, including the
   infamous red tape and personnel rules that sharply constrain pay,
   promotion, and dismissal and weaken their relations to performance.
   Research on these topics has often focused on public organizations alone
   or on comparisons of public and private organizations. The analysis
   reported here extends this research to include nonprofit organizations.
   Certain theoretical perspectives would predict sharp differences between
   public and nonprofit organizations, whereas others would predict no
   differences. Using survey data from managerial-level respondents in
   state government and nonprofit organizations in Georgia and Illinois,
   this analysis compares perceptions of red tape and personnel rule
   constraints in public and nonprofit organizations. We investigate
   whether or not public and nonprofit respondents differ in their
   perceptions about levels of organizational red tape and about whether
   formal rules enable or constrain managers in promoting and rewarding
   good employees and removing poor performers. The results indicate sharp
   public and nonprofit differences, with public managers reporting higher
   perceived organizational red tape and lower levels of personnel
   flexibility. In addition to public and nonprofit comparisons, the
   analysis takes into account other factors that might influence public
   and nonprofit managers' perceptions of red tape and personnel
   flexibility in their organizations, including individual motivations to
   choose the job, the respondent's state (Georgia or Illinois), and
   others.},

Abstract = {The presence of women in the United States science and technology
   professoriate depends on various factors, including the availability of
   a pool of qualified women with relevant doctorates and the elimination
   of policy constraints and institutional barriers to professional access.
   Recognizing that initial hiring in related science, technology,
   engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields is a crucial step affecting
   gender composition and representation at all levels in the academic
   hierarchy, we focus on hiring profiles in institutions of higher
   learning to examine related trends and practices. In addition to the
   significant and inversely proportional influence of initial hiring on
   future trends, differences were noted relative to public or private
   control of the university and other institutional characteristics,
   providing a basis for further analyses of institutional dynamics
   restricting or enhancing favorable hiring policies and practices for
   STEM women faculty.},

Abstract = {This article examines the relationship between public administration
   regimes and market economy models in 20 member countries from the
   Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Building
   on Pollitt and Bouckaert's (2004) description of politico-administrative
   regimes, we compile a data set of cross-national public administration
   indicators to explore public employment and politico-administrative
   regulation. Our explorative statistical analysis identifies three
   distinct public administration regimes: an Anglo-American, a
   French/German and a Scandinavian regime. The Anglo-American and
   French/German regimes show, especially with regard to public employment
   regulation, a high degree of institutional coherence with the
   co-ordination rules applying to the market economy. Findings for the
   Scandinavian administration regime do not support the institutional
   coherence argument, which leads us to conclude that the legal origin of
   a country may play an important role in linking and synchronizing the
   mode of regulation in the public and private spheres of the political
   economy.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses the problems of the new peripheral regions after the
   European Union enlargement. The last EU enlargements in 2004 and 2007
   were the logical consequences of political, social and economic changes
   associated with the break-up of the Soviet Union and the disintegration
   of the Communist Bloc. These two enlargements led to substantial
   geopolitical consequences. The European Union's demographic and
   territorial potential increased by around one-third. At the same time,
   the European Union structures moved east and southwards. In 2004, one of
   the Polish regions, the Warmia and Mazury region, faced some new
   challenges associated with the Polish accession to the EU. The years of
   Poland's membership in the European Union have been a period of gaining
   experience in submitting EU projects for the region, and in allocating
   financial resources properly. The total effect of this period is rather
   positive. However, we must not forget that many negative economic and
   social phenomena still occur (e.g., a high unemployment rate, emigration
   of young educated people, etc.). Politically, a new challenge for the
   Warmia and Mazury region is going to be a continuation and development
   of the cross-border cooperation with the Kaliningrad region. Poland's
   accession to the EU has had no positive impact on improving the
   Polish-Russian relations at the central decision-making level.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION},

Abstract = {Analyses of monetary policy posit that exchange-rate pegs, inflation
   targets, and central bank independence can help anchor private-sector
   inflation expectations. Yet there are few direct tests of this argument.
   We offer cross-national, micro-level evidence on the effectiveness of
   monetary anchors in controlling private-sector inflation concerns. Using
   firm-level data from eighty-one countries (approximately 10,000 firms),
   we find evidence that ``international{''} anchors (exchange-rate
   commitments) correlate significantly with a substantial reduction in
   private-sector concerns about inflation while ``domestic{''} anchors
   (inflation targeting and central bank independence) do not. Our
   conjecture is that private-sector inflation expectations are more
   responsive to exchange-rate anchors because they are more transparent,
   more constraining, and more costly than domestic anchoring arrangements.},

Abstract = {The remarkable increase in European security and defence integration in
   the past decade has presented a challenge to traditional integration
   theories. Although they remain relevant, these theories fail to take
   full account of the changing security architecture of Europe, which
   includes the rise of transgovernmental networks (TGNs). With a focus on
   EU civil protection, this article critically examines established
   definitions of TGNs and investigates how these networks influence the
   supranational and national levels of security cooperation. Findings
   point toward the emergence of an alternative form of European security
   governance that addresses the lack of authority in EU security policy.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to explore government preferences and cleavages in the
   bargaining process on the European Constitution, across the range of 25
   EU member states. The study focuses on preferences concerning
   socioeconomic policymaking and explores whether divisions can be
   discerned between preferences held by actors according to locations on
   the left-right policy scale, actors in older as compared to newer EU
   states, net EU budget positions, domestic rates of support for European
   integration, and smaller as compared to larger states. The analysis also
   controls for possible external effects, such as recent domestic
   macroeconomic developments. Negotiations on the European Constitution
   are found to be determined less by general transnational left-right
   divisions, but cleavages according to the length of EU membership and
   the size of EU member states.},

Title = {Democracy and Conceptual Contestability: Reconsidering Conceptions of
   Democracy in Democracy Promotion},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {12},
Number = {3},
Pages = {362-386},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Democracy is a deeply contested concept: historically, complex debates
   have revolved around the meaning of democracy and the plausibility of
   different `models of democracy.' However, democracy's conceptual
   contestability has received diminished attention in the post-Cold War
   democracy promotion debate as the attention of democracy promotion
   actors and scholars has turned to fine-tuning of policies through which
   a liberal democratic model can be successfully encouraged. It is argued
   here that the focus on the extension of the reach of the liberal
   democratic mode of governance has resulted in a conceptually
   impoverished appreciation of the multiple meanings that the idea of
   democracy can take. It is argued that the `essential contestability' of
   the idea of democracy is not adequately recognized and tackled, which in
   turn has important effects for the ability of democracy promotion
   scholars, as well as practitioners, to take into account the
   consequences that considering alternative (non-or extra-liberal) models
   of democracy might have for democracy promotion. To move the debate
   forward, I explore here, primarily in conceptual and theoretical terms,
   what serious engagement with the essential contestability of democracy
   might mean for democracy promotion. I argue that it entails a two-fold
   move: `pluralization' and `contextualization' of the conceptions of
   democracy. The latter part of the article examines in detail the reasons
   that might exist for considering such a move in framing the study and
   the practice of democracy promotion, as well as the potential dangers
   that might be involved.},

Abstract = {It is widely acknowledged that the involvement of small farmers into
   markets can contribute to higher productivity and income growth, which
   in turn can enhance food security, poverty reduction efforts, and
   overall economic growth. In Africa, as in other parts of the developing
   world, agricultural production systems and their participants face
   significant challenges as a result of changing economic, environmental,
   and sociopolitical context. New dynamics in the global agricultural
   economy, such as the growth of supermarkets, are providing smallholders
   with both the new opportunities and new constraints to participate in
   and benefit from market exchanges. Collective action in the form of
   producer groups can enable African smallholders to take advantage of the
   new value chains and deal with existing market imperfections. However,
   certain conditions must be in place to create and sustain incentives for
   farmers to organize around marketing. Experiences from collective action
   in natural resource management (NRM) have shown that the types of
   markets and products, characteristics of user groups, institutional
   arrangements, and external environment need to be considered in order to
   determine the effectiveness and sustainability of collective marketing
   for smallholders. This paper applies the lessons from collective action
   in NRM to marketing, using existing case studies of producer groups in
   Africa, and offers policy recommendations on the factors that contribute
   to the success of collective marketing efforts.},

Abstract = {This paper attempts to understand the Sino-Mideast relations in terms of
   energy cooperation and the subsequent cooperation in the areas of trade
   and arms sales. It also examines the political economy of China's energy
   policy toward the Middle East. The paper argues that the objective of
   China's engagement in the Middle East is energy security rather than
   undermining the United States' interests in the region. Contrary to
   realist assumptions, China is utilizing the existing Western
   institutions to achieve its goals in the region, a step highly welcomed
   and encouraged by Middle Eastern states. The paper attempts to develop a
   tridimensional and triangular approach to the political economy of the
   region in relation to the rapid pace of China's involvement in the
   Middle East. Such involvement is generating substantial intellectual
   interests and anxiety among major players in the region in terms of its
   nature, goals and mechanisms. In so doing, China maintains a balance in
   its relations with protagonists in the region and skillfully navigates
   its national interest in the region.},

Volume = {20},
Number = {3},
Pages = {577-600},

Abstract = {This article aims to explain cross-country variations in a paradigmatic
   element of the new public management reforms: the shift from low-powered
   incentives (i.e., flat salaries) to high-powered ones (i.e.,
   performance-related pay {[}PRP] systems). It presents a theoretical
   model based on insights developed for understanding the success of
   performance-related incentives in the private sector. Economic
   literature has underlined the need for a system of separation of
   interests within firms to make promises on incentives credible. The
   interests of those who benefit from the incentives (e.g., owners) must
   be relatively different from the interests of those who manage the
   incentive system (e.g., managers). Similarly, this article argues that
   incentives in the public sector are more likely to be implemented in
   those administrations in which there is a relative separation between
   those who benefit from the incentives (e.g., politicians) and those who
   manage the incentive system (e.g., senior civil servants). Where the
   interests of both groups overlap (e.g., the careers of senior officials
   and politicians are intertwined), incentives will be less credible and
   thus less likely. A quantitative analysis for 25 Organization for
   Economic Co-operation and Development countries confirms that PRP is
   significantly more used in contexts with clear separation of interests
   between politicians and senior civil servants.},

Abstract = {The authors analyse newly collected time-series data measuring the
   dimensions of violent political conflict in Egypt. Attention is focused
   on the interaction between politically motivated attacks by Islamists
   and the counter-insurgency measures used by the Egyptian government.
   Both insurgency and counter-insurgency are multidimensional. Insurgency
   includes attacks on tourists, on Egyptian civilians and on security
   forces. Counter-insurgency includes arrests and attacks on militants. To
   some extent, the dynamics of insurgency and counter-insurgency can be
   described by two distinct cycles of violence: one related to highly
   politicized activities on both sides, and another related to less
   explicitly political activities. However, the two cycles are
   inter-related, leading to complex and asymmetric dynamics in the
   relationships between the different dimensions of the conflict. The
   authors find that the combination of political repression and military
   counter-insurgency measures employed by the Egyptian government has the
   potential to exacerbate rather than reduce political violence. On the
   other hand, the overall level of conflict intensity in Egypt can be
   mitigated by food subsidies. Finally, the existence of significant
   spillovers from upsurges in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict shows the
   regional importance of reaching a Middle East peace agreement.},

Abstract = {This article examines the renewal of public policy via instrumental
   innovation since the adoption in France of an automated sequence of
   detection and sanctioning of speed limit violations. Involved here is an
   instrument of public policy that points up the changes that have taken
   place in recent years in respect of road safety policy and provides a
   clearer view of some aspects of ongoing state reorganization. The change
   in public policy permitted by this instrumentation results from an
   increasingly close focus on the road hazard issue, which has allowed
   specialists from different epistemic fields to advocate a system used in
   other countries for over a decade now. However, this success with
   policymakers is also explained by the fact that the new system involves
   the return of the state as the core shaper of this public policy, after
   20 years of emphasis on local and partnership-based policies.},

Journal = {REVIEW OF POLICY RESEARCH},

Abstract = {The globalization of science is demonstrated in the mobility of
   scientists across national boundaries, the composition of the U.S.
   scientific workforce, and increased collaboration across national
   boundaries. While studies based on bibliometric and other data have been
   useful in identifying trends, collaborative clusters, and other patterns
   in international collaboration, they do not reveal the social dynamics
   behind those collaborations. This paper addresses the human and social
   capital factors that explain whether or not an academic researcher in
   science and engineering has an international collaborator. Further,
   through detailed statistical models, the analysis also addresses the
   factors that differentiate the specific resources derived from those
   international ties. Results show that non-U.S. citizens are more likely
   to have close international collaborators, but that a range of factors
   explain this relationship. Further, results show that U.S. academic
   faculty mobilize different collaborative resources from international
   collaborators, versus their domestic collaborators.},

Abstract = {Most Realists today oppose far-reaching global reform on the grounds
   that it represents unrealistic and potentially irresponsible
   `utopianism'. An earlier generation of mid-century Realists, however,
   not only supported serious efforts at radical international reform but
   also developed a theoretically impressive model for how to bring it
   about. They considered the possibility of post-national political orders
   and ultimately a world state as desirable long-term goals, but only if
   reformers could simultaneously generate the thick societal background
   (or what they called `supranational society') required by any viable
   order `beyond the nation state'. As they fail to engage constructively
   with proposals for global reform, present-day Realists betray their own
   intellectual tradition. By reconsidering the subterranean legacy of
   Realist reformism as advanced by mid-century international thinkers
   (e.g. E. H. Carr, John Herz, Hans Morgenthau, Reinhold Niebuhr, and
   Frederick Schuman), the essay provides a revisionist reading of the
   history of twentieth-century international theory, while also
   highlighting its significance for ongoing debates about global reform.},

Abstract = {Recent research on violence against civilians during wars has emphasized
   war-related factors (such as territorial control or the characteristics
   of armed groups) over political ones (such as ideological polarization
   or prewar political competition). Having distinguished between irregular
   and conventional civil wars and between direct and indirect violence, I
   theorize on the determinants of direct violence in conventional civil
   wars. I introduce a new data set of all 1,062 municipalities of
   Catalonia during the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) and I show that the
   degree of direct violence against civilians at the municipal level goes
   up where prewar electoral competition between rival political factions
   approaches parity. I also show that, following the first round of
   violence, war-related factors gain explanatory relevance. In particular,
   there is a clear endogenous trend whereby subsequent levels of violence
   are highly correlated with initial levels of violence. In short, the
   paper demonstrates that an understanding of the determinants of violence
   requires a theory combining the effect of political cleavages and
   wartime dynamics.},

Abstract = {In this article, the concept Normative Europeanization is developed from
   a synthesis of Normative Power Europe (NPE) and Europeanization. It is
   argued that NPE has focused too narrowly on the external relations of
   the European Union (EU), while Europeanization has focused on changes in
   policy structures. The synthesis developed here overcomes these
   shortcomings by emphasizing normative internal relations within the EU.
   Normative Europeanization is defined as a top-down process based on the
   logic of appropriateness, where states with a close relationship to the
   EU, i.e. candidate and member states, develop a commitment to a European
   centre and their normative point of departure is changed. It is argued
   here that a process of normative Europeanization affects candidate
   countries and new EU members especially where pro-European norms are
   diffused through different mechanisms. The theoretical argument is
   illustrated through a case study on Swedish foreign policy reorientation
   during the 1990s. The empirical analysis is structured around two ideal
   types: internationalist foreign policy and normatively Europeanized
   foreign policy. Based on this analysis, it is concluded that Swedish
   foreign policy has undergone strong normative Europeanization.},

Abstract = {The transition from an Industrial Society to a Knowledge Society implies
   that organizations and citizens can improve their performance and
   quality of life by using Information and Communication Tecnologies (ICT)
   in different ways. In the case of public administration, it must begin a
   process of dynamic and continuous change based on civil servants'
   training to keep their knowledge, skills and values updated.
   The purpose of this article is twofold. On the one hand, it shows the
   key e-competencies required to be an excellent civil servant. On the
   other hand, the paper evaluates the extent that Latin American public
   administration officials are using ICT as a tool to promote the
   development of competencies, to manage knowledge that exists in their
   organizations, and to carry on strategic planning of training.
   The main conclusion of this document is that the technology use itself
   does not guarantee learning and that a combination of actions needs to
   be considered. Firstly, implementing e-learning programs requires
   actions to reduce the digital breach and attaining a high level of
   professionalism in the use and design of Web 2.0 tools. Secondly,
   designing e-activities to increase learning-to-learn competencies. And,
   thirdly, transforming the environment of work into learning
   organizations.},

Abstract = {What is the relationship between international cooperation and the
   success of economic sanctions? Although it is commonly assumed that
   international cooperation is an important condition for the
   effectiveness of sanctions, empirical results have been mixed. We focus
   on the role of the sanctioned country's major trading partners and
   develop a theoretical model that shows how their actions can affect the
   probability of sanctions success by raising or decreasing resistance
   costs to the sanctioned country. We then derive hypotheses from the
   theoretical model and test them using fully structural estimation. The
   empirical results lend support to the theoretical expectation that the
   sanctioner is more likely to succeed if it has the support of the
   sanctioned country's major trading partners. We also find that
   international cooperation may be less crucial if sanctions are imposed
   by the sanctioned country's main trading partner because such sanctions
   have a higher probability of success.},

Abstract = {High oil prices and impressive economic performance in emerging markets
   have led to the accumulation of massive financial assets. These nations
   have created sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) to manage their growing
   assets. SWFs have provided significant liquidity to American and
   European financial institutions. The rise of SWFs in number and size has
   raised concern about their objectives and strategies. This study
   examines the role these state-owned funds play in the global markets and
   the efforts to regulate their activities. I argue that capital exporting
   and importing nations share common interests and reciprocal
   responsibility in ensuring global financial prosperity.},

Volume = {24},

Abstract = {This article, unlike the vast existing literature on political trust,
   focuses on trust in post-socialist countries and, more specifically, on
   trust of young people rather than on trust of general populations.
   Studying young people is important in the context of establishing
   democracy and the survival of democracy. The authors examine the
   continuous effect of socialism and stipulate that the legacy of the type
   of socialist regime is a major determinant of political trust in Central
   and Eastern European and former Soviet Union countries. Utilizing
   individual-level data from an institutional survey, the authors find
   that distinguishing between different types of socialism is instrumental
   in explaining political trust. Results on the former Yugoslavia,
   however, suggest that the effects of socialism might be temporarily
   overshadowed in the short run by drastic post-socialist events such as
   warfare. The findings have implications for policies aimed at fostering
   political trust in post-socialist countries and for discerning future
   patterns of political and social developments.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION},

Volume = {54},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {214-236},

Abstract = {This article utilizes Bayesian Poisson changepoint regression models to
   demonstrate how transnational terrorists adjusted their target choices
   in response to target hardening. In addition, changes in the collective
   tastes of terrorists and their sponsorship have played a role in target
   selection over time. For each of four target types officials, military,
   business, and private parties the authors identify the number of regimes
   and the probable predictors of the events. Regime changes are tied to
   the rise of modern transnational terrorism, the deployment of
   technological barriers, the start of state sponsorship, and the
   dominance of the fundamentalists. The authors also include two sets of
   covariates-logistical outcome and victim's nature to better explain the
   dynamics. As other targets have been fortified and terrorists have
   sought greater carnage, private parties have become the preferred target
   type. In recent years, terrorists have increasingly favored people over
   property for all target types. Moreover, authorities have been more
   successful at stopping attacks against officials and the military,
   thereby motivating terrorists to attack business targets and private
   parties.},

Abstract = {Central policies that are only loosely specified might be expected to
   result in local variations in interpretation and implementation, and
   practice-based commissioning in the English National Health Service
   (NHS) is no exception. We show how local `sensemaking' in relation to
   this policy has been influenced by local histories and by conceptual
   schemata derived from earlier reorganisations of the NHS. Changes to
   organisational formalities do not necessarily, therefore, result in
   reappraisals of sensemaking on the part of local actors. We also employ
   our data to address issues raised by commentators critical of the way
   the concept of sensemaking has been previously employed.},

Abstract = {This paper considers the effects of fiscal governance in Central and
   East European countries 1998-2008. The first part makes predictions
   about which form of fiscal governance fits which form of government.
   Under multi-party coalition governments, fiscal contracts where
   governments make political commitments to multi-annual fiscal plans work
   well. In countries where two political blocks face off against one
   another, delegation based around a strong finance ministry should be
   most effective. The second part examines electoral and party systems,
   which affect the form of government in place. The third part documents
   norms, rules, and institutions in place. The final section considers the
   joint effects of fiscal governance on fiscal outcomes. On balance, the
   underlying political climate is crucial for determining what types of
   fiscal norms, institutions, and rules function best. The more countries
   diverge from their expected form of fiscal governance, the greater the
   increase in a country's debt burden.},

Abstract = {This article explores the history of elections by secret ballot in Sudan
   since the 1950s, and considers what lessons this history may offer in
   the run-up to the national elections planned under the Comprehensive
   Peace Agreement. The article locates the repeated use of the secret
   ballot in Sudan in the context of a wider state-directed project of
   modernity, for which the secret ballot offers a performative enactment
   of the relationship between an efficient state and a disciplined
   citizenry. The article therefore focuses on the actual procedure of
   elections, rather than on high politics, and it argues that despite a
   formal insistence on consistent procedure, practice often deviated from
   the supposed rules. While in some cases such deviations were driven by
   political manipulation, they were at other times simply the result of a
   lack of resources; such deviations were covered up by officials who were
   well aware of the immense value placed on the performance of the secret
   ballot. It seems likely that the coming elections will see similar
   problems and deviations from the rules, and that the elections are
   unlikely to achieve the intended aim of developing a more inclusive
   political culture.},

Abstract = {The European Parliament (EP) has long been regarded as a positive force
   for environmental change in the EU, but there has been little detailed
   empirical scrutiny to determine whether its reputation as a green
   champion is deserved. Nor has there been any evaluation of the
   environmental impact of the increase in EP powers under co-decision.
   These oversights are rectified by an evaluation of the EP's amendments
   to environmental legislation using typologies that rank them in terms of
   their level of ecological commitment and importance. EP amendments
   proposed under three procedures of decision making are compared in order
   to determine whether recent increases in the EP's powers under the
   co-decision procedure have affected its ability and willingness to adopt
   `green' amendments. It is clear that the EP has consistently tried to
   strengthen environmental legislation but there is some ambiguity as to
   whether co-decision has been good for the environment.},

Abstract = {Conventional wisdom, and a growing body of behavioral research, suggests
   that the nonverbal image of a candidate influences voter decision
   making. We presented subjects with images of political candidates and
   asked them to make four trait judgments based solely on viewing the
   photographs. Subjects were asked which of the two faces exhibited more
   competence, attractiveness, deceitfulness, and threat, which are
   arguably four of the most salient attributes that can be conveyed by
   faces. When we compared our subjects' choices to the actual election
   outcomes, we found that the candidates chosen as more likely to
   physically threaten the subjects actually lost 65\% of the real
   elections. As expected, our findings support the conclusions of Todorov,
   Mandisodza, Goren, and Hall ( 2005) by showing a positive correlation
   between the competence judgments and the real election outcomes.
   Surprisingly, attractiveness was correlated with losing elections, with
   the effect being driven by faces of candidates who looked politically
   incompetent yet personally attractive. Our findings have implications
   for future research on negative political communication, as they suggest
   that both threatening first impressions and fleeting impressions of
   attractiveness can harm a candidate's electoral chances.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {19},
Number = {5},
Pages = {708-735},
Abstract = {How has Europeanisation of environmental policy, as represented by the
   adoption of European Union (EU) biodiversity policies, influenced the
   agendas and repertoires of action employed by environmental
   non-governmental organisations (ENGOs) in Hungary, Poland and Romania?
   The EU's environmental acquis gave ENGOs new and often forceful tools to
   reach their aims by emphasising the importance of collaborative
   relations between state and non-state actors and by offering
   opportunities to civil society actors to circumvent their national
   governments in the policy process. Implementation of the EU's Natura
   2000 network in Hungary, Poland and Romania further reinforced
   endogenously driven professionalisation and institutionalisation of
   civil society groups. While EU accession benefited from the expertise of
   professional ENGOs, the logic of the accession process together with the
   weakness of both state actors and civil society has not led to the
   development of sustainable cooperative state-society relations in
   Central and Eastern Europe (CEE).},

Abstract = {News coverage about the European Union (EU) has the potential to inform
   citizens about and to involve them in matters of European integration.
   Investigations of factors that explain variation in EU news coverage,
   however, are rare. This study explains weekly variation in the
   visibility of EU news in newspapers from seven EU member states for the
   period 1990 to 2006. It identifies exogenous factors that relate to the
   EU polity, its policies and national politics. The descriptive results
   show that EU news visibility has increased overall and that weekly
   variation is rather similar in the seven member states. News visibility
   is substantially influenced by infrequent polity-related events such as
   European Parliamentary (EP) elections or Council summits but also by EP
   sessions. Also policy-related and national events affect visibility. The
   findings are discussed in light of the democratic deficit of the EU and
   the potential consequences of visible EU news coverage.},

Abstract = {How have environmental movements and organisations evolved in the two
   decades since the end of state socialism? Focusing upon how the impact
   of external forces, the core debates concern how changing political
   opportunities and access to resources as a consequence of European Union
   accession have impacted on environmental NGOs, as well as the effects
   more generally of contentious transnational assistance and tutelage
   offered to local activist networks by US and west European donors.
   Theoretical and conceptual debates regarding dependency and co-option,
   versus channelling and new governance, are examined. Have environmental
   actors and movements in these transitional states and new democracies
   aligned with the trajectory predicted by scholars 20 years ago? To what
   extent have longstanding environmental values, modes of political
   engagement and submerged networks buffered and even transmuted the
   impact? Why, and to what extent, do the movements and organisations of
   the region retain a distinctive character and profile?.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {9},
Number = {3},
Pages = {344-362},
Abstract = {The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY)
   maintains that its work is contributing to reconciliation in the former
   Yugoslavia. In the particular case of Bosnia-Hercegovina (BiH), however,
   there are many internal obstacles to reconciliation, not least the
   country's education system. This is not only unwieldy and highly
   fragmented, as evidenced by the existence of 13 different Ministries of
   Education, but it also keeps children divided, exemplified by the
   phenomenon of ``two schools under one roof.{''} Reconciliation is
   quintessentially about the restoration and repair of relationships,
   which in turn involves processes of rehumanization and trust-building.
   An education system that keeps young people divided, however, thus
   helping to fuel prejudice and stereotypes, is a critical impediment to
   reconciliation. Hence, the central contention of this article, which is
   premised on the so-called ``contact hypothesis,{''} is that the
   education system in BiH must be fundamentally reformed. Unless and until
   segregation and exclusion are replaced with integration and inclusion,
   the prospects for genuine reconciliation remain somewhat remote. The
   example of Brcko District, it is suggested, offers a possible template
   for reform. Yet it is BiH's desire to join the European Union that may
   prove to be the ultimate catalyst for a much-needed overhaul of its
   education system.},

Title = {NATO's Transformation Gaps: Transatlantic Differences and the War in
   Afghanistan},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {33},
Number = {5},
Pages = {673-699},
Abstract = {The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has since the turn of the
   new century experienced a double transformation gap: between global and
   regionally oriented allies and between allies emulating new military
   practices defined by the United States and allies resisting radical
   change. This article takes stock of these gaps in light of a decade's
   worth of collective and national adjustments and in light of
   counter-insurgency lessons provided by Afghanistan. It argues first of
   all that the latter transatlantic gap is receding in importance because
   the United States has adjusted its transformation approach and because
   some European allies have significantly invested in technological,
   doctrinal, and organizational reform. The other transformation gap is
   deepening, however, pitching battle-hardened and expeditionary allies
   against allies focused on regional tasks of stabilization and
   deterrence. There is a definite potential for broad transformation, our
   survey of officers' opinion shows, but NATO's official approach to
   transformation, being broad and vague, provides neither political nor
   military guidance. If NATO is to move forward and bridge the gap, it
   must clarify the lessons of Afghanistan and embed them in its new
   Strategic Concept.},

Journal = {SURVIVAL},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {52},
Number = {3},
Pages = {67-93},
Abstract = {Tehran's agreement in principle in October 2009 to a US proposal to
   exchange the bulk of Iran's stockpile of low-enriched uranium (LEU) for
   replacement fuel for the Tehran Research Reactor sparked a global surge
   of optimism. From the start, however, the deal was tangential to the
   main issues at stake, and it offered only temporary respite from the
   growing threat posed by Iran's fissile-material production programmes.
   Over the course of the winter, the confidence-building advantages
   foreseen for the deal have been replaced by still more mutual suspicion.
   The new version of the fuel-swap deal negotiated by the presidents of
   Brazil, Turkey and Iran in May 2010 is less attractive on
   non-proliferation grounds, but on balance will be a plus if Iran is
   willing to export LEU and if it agrees to stop enriching to 20\%.
   Unfortunately, however, the deal is likely to fail over the same
   disparity in goals that has frustrated all negotiation efforts to date
   over Iran's nuclear programme. If diplomacy and strong sanctions do not
   persuade Iran to accept conditions that would protect against
   nuclear-weapons break-out, there may be other ways to keep the
   capability latent. But Iran's lack of restraint risks triggering
   military action.},

Journal = {ETHNOPOLITICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {9},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {357-377},
Abstract = {The issue of national minorities in post-Cold War Europe has warranted
   considerable scholarly attention with regard to security,
   democratization and regional integration. The literature has focused on
   how European integration compelled host states to comply with
   obligations to protect a national minority within their borders. Missing
   from this debate, however, is a more comprehensive analysis of whether
   European integration has had an effect on the wider geopolitical
   relationship between the host state and the kin state over national
   minorities. Has European integration served to dampen or to intensify
   the salience of nationalist politics between host and kin states? To
   address this gap the range of host state-kin state relations in Central
   and Eastern Europe is explored corresponding to whether both states are
   EU members ( at least one may be a candidate country) compared with when
   one state remains external to the EU for the foreseeable future. It is
   argued that, despite much of the Europeanization literature, European
   integration can have an amplifying effect on nationalism regardless of
   whether kin states are existing members, acceding states or outside the
   process altogether.},

Abstract = {This paper focuses on a largely neglected aspect of legitimation in
   international organizations (IOs)-the rhetorical work done by IO scripts
   as a legitimation strategy of IOs. Based on extensive research within
   regional and global IOs, we demonstrate four aspects of rhetorical
   legitimation. First, IO texts draw upon a finite repertoire of
   rhetorical devices (a) to propagate legitimation strengths of an IO, (b)
   to amplify or compensate for legitimation weaknesses and (c) to express
   rhetorical repertoires which convey their own intrinsic merits. Second,
   configurations of rhetorical devices in IO texts are affected by
   temporal contexts, such as exogenous shocks and the historical
   sequencing of IO norm production. Third, the negotiation of relations of
   IO interdependency, including competition and cooperation, are partly
   signaled and managed through the rhetorical repertoires of IO products.
   Fourth, texts have their own properties, formal and substantive, that
   are crafted to persuade domestic law-makers.},

Abstract = {The existing integrationist approach to addressing the plight of the
   Roma in Slovakia has been delivering ambiguous results, often promoting
   Roma assimilation or simply perpetuating their exclusion. This paper
   proposes an alternative approach: a variant of the national cultural
   autonomy (NCA) combined with aspects of a joint governance model called
   transformative accommodation. Unlike the existing policy, the proposed
   model of Romani autonomy is better equipped to enable the Roma to
   participate in setting the parameters for the legal protection of their
   communities. Saliently, this approach also promises to facilitate the
   transformation of mainstream institutions in a way that promotes Roma
   inclusion into these structures. The paper outlines how to engage with
   models of NCA and transformative accommodation in devising affirmative
   action policy and membership determination.},

Abstract = {Contracting in health care is a mechanism used by the governments of
   Canada, Australia and New Zealand to improve the participation of
   marginalized populations in primary health care and improve
   responsiveness to local needs. As a result, complex contractual
   environments have emerged. The literature on contracting in health has
   tended to focus on the pros and cons of classical versus relational
   contracts from the funder's perspective. This article proposes an
   analytical framework to explore the strengths and weaknesses of
   contractual environments that depend on a number of classical contracts,
   a single relational contract or a mix of the two. Examples from
   indigenous contracting environments are used to inform the elaboration
   of the framework. Results show that contractual environments that rely
   on a multiplicity of specific contracts are administratively onerous,
   while constraining opportunities for local responsiveness. Contractual
   environments dominated by a single relational contract produce a more
   flexible and administratively streamlined system.},

Abstract = {This article opens with survey results indicating that a majority of
   professors of undergraduate courses hope to encourage their students to
   take action for social change and goes on to examine the chances of
   success when professors assign human rights literature as part of that
   project. Hope for a positive outcome would appear to be bolstered by
   psychologists' experimental findings that under certain conditions
   fictional texts as well as factual ones can persuade readers to act in
   favor of justice. However, those findings also point to a second and far
   more common outcome of reading about injustice. If readers' exigent
   requirements for action are not met, they will instead engage in
   cognitive restructuring of their perspectives on the situation,
   sufferer, suffering, or themselves. For instance, readers may cease to
   view the suffering as unjust and remediable, or they may come to see
   others (rather than themselves) as the appropriate agents of change.
   Considering the magnitude of the task as well as the academic culture in
   which literature professors have been prepared, how likely is it that
   those who hope to use human rights literature to encourage students to
   take social action will realize that desire?},

   but that it raises questions. Nordic cooperation can be seen as
   competition rather than as complement to existing defence structures and
   it might be more expensive in terms of both economy and political
   goodwill than other alternatives (especially for Iceland, Denmark and
   Norway). In addition, there may be ``non-rational{''} factors affecting
   the process, such as bureaucratic interests, military culture and
   political identity.},

Abstract = {War-on-terror-themed fictional films, particularly those focused on the
   war in Iraq, have largely failed at the box office and have been
   subjected to stinging criticism by right-wing political commentators and
   film reviewers. Critics on the political right have been upset by a
   perceived lack of patriotism in the films, often arguing that they are
   dangerous incitements to new acts of violence. However, unlike many
   earlier war films, including those made about the conflict in Vietnam,
   directors of films about the war on terror are quite self-consciously
   making political films that question United States (US) policy and
   practice, that focus on the effects of war on US service personnel and
   civilians in Iraq and Afghanistan and that, significantly, attempt to
   rehabilitate Arabs, Muslims and Islam from decades of Hollywood
   demonization. Moreover, the films are being made and released into a
   media environment in which quality news reporting has declined even as
   the intensity of feeling about `otherness' has sharpened. This article
   argues that war on terror film directors are themselves bearing witness
   to the tragedy of war and thereby inviting film audiences to see the
   effects of war.},

Abstract = {Comparative research on democratisation suggests the political space for
   the immediate punishment of previous dictatorships depends on the type
   of transition and the correlative power-sharing and veto capacity of the
   political actors and institutions. This article argues that the type and
   diversity of transitional justice in Portugal's democratisation must be
   correlated not only with the absence of the veto capacity of former
   authoritarian elites and institutions, due to their collapse, but mainly
   with the cleavages opened by democratisation and military intervention
   in politics. We also argue that the nature of the transition is
   superimposed on the nature of the authoritarian regime and the extent of
   its legacy in the type of transitional justice, and that the
   transition's powerful dynamic served to constitute another legacy for
   the consolidation of democracy, strongly counterbalancing those of the
   authoritarian regime.},

   Provincial Schools in British Columbia},
Journal = {POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {38},

Abstract = {Many indigenous populations are experiencing rural-to-urban migration.
   In making this transition, indigenous peoples are entering industrial
   societies where most income derives from wages or salaries, and formal
   educational achievement is crucial in determining economic prospects.
   This research analyzes the gap in test score results between Aboriginal
   and non-Aboriginal students in public schools in the Canadian province
   of British Columbia. It finds a strong effect of school quality, as
   measured by non-Aboriginal achievement, on Aboriginal achievement. It
   also finds a nonlinear negative relationship between Aboriginal
   achievement and the number of Aboriginal students in a school over the
   empirically observed range. It thus suggests a possible trade-off and
   dilemma between, on the one hand, policies that enable Aboriginal
   students to concentrate in a few schools able to provide a culturally
   sensitive curriculum and, on the other, policies to maximize Aboriginal
   academic achievement.},

Abstract = {Where does `the international' come from? What accounts for its
   existence as a dimension of the human world? This article attempts an
   answer, in three steps, using the idea of `uneven and combined
   development' (U\&CD). First, a depth model is constructed, comparing
   different ways of linking uneven development with international
   relations. Thus far, it turns out, these ways have all presupposed the
   fact of political multiplicity, rather than explaining it. In search of
   explanation, the article turns, secondly, to the compelling historical
   sociological argument of Barry Buzan and Richard Little. This locates
   the origins of geopolitics in the late prehistoric shift from
   hunter-gatherer to settled agricultural existence, together with
   associated processes of social differentiation and proto-state
   formation. Buzan and Little's explanation appears at first to pre-empt
   the need for the concept of U\&CD. Yet closer inspection reveals that
   unevenness and combination play a key role in their empirical account
   without, however, being theorized. The third step of the argument
   therefore seeks to show how these are necessary parts of the process of
   social change which Buzan and Little describe. And in this way it
   emerges that the origins of `the international' do indeed lie in the
   uneven and combined character of historical development.},

Abstract = {Denmark is a windy, low-lying country with a very long coastline where
   global warming, rising sea levels and renewable energy are serious
   national issues. Renewable energy in Denmark is primarily wind power, a
   traditional and popular energy source. Until 2001, Danish energy policy
   was largely synonymous with environmental policy, based on a broad
   popular and political consensus. A European Commission survey published
   in January 2007 showed 93\% of the population supported renewable energy
   sources (EWEA News Release 2007). However, political developments since
   2001 have created a crisis for Danish wind power (see Toke 2002). This
   period has also seen greater interaction between domestic and
   international forces.},

Title = {Target-group influence and political feasibility: the case of climate
   policy design in Europe},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {17},
Number = {6},
Pages = {854-873},
Abstract = {Political feasibility (or infeasibility) is often associated with
   target-group support (or opposition) of specific policy alternatives. We
   argue that target-groups' capacity to influence the spectrum of
   politically feasible policy options tends to be higher when (1) target
   groups control resources needed by decision-makers, that (2) are
   agenda-setters and/or veto players in the decision-making process. In
   the 2008 revision of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU
   ETS) exemptions from the basic principle of full auctioning of
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions allowances can all be traced to
   target-group interest representation by single veto players or blocking
   minorities in the European Council and the Council of Ministers. Our
   analysis indicates that target groups succeeded in constraining the
   spectrum of politically feasible policy options to the extent that their
   positions were unified and threats to shut down or relocate activity
   were perceived to be relevant, severe and credible. Our findings confirm
   both the significance and the limits of portfolio assignment in the
   Commission. Even with Directorate General (DG) Environment in an
   agenda-setting role, target groups acquired exemptions through their
   relations with veto players in the Council.},

Journal = {REVIEW OF AFRICAN POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {37},
Number = {124},
Pages = {173-186},
Abstract = {The efforts of the international community to build peace in Sudan have
   been frustrated by the failure to stop the violence in Darfur,
   continuous setbacks in the implementation of the 2005 peace agreement,
   and a failure to remain sufficiently engaged with processes at the root
   of the violence. This applies particularly to local conflicts and the
   ways in which they interlock with national and regional conflicts. This
   paper highlights the role that land issues have played both in poverty
   generation and in driving and sustaining protracted conflict. The
   challenge is to take the current complexity into account, not by
   perceiving local conflict dynamics as merely a manifestation of
   macro-political cleavages, but as being motivated by both top-down and
   bottom-up agendas. As Sudan is drifting towards increasing
   fragmentation, an approach to peace-building is required that can
   address multiple arenas and sources of conflict in a much more
   integrated way than has been the case so far.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {17},
Number = {5},
Pages = {633-647},
Abstract = {European Union (EU) negotiations take place within the framework of a
   set of formal and informal institutions. Member states negotiate in the
   organizational context of the Council and the European Council, take
   decisions through alternative procedures and decision rules, and sustain
   a set of norms for the conduct of negotiations. While the effects of
   these institutions on negotiation behaviour and outcomes have received
   extensive attention, the question of why these particular institutions
   have been established or evolved remains underexplored. This
   contribution makes an argument in favour of systematic attention to the
   design of negotiation institutions in the EU, and suggests that we
   should draw on general theoretical approaches to institutional design
   for these purposes. Moreover, rather than engaging in the exercise of
   trying to prove or falsify theoretical approaches, we should exploit the
   potential for explanatory complementarities in concrete empirical
   domains. To this end, the paper advances a domain-of-application
   approach to institutional design and illustrates its applicability to EU
   negotiation institutions through four empirical illustrations.},

Abstract = {Violations of rights, a weak Duma, political parties dominated by
   bureaucrats, and corrupt privatization are ordinarily taken as signs or
   even causes of the failure of democracy in Russia or at best as normal
   traits of electoral politics in a middle-income state. Yet all of these
   are natural consequences of introducing democracy in a country with the
   Russian electorate's distinctive recent experience of a loss of a third
   of the state's territory and half its population. In such a democracy
   only a centrist, not a liberal, strategy can block a return to
   authoritarianism, and such a strategy in Russia will subordinate rights
   to the task of privatization that a Duma weakened by ideological,
   demographic and geographic impediments to party development cannot
   conduct. Consequently what are taken as signs or causes of democratic
   failure in Russia are instead necessary effects of introducing democracy
   in Russia's special circumstances. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd on

Abstract = {This study examines the relationship between types of government and
   level of public spending. There are two competing perspectives about the
   consequences of coalition governments for the size of public
   expenditures. The most common argument is that government spending
   increases under coalition governments, compared with one-party
   governments. Another line of thought contends that coalition governments
   are often stalled in the status quo due to the veto power of each
   member. Our analysis of public spending in 33 parliamentary democracies
   between 1972 and 2000 confirms the latter argument that coalition
   governments have a status quo bias. We find, particularly, that
   single-party governments are apt to modify the budget according to the
   current fiscal condition, which enables them to increase or decrease
   spending more flexibly. By contrast, coalition governments find it
   difficult not only to decrease spending under difficult fiscal
   conditions but also to increase it even under a more favorable context,
   because each member of the coalition has a veto power.},

Abstract = {The prediction of conflict constitutes a challenge to social scientists.
   This article explores whether the incorporation of geography can help us
   make our forecasts of political violence more accurate. The authors
   describe a spatially and temporally autoregressive discrete regression
   model, following the framework of Geyer and Thompson. This model is
   applied to geo-located data on attributes and conflict events in Bosnia
   over the period from March 1992 to October 1995. Results show that there
   is a strong spatial as well as temporal dimension to the outbreak of
   violence in Bosnia. The authors then explore the use of this model for
   predicting future conflict. Using a simulation approach, the predictive
   accuracy of the spatial-temporal model is compared to a standard
   regression model that only includes time lags. The results show that
   even in a difficult out-of-sample prediction task, the incorporation of
   space improves our forecasts of future conflict.},

Abstract = {International institutions have developed into a site of political
   authority of their own as can be seen by looking at a number of
   authority indicators. The concept of international authority, however,
   is intimately bound to the concept of legitimacy. The stronger the role
   that international institutions play in policymaking, the stronger the
   demands for their legitimacy that can be expected to arise. Against this
   background, we ask which of the state powers analysed in this special
   issue prefer which form of legitimation of international institutions,
   whether their general conceptions of legitimacy diverge or converge, and
   what this means for the future of global governance.},

Abstract = {This article discusses the issue of special genocidal intent and, within
   it, the relevance of judicially established truths to the wider
   historical context. It suggests that genocide researchers should not
   rely only on verdicts-which either deny or confirm genocideas historical
   truth but, rather, use the judicial process and trial evidence as
   signposts to direct their research. The author uses the case study of
   Serbian genocide against Bosnian Muslims from 1992 to 1995 to illustrate
   the failings of judicially established truths in determining wider
   historical truth. Wartime documentation, interviews with witnesses, and
   court transcripts are analyzed to illustrate how this wider truth is
   sometimes lost when focus on the importance of supporting documents is
   overshadowed by a final verdict. The case of Srebrenica is outlined to
   illustrate how documents used in trials, as well as witness testimonies,
   can contribute on their own to the understanding of historical truths.
   In this case, a selection of trial narratives and documents is used to
   examine not only if there was ``special intent{''} among Serbian
   political leadership to exterminate Bosnian Muslims as early as 1992,
   but also to determine if international community representatives were
   aware of that intent and ignored it consciously.},

Abstract = {While for multiparty systems the development of vote function forecast
   models for the incumbent party and the official opposition party is
   commonplace, only rarely do these models try to forecast the vote for a
   third party. Can third party vote shares be forecasted with reasonable
   accuracy? We explore this question within the context of British
   politics. Our model proposes that the British Liberal party vote is
   mostly driven by the extent to which the UK electorate approves or
   disapproves of the official opposition leader. Our results are
   consistent with the idea that once the decision has been made to punish
   the incumbent government, a voter must then decide whether to support
   the official opposition party or another smaller party.},

Abstract = {Evidence from the Transitional Justice Data Base reveals which
   transitional justice mechanisms and combinations of mechanisms
   positively or negatively affect human rights and democracy. This article
   demonstrates that specific combinations of mechanisms-trials and
   amnesties; and trials, amnesties, and truth commissions-generate
   improvements in those two political goals. The findings support a
   justice balance approach to transitional justice: trials provide
   accountability and amnesties provide stability, advancing democracy and
   respect for human rights. The project further illustrates that, all else
   being equal, truth commissions alone have a negative impact on the two
   political objectives, but contribute positively when combined with
   trials and amnesty.},

Abstract = {This article explores and criticizes key assumptions of contemporary
   cosmopolitanism, not least the notion of post-sovereignty, trying to
   understand how the cosmopolitan power and sovereignty critique may be
   very compatible with present-day reconfigurations and relegitimizations
   of state power and sovereignty. Through a critique of how cosmopolitans
   sketch out a problematic nation state's past and a more factual
   efficient and morally appropriate post-nation state condition the
   article claims that cosmopolitanism may come to serve as legitimizing
   cover for a new sovereigntist language and practice wielded by the same
   powers who were dominant in the nation state age, namely the Western
   states. The purpose of the article is to ask whether cosmopolitanism and
   humanitarianism have become the new sovereigntist language uniting state
   officials and state-critical scholars? International Politics (2010) 47,

Journal = {EAST EUROPEAN POLITICS AND SOCIETIES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {24},
Number = {4},
Pages = {503-519},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The controversy over bringing back Bulgaria's abolished monarchy
   reflects in a large measure the prolonged agony the country has been
   undergoing ever since it launched on a course of painful post-communist
   reforms. Against the background of a deep economic crisis, mass poverty,
   the breakdown of law and order, and political chaos that have
   traumatized the population, the attempts to reinstate the monarchy have
   failed only because of its low historical legitimacy. While the
   ex-king's triumph in the June 2001 election initially seemed to improve
   the chances for bringing back the monarchy, such a restoration has been
   rendered less likely now by the numerous failures and blunders of his
   time in office, particularly his inability to rebuild the ailing
   national state and economy. In spite of some notable foreign policy
   successes such as Bulgaria's entry into NATO and the European Union,
   ex-Prime Minister Simeon did not live up to the naively overoptimistic
   expectations of Bulgarians who had hoped that he would save their
   country from the profound economic, social, political, institutional,
   and even moral crisis into which it has descended. The precipitous fall
   of the political fortunes of Simeon, especially as a result of the
   public relations disaster involving the scandalous ``restitution{''} of
   his family's properties that turned the ex-monarch into a
   multimillionaire, does not bode well for the prospect of reintroducing
   the monarchy. In the eyes of many ordinary Bulgarians, the former king
   has now turned into a liability and an embarrassing disappointment.},

   SUMMIT},
Journal = {AFRICAN AFFAIRS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {109},
Number = {437},

Abstract = {Political protests have visibly increased in frequency and intensity in
   South Africa in recent years, and they seem to indicate a more
   adversarial relationship between the post-apartheid state and civil
   society. This article uses the 2002 Johannesburg World Summit on
   Sustainable Development, and the protests which accompanied it, to
   illuminate these broader trends. It analyses the legacy of the Summit as
   a `mega-event', and highlights the importance of the `mega-protests' in
   2002. The most important effects are shown to be the disruption of South
   African extraversion; the marginalization and repression of particular
   social movements; and the exacerbation of broader trends toward a more
   polarized political landscape in South Africa. Importantly, however, the
   article concludes that such developments are not evidence of growing
   distance between the state and civil society, but rather between those
   considered legitimate and responsible partners, and those who are
   excluded from `normal' politics. Thus the Johannesburg Summit
   illuminates broader trends toward the governmentalization and
   transnationalization of politics in South Africa, and destabilizes
   conventional understandings of what and where `South African politics'
   actually is, as well as raising important questions regarding the
   impacts of such mega-events in the future.},

Abstract = {Political devolution allowed policy divergence around the UK. But
   England, Scotland and Wales must coexist within the UK, which means that
   the overarching rules of devolution shape their policy options. What
   friction emerges, what does it mean for health and how does the UK deal
   with it? This article, based on extensive elite interviewing, identifies
   `bottom-up' issues in which health policy divergence creates
   intergovernmental friction and `top-down' issues in which broader
   conflicts affect health. The rest of the article identifies and explains
   the mechanisms of coordination and dispute resolution,finding them
   probably inadequate to managing conflict.},

Abstract = {Starting with Falun Gong, this article first identifies the meanings of
   the term ``cult{''} in the context of religious belief and Chinese law,
   which are characterized by a strong instrumentalist nature. The article
   then explores the current system of law governing ``evil cults,{''} and
   examines how the system actually simultaneously protects and restricts
   the freedom of religious belief. The author observes that the extent and
   scope of citizens' religious beliefs have been restricted by law, and
   further asserts that legislation and regulations against ``evil cult{''}
   activities should not be used to control and limit citizens' normal
   religious life.},

   from Insider Trading Regulation},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {64},
Number = {3},
Pages = {505-528},
Month = {SUM},
Abstract = {Cross-border cooperation among domestic regulators and public officials
   has become a defining feature of global governance. While a number of
   studies have tracked the emergence and institutionalization of such
   transgovernmental networks, less is known about their effect on domestic
   policy. This study explores this link for the important case of
   insider-trading regulation in original data for I 16 countries between
   1977 and 2006. It offers quantitative evidence that transgovernmental
   cooperation is related to domestic policy convergence but that the
   relationship is more complex than often assumed. Direct ties to powerful
   regulators increases a jurisdiction's likelihood of adopting
   internationally promoted policies such as insider-trading rules.
   Separately, membership in the International Organization of Securities
   Commissions (IOSCO), a forum designed to diffuse best practices among
   regulators, increases a jurisdiction's likelihood of subsequently
   enforcing newly adopted policies. The findings in this study suggest
   that different network components are associated with distinct aspects
   of domestic policy convergence. The results are directly relevant for
   current public policy debates about the reregulation of global financial
   markets as transgovernmental networks among domestic regulators have
   assumed a critical role.},

Title = {Open Horizons: The Temporal Visions of Reflexive Realism},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {12},
Number = {2},
Pages = {271-300},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This paper excavates another conceptual thread running through much of
   what has been termed ``reflexive realism{''} the importance of open
   temporality. We argue that the ethical and political cores of reflexive
   realism owe much to a theoretical confrontation with the ultimate
   reality of open-ended, indeterminate time. Where the legacy of classical
   realism embedded significant ambiguities in these tensions, reflexive
   realism can provide a more developed ethical framework for political
   action through an engagement, via open time, with research often viewed
   as outside the purview of political realism. We then uncover an
   aesthetic understanding of action and theory to show how classical
   realism's indeterminate view of time, instead of limiting and even
   debasing any and all human efforts, can be mobilized as a resource for
   ethical evaluation and action. The paper's concluding discussion
   demonstrates this by examining the contributions that open time can make
   to the perennial dilemma of humanitarian intervention.},

Abstract = {In considering the concept of ``Pole-Catholic,{''} it might well be
   asked not if it had real grounds but in what circumstances it was
   constructed. Although the Polish national identity in its current shape
   was ``Catholicized{''} mostly in the twentieth century, the previous
   age-the nineteenth century-as a time of constant struggle for political
   independence has been regarded as having the most formative effect on
   Polish national imagination. This article discusses an important moment
   in the construction of the concept ``Pole-Catholic.{''} It shows that
   far before the idea of Roman Dmowski (from the turn of the nineteenth
   and twentieth centuries), who claimed that only a Catholic was a good
   Pole, the strong identification of Polish nationalism with Catholicism
   had been insistently articulated by Polish conservative groups. The
   discourse of the Catholic Polish nation appeared in (and even dominated)
   the debate on the Italian Risorgimento. Between 1848 and 1871,
   discussing the Italian-papal conflict, the conservatives created their
   religious programme for Poland and took advantage of the popularity of
   the Italian national movement among Poles to promote it in their
   writings. Their equation of Polishness with Catholicism appeared to
   leave a strong trace in the formation of the Polish identity and
   continues to inform the way in which Poles are perceived nowadays.},

Abstract = {This article uses the Advocacy Coalition Framework to identify the
   stakeholders and their coalitions in the arena of after-school policy,
   which drew much new attention beginning in the early 1990s in many
   American cities. Using evidence from case studies in five cities, we
   show how the framework can be extended beyond stakeholder analysis to
   include identification of core and secondary value conflicts and of
   opportunities for policy analysis to help strengthen coalitions and
   pressures for change. Coalitions in each of the cities differ over core
   values relating to the purposes of after-school programs (academics
   versus ``fun{''}), but policy analysts can promote common goals by
   developing options to deal with the secondary conflicts over the
   relative importance of facilities versus program content, the modes of
   collaboration between public schools and community based organizations,
   and the incentives for public school teachers to engage in staffing
   after-school programs.},

Journal = {WORLD POLITICS},

Abstract = {Utilizing a unique data set from the Italian Ministry of Justice
   reporting the transmission to the Chamber of Deputies of more than the
   thousand requests for the removal of parliamentary immunity from
   deputies suspected of criminal wrongdoing, the authors analyze the
   political careers of members of the Chamber during the first eleven
   postwar legislatures (1948-94). They find that judicial investigation
   typically did not discourage deputies from standing for reelection in
   Italy's large multimember electoral districts. They also show that
   voters did not punish allegedly malfeasant legislators with loss of
   office until the last (Eleventh) legislature in the sample. To account
   for the dramatic change in voter behavior that occurred in the early
   1990s, the investigation focuses on the roles of the judiciary and the
   press. The results are consistent with a theory that a vigilant and free
   press is a necessary condition for political accountability in
   democratic settings. An independent judiciary alone is ineffective in
   ensuring electoral accountability if the public is not informed of
   political malfeasance.},

Abstract = {In May 2008, South Africa witnessed two shocking weeks of deadly attacks
   on foreigners and other suspect outsiders. This article makes sense of
   the violence with reference to an extended history of South African
   statecraft that both induced the conflict and hamstrung efforts to
   address it. In particular, it describes how decades of discursive and
   institutional efforts to control political and physical space have
   generated two demons with which the country must now contend. The first
   is a perceived enemy within: an amorphously delimited group of outsiders
   that is inherently threatening, often indistinguishable from others, and
   effectively impossible to exclude spatially. The second demon rests in a
   society prepared to kill to rid itself of those retarding the country's
   post-Apartheid renaissance. For many of those behind the attacks or
   empathizing with them, controlling the movement of people within the
   country and across its borders remains essential to security,
   prosperity, and South Africa's national self-realization. Political
   leaders now face a dilemma: extending legal identities and
   constitutionally promised protections to outsiders and other foreigners
   risks being seen as betraying the national project by the demonic and
   visibly violent society they have helped create.},

Abstract = {This article studies the impact of economic sanctions on the duration
   and outcome of intrastate conflicts. Sanctions are argued to foster the
   convergence of beliefs over parties' capacity, to reduce the utility of
   victory and to increase the costs of continuing fighting. Using a sample
   of 87 wars and new data on sanctions and sanction types, the author
   shows that sanctions and their durations are statistically associated
   with shorter intrastate conflicts. It is also shown that total economic
   embargoes are the most effective type of coercive measure in these cases
   and that sanctions imposed either by international organizations or by
   other actors have similar negative effects on war duration. In the
   second part of the article, the dependent variable is disaggregated, and
   I demonstrate that sanctions imposed by international institutions
   increase the likelihood of conflict resolution, whereas those sanctions
   not imposed by such institutions tend to increase the probability of a
   military victory. Moreover, if the targeted state is a member of the
   international institution imposing the sanctions, the effect of such
   coercion is even greater. Economic embargoes are also proven to increase
   the likelihoods of a military and a negotiated end, whereas
   international arms embargoes reduce the likelihood of a military
   victory.},

Abstract = {States have recently agreed that there is a responsibility to protect
   populations threatened by genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and
   crimes against humanity. The international community, however, often
   lacks the resources and willingness to carry out a key part of this
   responsibility, that is, to undertake humanitarian intervention
   effectively when required. One potential solution to this problem is to
   outsource intervention to private military and security companies. In
   this article, I consider this option. In particular, I present a largely
   consequentialist argument which asserts that, when two conditions are
   met, using these companies to bolster the capacity to undertake
   humanitarian intervention might be morally justifiable overall.},

Abstract = {This study analyzes the impact of media framing on aggregate attitudes
   and expectations of Israelis toward the Oslo peace process with the
   Palestinians during a time period of eight years (1995-2003). It
   presents three main contributions: First, it provides a long-term
   analysis of the impact of media coverage of a peace process on public
   opinion, while controlling for the influence of real life events.
   Second, it presents empirical evidence that the strength of media
   framing effects varies among different facets of public opinion.
   Specifically, framing effects are stronger on aggregate future
   expectations compared with their effects on aggregate current attitudes.
   The fact that the information transmitted by the media evaluative tone
   was a central source of influence on future expectations underlines the
   central role of the media in political and social phenomena. Third, in
   line with previous studies, it shows that the public response to
   negative framing is much stronger than to positive framing. This may
   have a negative effect on a government's ability to rally the public in
   support of a peace process. Since most media coverage of the peace
   process and conflict focused on negative developments while ignoring
   positive ones, the media effect on public opinion was that of peace
   spoilers.},

Abstract = {The question of whether human rights are above sovereignty has dominated
   China's human rights discourse. Relying on a sovereignty-human rights
   spectrum, this article reviews China's behaviors, particularly its
   participation in the UN Security Council, in managing the three major
   international humanitarian crises in the post-Cold War era-Rwanda,
   Kosovo, and Darfur, and finds that there have been impressive changes in
   China's response to the crises. Yet, a content analysis of China's
   official discourse on human rights finds that China's attitudes towards
   sovereignty and human rights have not changed much. Drawing on
   constructivist international relations theory, this article attempts to
   explain the paradox. It is argued that the international discourse on
   the ``responsibility to protect{''} has brought about changes in
   international norms regarding violations of human rights and
   humanitarian law, and that, having undergone in recent years an identity
   change from a defensive power of bitterness and insecurity to a rising
   power aspiring to take more responsibility, China is more concerned
   about its national image and more receptive to international norms,
   which has led to the changes in its response to international
   humanitarian crises.},

Abstract = {This article suggests that research in the field of human rights,
   especially when it is legal in nature, tends to devote surprisingly
   little attention to questions of methodology. This may be a result of
   the fact that human rights scholars often are (former) human rights
   activists. Dispensing with methodological constraints enables
   researchers to engage in wishful thinking and to reach the conclusions
   they were hoping to find in the first place. The article makes some
   suggestions for those who wish to avoid this pitfall, including
   carefully spelling out a research method, discussing which alternative
   methods have been rejected, and avoiding the label ``emerging{''} human
   right.},

Title = {Indigenous Suicide and Colonization: The Legacy of Violence and the
   Necessity of Self-Determination},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT AND VIOLENCE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {4},
Number = {1},
Pages = {124-133},
Abstract = {Contemporary indigenous first nations psychologists have developed an
   alternative frame for viewing suicide that not only shifts the focus
   from individual-level to group-level explanations, but challenges
   discourses that position group-level influences as ``risk factors{''}
   that can be easily subsumed within standard repertoires for suicide
   prevention. First nations psychologists show the violent legacy of
   colonization has left a dark shadow on the contemporary lives of young
   people, so that around the world, suicide rates for indigenous peoples
   are much higher than for non-indigenous peoples in the same country.
   These arguments, which rely on historical accounts, cannot be neatly
   demonstrated using empirical data, but form an important part of a
   self-determination movement among indigenous peoples, directly
   challenging unequal power relations in society as a means to seek
   redress for particular issues of inequity like rates of youth suicide.
   We present a theoretical case study and analysis of contemporary suicide
   among Maori youth in New Zealand. In a traditional Maori
   conceptualization, individual well-being is sourced and tied to the
   well-being of the collective cultural identity. Therefore, individual
   pain is inseparable from collective pain and the role of the collective
   becomes that of carrying individuals who are suffering. The state of
   kahupo or spiritual blindness (Kruger, Pitman, et al. 2004) is
   characterized by a loss of hope, meaning, and purpose and an enduring
   sense of despair. It bears the symptoms of chronic dissociation or
   separation of the physical from the spiritual and vice versa. We
   describe community empowerment practices and social policy environments
   that offer pathways forward from colonization towards tino
   rangatiratanga, or indigenous self-determination, noting significant
   obstacles along the way.},

Title = {Repression of Sudanese civil society under the National Islamic
   Front/National Congress Party},
Journal = {REVIEW OF AFRICAN POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {37},

Pages = {437-450},
Abstract = {Political change in Sudan gathered momentum after 1989, with the
   government introducing policies of control and restriction on the one
   hand, and an increasing number of civil society organisations seeking to
   establish and legitimise their (autonomous) identity and secure their
   continued existence on the other. This article concentrates uniquely on
   Sudanese non-governmental organisations and civil society (notably
   community-based organisations), focusing on the regime's institutions
   and social organisation and social and political opposition to the
   regime. It shows how the Islamic movement uses religion and power to
   sustain and protect a political system which has lost its credibility
   and legitimacy among many Sudanese. The article focuses on the rise of
   the National Islamic Front from a small political party, through a
   period as the third political force after the election of 1986, to a
   ruling party in the wake of the military coup of 1989. It discusses
   structures and processes of rule under the National Islamic Front, as
   well as the causes leading to the failure of its own Islamic project in
   the country. It suggests that the rise of an Islamic movement in Sudan
   is itself a reflection of a decline in local or grassroots initiatives
   for social change, and summarises relations between the National Islamic
   Front and non-governmental/citizen-based organisations. It concludes
   that even in the absence of democracy, and under a brutal authoritarian
   regime, non-governmental organisations can engage effectively and
   contribute to social and economic change, particularly those affecting
   the marginalised poor, by raising issues of concern about, and promoting
   alternatives to, political Islam.},

Abstract = {The role of the media in foreign policymaking has been the subject of
   significant academic enquiry, particularly in response to the so-called
   `CNN effect', but this work has mostly focused on prominent Western
   nations (particularly the United States). This article enlarges the
   debate by adding a comparative and post-communist perspective. Taking
   the Kosovo conflict as a case study, it analyses the role of the media
   in foreign policy in Bulgaria and Britain. Through the application of
   Robinson's policy-media interaction model, the article argues that the
   Bulgarian press did not have any substantial impact on the government's
   position on the Kosovo conflict because it framed its reports in a
   neutral way. The British press/foreign policy relationship discloses a
   clear case of media support for governmental policy. The findings raise
   questions about the validity of certain claims about the media-policy
   relationship in former socialist countries. The article identifies
   limitations to models based on Western media systems and suggests that
   their construction is often based on certain cultural assumptions and
   hence very much context bound.},

Abstract = {This article explores two different conceptions of how an emerging
   policy regime might evolve to strengthen incentives for more vigorous
   cooperation in mitigating global climate change. One is the paradigm
   that has figured most prominently in negotiations to this point: the
   establishment of targets and timetables for countries to limit their
   aggregate greenhouse gas emissions. The other approach consists of a
   variety of loosely coordinated smaller-scale agreements, each one of
   which addresses a different aspect of the challenge, and is enforced in
   its own way. Our primary conclusion is that an agreement of the first
   type may be more cost-effective, but that a system of agreements of the
   second type would likely sustain more abatement overall.},

Journal = {POLITICS RELIGION \& IDEOLOGY},

Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Pages = {167-183},
Abstract = {During the post-1980 period, the rise of the Justice and Development
   Party to power in 2002, increasing visibility of Islamic symbols like
   the use of the headscarf in the cultural field and the growth of Islamic
   businesses and markets in the economic field, have all caused anxiety
   among secular groups in Turkey, concerned that it will lose its economic
   and social status. This resentment has led to a fierce struggle among
   secular and religious groups both at state and societal levels.
   Therefore, during the post-1980 period the struggle between religious
   and secular actors in Turkey has turned into a struggle between two
   rival middle classes. This article examines the influence of
   globalisation on both religious and secular groups and concludes that
   the Islamic middle class has benefited from globalisation to increase
   its influence in the social, economic and political realms. However,
   upon the growing visibility of Islamic actors, the secular middle class
   feel that they will lose their secular lifestyle so they have tried to
   demonstrate their determination to defend it.},

Abstract = {The Canadian Constitution remained a British statute from 1867 to 1982,
   a situation that endured even after the country became independent in
   1931. As a result, every time Canadians wanted constitutional changes,
   legislation had to be passed in Westminster. Between 1980 and 1982,
   following the Quebec referendum on independence, the then Prime Minister
   Pierre Trudeau undertook to change this situation. This meant devising a
   Canadian amending formula and, most importantly for Trudeau, the
   inclusion of an entrenched bill of rights in the constitution. Trudeau's
   initial project was opposed by eight of 10 provinces and this situation
   proved difficult for the UK. The opposing provinces lobbied British
   lawmakers in order to convince them to vote against the federal request.
   That situation eventually forced Ottawa to accept a diluted version of
   the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.},

Abstract = {Fifteen years after the Dayton Accords, Bosnia is still at peace. In
   some ways, Bosnia was an easier case than Afghanistan and Iraq, and is a
   sobering lesson in both the promise and inherent limitations of
   contemporary military interventions and state-building operations. While
   the international community proved adept at stopping the violence,
   generating self-sustaining peace has been much more difficult. Dayton
   posed an inherent dilemma: on the one hand, the political structures it
   had established were unworkable and too often served the interests of
   Bosnia's most malign political forces; on the other, the agreement was
   the foundation of the peace, and uprooting it threatened a return to
   war. Bosnia's current predicament should not be construed as evidence of
   the inherent impossibility of state-building, but only of the extreme
   difficulty, resource-intensiveness and decades-long timeframe such
   projects require. A policy of benign neglect or a purely military
   approach are not, in most cases, apt to be more effective. Ultimately,
   the logic of intervention can be very compelling for liberal democracies
   in possession of the power to stop violence, and extended interventions
   will thus sometimes be unavoidable.},

Title = {Shared metacognition in integrative negotiation},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT},

Volume = {21},
Number = {3},
Pages = {309-333},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this study is to examine the unique effect that
   shared metacognition has on negotiation over and above the effect of
   simply having similar views
   Design/methodology/approach - An experiment was conducted where it was
   systematic:ally varied whether the negotiators explicitly knew or did
   not know that their opponent had a similar view of the negotiation task
   Findings - Results showed that having shared metacognition promoted
   cooperative negotiation, accurate insight into the opponent's point
   values (which was correlated with increased Joint gain), and increased
   satisfaction regarding the negotiation outcome Moreover, this was the
   raise across different conditions in which negotiators' negotiation task
   view and motivation were varied
   Practical implications - The paper suggests that negotiators and
   mediators am benefit by developing a common understanding of the
   negotiation and explicitly.,, exchanging this understanding with each
   other (establishing shared metacognition) more to engaging in the
   negotiation Future studies should examine closely the underlying process
   of shared metacognition in terms of its impact on negotiation
   Originality/value - Prior research suggests that successful, integrative
   negotiation depends on negotiators' view of the negotiation task and
   whether they hold similar views of the negotiation task (shared
   cognition) Implicit in this research is that the negotiating parties not
   only had similar views of the negotiation task but also may have
   explicitly known that they did so (shared metacognition).},

Abstract = {There is no doubt that one of the most contentious terrains of
   contestation in the supposed clash of values between Islamism and
   western values is the role of women in society. Thus, the issue of
   women's rights has become the litmus test for Arab societies with
   respect to the current zeitgeist of human rights in the age of democracy
   and liberalism. There is today a stereotypical view of debates
   surrounding women's rights in the Arab world where two distinct camps
   are in conflict with each other. On the one hand there are `globalised'
   liberal and secular actors that strive for women's rights and therefore
   democracy, while on the other are obscurantist movements that are
   anchored in religious tradition, resist globalisation and are therefore
   autocratic by assumption. This article challenges this view and through
   an empirical study of the changes to the Code of Personal Status in
   Tunisia and Morocco it demonstrates that the issue of women's rights is
   far more complex and, in particular, it finds that there is a very
   significant decoupling between women's rights and democracy in the
   region, despite a progressive liberal shift in the gender equality
   agenda.},

Title = {Politicizing sustainable development: the co-production of globalized
   evidence-based policy},
Journal = {CRITICAL POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {3},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {375-390},
Abstract = {Sustainable development is fundamentally depoliticized by the
   interrelated discourses of globalization (as a way of conceptualizing
   environmental problems) and evidencebased policy (as a key global
   response to global environmental problems). This depoliticization has
   overlooked key issues of control over resources and decision-making,
   disparate experiences of environmental problems, and hierarchies of
   knowledge relevant to environmental policy. If sustainable development
   is to be salvaged as a useful and meaningful concept, it needs to be
   politicized, requiring two things. The first is to establish a global,
   evidence-based discourse of sustainable development as one legitimate
   discourse of many, but as co-produced-embedded in power politics that
   both reflect and create the broad social order. The second is to assert
   the need for deliberative governance as a basis for an environmental
   decision-making that is not exclusively controlled by privilege within
   this social order. Ultimately, the politicization of sustainable
   development legitimates a call for deliberative governance to supplant
   evidence-based policy as the `gold-standard' for environmental
   decision-making.},

Abstract = {Environmental activism across the Western Balkan successor states of the
   former Yugoslavia, particularly in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia,
   remains in its infancy. Compared to the movements of central and Eastern
   Europe, the development of environmental non-governmental organisations
   (ENGOs) in these states appears to be much slower. From the empirical
   perspective of non-governmental organisation activity concerning river
   basin management in Herzegovina, the factors that have determined the
   pace and nature of environmental politics in the region are explored.
   The most significant constraints on ENGO activity relate specifically to
   the political legacy of conflict and the turbulent recent history of
   this region. The ethnicisation of party politics, the weak regulatory
   capacity of state authorities and the obfuscation of power, the specific
   model of political economy and the absence of green politics at the time
   of the collapse of socialism coalesce to inhibit the emergence of
   politically engaged and professionalised green advocacy networks.},

   report is on mass casualty, complex attack scenarios involving explosive
   or incendiary materials. Although such attacks are not limited to one
   particular strand of terrorism, the case studies assessed in this report
   are linked to or inspired by the global jihadist movement spearheaded by
   the al Qaeda network, since this currently constitutes the most
   significant threat of mass casualty bombings to the United States.},

Title = {From formal- to informal-sector employment: examining the Chinese
   presence in Zambia},
Journal = {REVIEW OF AFRICAN POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {37},
Number = {123},
Pages = {41-59},
Abstract = {This paper analyses China's recent engagement with Zambia, examining
   especially Chinese hiring practices, methods of business organisation
   and the labour conditions maintained by Chinese-operated construction
   and mining firms. Moving beyond existing analyses which remain focused
   solely on Chinese trade, aid and investment, this study begins to
   explore the micro-level of Chinese ventures, arguing that the continued
   employment of co-nationals as well as the generally substandard labour
   conditions maintained by Chinese firms lead to the offloading of Zambian
   workers into the country's burgeoning informal economy. There, newly
   emerged Chinese businesses stand to threaten local entrepreneurs who
   lack the resources necessary to parry Chinese competition. The result is
   a rapidly growing national unemployment rate and an increasing number of
   Zambians left struggling to sustain their livelihoods. This paper
   further argues that the characteristics defining China's engagement with
   Zambia are not particular to the Zambian context alone, but are rather
   abiding characteristics of overseas Chinese businesses in general. The
   paper ultimately calls for a policy framework regulating Chinese
   business activities in Zambia, lest the negative consequences of the
   Sino-Zambian partnership prevail.},

   post-Soviet environmental movement},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {19},
Number = {5},
Pages = {756-781},
Abstract = {Transnational linkages are generally considered advantageous for
   environmental activists who face an unsympathetic government at home.
   Since the early 1990s, Russia's environmentalists have developed a
   number of transnational ties that have increased their leverage over the
   Russian government. However, transnational support interacts with
   domestic constraints on mobilisation in unpredictable ways, generating
   obstacles as well as opportunities. The recentralisation of state power
   in Russia has presented environmentalists with a dilemma as they attempt
   to engage constructively with state bodies that prioritise security and
   economic growth and have little tolerance for autonomous public
   mobilisation or transnationalism. A comparison of environmental
   mobilisation on the extraction of petroleum resources, climate change
   and forestry illustrates the power and limits of transnational influence
   on Russia's environmental movement in a context of renewed state
   authority and economic globalisation. Thus far, Russian
   environmentalists have found it easier to achieve rhetorical change than
   institutional change in environmental governance; institutional change
   appears most likely when environmental and economic goals coincide.},

Abstract = {Green technologies display unusually strong growth and are well on the
   way to establishing a `mega-trend' in technology development. To exploit
   the associated economic opportunities, many industrialised countries
   have started to follow an innovation-oriented approach to environmental
   policy. Against this background, the ways are examined in which
   environmental policy can effectively `govern' technological change and
   secure environmental improvements. What is needed is a clear focus on
   prioritising the ecological effectiveness of environmental innovations,
   devising `smart regulation' through instrument mixes and addressing the
   inherent limitations of innovation-oriented policies.},

Journal = {CRITICAL POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {4},
Number = {3},
Pages = {222-233},
Abstract = {Democratic legitimacy in the carbon fuel era has been based on popular
   acceptance of elitist democracy in return for economic growth and rising
   material standards of living. This social contract of consumption is
   coming to an end with climate change adaptation and ecological limits to
   growth. This article argues that a new era characterized by a social
   covenant of ecological trusteeship is necessary. Will the politics and
   governance of this new covenant necessarily be elitist and
   authoritarian, or can it be democratic in new ways? The article
   discusses the nature and prospects for a future democratic governance
   that remains liberal in its respect for human rights and the rule of
   law, but is more deliberative and civic in its orientation than interest
   group liberalism has been. Key concepts of ecological literacy and
   ecological democratic citizenship are discussed. Literacy is understood
   as a function of both information and empowerment. A model of
   citizenship as trusteeship is defended against the notion of citizenship
   as rational-choice consumerism. Deliberation as distinct from
   bargaining, and dialogic judgment rather than monologic assessment of
   interests, are defended as the appropriate forms of policy making and
   policy analysis.},

Volume = {3},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {336-356},
Abstract = {This article introduces cultural political economy as a distinctive
   approach in the social sciences, including policy studies. The version
   presented here combines critical semiotic analysis and critical
   political economy. It grounds its approach to both in the practical
   necessities of complexity reduction and the role of meaning-making and
   structuration in turning unstructured into structured complexity as a
   basis for `going on' in the world. It explores both semiosis and
   structuration in terms of the evolutionary mechanisms of variation,
   selection, and retention and, in this context, also highlights the role
   of specific forms of agency and specific technologies. These general
   propositions are illustrated from `economic imaginaries' (other types of
   imaginary could have been examined) and their relevance to economic
   policy. Brief comments on crisisinterpretation and crisis-management
   give this example some substance. The conclusion notes some implications
   for research in critical policy studies.},

Pages = {21-38},
Abstract = {German Chancellor Angela Merkel's policy toward Greece's fiscal crisis,
   as it developed from late 2009 to April 2010, was folly in many senses
   of the term. It failed to anticipate the speed with which, and the
   extent to which, the crisis would spread. It cost much more than
   immediate support to Greece through its painful fiscal consolidation
   would have cost. And it reinforced stereotypes and prejudices that
   obscure the true weakness at the heart of the European Union and its
   single currency. But while the measures taken in early May may calm the
   markets temporarily they will not solve the underlying problem. So long
   as countries in the eurozone can borrow without market sanction,
   politicians will find a way to dig themselves unsustainably into debt.
   Threatening them with sanction is no solution either. The best way
   forward is to place restrictions on access to credit rather than trying
   to control the build-up of debt.},

Abstract = {While sociological concepts have often been implicitly used in
   International Relations (IR), recent years have seen a more explicit
   engagement between IR and Sociology. As with any such interdisciplinary
   assignation, there are both possibilities and challenges contained
   within this move: possibilities in terms of reducing IR's intellectual
   autism and opening the discipline towards potentially fertile terrain
   that was never, actually, that distant; challenges in that
   interdisciplinary raiding parties can often serve as pseudonyms for
   cannibalism, shallowness and dilettantism. This forum reviews the
   sociological turn in IR and interrogates it from a novel vantage
   point-how sociologists themselves approach IR concepts, debates and
   issues. Three sociological approaches-classical social theory,
   historical sociology and Foucauldian analysis-are critically deployed to
   illuminate IR concerns. In this way, the forum offers the possibility of
   (re) establishing exchanges between the two disciplines premised on a
   firmer grasp of social theory itself. The result is a potentially more
   fruitful sociological turn, one with significant benefits for IR as a
   whole.},

Abstract = {This article demonstrates that, contrary to the common image of Islam in
   Malaysia as being predominantly liberal, a conservative and
   authoritarian Islam frequently prevails. State-sanctioned interventions
   into the minutiae of people's daily and moral lives often take place.
   Drawing particularly on Cornelius Castoriadis's idea of autonomy and Roy
   Rappaport's notion of oversanctification, the author argues that such
   interventions may have a number of negative effects, including putting
   at risk the wider basis on which State and religious authority rests.},

Title = {Learning About Our Shameful Past: A Socio-Psychological Analysis of
   Present-Day Historical Narratives of Italian Colonial Wars},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT AND VIOLENCE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {4},
Number = {1},
Pages = {11-27},
Abstract = {A computer-assisted content analysis (Bolasco 2000) of seven textbooks
   currently used for history teaching in Italian high schools was carried
   out to examine to what extent past atrocities perpetrated during Italy's
   African colonial wars are acknowledged and taught. More specifically, we
   investigated the relative importance these texts devote to teaching
   established historical facts or to achieve socio-psychological aims,
   such as advancing reconciliation processes and protecting the in-group's
   social identity. Social psychologists working in the field of intergroup
   reconciliation usually consider these two aims as partially competing.
   The models reviewed by Nadler et al. (2008a) all consider the need to
   protect personal social identity as a source of biases, which the search
   for historical truth has to accommodate. In contrast, a recent work by
   Pratto and Glasford (2008) stresses that social identity can play a
   positive role as a powerful motivation for reconciliation. They suggest
   that acknowledging historical faults may assist the difficult process of
   finding a balance between the need for self-esteem and self-integrity
   and the need to belong. Our results seem to confirm certain aspects of
   the first group of models, and other aspects of Pratto and Glasford's
   review. The crucial point seems to be the use of abstract or concrete
   terms to describe in-group wrongdoings. Strikingly, more than seventy
   years after the Italian colonial wars only three textbooks out of seven
   fully describe atrocities perpetrated by the in-group using clear,
   concrete terminology; this is consistent with the idea of a tension
   between reconciliation and justice. On the other hand, the more concrete
   descriptions, although less frequent, seem better able to protect the
   in-group's self-integrity by showing their young readers a clearer
   acceptance of moral responsibility for the historical faults of their
   group.},

Abstract = {In the study of risk regulation, grid-group cultural theory has
   attracted considerable interest. There has, however, been a lack of a
   systematic interest in its claims and in methodological issues. In this
   article, we present five claims that are drawn from cultural theory and
   assess them in the light of failure in meat inspections in Germany.
   These claims are assessed through the analysis of argumentation as
   recorded in newspapers. In the light of its empirical findings, this
   article argues that the claims and methodology employed offer a
   promising avenue for further work to investigate the usefulness of this
   particular theoretical approach.},

Abstract = {Purpose - The aim of this exploratory study is to assess the impact of
   role clarity and concern for the other party's goals on soldiers'
   negotiations with members of the local population within a combat zone.
   Design/methodology/approach - Following the Dual Concerns Model it was
   hypothesized that soldiers experiencing high concern for the needs of
   their Iraqi counterparts would engage in: higher levels of problem
   solving behavior; report greater trust in their counterparts; and reach
   more mutually satisfying agreements under conditions of role clarity
   relative to role ambiguity. A total of 42 officers and non-commissioned
   officers serving in Iraq participated in the study.
   Findings - The results supported the prediction that role clarity
   moderates the relationship between concern for the other party's needs
   and various outcomes of the negotiation process.
   Research limitations/implications - The study involved a small
   convenience sample, cross-sectional design, and a single source of data
   for all measures. Nonetheless, the results are consistent with other
   studies examining the theoretical assumptions of the Dual Concern Model
   and suggest that role clarity may serve as a useful operationalization
   of high self-concern and high resistance to yielding.
   Originality/value - The study advances knowledge about soldiers' ability
   to negotiate mutually satisfying agreements with members of the local
   population. It points to the need to combine a policy of collaboration
   with local civilians with the communication of a clear set of overall
   mission and specific negotiation goals and objectives.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},

Pages = {799-817},
Abstract = {Small states face disadvantages in shaping European policies owing to
   their limited bargaining power and constrained financial resources
   necessary for building up policy expertise and exerting influence via
   arguing. Nevertheless, small states can apply a variety of strategies to
   counterbalance size-related difficulties. Although such activity is an
   important precondition for success in negotiations, this article shows
   that some small states are considerably more active in using
   counter-balancing strategies than others. To explain this, the article
   tests hypotheses on learning, co-ordination mechanisms and legitimacy.
   It shows that small states are most active in negotiations if they have
   non-interrupted administrative work environments, motivated staff,
   balanced systems for the development of national positions, and have
   experienced a learning curve through long membership durations and
   through holding the office of the Presidency. By contrast, differences
   in specific or diffuse support of European integration do not influence
   activity levels.},

Abstract = {In 2004, the Norwegian Parliament amended Article 100 of the
   Constitution, replacing freedom of print with freedom of expression.
   This article argues that the purpose of the amendment was not to expand
   freedom of speech, but to protect the state and political parties
   against the growing power of a non-partisan media system and of a new
   type of political party capable of exploiting the politically
   emancipated media for its purpose. As the amendment may cause government
   failure, the article suggests that in a political system based on the
   exploitation of independent media, the Constitution will once more be
   amended, giving more responsibility to the media and returning the
   responsibility of the state to that of correcting market failure.},

   Analysis},
Journal = {TERRORISM AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {22},
Number = {2},
Pages = {198-215},
Abstract = {During the late 1970s, Turkey experienced a major campaign of political
   terrorism that was waged by a multiplicity of leftist, ultranationalist,
   and separatist groups. Between 1976 and 1980, more than 5000 people lost
   their lives in hundreds of terrorist incidents. The steady escalation of
   violence amidst a major political and economic crisis undermined the
   country's fragile democratic system and paved the way for a military
   coup in September 1980. This study examines the origins and growth of
   the terrorist movement in Turkey, the main characteristics of political
   violence, and the causes of the dramatic escalation of terrorism in the
   late 1970s. The study suggests that although state-sponsored terrorism
   against Turkey facilitated the rapid proliferation of leftist, rightist,
   and separatist armed extremist groups, the drift into total terrorism
   was largely the product of domestic political and social developments.},

Title = {Evolutions of the competition state in Latin America: power,
   contestation and neo-liberal populism},
Journal = {POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {31},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {39-56},
Abstract = {This contribution argues that competition state theory unduly
   marginalises the political dimensions of state reform. Institutional
   reform is not simply political in the sense that policies are contested,
   but because reform reshapes the very nature, process and possibilities
   of politics itself. I argue that the competition state project has
   sought to enforce new technologies of power and discipline across
   socioeconomic life by enforcing new ways of (and limits to) doing
   politics within the paradigm of an abstract `global competitiveness'.
   The discourse of competitiveness, therefore, is not merely a response to
   a changing external environment in an era of globalisation but a
   representative of a determined political project in the context of
   distinct social struggles. The article traces this argument through a
   discussion of neo-liberal reform in Latin America generally and Chile
   specifically.},

Journal = {PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION},

Volume = {88},

Abstract = {A number of countries use forms of interactive policy-making to increase
   the influence of citizens on decision making. Since there has also been
   an increase in citizen participation in The Netherlands over the last
   decade, in this paper, we provide a comparative analysis of 8
   interactive projects initiated by the Dutch central government. The
   central aim of the paper is to understand processes of power in
   interactive policy-making. We do so by raising two central questions: (
   1) how do power processes influence the setting-up of a project, the
   negotiations within a project and the translation of the results of
   interactive projects into formal decision making circuits?; ( 2) to what
   extent and under what conditions do citizens and other stakeholders
   obtain influence in interactive projects, especially in defining
   problems, selecting solutions/instruments and realizing outcomes? Our
   findings show there is relatively little translation of the outcomes of
   the projects in regular decision making.},

Abstract = {This article offers an analysis of China's Africa policy that, while
   maintaining the connection with economics, emphasizes China's concern
   with its reputation, soft power and other international players'
   competition in Africa. Also, Chinese-African relations can be properly
   understood only by adopting a ``longitudinal perspective{''}. This
   allows one to understand their specificities as well as why African
   governments have responded so positively (in general) to China's
   presence. Also, this perspective focuses on the current, rejuvenated
   `scramble for Africa' in order to explain why China's Africa policy
   today is so accommodating. For given the competition between
   international powers on the continent, China faces constraints and its
   dominance on the continent has been much exaggerated.},

Abstract = {This article examines the internal and external reactions by post-Soviet
   autocrats to the colored revolutions. First, the colored revolutions
   provoked incumbents in Azerbaijan, Be laws, Kazakhstan, Russia, and
   other post-Soviet countries to strengthen domestic efforts to preempt
   opposition challenges. Preemptive measures included restrictions on
   independent civil society, disruptions of independent electoral
   monitoring, promotion of pro-government civil society groups, and
   assaults on opposition and democracy assistance. Such actions, together
   with already existing endowments, allowed these regimes to survive.
   Next, the colored revolutions stimulated increased coordination among
   non-democratic states to squash opposition. Measures included
   counter-monitoring of elections to offset Western claims of fraud, and
   increased efforts at military and economic cooperation such as the
   Shanghai Cooperation Organization. Simultaneously, Russia sought to
   destabilize Georgia and Ukraine through economic and, in Georgia,
   military pressure. This authoritarian backlash following the colored
   revolutions buttressed the surviving autocracies, which prospects for
   democratization have become even more bleak and distant. (C) 2010

Abstract = {The Taiwan Strait has often been referred to as one of the world's most
   dangerous hotspots and many dire predictions have been made about a
   military conflict between mainland China and Taiwan, likely involving
   the United States. Yet, despite several crises in the Taiwan Strait and
   numerous war speculations, there has been no major armed conflict
   between Beijing and Taipei since the 1950s. How do we explain the puzzle
   that an expected war across the Taiwan Strait did not happen after all?
   This paper first examines the explanations based on military balance of
   power. Having found the realist/rationalist explanations less
   convincing, however, this study explores the explanatory power of the
   ``ethnicity{''} factor. It suggests that when the Chinese society is no
   longer divided by ideological differences, the ``ethnicity{''} may
   provide a more convincing explanation of why a military conflict has not
   happened in the Taiwan Strait in the past four decades. This paper also
   considers several counterarguments, including the neo-liberal argument
   of economic integration as a driving force for peace in the age of
   globalization. The paper concludes with a discussion of some policy
   implications resulting from the ``ethnic peace{''} thesis and proposes
   that when actively promoted by the both sides, the Chinese ethnic
   identity is likely to be the most important strategic guarantee of peace
   and stability in the Taiwan Strait for many years to come.},

Abstract = {This research offers a general framework for thinking about how
   individual disposition towards risk influences public policy opinions.
   Affinity for or aversion to risk is, in part, a stable personality
   characteristic that interacts with risk and reward messages in complex
   policy debates. We examine the implications of this for public opinions
   about free trade with extensions to immigration policy. We argue and
   find that opinions about policy depend jointly upon one's exposure to
   potential gains or losses and one's risk orientation. The findings have
   implications for crafting and framing public policies because they
   highlight how individual characteristics are likely to shape the public
   response to policy proposals. Our findings suggest that there may be
   limits, in the aggregate, to the degree to which elites can alter the
   level of support for policies through framing or through offering
   risk-mitigating policy provisions.},

Abstract = {In recent years, interest has grown in promoting and employing
   ``evidence-based policymaking.{''} This has been accompanied by an
   increase in available information about the performance of public
   policies. While existing research concludes that evidence about ``what
   works{''} rarely prevails in democratic politics, it is inconclusive
   about which conditions affect the relevance of such evidence in
   decision-making processes. This article aims first to clarify these
   conditions, and second, to present empirical findings from two case
   studies of road safety policy revision. The findings show how the
   creation and diffusion, as well as the political context, affect the
   role evidence plays in legislative policy revision in Switzerland.},

Abstract = {Mississippi's contemporary revisiting of racial violence that marred the
   state's transition from a white supremacist political order,
   colloquially known as Jim Crow, to a post-Jim Crow polity constitutes a
   valuable case study for transitional justice scholarship and practice.
   It is within the context of an often overlooked yet violently contested
   transition that transitional justice discourses have increasingly
   permeated debates on how, and even whether or not, to confront
   Mississippi's violent past. Mississippi's recent attempts to confront
   past abuses through criminal prosecutions and non-state community-based
   initiatives provides an important insight into the limits of criminal
   prosecutions and a growing turn towards the establishment of a truth
   commission to confront past human rights abuses perpetrated within the
   state.},

Title = {Regulation and Economic Globalization: Prospects and Limits of Private
   Governance},
Journal = {BUSINESS AND POLITICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {12},
Number = {3, SI},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {dCorporate codes of conduct, product certifications, process standards,
   and other voluntary, non-governmental forms of private governance have
   proliferated in the last two decades. These innovations are a response
   to social pressures unleashed by globalization and the inadequacy of
   governmental institutions for addressing its social and environmental
   impacts. Private governance has had some notable successes, but there
   are clear limits to what it alone can be expected to accomplish. We
   hypothesize that the effectiveness of private governance depends on four
   main factors: 1) the structure of the particular global value chain in
   which production takes place; 2) the extent to which demand for a firm's
   products relies on its brand identity; 3) the possibilities for
   collective action by consumers, workers, or other activists to exert
   pressure on producers; and 4) the extent to which commercial interests
   of lead firms align with social and environmental concerns. Taken
   together, these hypotheses suggest that private governance will flourish
   in only a limited set of circumstances. With the trend towards
   consolidation of production in the largest developing countries,
   however, we also see a strengthening of some forms of public governance.
   Private governance will not disappear, but it will be linked to emerging
   forms of multi-stakeholder institutions.},

Journal = {POLICY AND POLITICS},

Volume = {38},
Number = {3},
Pages = {389-406},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This article analyses the capacity of a single political party - New
   Labour in the UK - to engender politics and policy. It draws on
   Kingdon's (1984) policy streams approach to demonstrate how with the
   election of New Labour in 1997 a window of opportunity emerged for
   gender changes in political representation, governance and policy terms.
   It argues that the commitment to engendering politics was an important
   step towards engendering policy, but that policy promoting gender
   equality does not automatically follow from more gender-balanced
   political representation. Despite some successes, gendered policy change
   is constrained by: the way gendered policy problems are framed; the slow
   pace of change in institutions of politics and governance; and the
   limits posed by policy solutions that had to fit with the dominant
   liberal market economic approach.},

Title = {Stability and Punctuations in Public Spending: A Comparative Study of
   Budget Functions},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION RESEARCH AND THEORY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {20},

Abstract = {This article provides a comprehensive analysis of stability and
   punctuations in public spending within and across two different
   countries-Denmark and the United States. The theoretical starting point
   is the classic model of budget incrementalism and Jones and
   Baumgartner's model of disproportionate information processing. First,
   despite the clear differences in institutional setup, we show that
   public spending spanning many decades in Denmark and the United States
   are characterized by a similar distribution of small-, medium-, and
   large-scale spending changes. What is more intriguing is that we show
   how this aggregate result obscures (1) substantial variation between
   categories of public spending and (2) similar tendencies within similar
   spending categories across the two countries. These findings suggest
   that we need to unpack the overall budgets for detecting the particular
   sources of stability and change in government spending. Hence, the
   article offers important comparative findings that not only challenge
   the empirical validity of classic budgetary incrementalism but also
   advocate an increased focus on more disaggregated spending dynamics than
   employed in previous studies of the model of disproportionate
   information processing.},

Abstract = {This article examines the evolution of budgetary institutions in Estonia
   between 1993 and 2008, with a main focus on rules governing the
   preparation, adoption, and implementation of the state budget. It
   discusses the initial choice of budgetary institutions in 1993 and
   subsequent developments in the light of theoretical propositions put
   forth by the fiscal governance literature. The case of Estonia poses a
   number of puzzles, and the article seeks to explain the institutional
   choices in Estonia: Why did the coalition government opt for a
   delegation mode of fiscal governance in 1993? Why has the preparation
   phase of the budget process evolved toward a contracts approach from
   1994 onward, while the adoption phase has moved closer to a delegation
   mode? The article demonstrates that alongside government type,
   institutional choices can be influenced by lesson-drawing from history,
   examples of other countries, and negative experiences gained in
   legislative budget process.},

Abstract = {This article examines the next stage in the movement towards
   self-government in rural China: that is, the direct election of
   town-level executives. Theoretically, as the article asserts, with the
   mechanisms and statutes currently in place, direct elections at the town
   level could generate a two-pronged disaffection. First, there may be
   alienation between the executives directly elected at the town level and
   those already directly elected at the village level, namely a ``vertical
   organizational alienation.{''} Second, there may be alienation between
   the directly elected ``town executives{''} and the town legislature
   (People's Congress), namely a ``horizontal governmental alienation.{''}
   After describing the possible points of confrontation, the article
   concludes by proposing how such discord can be prevented from arising
   and suggests that until the potential problems attendant on these
   elections have been successfully tackled direct elections at the town
   level should not be extended into other regions.},

Abstract = {In one of the most traditionally hierarchical and ``colonial{''} of the
   Bolivian state apparatuses, the official health sector, attempts since
   2006 by Evo Morales and the MAS government at radical restructuring have
   proved innovative but inconclusive and divisive. Reflecting a series of
   conflicts and contradictions, a number of often fundamentally competing
   scenarios are at work: the institutionalization of traditional medicine,
   the reinterpretation of previous primary health care and community
   participation models, social and ``socialized{''} medicine, and the
   durability of a deeply ingrained vertical health system. The challenges
   and risks inherent in what at heart may be a struggle between cultural
   and political factions and ideologies among the government's public
   health authorities and planners are emblematic of many paradoxes in the
   effort to decolonize the Bolivian state as a whole.},

Abstract = {Nearly fifteen years ago, Audrey Chapman emphasized the importance of
   ascertaining violations of the International Covenant on Economic,
   Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) as a means to enhance its
   enforcement. Today, this violations approach is even more salient given
   the recent adoption of the Optional Protocol to the ICESCR. This article
   focuses on the right to education in the ICESCR to illustrate how
   indicators can be employed to ascertain treaty compliance and
   violations. Indicators are important to enforcing economic, social, and
   cultural rights because they assist in measuring progressive
   realization. The methodology that we propose calls for: 1) analyzing the
   specific language of the treaty that pertains to the right in question;
   2) defining the concept and scope of the right; 3) identifying
   appropriate indicators that correlate with state obligations; 4) setting
   benchmarks to measure progressive realization; and 5) clearly
   identifying violations of the right in question.},

Volume = {32},

Abstract = {Despite the frequency with which scholars have utilized the Political
   Terror Scale (PTS), a surprising number of questions remain regarding
   the origins of the scale, the coding scheme it employs, and its
   conceptualization of ``state terror.{''} This research note attempts to
   clarify these issues. We also take this opportunity to compare the PTS
   with the Cingranelli and Richards Human Rights Data Project (CIRI).
   Although the PTS and CIRI are coded from the same source material and
   capture the same class of human rights violations, we observe some
   important differences between the two that we believe may be of interest
   to scholars in the quantitative human rights community. First, we
   believe that the CIRI claims a level of precision that is not possible
   given the source data from which both datasets are coded. We believe
   that the PTS offers a transparent coding system that recognizes the
   inherent limitations in measuring abuses of physical integrity rights.
   Second, we argue that the CIRI's method of summing across abuse types
   leads to some inappropriate categorizations. For instance, the absence
   of one type of abuse prevents a state from being coded into a more
   repressive overall category regardless of the levels of other types of
   abuse. Lastly, the PTS accounts for the ``range{''} of violence
   committed by the state in short, what segments of the population are
   targeted. We believe that range is an important dimension to consider in
   measuring human rights and one to which CIRI does not attend.},

Abstract = {This article examines what key reform attempts made during the Clinton
   and Bush presidencies reveal about the wider possibilities for social
   policy change in the US. Why were Presidents Clinton and Bush able to
   achieve their goals in some policy realms but not others' As argued,
   institutional variation from one policy area to another largely helps
   answer this question. Yet, the analysis also suggests that paying close
   attention to the strategic ideas of political actors as they interact
   with existing institutions and policy legacies is necessary to fully
   understand the politics of social policy reform.},

Abstract = {The article reflects on the cases of Canada and the United States with a
   twofold theoretical and methodological purpose. Finding differences
   between countries that share the same economic and liberal culture and
   appear to coincide in the same type of capitalism, is convincing
   evidence that the countries' economies are conditioned by the contexts
   and characteristics of political regimes, which gives politics
   preeminence over economy. Moreover, if these countries which are so
   similar diverge as a consequence of politics, this means that the
   economic effects of globalization and the application of economic policy
   recipes are different in every country and are determined by each one's
   political context.},

Abstract = {Direct payments are central to UK independent living and welfare
   modernisation agendas, however, little is known about the local cultures
   of welfare within which they are implemented This article uses eight
   case studies of devolved governance within local authorities and trusts
   to explore the dynamics of implementation cultures at the front line.
   While national and local policies are clearly important, so too are
   political cultures, commissioning practices and interrelationships
   between key stakeholders While local authorities have enjoyed
   considerable discretion and autonomy in this area, the article concludes
   that greater harmonisation may be required in the interests of social
   justice.},

Abstract = {Current reforms in the public sector are characterized by the
   introduction of businesslike incentive structures, in particular the
   introduction of ``pay for performance{''} schemes in public
   institutions. However, the public sector has some specific
   characteristics, which might restrict the naive adoption of pay for
   performance. Our article analyzes whether the impact of pay for
   performance on performance is bound to conditions, and if this is the
   case, under which conditions pay for performance has a positive or a
   negative effect on performance. We explore this contingency in a
   meta-analytic review of previous experimental studies on the effects of
   pay for performance on performance. We further show why pay for
   performance sometimes negatively affects personal efforts. With an
   experimental vignette study we demonstrate (a) that motivation is likely
   to be a key influence on the effect of performance-related pay on
   performance, and (b) that pay for performance is generally more costly
   as it appears because it almost always produces hidden costs of rewards.
   Our findings help to explain the modest success of pay for performance
   in the public sector.},

Abstract = {This article examines contemporary China-Iran relations, focusing on the
   economic and strategic ties that have helped solidify the relationship
   since 1979. We begin with an overview of the arms and technology
   transfers that mark the early years of the relationship, analyzing the
   benefits each side gained from these transactions. In addition to
   discussing the short-term financial benefits behind forging stronger
   ties, we examine how the regional ascent of both states has also
   presented several long term factors that helped motivate their
   cooperation. These developments shed light on the important role the
   U.S. has played, both in terms of where it has tried to intervene and
   what success it has had influencing the Sino-Iranian relationship.},

Abstract = {The left-right schema has long been used in analyzing political
   cleavages in established democracies. This study applies the schema in a
   post-communist context by examining the structuring of political
   attitudes in Slovenia and Croatia. Findings from six public opinion
   surveys in each country during the 1990s demonstrate that left-right
   orientations in both countries are consistently influenced by religious
   beliefs, while an additional dimension focusing on democratization is
   found in Croatia. Economic issues did not constitute a significant axis
   of political competition. Changes and continuities in party locations
   and the basis of vote choice according to party supporters' left-right
   placements are also discussed. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd on

Abstract = {Military planners and other decision makers require advanced early
   warning of impending crises so they can devise effective mitigation
   plans, mobilize resources, and coordinate responses with their foreign
   counterparts. Over the last 40 years, the US government has invested
   generously in several attempts to build crisis forecasting systems that
   were analytically defensible and capable of processing and making sense
   of vast amounts of information in real or near real time. This article
   describes the most recent attempt by the US military to develop an
   Integrated Crisis Early Warning System (ICEWS). Although ICEWS relies
   heavily on social science theories, data, and methods, our experiences
   thus far reveal some strengths and limitations of contemporary
   quantitative approaches to addressing social science questions with real
   world implications. The article concludes with a sketch of a new
   paradigmatic approach-a Computational Social Science Experimentation
   Proving Ground-that could not only improve crisis early warning and
   response, but also revolutionize how social science knowledge is
   developed, evaluated, and applied more broadly.},

Abstract = {Since the end of the Cold War, sub-Saharan African states have
   substantially increased their participation in international
   peacekeeping operations in Africa. Their contributions have become
   highly valued and even facilitated by major powers. This article
   examines why certain African states might contribute more than others to
   peacekeeping. In particular, prominent arguments are considered about
   the primacy of regime security concerns and the dynamics of warlord
   politics in the foreign policymaking of African states, the economic
   incentives of peacekeeping, and the importance of African states'
   concerns over their state legitimacy and territorial integrity. First,
   this study investigates the possibility that peacekeeping might be
   utilized as a diversionary strategy to divert the attention of both an
   African state's military and major powers from a regime's misrule.
   Second, this study examines the extent to which financial and material
   assistance from donor states encourages poorer states to engage in
   peacekeeping. Third, the study investigates whether states with less
   legitimate and more arbitrary borders might have greater incentive to
   contribute to peacekeeping operations to promote the territorial status
   quo in Africa. Empirical evidence from a quantitative analysis across 47
   states of sub-Saharan Africa from 1989 to 2001 suggests that states that
   are poorer, with lower state legitimacy and lower political repression,
   participate more often in regional peacekeeping.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the logic and politics of the range ofmeasures
   undertaken by the non-party caretaker government to reform the political
   sector, particularly political parties, in Bangladesh between January
   2007 and December 2008. It was argued by the military-backed government,
   and supported by civil society, that the reforms were necessary to
   cleanse party politics which was considered to be a serious obstacle to
   the institutionalisation of elections and the consolidation of democracy
   in Bangladesh. The article argues that rather than achieving any major
   success in reforming the party system, measures taken by the non-party
   caretaker government reinforced the `old' party politics characterised,
   among others, by over-concentration of power in the party chief,
   interparty rivalry and suspicion, lack of mutual trust, dynastic
   domination of party leadership, and lack of democratic orientation of
   parties. It examines the factors that account for the resilience of
   `old' party politics and explains its implications for party
   institutionalisation and democratic consolidation in Bangladesh.},

Title = {The maternal health initiative: A global perspective},
Journal = {INTERNASJONAL POLITIKK},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {68},
Number = {1},
Pages = {63+},
Abstract = {At the turn of the millennium, eight overriding goals for global
   development were adopted to be reached by 2015. One of these was a 75 \%
   reduction in mortality of women in relation to pregnancy, delivery and
   abortion, and is the goal that shows least progress. 99 \% of deaths in
   these areas occur in poor countries, and particularly where there is
   gross social inequity. Despite increasing political will at global level
   and among state leaders in recent years, as well as acknowledgement of
   maternal health as a Human Right, the priority given to this issue is
   still too low. The article discusses the different reasons, and examines
   why the global initiative for safe motherhood has made such little
   progress during its 20-year-long existence. To examine generation of
   political priority for global initiatives, a framework is used that
   encompasses the political context, degree of agreement and cooperation
   among the actors, ideas and their presentation, and how the effect of
   the efforts can be measured. Based on this, conclusions are drawn on how
   rationality meets power at different levels, and on how women are losing
   out.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the merging of development and security in Western
   policies vis-a-vis `deficient' states in the Global South, looking at
   the social life of anti-terror policies in Kenya. The attacks on 11
   September 2001 renewed the interest in strong and stable states, leading
   many donors to focus on capacity building and security sector reform. In
   Kenya, the repressive use of these new powers by the Kibaki government
   has created significant resistance and the main external actors have
   taken the local opposition into account and have adapted their
   anti-terror agendas. They have complemented hard security assistance
   with soft interventions aimed at addressing local issues such as
   conflict prevention and development in communities perceived as being
   `at risk' of harbouring terrorists. Representing a more general shift in
   security interventions in Africa, countering terrorism is now presented
   as part of a broader `peace and security' agenda, but despite using new
   methods to engage with so-called crucial parts of the population, this
   repositioning is not a paradigm shift. Despite the different approaches
   and objectives, the various projects have ambiguous effects and donors
   have not abandoned the traditional rationality, which privileges
   homeland protection over civil rights in the recipient country.},

Journal = {PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION},

Volume = {88},

Pages = {479-495},
Abstract = {Because of differences in institutional arrangements, public service
   markets, and national traditions regarding government intervention,
   local public service provision can vary greatly. In this paper we
   compare the procedures adopted by the local governments of The
   Netherlands and Spain in arranging for the provision of solid waste
   collection. We find that Spain faces a problem of consolidation, opting
   more frequently to implement policies of privatization and cooperation,
   at the expense of competition. By contrast, The Netherlands, which has
   larger municipalities on average, resorts somewhat less to privatization
   and cooperation, and more to competition. Both options - cooperation and
   competition - have their merits when striving to strike a balance
   between transaction costs and scale economies. The choices made in
   organizational reform seem to be related to several factors, among which
   the nature of the political system and the size of municipalities appear
   to be relevant.},

Title = {To the thousandth generation: timelessness, Jeffersonian republicanism
   and environmentalism},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {19},
Number = {3},
Pages = {356-373},
Abstract = {Conceptions of developmental change and stability, and their spatial
   implications, are investigated in Jeffersonian republicanism and
   Thoreauvian environmentalism. Both Jefferson and Thoreau associated
   capitalist development with corruption and sought a stable, virtuous,
   materially frugal society in the face of modernisation. The Jeffersonian
   programme of agrarian, republican virtue rested on westward expansion
   and wilderness conquest. This approach was self-defeating: it exhausted
   the land base for agrarianism and promoted a commercial ethos inimical
   to republican virtue. Thoreau tried to address this contradiction by
   seeking stability and virtue through wilderness preservation. Yet both
   Jefferson and Thoreau problematically tried to displace developmental
   change away from a privileged locale and create an ahistorical, timeless
   preserve for virtue, whether agrarian republic or protected wilderness.
   A green republicanism drawing on aspects of Jefferson and Thoreau can
   offer an important critical standpoint on social and ecological change
   under capitalism. However, such a perspective must replace the
   Jeffersonian/Thoreauvian spatial dichotomisation of change and stability
   with a regionalism embracing a spectrum of interrelated locales
   experiencing different degrees of dynamism and permanence.},

Abstract = {The concept of soft power, or symbolic power, offers unexplored
   potential for analysing small state power. This article argues that it
   is a means of virtual enlargement of small states' foreign policy reach
   and presence. If one examines the bases of soft power, it becomes
   evident that small states can utilize their political economy potential,
   models of good governance and diplomatic mediation as forms of power
   that defy their territorial limitations. Case studies of the Vatican
   City State and Singapore illustrate `small state soft power'.},

Pages = {313-339},
Abstract = {Since 1945, has the imposition of democracy by foreign powers been
   limited to five exceptional cases, as claimed by Schmitter, or is it at
   the origin of the two thirds of democracies as maintained by Whitehead ?
   This article proposes a definition of the imposition of democracy and
   analyses 24 of the 40 scenarios of democratization that correspond to
   this definition. It shows that the imposition of democracy has been
   limited to 6 cases, if we take into account only liberal democracies,
   and to 9 cases if we consider liberal and consociational democracies.

Abstract = {Canadian Muslim women, as opposed to their Australian counterparts, have
   attained prominent social status not only in terms of their contribution
   to electoral politics but also in other political spheres. With its
   focus on the Sharia debate, this paper investigates one potential
   explanation for this difference. Challenging Okin's feminist
   perspective, which claims that multiculturalism is an undesirable policy
   for emancipation, it is argued that multiculturalism facilitates agency
   of female members of Muslim communities. A comparative examination of
   the Sharia debate between the two secular countries of Canada and
   Australia demonstrates that the former's more robust multicultural
   polity in terms of responding to requests to adopt the Sharia have not
   only culminated in Muslim women's empowerment but have enhanced their
   political representation. In contrast, Australian Muslim women have
   neither had the opportunity to articulate their position with regard to
   Sharia nor to contribute to an important issue that could have empowered
   them.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study is to provide through an in-depth
   investigation of the Fatah Al-Islam organization, emergence, programs,
   and external links, and the inner operation of this underground
   Salafi-jihadi group. By divulging secret confession statements to the
   public, it has uncovered many of the mysteries that surrounded the
   evolution and goals of the group. On the other hand, and more important,
   it has examined the application of certain conventional approaches to
   the study of terrorist behavior. The findings, based on the biographies
   of FI terrorists, seem to negate much of the advanced explanation about
   political violence. Economic destitution, poverty, lack of education,
   young age, and marital disruption for instances do not determine
   adherence to the group. Members of the jihadi group of FI stem from a
   diversified occupational background, not lacking in education, mature,
   married, and influenced by various motivations, specifically religious
   dogma.},

   Requirements and HAVA},
Journal = {POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {38},
Number = {2},
Pages = {281-302},
Abstract = {This research examines factors that have influenced state choices about
   methods of voter identification practices in the current environment of
   election administration reform. State voter identification practices
   have been an active area of state policy action since 2000. Rival
   explanations for state adoption of voter identification requirements are
   analyzed for three national election cycles following the 2000
   presidential election. State voter identification practices are
   classified according to levels of relative stringency and in terms of
   variation from federal requirements for voter identification under the
   Help America Vote Act of 2002. State decisions to adopt more stringent
   forms of voter identification are significantly influenced by intrastate
   factors including Republican Party control of state government,
   traditionalist state political culture, and greater levels of
   racial/ethnic diversity. Federal review of election practices under the
   Voting Rights Act is positively associated with more moderate approaches
   to voter identification but is not significant over this time period.},

Title = {HOW POLICY-MAKERS (REALLY) UNDERSTAND GLOBALIZATION: THE INTERNAL
   ARCHITECTURE OF ANGLOPHONE GLOBALIZATION DISCOURSE IN EUROPE},
Journal = {PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {88},
Number = {4},
Pages = {903-927},
Abstract = {There is a growing acceptance in the literature of a potentially
   significant causal role for ideas about globalization in shaping the
   trajectory of policy and institutional reform in contemporary Europe.
   Yet we still know remarkably little about policy-makers' understandings
   of globalization, save those they choose to declare publicly. This paper
   contributes to the important task of operationalizing empirically this
   key set of ideational variables. Using factor analysis of new survey
   data collected by the authors it maps and compares UK and Irish
   policy-maker's understandings of, and orientations towards,
   globalization. The analysis reveals considerable similarities in the
   ordering of assumptions and attitudes towards globalization between the
   two country cases and between civil servants and parliamentarians. Yet
   it also shows some subtle and intriguing differences between
   policy-makers' responses in the UK and Ireland and between elected and
   unelected officials. Intriguingly, it also suggests a significant
   disparity between politicians' private understandings and public
   discourses of globalization, with the former less necessitarian in tone
   than the latter. Above all, it suggests that Anglophone globalization
   discourse in Europe is principally structured in terms of a number of
   dimensions which relate to the acceptance or rejection of a series of
   core neoliberal premises. In effect, the terms and internal architecture
   of globalization discourse in the UK and Ireland are defined by
   neoliberal assumptions, to the extent that they provide the core point
   of reference and orientation for even the most sceptical and critical of
   views.},

Journal = {REVIEW OF AFRICAN POLITICAL ECONOMY},

Volume = {37},

Pages = {281-297},
Abstract = {The paper presents a historical sociology of the peasant movement in
   Senegal through three successive periods from its emergence until its
   internationalisation. The analysis shows that recourse to external aid
   has been an integral part of the Senegalese peasant movement, in that
   the movement has developed within a multi-level political space where
   the government of Senegal and external donors play a decisive role.
   However, the peasant movement is also a product of its own dynamics and
   has adjusted its strategies according to the national and international
   political environment.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses two contemporary trends in local decision-making.
   Firstly, there seems to be more centralised decision-making today than
   before in important policy fields such as welfare policy. Secondly,
   informal governance processes outside formal government structures open
   up for a substantial influence from non-elected political actors. The
   paper asserts that there is a connection between the trends, and argues
   that the centralisation tendencies in welfare issues might affect and
   encourage governance processes in other local policy arenas. These
   policy fields are mainly within the so-called `developmental policies'
   that often facilitate more networking and partnership activities in
   `grey areas' between the public, private and civil sectors in collective
   problem solving. Accordingly, more attention should be given to policy
   fields where governance networks operate, and the implications for
   revitalising democratic political participation should be studied. The
   paper concludes that the well-established rationales for local
   self-government and local democracy need to be reconsidered by taking
   into account these new decision-making structures.},

Abstract = {The approval (2003) and enforcement (2005) of a smoking ban in Italy
   have been viewed by many as an unexpectedly successful example of policy
   change. The present paper, by applying a processualist approach,
   concentrates on two policy cycles between 2000 and 2005. These had
   opposing outcomes: an incomplete decisional stage and an authoritative
   decision, enforced two years later. Through the analysis of the
   different phases of agenda setting, alternative specification and
   decision making, we have compared the quality of participation of policy
   entrepreneurs in the two cycles, their political strategies and, in
   these, the relevance of issue image. The case allows us to direct the
   attention of scholars and practitioners to an early phase of the policy
   implementation process - which we have named `transition to practice'.
   This, managed with political strategy, might have strongly contributed
   to the final successful policy outcome.},

Abstract = {A review of the history of one of the most influential Marxist parties
   in Peru, the Partido Comunista del Per-Patria Roja, helps to place the
   militancy of Sendero Luminoso in context. Patria Roja was a powerful
   political party throughout the military dictatorship of the 1960s and
   1970s and a much more representative example of Peruvian Maoism than the
   popularly known Sendero. It played a significant role in the student
   movement and the trade unions and helped to pressure the military
   government onto the road toward re-democratization. While reaffirming
   the need for violent revolution, it pushed the date of the revolution
   into the distant future and adopted as its immediate goal aiding Peru's
   transformation from a dependent colonial nation into a free and
   democratic one.},

Pages = {212-232},
Abstract = {The practical significance of creating `ethnic territorial units' within
   the Russian federation remains unclear. Since 2003 the Russian
   Government has implemented a policy of merging ethnically defined
   autonomous okrugs (districts) into larger units. The former okrugs have
   been replaced by the territories of a `special' status. Some new legal
   provisions refer to these units' ethnic' character. However, examination
   of the new legislation reveals that issues of ethnicity, the protection
   and promotion of minority languages, and the cultural heritage of the
   okrugs have largely been neglected. All the legal acts adopted to date
   are very general in nature and do not provide details of the guarantees
   and obligations necessary to put such policies into practice.},

   Organization},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {17},
Number = {4},
Pages = {581-598},
Abstract = {This article contributes to the debate on the role of norms in European
   Union (EU) foreign policy by looking at EU policies in the making of a
   Consolidated Maritime Labour Convention (MLC). Given the economic
   importance of shipping for many EU members, one would expect the EU to
   promote its economic interests in the International Labour Organization
   (ILO). However, the EU was described as a human rights promoter and had
   positions on the MLC that after common EU implementation will increase
   costs for both ship-owners and national administrations. How can this
   be? I answer by examining the arguments that mobilized the actors to
   agree to the policies conducted, differentiating between three
   ideal-types: pragmatic; ethical-political; and moral arguments. I
   conclude that moral arguments, supporting a thesis that a concern for
   establishing global law for the protection of rights, have been
   particularly important in mobilizing the EU to promote a convention of
   high standards.},

Abstract = {The perception that new immigrants and migrants are unfairly advantaged
   in the allocation of social housing is one of the most frequently cited
   injustices of new immigration in Britain. Tapping into dominant notions
   of the immigrant as folk devil and a long tradition of scapegoating
   blameworthy groups for problems accessing social housing,this debate has
   all the hallmarks of a moral panic, with exaggeration and distortion
   raising public concern to a level disproportionate to any apparent or
   rational threat. This point is reinforced by a review of the experiences
   of new immigrants and migrants within the social housing allocation
   process.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {19},
Number = {2},
Pages = {237-254},
Abstract = {The clean development mechanism (CDM) has been widely considered a
   win-win scenario from which both developed and developing countries
   could benefit. However, in spite of its growing popularity and the
   increasing number of issued certified emission reductions, CDM has not
   been effective in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and helping
   developing countries to achieve sustainable development. By considering
   the case of China, it appears that, although there are fundamental
   weaknesses in the institutional design of CDM, it is the host country's
   domestic conditions that have the biggest impact on CDM's effectiveness.
   The Chinese government has implemented its own rules and regulations,
   and addressed the problems in CDM processes in ways that maximise its
   national interest, whilst preventing non-governmental actors from
   participating in the policy process. The combination of governmental
   intervention and weak non-governmental participation has shaped the
   outcomes of CDM projects in China. The balance between these two
   domestic factors may be critical in influencing the effectiveness of CDM
   governance.},

   Social Groups},
Journal = {EAST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {26},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-24},
Abstract = {Current empirical sociology features a limited set of indicators for
   associating individuals with certain social groups (classes or strata).
   European sociologists rely heavily on such an informative descriptor as
   occupation, which has become institutionalized and thus produces certain
   requirements of human, social and cultural resources for individuals to
   perform the underlying functions. However, this indicator manifests at
   least two substantial restrictions: first, it is natural that certain
   types of economic activity are historically less stable than the social
   classes with which they are associated; and second, Russian history
   demonstrates that in a developed society the system of occupations is
   consistent with its institutional set-up and system of values, which are
   transferred from generation to generation. In Russia specific
   occupations are associated with a certain character of labour yet not
   with particular status characteristics that should result from the
   corporate nature of professional associations. In fact, in that society
   there exists a unique form of social stratification, in which a
   hierarchy of social estates dominates elements of true class
   differentiation.},

Journal = {EAST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {26},
Number = {2},
Pages = {257-275},
Abstract = {The United Russia party has been given the role of the dominant party in
   the Russian political system, both at the national level and in all
   regions. Nevertheless, the party lacks many of the institutional
   characteristics that would allow it to play an autonomous role,
   particularly in regional politics. United Russia lacks an effective
   patronage system; personnel decisions are in the hands of other actors.
   The party is highly centralized, yet subject to pressure from governors
   who are only formally subordinate to the party. Intraparty democracy is
   minimal. and the regional party organs lack financial independence.
   Conflicts among regional elites take the form of a struggle for control
   over the party, and this hinders United Russia's ability to establish
   strong regional organizations. This appears to be the desired outcome;
   the Kremlin uses the party as a screen to conceal its efforts to
   micro-manage regional political developments.},

Abstract = {Purpose - Researchers interested in the positive side of power and
   managers seeking to develop a resourceful workforce seek to understand
   the conditions under which managers use their power to assist and
   encourage employees. This paper aims to address this issue.
   Design/methodology/approach - An experiment conducted in China tested
   the hypothesis that employee performance and relationship with the
   manager affects the use of power.
   Findings - Results indicate that participants used their power to
   provide directly relevant information and encouraged employees who
   demonstrated their need by performing ineffectively. In addition,
   participants with cooperative, compared with competitive and
   independent, goals assisted, encouraged, and felt the responsibility to
   assist their employees.
   Originality/value - Results were interpreted as suggesting that
   demonstrating a clear need for managerial assistance and developing
   cooperative goals are important bases for fostering the positive use of
   power.},

Abstract = {The landscape of the global economy is dotted with institutions that
   regulate investment and trade. In recent years, the number of bilateral
   investment treaties (BITS) and preferential trade agreements (PTAS), in
   particular, has grown at a torrid pace; practically every country is a
   member of at least one-if not many-of these institutions. For all the
   scholarly attention that these institutions have received, however,
   there is little research tying BITS and PTAS together. This is
   surprising, since both aim to increase commerce by making it more
   predictable. The authors seek to fill this gap in the literature. They
   argue that a BIT between a developed and a developing country should
   make it more likely that this pair of states will subsequently form a
   PTA. That said, the wrinkle in the story is that more is not better in
   this regard; the authors further argue that a developing country that
   has many BITS is less likely to conclude a PTA with a wealthy state. The
   authors test these hypotheses using annual data on pairs of developing
   and developed countries between 1960 and 2004 and find strong evidence
   in support of their argument.},
