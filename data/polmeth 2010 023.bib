Abstract = {The 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and
   the Pentagon marked the advent of an unprecedented preoccupation with
   terrorism. Although Australia's actual terrorist risk profile remains
   marginal in comparison with other mortality risks, in times of crisis,
   the reasoned negotiation of risk is marginalised. Drawing on the
   findings of qualitative research, this article offers an analysis of how
   Australians are responding to the threat of terrorism embodied in a
   developing discourse of the war on terror and how they construct their
   perceptions of terrorist risk. The findings implicate community fear as
   a factor that should be considered in the development of counter
   terrorism strategies that emphasize community engagement as a mechanism
   for challenging radicalisation in democratic states.},

Pages = {3-25},
Abstract = {Taking its starting point from the work of John Gray on the continuation
   of religious categories of thought in the mass movements of modernity,
   the article considers the strand of Messianic utopianism within Italian
   Fascism and its effect upon the representation of the country's largest
   colony, Libya. It considers the ways in which those who wrote on Libya
   in the 1930s - government officials, figures within the military,
   wellknown commentators and journalists - participated within a discourse
   that was dominated by eschatological thought, by the notion of an
   established order rapidly coming to an end so as to give way to a
   radically new order. It considers how those who were involved in the
   process of colonisation wrote about their experience of time and how
   they considered the Fascist attempt to reform human consciousness. The
   concluding part of the essay explores the relation, within the writing
   of Italian officials and observers, between the expectation of utopia
   and the justification of the use of terror to suppress opposition to the
   new order that Fascism promised.},

Title = {Beyond methodological nationalism: how multilevel governance affects the
   clash of capitalisms},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {17},
Number = {4},
Pages = {564-580},
Abstract = {This article challenges the methodological nationalism of the
   convergence debate by arguing that multilevel governance destabilizes
   the coalitions thought to underpin liberal and co-ordinated varieties of
   capitalism. Many attempts to explain how coherent production regimes
   emerge and persist assume that some dominant social bloc ensures
   coherence by imposing its interests across all relevant regulatory
   subspheres. This assumption is not tenable in systems of multilevel
   governance. Three features of multilevel governance diminish the scope
   for a homogenous social bloc to ensure a tight coupling of complementary
   regulations. First, the incentives for interest groups to unite at the
   transnational level vary across regulatory subspheres, because the
   transnational scope of legislation adds a `constrain-thy-neighbour'
   dimension to actors' decision-making that may either strengthen or
   weaken interest group cohesion. Second, the strategic opportunities for
   playing multilevel games vary across subspheres. Third, the
   institutional set-up at the supranational level of Europe's multilevel
   polity reduces the capacity of state actors to impose coherence from
   above. To illustrate these claims, the article draws on case studies of
   EU legislative initiatives concerning takeovers and worker
   participation.},

Abstract = {Several studies have analyzed media representations of human rights
   practices, but none has systematically examined whether those
   representations lead to skewed perceptions of repression or abuse. This
   phenomenon, referred to in the literature as the ``information
   paradox,{''} poses serious problems for scholars attempting to gauge the
   extent of human rights violations or to evaluate measures taken to
   remediate them. This article considers whether increased awareness of
   and attention to human rights practices in fact distorts perceptions of
   abuse with an analysis of human rights coverage in two major American
   newspapers, the New York Times and the Washington Post, between 1980 and
   2000. Multivariate regression analyses are employed to identify the
   characteristics of countries that are mentioned in conjunction with
   human rights in these newspapers. Results show that human rights
   coverage tends to be negative, with repressive countries garnering the
   most attention. However, human rights reporting appears not to be
   tainted by an information paradox, inasmuch as coverage does not vary
   systematically by a country's respect for press freedoms, linkage to
   international civil society, or the extensiveness of its communication
   infrastructure.},

Abstract = {This first article in this issue provides a broad introduction to the
   theme of leadership and place for the case studies that follow. The
   article is an opening review which aims to achieve three things: first,
   to explore the idea of place as a distinct setting for leadership;
   second, to summarise the contemporary debate around the need for
   integrated policy approaches for the shaping and re-shaping of place(s)
   in advanced economies; and, third, to point up some of the implications
   for leadership practice that flow from this. The authors argue that
   there is a need to re-examine the contribution of formal political and
   executive leadership in the context of the continuing integrated and
   sustainable development of neighbourhoods, cities, subregions and
   regions. This is done by presenting a range of insights around
   leadership and place-shaping that have not yet fully penetrated the
   academic literature or the policy-maker community.},

Abstract = {The concepts of place-making and place-shaping have grown in prominence
   over recent years, and have been taken up increasingly into public
   policy discourse. As used by many commentators, these concepts assume
   that places are amenable to purposive control under the leadership of
   local agencies of one sort or another including, for example, local
   authorities. The present article explores this assumption by sketching
   out a framework for the investigation of place-making and shaping, a
   framework that focuses particularly upon its governance and leadership.
   It is argued in this context that place-making is an ordering process
   that combines two modes of governance - spontaneous and purposive - only
   one of which (the second) is directly amenable to deliberate control and
   so to leadership of any sort. It is also argued that leadership is a
   relational phenomenon, and that the leadership relationship will on any
   occasion be located somewhere between two poles - between
   leader-dominance and follower-dominance - only one of which (the first)
   is consistent with leadership as this is conventionally understood.
   Drawing upon the findings from a case study of the Oresund cross-border
   region, it is concluded that a less conventional sense of leadership is
   required in the context of place-making and shaping, one that
   acknowledges the importance of spontaneous governance, and that embraces
   the possibility of follower-dominance.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the roles that experts, specialized systems of
   knowledge and law play in the legitimization of private transnational
   governance. Governance of the global political economy and society is
   increasingly being shaped by private actors, institutions and processes
   that operate transnationally, linking local and global orders through
   complex laws and regulatory arrangements. These private governance
   arrangements are legitimized through their claims to possess expert
   knowledge and authority. However, adopting the lenses of critical
   theory, this paper seeks to problematize the tendency to defer
   unquestioningly to expert opinion. It argues that uncritical deference
   to experts is symptomatic of deeper conditions that are linked to the
   dominant form that law takes under contemporary capitalism. This paper
   examines the nexus between knowledge and power and the specific place
   that experts have in the legitimization of private modes of governance
   under contemporary conditions of post-modern legality and late
   capitalism. It advances critical theory as an approach to understanding
   the significance of technological rationality and expert systems of
   knowledge in the reproduction of transnational capitalism and in the
   creation of space for greater reflexivity in governance and the
   enhancement of individual autonomy.},

Abstract = {We present the formalization of regulations intended to ensure airport
   security in the framework of civil aviation. In particular, we describe
   the formal models of two standards, one at the international level and
   the other at the European level. These models are expressed using the
   Focal environment, which is an object-oriented specification and proof
   system. In addition, we show that these models are correct and complete
   thanks to the Zenon automated theorem prover, which is the dedicated
   reasoning support of Focal. Finally, we propose an automatic
   transformation of Focal specifications to UML class diagrams, in order
   to provide a graphical documentation of formal models for developers,
   and in the long-term, for certification authorities.},

Abstract = {Given the record of the US occupation and the profound limitations of
   America's present stature, the Barack Obama administration is right to
   continue to draw down the American presence in Iraq. But in remembering
   the egregious mistakes of its predecessor the administration should not
   claim victory as it exits. It should not, as Vice President Joe Biden
   did in the midst of the de-Ba'athification crisis, claim all is well in
   Baghdad. A more honest and realistic approach would recognise the
   impossible legacy left by the Bush administration. The damage the
   previous administration did so much to encourage would then be minimised
   with the help of US allies and multilateral organisations. In short,
   after seven years of American occupation, it is time to go home.},

   Challenges},
Journal = {PHILIPPINE POLITICAL SCIENCE JOURNAL},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {31},
Number = {54},
Pages = {31-56},
Abstract = {The essay discusses how civil society has found an opening in
   intervening in the decision-making process on the country's negotiating
   position in the World Trade Organization (WTO). It particularly looks at
   political opportunity structures which made this possible including the
   following external and domestic factors: 1) the anti-globalization
   movement which has pressured states to be more transparent and
   accountable to the manner in which WTO policymaking is being undertaken,
   2) the failure of the Uruguay Round to provide the economic benefits to
   the Philippines inducing the government to be more open to civil society
   intervention, 3) the effort of the Department of Agriculture (DA), the
   lead agency for the negotiations of the WTO's Agreement on Agriculture
   (AoA), to bring in civil society players, which was exemplified by the
   DA's establishment of the Task Force on the WTO (Re) Negotiations on the
   Agreement on Agriculture (TF-WAR), and 4) the emergence of
   coalition-building in the WTO, particularly among developing countries.
   However, there are also challenges which civil society groups face such
   as the need for the active involvement of the legislators in the WTO
   negotiations; the institutionalization of civil society participation at
   the local and global levels; and the prioritization of civil society
   strategies on dealing with the WTO and their respective governments.},

Title = {POLICY-LEARNING AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY INTEGRATION IN THE COMMON
   AGRICULTURAL POLICY, 1973-2003},
Journal = {PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {88},
Number = {2},
Pages = {296-314},
Abstract = {This article uses the Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF) (Sabatier and
   Jenkins-Smith 1999; Weible and Sabatier 2007) and a refined version of
   the social learning approach of Peter Hall (1993) to assess and explain
   policy change in the Common (Agricultural) Policy (CAP) with a special
   view on Environmental Policy Integration (EPI). Three stages of EPI are
   discerned that move from central to vertical and later horizontal EPI,
   complementing an impact model of agriculture and the environment with a
   public goods model. Reform debates appear as prolonged and iterative
   battles over the institutionalization of new ideas which are finally
   incorporated into the existing policy framework. The policy network
   increasingly reflects cross-policy interdependencies and includes
   superior authorities, rendering the notion of a policy subsystem
   problematic. Contrary to the social learning model, the major (although
   not the most radical) change proponent dominates the policy community
   while superior authorities tend to intervene on behalf of the status
   quo. The argument is developed on the base of interviews with
   policy-makers in Brussels.},

Journal = {SURVIVAL},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {52},
Number = {4},
Pages = {87-98},
Abstract = {The global financial crisis of 2007-08 and the subsequent recession in
   most European economies has created a new dynamic for defence spending.
   Even before the crisis, the punishing demands of operations on armed
   forces revealed shortfalls in capabilities and the cost of new equipment
   was rising at a rate of 5-10\% per year. As both trends continue,
   European governments now struggling to control public deficits have
   launched a series of austerity measures across the board. In the overall
   scheme of government priorities, defence spending has become
   discretionary and many defence ministers have already been asked to make
   do with less money. There are two basic options in light of these
   developments: either lower ambitions and accept that reduced financial
   resources will lead to reduced capabilities, or use the budget crunch as
   an opportunity to do things differently, to protect capability and
   perhaps even improve it. If budgetary pressure leads to structural
   reforms that eliminate unnecessary legacy capabilities and focus on
   capabilities relevant to present operations and future contingencies,
   this crisis will be a blessing in disguise.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {17},
Number = {4},
Pages = {468-486},
Abstract = {This article analyses the implementation of EU social policy in the
   Southern European member states. When studied by implementation
   research, Portugal, Greece, Italy and Spain are often treated as a
   homogeneous group, and some authors speak of a particular `Southern
   Problem' while others contest this. In this article, we will take issue
   with central explanatory frameworks of this literature - the existence
   of a high level of policy misfit, inefficient administrative and
   political systems, and weak non-state actors and civil societies in
   Southern Europe. We analyse the effects of these factors on the
   timeliness and correctness of implementation in the area of social
   policy. In a first step, we show that images of a homogenous `Southern
   laggard group' are indeed inappropriate. In a second step, we present a
   new explanation of why the Southern countries are not as uniform as
   often supposed: they belong to different `worlds of compliance'.},

Abstract = {Is `Islam' inherently un-or anti-democratic? Is the fact that Islam is
   the majority religion in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA)
   sufficient explanation as to why the region exhibits a decided lack of
   democracy? How, if at all, does globalisation affect democratisation in
   the MENA? To examine these issues, the article is divided into the
   following sections. After a brief introductory section, the second
   section turns to an examination of how Islam and globalisation interact
   in the MENA. The third section examines how globalisation offers both
   challenges and opportunities for Islam. The fourth section is concerned
   with western perceptions of Islam before and after 11 September 2001.
   The fifth section looks at Islam and democratisation in the MENA and
   traces the impact of globalisation. The overall conclusion is that
   globalisation - with its material and non-material characteristics -does
   not have a great impact on democratisation outcomes in the MENA. This is
   mainly because the external factors collected under the rubric of
   globalisation are ultimately less influential in MENA countries which
   have highly influential sets of domestic factors that reflect long
   periods of internal social, cultural and political development.},

Abstract = {In keeping Iran from developing nuclear weapons, the United States
   currently faces five possibilities. Three are unlikely to succeed: Iran
   either cannot produce the bomb or decides for its own reasons not to do
   so; economic sanctions work; or a new regime comes to power and adopts
   radically different foreign policies. Two other possibilities are more
   plausible: either the West accepts an Iranian nuclear weapon and
   deters/contains Iran; or the United States or Israel attacks its nuclear
   facilities. War would be catastrophic; but containment also has
   penalties. Washington should thus reassess core Western and Iranian
   strategic interests; offer security guarantees if Iran credibly abandons
   any pursuit of nuclear weapons and stops other unacceptable behaviour
   (for example support for Hizbullah and Hamas); explore possible
   cooperation with Iran in Iraq and (particularly) Afghanistan; and pursue
   confidence-building measures, such as agreements on incidents at sea,
   freedom of navigation, and counter-piracy cooperation. The United States
   has nothing to lose by trying this approach.},

Abstract = {Over the past four years concern has grown about what is perceived in
   the West to be an increasingly aggressive cyber threat emanating from
   China. The overall impression is that China, which now has close to 400
   million Internet users, has become something of a cyber superpower. But
   while it is highly probable that the Chinese state is exploiting Western
   vulnerabilities in the cyber domain both to collect with minimal risk
   valuable scientific, technological and commercial intelligence and to
   explore weaknesses in military and critical infrastructure systems, this
   is not a one-way street. Beijing too has considerable anxieties and
   vulnerabilities with regard to the Internet. It is important for Western
   policymakers to keep in mind such concerns when dealing with the kinds
   of threats emanating from China.},

Series = {Defense Security and Strategy},
Year = {2010},
Pages = {115-124},
Abstract = {After the conclusion of World War lithe United States adopted the
   national-security strategy of containment. Giving force to this strategy
   is the doctrine of Mutually Assured Destruction. But this
   national-security strategy failed to prevent the attack on the United
   States on September 11, 2001. The failure of this strategy has led
   Barnett {[}2004] to develop and propose a new national-security strategy
   as a successor to containment. His new strategy identifies two new
   problems that have arisen in the national-security sphere, and proposes
   military solutions to each of these problems. Jackson {[}2008] has
   explained why rational policy is also a contribution to the solution of
   the second of these problems, where rational policy is public policy
   that makes Adam Smith's simple system of natural liberty a reality by
   removing barriers to entry in product and resource markets.(1)
   This work identifies an additional contribution that rational policy
   makes to the solution of this second problem. The work explains why
   rational policy produces powerful long-run tendencies toward equality of
   average real wages for homogeneous labor across industries, regions,
   races and sexes, and produces evidence from the United States in support
   of these conclusions. In turn, the work argues that increases in
   equality increase justice. Because rational policy produces ordered
   outcomes that are just, and because ``achieving just and ordered
   connectivity is the main struggle of our age{''} {[}Barnett, 2004, P.
   284], rational policy contributes to the success of this struggle.},

Abstract = {This study is interested in understanding public opinion in Pakistan
   toward terror attacks. Specifically, this study explores (1) the general
   picture of attitudes in Pakistan toward terrorism and (2) which
   individuals are most likely to support terrorism in Pakistan. The study
   aims to give insights into how pervasive a support base exists for
   terrorism as a tactic in Pakistan and it seeks to isolate the
   individual-level traits that account for the variation we see among
   Pakistani Muslims regarding their level of acceptance of terrorism
   against Pakistani and Indian targets. The study finds that a large
   majority of Pakistanis oppose terrorism but terrorism directed at Indian
   targets is more tolerated than terrorism against Pakistani targets. The
   study also finds that those who are most supportive of Talibanization in
   Pakistan are the most supportive of terrorism.},

Title = {China's New Energy-Security Debate},
Journal = {SURVIVAL},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {52},
Number = {3},
Pages = {137-157},
Abstract = {China's debate over what `energy security' is and how it can be achieved
   has evolved considerably over the past decade. raditionally, Chinese
   officials and analysts have been most worried about China's mounting oil
   imports, and they have expressed considerable wariness of international
   energy markets and institutions. This narrow and relatively
   nationalistic view of China's energy-security challenge has been
   challenged on several different fronts, however, particularly in the
   past five years. Prominent analysts now call for a more positive
   approach to international markets and institutions, and some argue that
   external dependence is a less important energy security challenge than
   the shortcomings of China's own energy system. China's broadening debate
   over energy security represents an opportunity for the outside world as
   it engages China on energy and climate change in the years ahead.},

Abstract = {On 22 January 2009, President Barack Obama issued an executive order
   that banned harsh interrogations and restricted legal methods to those
   listed in Army Field Manual 2-22.3. However, there remain concerns that
   the field manual may fail to prevent the continued abuse and torture of
   detainees. This study reexamines the leading social-psychological
   explanations for torture at Abu Ghraib to determine whether the manual
   appears sufficient to prevent future torture. Findings suggest that it
   has significantly curtailed future risks; however, in order to help
   ensure that U.S. soldiers' treatment of foreign detainees is
   consistently humane, additional steps should be taken.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {19},
Number = {6},
Pages = {851-868},
Abstract = {Leading sociologists have approached the climate crisis by emphasising a
   way forward and identifying hopeful directions. What sense is to be made
   of suggestions that we are instead on the brink of a `collapse' in which
   the crisis is not resolved but leads to the end of existing
   civilisation? Partly based on three studies of contemporary opinion in
   the Hunter Valley in Australia, a coal industry centre, this discussion
   is also based on an examination of the public response to climate change
   world wide, the nature of the crisis as understood by science, the
   political response so far and the economic problems of replacing fossil
   fuels. What social theories might help explain what is happening? It is
   concluded that `collapse' can be understood by conceiving capitalist
   society as a social machine, informed by a `social imaginary'.},

Abstract = {This article examines the priority bilateral relations of Brazil, named
   ``strategic partnerships{''}, both because of their tradition and
   historical relevance and due to the existence of political and economic
   cooperation projects. An assessment of these relationships, especially
   under Lula's administration, is made in this work, bearing in mind the
   concept of ``strategic partnerships{''} and its development in Brazilian
   foreign policy. There will be considered partnerships with the US;
   Argentina; Japan; China; India; South Africa and the European Union. In
   the article, the meaning of the increase in these relationships is
   interpreted on the grounds of its significance to the international
   insertion strategy of Brazil.},

Title = {Ties that bind or binds that tie? India's African engagements and the
   political economy of Kenya},
Journal = {REVIEW OF AFRICAN POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {37},
Number = {126},
Pages = {465-482},
Abstract = {This paper analyses contemporary non-Western engagement with Africa
   through the lens of the second most significant, but surprisingly
   neglected, `Asian driver' - India. Much of the literature on India's
   renewed interest in Africa is panoramic, highlighting concepts of
   `South-South' cooperation in ways relatively uncritical of continued
   Indian claims to the Nehruvian moral high ground in the developing
   world. This article, by contrast, focuses on critical realities of
   India's relations with a single country - Kenya, a nation with which
   India has had ostensibly close links due to the historic presence of
   South Asian communities in the region. It critiques notions that
   `diasporic' ties between India and Kenya facilitate contemporary Indian
   economic ambitions. Rather, the paper argues, fractious historical race
   relations in Kenya, and the cynosure of `African' homogenisation of
   `Asians' within an `ethnicised' post-colonial political economy, might
   partially impede Indian ambitions relative to capital-rich foreign
   suitors devoid of such historical baggage. The second major argument
   holds that the specific state-led imperatives of much economic liaison
   within Kenya today favour certain `partners' with statist investment
   models in contrast to India's more explicit, but not absolute, private
   sector-led engagement. Most importantly, analysis within a localised
   African context points to African agency in encounters with the `Asian
   drivers', a term implying a certain unidirectional power flow. The
   competitive interest of a range of `new' suitors has allowed African
   leaders, not least in Kenya as this paper suggests, unprecedented choice
   in international negotiations. The danger, however, is that these new
   liaisons can reify divisive socio-political conflicts in which many
   African nations are mired. This appears to be pertinent to Kenya where
   strains within the elite political sphere are being somewhat exacerbated
   by foreign investment, particularly from China and the Arab world.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {81-99},
Abstract = {In this article I spell out a conception of dignity grounded in African
   moral thinking that provides a plausible philosophical foundation for
   human rights, focusing on the particular human right not to be executed
   by the state. I first demonstrate that the South African Constitutional
   Court's sub-Saharan explanations of why the death penalty is degrading
   all counterintuitively entail that using deadly force against aggressors
   is degrading as well. Then, I draw on one major strand of
   Afro-communitarian thought to develop a novel conception of dignity as
   the view that what is special and inviolable about human nature is our
   capacity for harmonious relationships. I argue that a principle of
   respect for the dignity of such a capacity entails that the death

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},

Volume = {17},

Pages = {619-632},
Abstract = {Today we have three bodies of literature relevant for understanding
   negotiations in international organizations, and they seem like islands
   in the sea, largely independent from one another. Each island has
   established significant relevant knowledge, while not taking the others'
   ideas into account very much. The three are negotiation analysis,
   political economy and constructivist contributions. Each has potential
   value for scholars of the European Union (EU). This divided field, after
   accomplishing much, offers many interesting opportunities for fresh
   research. It faces the prominent challenges of addressing fundamental
   conceptual problems and integrating the separate literatures.},

Title = {Hannah Arendt's ``Right to Have Rights{''}: A Philosophical Context for
   Human Security},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {9},
Number = {3},
Pages = {279-302},
Abstract = {Contemporary international legal theorists and policymakers have
   endorsed the concept of ``human security{''} in an effort to mitigate
   the same categories of suffering that Hannah Arendt sought to address
   with her concept of a ``right to have rights.{''} Like Arendt, human
   security theorists and practitioners today focus on the plight of
   individuals in distress as a consequence of the unrealizability in
   practice of their human rights. But despite the popularity of the goal
   of human security, the content of this concept remains unsettled. This
   article argues that Arendt's notion of a right to have rights offers
   important insights to those who wish to develop the idea of human
   security in a way that primarily serves humanitarian, rather than
   strategic, goals, and who seek an interculturally legitimizable basis
   for human rights, rather than a conventionally universalist foundation.},

Abstract = {Hizbut Tahrir (HT) is a transnational Islamic movement operating in over
   forty-five countries. Literature on HT has focused mainly on its
   activities in Central Asia and Europe. As such, when the HT chapter in
   Indonesia organized the largest-ever political gathering staged by HT,
   many observers were caught by surprise. Yet despite the importance of
   Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia (HTI), little is known about the organization in
   the English-speaking world. This paper is an attempt to present
   empirical data on this group. The paper argues that HTI's usage of
   different mobilization strategies has resulted in its ability to effect
   policy changes in Indonesia.},

Journal = {COMMONWEALTH \& COMPARATIVE POLITICS},

Abstract = {While the transformation of the Indian party system from a predominant
   party system to a highly fragmented multi-party system has been
   investigated, less attention has been paid to the political consequences
   of this change. By analysing an original data set, this paper
   investigates how the fragmentation of the Indian party system has
   affected the stability of Indian legislatures, their ability to
   legislate, and the quality of the law-making process. The analysis
   reveals that as fragmentation increased, legislatures became more
   unstable, produced less legislation, and the quality of the law-making
   process declined. The paper further suggests that these changes may be
   the reason that Indian voters may have less confidence in parliament.},

   rising prices},
Journal = {POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {31},
Number = {5},
Pages = {577-590},
Abstract = {This article analyses current housing market conditions in Australia;
   specifically the factors that have caused increased housing prices in
   recent years and their implications. The article finds that the number
   of home owners with a mortgage and the number of renters have increased.
   For owners with a mortgage, average housing costs escalated
   substantially. Interest rates, investment demand, economic climate,
   financial deregulation and innovation, land supply and the land-use
   planning system, government taxes, levies and charges, demography,
   economic growth and wealth effect all play a vital role in influencing
   housing prices. Rising house prices positively impact on home owners'
   wealth, aggregate demand, employment and real GDP, and reduce
   affordability of first-home buyers and wellbeing of Australians in
   aggregate. It is argued that increasing the supply of housing, approval
   of tax-free savings for first-home buyers, regional development and
   reduction of government taxes, levies and charges should be the focus of
   future policy development to redress these problems.},

Abstract = {Can the three concepts of Neutralization Techniques, Moral
   Disengagement, and Secondary Self-Serving Cognitive Distortions be
   conceived theoretically and empirically as capturing the same cognitive
   processes and thus be measured with one single scale of Moral
   Neutralization? First, we show how the different approaches overlap
   conceptually. Second, in Study 1, we verify that four scales derived
   from the three conceptions of Moral Neutralization are correlated in
   such a way that they can be conceived as measuring the same phenomenon.
   Third, building on the results of Study 1, we derive a unified scale of
   Moral Neutralization which specifically focuses on the neutralization of
   aggression and test it in a large general population sample of
   preadolescents (Study 2). Confirmatory factor analyses suggest a good
   internal consistency and acceptable cross-gender factorial invariance.
   Correlation analyses with related behavioral and cognitive constructs
   corroborate the scale's criterion and convergent validity. In the final
   section we present a possible integration of Moral Neutralization in a
   broader framework of crime causation.},

Abstract = {In counterinsurgency, the population is the center of gravity. This
   insight has become a key doctrinal tenet of modern armed conflict. But
   where does it come from? The razzia, a tactic introduced by the French
   in North Africa around 1840, first thrust tribal populations into the
   focus of modern operational thinking. Soon the pioneering bureaux arabes
   added an administrative, civil, and political element. Eventually, in
   the 1890s, French operations in Madagascar gave rise to a mature
   counterinsurgency doctrine. David Galula, a French writer who heavily
   influenced the American Counterinsurgency manual, is merely the joint
   that connects the nineteenth century to the twenty-first.},

Abstract = {It has become a commonplace to say that war has changed radically since
   the early twentieth century to the point where civilians now comprise
   some 80 or 90\% of war victims. This proposition has been supported by
   many writers and academics, some United Nations agencies, and the
   European Union in its European Security Strategy. Yet it rests on shaky
   foundations. It is possible that in some particular conflicts nine out
   of ten deaths are of civilians, but the proposition does not hold up as
   a generalisation about all war in the past two decades. There is
   persuasive evidence that certain wars have had civilian death tolls far
   lower than 90\%. The proposition, intended to alert the world to the
   importance of protecting civilians, has probably had the unintended
   effect of reinforcing cynicism about efforts to limit the human costs of
   war.},

Abstract = {Since the inauguration of Vladimir Putin as President of the Russian
   Federation in 2000, the principles and practices of federalism have come
   under attack and we have witnessed a recentralisation of power in the
   Kremlin. Over the period 2003-6 a number of major laws were adopted that
   seriously weakened the powers and competencies of federal subjects.
   Moreover, any hopes that the centralizing initiatives of the Putin
   administration would be reversed by President Medvedev have been dashed.
   Inter-governmental relations in Russia are once again conducted in
   accord with Soviet style principles of hierarchy and control. Russia is
   a `quasi-unitary' state masquerading as a federation.},

Abstract = {How does an international organization legitimate reforms for its member
   states that it sees as vital medicine, but its members view as too
   bitter a pill to swallow? International organizations appeal to global
   standards of market civilization to bridge the ``legitimacy gap{''}
   between what the international organization considers optimal reform and
   the member-state as politically feasible reform. Increasingly, however,
   globalized standards call international organization's role into
   question. In particular, the IMF is having problems marrying its
   treatment of all borrowing states with common procedures, a question of
   formal legitimacy, with reform program success through winning the
   ``political will{''} of borrowing state governments, a question of
   substantive legitimacy.
   This article traces the emergence of a global standard of market
   civilization within the IMF by examining how the IMF attempted to close
   the ``legitimacy gap{''} on proposed tax reforms within four East Asian
   states. The IMF's legitimation of tax reform with Indonesia, the
   Philippines, South Korea, and Thailand is assessed for the 1965-2000
   period.},

Abstract = {After 9/11, the exact perception among young Chinese of terrorism and
   security is little known to the world. What are their views and how are
   they formed? Are there any obvious differences in perception between
   young Chinese in different parts of China? What causes this disparity,
   if there is any? Are these differences intentionally created by the
   Chinese party-state top-down, or are they only nurtured in a bottom-up,
   decentralized manner? Using primary research findings obtained from
   original quantitative surveys and qualitative analyses, this article
   attempts to offer an empirical answer to these questions. The article is
   arranged in three sections. The first provides a review of the
   literature on the topic and describes the research methodology used. The
   second offers an analysis of our survey findings on how university
   students from two different cities, Shanghai and Xi'an, evolve
   distinctive perceptions about terrorism and security. The third section
   explains the framework used to analyse our findings, which can be
   summarized as ``the nearer, the more tolerant and the less
   state-centric{''} towards terrorist-related topics. A conclusion
   suggests the possible roles of-and wake-up calls for-the Chinese state
   and the media in light of these disparate perceptions.},

Journal = {CAMBRIDGE REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {23},
Number = {4},
Pages = {561-587},
Abstract = {This article focuses on the Marxist characteristics of North Korea in
   its interpretation of human rights. The author's main argument is that
   many Marxist features pre-existed in Korea. Complying with Marxist
   orthodoxy, North Korea is fundamentally hostile to the notion of human
   rights in capitalist society, which existed in the pre-modern Donghak
   (Eastern Learning) ideology. Rights are strictly contingent upon one's
   class status in North Korea. However, the peasants' rebellion in
   pre-modern Korea was based on class consciousness against the ruling
   class. The supremacy of collective interests sees individual claims for
   human rights as selfish egoism, which was prevalent in Confucian ethics.
   The prioritization of subsistence rights and material welfare over civil
   and political rights was also the foremost important duty of the
   benevolent Confucian king. Finally, unlike Marx's reluctant use of the
   language of `duties', rights are the offspring of citizens' duties in
   North Korean human rights discourse.},

Abstract = {Despite several independent international investigations, there are
   still some unanswered questions concerning the Russian-Georgian conflict
   in August 2008. If the Georgian government was facing an outright
   Russian invasion - as President Mikhail Saakashvili and his ministers
   have argued again and again since the military action ended in 2008 why
   did it not tell its own citizens about it? Indeed, why is there no
   mention of invading Russian troops, but only of South Ossetian
   irregulars and Russian volunteers in the Georgian government's public
   communiques in the hours leading up to the outbreak of war and in the
   first 15-16 hours of the conflict? Or, why were there at least 36
   Russian journalists in the capital of South Ossetia, Tskhinvali, from
   around 2 August to the outbreak of war and during hostilities if the
   Russian government had been taken by surprise, i.e. the official Russian
   explanation, taking into account the strict Russian rules for
   journalistic accreditation? This article is a systematic analysis of the
   Georgian and Russian official explanations for the escalation of
   hostilities.},

   Voting Behavior on Regional Fishery Management Councils},
Journal = {POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {38},
Number = {3},
Pages = {447-464},
Abstract = {This article tests capture theory by analyzing voting behavior on U.S.
   Regional Fishery Management Councils. Some seats on the councils are
   reserved for state and federal agency representatives; others, for
   political appointees. The political appointees primarily represent
   special interests (specifically, commercial and recreational fishing
   interests); a smaller number of appointees represent public interests.
   We use logistic regression to model the vote of state and federal agency
   representatives on the councils as a function of the votes of commercial
   interests, recreational interests, and public interests. We find
   evidence that some state agencies are captured by special interests from
   their states, but not systematic evidence across all states. We find
   that state agency representatives voted with commercial interests from
   their own state in five of the sixteen states in our sample; with
   recreational interests in three states; and with both special interests
   in two states. These ten states support the capture hypothesis; the
   other six states do not. We find no evidence that federal agencies were
   captured on the councils. We conclude that the gubernatorial-driven
   appointment process leads to capture at the state level by promoting
   voting blocs among state agency representatives and special interests
   from those states. Federal agency representatives, by contrast, are
   better able to maintain their distance from state-level politics on the
   councils, and thereby enhance their ability to vote independently on
   fishery management measures.},

Title = {AGENTS OF INFLUENCE: COUNTRY DIRECTORS AT THE WORLD BANK},
Journal = {PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {88},
Number = {1},
Pages = {211-231},
Abstract = {This article seeks to understand the operations of the World Bank by
   examining one particular group of players - the country directors (CDs).
   It argues that the analysis of international organizations (IOs), by
   focusing on the behaviour of their principals (states), as
   principal-agent analysts do, or on organizational cultures, as the
   constructivist approach does, is inadequate in explaining the operation
   and behaviour of IOs, which are themselves complex organizations with
   chains of cascading relationships. Country directors at the World Bank
   occupy a pivotal position in this chain: with executive directors and
   the president as their nominal and ultimate principals, vice presidents
   as their direct principals and client countries as informal principals.
   They are themselves principals to their country team and to some sector
   people. For both conceptual and empirical reasons, therefore, CDs
   deserve separate analysis. To explain the way these relationships shape
   the work CDs do and how they do it, this article examines three basic
   functions of country directors at the Bank: (1) representing the Bank to
   the client countries; (2) representing the country to the Bank; and (3)
   managing the country offices and country programmes. The empirical
   section of this article is based on interviews with over 80 officials in
   both Washington and field offices. We show that an understanding of the
   Bank and its operations requires an examination of its internal
   processes and its staff.},

Abstract = {A large collection of captured documents from the very highest levels of
   the Iraqi government offers a chance to gain insight into why Saddam
   Hussein was unwilling and unable to alter his strategy on the eve of the
   2003 war that toppled his regime. This paper explores some of the
   perceptions and misperceptions that Saddam Hussein took away from the
   1991 Gulf War and shows how they affected his decisionmaking on the eve
   of the war in 2003. It concludes with some thoughts on the policy
   implications of these findings.},

Abstract = {The question of whether democratic institutions facilitate terrorist
   activities is a controversial one in current scientific studies of
   terrorism. Although the ``rule of law'' is an essential institutional
   pillar of any mature democracy, its direct effect on domestic and
   international terrorism remains unexplored. Conceiving democratic rule
   of law as the coexistence of effective and impartial judicial systems
   and citizens' recognition of the law as legitimate, the author presents
   a causal explanation in which a high-quality rule of law is considered
   to dampen ordinary citizens' opportunity and willingness to engage in
   political violence, protecting democracies from becoming victims of
   terrorism. Built on a cross-sectional, time-series data analysis of 131
   countries during the period from 1984 to 2004, the author finds that,
   ceteris paribus, maintaining a sound rule of law notably reduces the
   likelihood of any type of terrorist events. In short, the rule of law
   instantiated in democratic institutions provides a formidable bulwark
   against terrorism.},

Abstract = {One would expect the common agenda of improving the quality of care in
   hospital sectors across nations to bring about a convergence of their
   quality assurance systems. However, one finds great variations in the
   ways in which such schemes are constructed and communicated to the
   general public in different countries. This paper examines three
   universal health care systems (England, Sweden and Japan) and explores
   the degree to which political institutions and public opinions affect
   the processes of quality assurance system building within them. It
   argues that the inputs from governments in response to public concerns
   are the key to understanding the changes in this seemingly
   profession-dominated policy domain; therefore policy changes are
   significantly affected by dynamic interactions between events, public
   discourses and governance structures within these countries. The
   findings also demonstrate that public access to information has begun to
   have a large impact on policy debates in all three countries.},

Abstract = {Georgia has been experiencing robust GDP growth since the Rose
   Revolution despite its formal financial system remaining critically
   underdeveloped. This goes against a strongly supported proposition that
   a country's economic development is followed by a well-developed and
   efficient financial system. In this paper we first explain the shallow
   financial deepening in Georgia and show that the economic growth in
   Georgia has been driven by such determinants as public spending and
   construction works mainly supported by foreign debt and FDI inflow. This
   paper further argues that prolonged civil conflict is one of the
   critical obstacles toward financial development in Georgia. Bank lending
   activity is associated with high level of uncertainty stemming from
   recurrent civil war. Newly privatized commercial banks are excessively
   cautious in expanding their loan assets to private non-financial
   corporations due mainly to the banks' inability to precisely assess
   borrower's risk involving not only with individual financial soundness
   but also with political uncertainty. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd

Abstract = {Since the mid-2000s it has become common, although far from universal,
   to characterise the world as `multipolar'. There has, however, been
   scant attention to how the key protagonists view the changing
   distribution of power. This article sets the stage for this special
   issue of POLITICS, which begins to address that lacuna. It introduces
   the significance of a change in the global balance of power and explores
   how power in the international context is understood and assessed. It
   then makes the case for which actors are the key protagonists in the
   current global distribution of power and contextualises the subsequent
   articles by providing comparative indicators of power across a range of
   dimensions. Drawing on the contributions, this article concludes that
   while the `rules of the game' of international politics probably will
   change, they are unlikely to do so beyond all recognition.},

Title = {Realism and international law: the challenge of John H. Herz},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL THEORY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {2},
Number = {3},
Pages = {410-445},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The proliferation, globalization, and fragmentation of law in world
   politics have fostered an attempt to re-integrate International Law (IL)
   and International Relations (IR) scholarship, but so far the
   contribution of realist theory to this interdisciplinary perspective has
   been meagre. Combining intellectual history, the jurisprudence of IL and
   IR theory, this article provides an analysis of John H. Herz's classical
   realism and its perspective on international law. In retrieving this
   vision, the article emphasizes the political and intellectual context
   from which Herz's realism developed: the study of public law in Germany
   during the interwar period and in particular the contribution of Hans
   Kelsen and the pure theory of law to the study of international law.
   Herz was deeply inspired by Kelsen but he criticized the pure theory for
   ignoring the sociological foundations of law. Following his emigration
   to the United States, Herz embraced realism but without disregarding
   international law. Indeed, his mature, globally oriented realism offers
   a balanced, fruitful perspective for thinking about the relationship
   between politics and law that is deeply relevant for contemporary
   theory: it challenges modern, law-blind variants of realism and holds
   considerable potential for contributing to the approaches that have most
   successfully studied the law-politics nexus.},

Abstract = {This article reports the UK's first design experiment, a qualitative
   form of policy evaluation using feedback from intensive observations of
   an intervention to improve its implementation. The application presented
   in the article is a local authority programme of intensive support and
   diversionary activities for a small group of problematic substance
   users. The article discusses how the experiment took place and focuses
   on the reluctance of policy makers to use feedback from researchers, who
   found that advocacy and one-to-one support were more beneficial than
   diversionary activities. Nonetheless, in time the project's workers
   responded to these signals in their day-to-day decisions. To address the
   feedback gap, the conclusion stresses the importance of ensuring
   multiple information flows within design experiments.},

Abstract = {This article is about the nature of democracy in environmental politics,
   with special reference to the issue of representation, and to the issues
   of speaking and listening. It is argued that politics has always been
   regarded as concerned with `speechifying', and that this has created
   problems for politicising environmental issues, many of which have to do
   with `dumb nature'. The work of Bruno Latour is examined in this context
   as a way of including nature in politics without resorting to
   extravagant claims about `nature speaking'. Latour's epistemological
   approach to `politicising nature' is discussed, and attention is focused
   on the importance for the political (and especially democratic) process
   of `listening' as well as `speaking'.},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This paper investigates the creation and consequences of private
   regulation in global food governance. It points to the power to govern
   and the authority to govern as the two crucial conditions for the
   emergence and diffusion of private food regulation. More specifically,
   the paper argues that the power to govern is a function of the
   structural power of agrifood corporations, particularly retail food
   corporations in our case. The authority to govern is a function of the
   perceived legitimacy of retail food corporations as political actors. By
   linking power and authority to the material and ideational structures
   existing in the global political economy of food, this paper analyses
   the processes that serve to create, maintain and reproduce private
   regulation in food governance. With its analysis, the paper aims to
   contribute to the theoretical and empirical debates on private
   authority, private regulation and the challenges for sustainability in
   the global food system.},

Abstract = {Hundreds of ``eco-labels{''} and ``social labels{''} exist for consumer
   products. These labels claim to provide information about
   characteristics of these products, which consumers cannot directly
   observe but which many of them consider desirable, such as low
   environmental impact, good treatment of workers during production, and
   relatively high prices paid to the local producers of ingredients from
   developing countries. Third-party certifiers are supposed to solve the
   well-known problem that a producer's unilateral declarations lack
   credibility, given the producer's conflict of interest and the
   information asymmetries between producer and consumer. Much of the
   literature on global private regulation-through standards for
   environmental sustainability, corporate social responsibility, among
   others-assumes that third-party certification works (i.e., overcomes the
   problems of producer self-declaration). But closer inspection shows that
   many third-party certifiers lack credibility. This article examines why
   some third party certifiers are more credible than others. In doing so,
   we elucidate the ways in which social capital and trust bolster third
   party certifiers' credibility. The empirical analysis focuses primarily
   on Kosher food labels within the global food supply chain. We then
   explore the consequences of the credibility paradox for other third
   party certified labels that promote social and environmental values.},

Abstract = {IR scholars have recently turned to emotions to understand and explain
   events in world politics. Although this turn is appealing, most scholars
   have failed to critically examine the relationships between emotion,
   language, identity and foreign policy. This article aims to unpack these
   relationships. Drawing upon Sara Ahmed's notion of the `emotionality of
   texts', this article explores how foreign policy may be an affective
   practice, which can be defined as a ritualized practice of discursively
   binding emotions to Others' identities and legitimating foreign policy
   through a discursive logic of feeling. In this way, identities are
   produced and policies are legitimated affectively. Neglecting the
   emotional narratives that constitute Self/Other relations leads to an
   insufficient understanding of emotion in global politics, an incomplete
   understanding of how identities emerge and matter as they do, and
   forecloses new alternatives of apprehending transformative ruptures and
   enduring patterns of Self/Other interaction. Through an analysis of
   United States policy towards the Israeli-Palestinian, this article
   highlights the importance of emotion and affective practices in world
   politics.},

   though comparing the position of the OSCE and the Council of Europe.
   This article considers whether the emerging framework includes: (1) a
   right to legal entity status, (2) a right to establish and run
   charitable or educational institutions, (3) a right to privileges and
   substantive benefits and (4) a right to anything else. It concludes that
   the current developments are welcome because religious freedom has a
   collective aspect that is essential to the lives of many believers.},

   coercion, (2) acculturation, and (3) persuasion. The article argues that
   a powerful international process of diffusion is at work and NHRIs are
   no longer the exclusive preserve of liberal democratic regimes. Instead
   NHRIs have diffused to a wide range of political systems, subjecting
   these human rights institutions to new and often competing demands and
   expectations.},

Abstract = {This paper evaluates the impact of urban sprawl on municipal
   expenditures, considering all the 3,179 Spanish municipalities with more
   than 1,000 inhabitants in 2005. We have ascertained that there is an
   influence of urban sprawl on per capita spending: the higher the
   population density, the lower the total investment and current
   expenditures per capita. This result supports the claims in favour of
   smart growth in municipalities. Furthermore, the economic level exerts a
   positive influence on expenditures per capita. Concerning social
   factors, our data show that population yields economies of scale to a
   limit (the function presents a U-shape): from the point of the minimum
   per-capita spending, if the population keeps on growing, per-capita
   spending rises.},

Abstract = {Why do some public organizations grow old and others die young? Since
   Herbert Kaufman first posed this question, considerable research has
   been devoted to answering it. The findings of that research suggest that
   the design of new public organizations affects, to a significant degree,
   their survival chances. In this article, we test whether and how
   ``design factors{''} affected the durability of the so-called New Deal
   organizations initiated under FDR's first term. Our findings confirm
   that design factors do matter, but their effects change over time. We
   draw out some potential implications for institutional design and sketch
   a renewed research agenda to determine why some public organizations
   survive environmental pressure whereas others succumb to it.},

Title = {A silent revolution? New management ideas and the reinvention of
   European public employment services},
Journal = {SOCIO-ECONOMIC REVIEW},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {8},
Number = {3},
Pages = {461-486},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Labour-market policy regimes are in flux, not only because of the
   introduction of activation policies but also because of changes in the
   governance of public employment services (PESs). This paper argues that
   PESs have been fundamentally transformed due to the `discovery' of New
   Public Management ideas. In the European context, these ideas first
   emerged in the UK and Sweden, were subsequently diffused through the
   Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the European
   Union and then internalized by critical epistemic communities, including
   the network of the heads of PESs and the World Association of PESs.
   Through the acceptance, diffusion and internalization of these new
   management ideas, common governance practices, including performance,
   quality and case management, have been widely adopted in Europe.
   Policy-makers have failed, however, to agree on a `best-practice' model
   with respect to the local organization of labour-market policy delivery.
   Consequently, no hegemonic idea was established, and significant
   national differences continue to persist.},

Abstract = {One of the most basic charges levelled at the consociational model is
   that, although it may provide for conflict management, it fails to
   provide for the longer-term goal of conflict resolution. This article
   seeks to respond to this charge by viewing the consociational model
   through a deliberative democratic lens. In particular, I argue that
   deliberative democracy provides normative standards that can inform the
   design of consociational institutions in ways that encourage political
   leaders to focus on the interests of everyone in society, rather than
   merely on the interests of their own ethnic group. In so far as
   consociational institutions, deliberatively conceived, can have this
   effect, there is in principle no reason why they might not also provide
   for conflict resolution.},

Abstract = {We examine relations of personal value priorities to identification with
   one's nation. We hypothesize that relations of values to identification
   depend on the motivations that can be attained by identifying with a
   nation. Study 1 confirmed the hypothesis that identification with one's
   nation correlates positively with conservation values and negatively
   with openness to change values in Israel and the USA. Moreover, values
   predicted identification with the nation above and beyond Right-Wing
   Authoritarianism. Study 2 showed that increasing the salience of
   conservation values produced higher identification with Israel, whereas
   increasing the salience of openness to change values produced lower
   identification. Study 3 tested the hypothesis that when identification
   with a national group conflicts with social expectations it has
   different, even reversed relations with value priorities. We examined
   identification of recent immigrants to Israel. The more pressure
   immigrants felt to assimilate, the more positive the correlation of
   conservation values with identification with the country of residence
   (Israel) and the more negative the correlation of conservation values
   with identification with the country of origin (Russia). Taken together,
   the findings point to the utility of values in revealing the
   motivational functions of identification with a nation.},

Abstract = {This article takes a closer look at multiparty wars in the modern state
   system. Because wars are different, a classification system of
   interstate wars is useful for theoretical concerns and empirical
   testing. We label multiparty wars ``complex{''} because we believe that
   the processes that bring them about are much more complicated and
   difficult to understand than dyadic wars. Complex wars are identified
   and classified on the basis of their size, the issue that gives rise to
   them, and whether they are preceded by certain behavioral processes. To
   see if the classification is empirically useful, a set of empirical
   expectations on which wars should differ is derived and employed to
   conduct a series of tests. It is found that dyadic wars are associated
   with different patterns from complex wars, and that within the set of
   complex wars, the larger wars differ from the smaller ones on several
   dimensions. It is also found that larger wars and wars over certain
   issues are likely to be preceded by different behavioral processes,
   especially in terms of the use of power politics practices. The
   classification breaks down each complex war into its component dyadic
   participants on a number of variables so that one can compare
   originating dyads with each joiner dyad to show how wars differ
   according to type.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the propaganda campaign orchestrated by the Russian
   authorities with the aim of promoting a version of the country's history
   for political purposes. This version puts the accent on the
   exceptionality of Russian historical development, and is geared to
   endowing the figure of Vladimir Rutin - seen as the person who has
   succeeded in carrying out a number of national projects that have been
   frequently abandoned throughout Russian history. The analysis presented
   here centres on two channels used in the campaign: school textbooks and
   the film industry. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The

Title = {Comparative regional integration in the EU and East Asia: Moving beyond
   integration snobbery},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICS},

Pages = {308-323},

Abstract = {In comparative regional integration (RI) analysis, the European Union's
   (EU) advancing of its own experience as a model is a significant
   problem. This article explores this problem by focusing on comparative
   aspects of RI in the EU and East Asia. It argues that there are
   important and valid aspects of comparison, such as the origins and
   objectives of these two regions, but fewer points of comparison between
   the two when it comes to achieving their objectives. It suggests that
   historical differences between the two regions constitute the major
   reason that a direct comparison is neither useful nor productive. It
   analyses the centrality and the exceptionalism of the EU in much of the
   comparative RI literature. It agues that the promotion of the EU
   experience as a form of model or paradigm is far from analytically
   helpful - the method of comparative analysis needs be the focus of our
   study as much as the objects of comparison. The article examines how the
   centrality of the EU in some analysis can amount to a form of de facto
   snobbery in the positioning of the EU on a rather unsteady pedestal.
   This `integration snobbery' - to coin a phrase utilized by an EU
   official - is not constructive for comparative analysis of the EU and
   East Asia. International Politics (2010) 47, 308-323.

   Perspective},
Journal = {GLOBAL POLICY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {1},
Number = {2},
Pages = {191-200},

Abstract = {Asia was not directly or significantly hurt through financial channels
   by the global financial crisis, but rather was hurt through trade
   channels. This article reviews the current regulatory reforms of global
   financial markets and how these affect Asia. The current crisis has
   exposed many weaknesses in the existing financial architecture,
   including the fragmentation of regulatory jurisdiction at the national
   and institutional levels. What is required is a system-wide and global
   view of market behaviour. The article uses a network perspective to
   analyse the issues and to propose solutions. The globalisation of
   finance and its fragmented regulatory oversight is a collective action
   problem that easily slips into a tragedy of the commons. Given the fact
   that there is no unanimity of views on how finance should be structured,
   there are differences in approaches to the reforms. Because Asian
   financial institutions and structures are less sophisticated, Asia is
   still struggling with how to make the financial system more efficient
   and responsive to real sector needs. The article suggests that Asia
   needs to identify its financial needs and can develop its markets
   through greater regional cooperation. Identifying the need to see
   financial markets as ecosystems through diversity, the article suggests
   that Asia can evolve through simpler but more robust financial systems.},

Journal = {LATIN AMERICAN PERSPECTIVES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {37},
Number = {3},
Pages = {51-70},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {During the short-lived government of Carlos Mesa (October 17, 2003 June
   6, 2005), Bolivian society was intensely divided along the lines of
   class, race, and region. Out of this context, two social blocs emerged:
   a left-indigenous bloc, constituted by worker and peasant organizations
   based in La Paz, Cochabamba, Oruro, Potosi, and Chuquisaca, and an
   eastern-bourgeois bloc, constituted by groups representing
   agro-industrial, financial, and petroleum capital in the Departments of
   Santa Cruz, Tarija, Pando, and Beni. The Movimiento al Socialismo
   (Movement Toward Socialism-MAS) party and fractions of the middle class
   were oscillating forces that belonged to neither side. Mesa attempted to
   play a mediating, Bonapartist role between the social blocs but
   ultimately failed, and his government collapsed. Thus the stage was set
   for Evo Morales's successful bid to become the country's first
   indigenous president in the elections of December 2005. Understanding
   this decisive interval in Bolivian history is crucial for fully coming
   to terms with the reformist character of the Morales government today.
   The nonrevolutionary trajectory of the MAS administration since 2005
   should not have come as a surprise given the extensive collaboration
   between Morales and the neoliberal regime of Mesa directly prior to the
   former's ascent to office.},

Abstract = {Voting is perceived as free and rational. Citizens make whatever choices
   they wish, shielded from external influences by the privacy of the
   voting booth. The current paper however suggests that a subtle source of
   influence polling places themselves can impact voting behavior In two
   elections, people voting in churches were more likely to support a
   conservative candidate and a ban on same-sex marriage, but not the
   restriction of eminent domain. A field experiment found that people
   completing questionnaires in a chapel awarded less money (relative to
   people in a secular building) to insurance claimants seeking
   compensation for abortion pills, but not to worker's compensation
   claimants. A laboratory experiment found that people subliminally
   exposed to ecclesiastical images awarded less money (relative to people
   exposed to control images) to abortion pill claimants, but not to
   worker's compensation claimants. Exposure to ecclesiastical images
   affected only Christians; non-Christians' awards were unaffected by the
   prime. These findings show that polling locations can exert a powerful
   and precise influence on political attitudes and decision making.},

Abstract = {In the last decade regulatory reforms have focused increasingly on
   efforts to improve regulatory quality. As part of that development
   policymakers have been encouraged to consider fiscal, socio-economic and
   administrative effects of proposed legislation when making policy
   choices. The Central and East European EU member states have adopted
   regulatory impact analysis (RIA) mechanisms but so far there has been
   little analysis of their implementation. This article first compares the
   manner in which RIAs have been institutionalised in the Czech Republic,
   Estonia, Hungary, Slovakia and Slovenia. Second, it explores how
   differences in institutionalisation have affected RIA performance. The
   paper concludes that there are marked differences in the RIA quality
   across Central and Eastern Europe, notably as a consequence of national
   differences in institutional and administrative contexts and capacities.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on multi-level governance in Turkey by examining
   the governance of the pre-accession funds allocated to regional
   development by developing an interdisciplinary and multidimensional
   approach that integrates the vertical and horizontal relations at
   different levels of governance with the four main principles
   (concentration, programming, partnership, and additionality) of the EU
   structural funds. The article analyses the influence of the dual
   governance structure on the efficient utilisation of EU funds allocated
   to 191 municipality and local authority projects executed under two
   different calls covering seven NUTS 11 regions and twenty cities in
   Turkey, thereby demonstrating the differences in the efficiency levels
   by using an empirical approach. The results show that the EU
   pre-accession funds in Turkey promote the formation of a European model
   of the multi-level governance structure by generating new forms of
   relations among authorities at different levels.},

Title = {Eliciting Substance from `Hot Air': Financial Market Responses to EU
   Summit Decisions on European Defense},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {64},
Number = {2},
Pages = {199-223},

Abstract = {The results of deliberations in multilateral fora are often considered
   ineffective. Decision making in the European Union (EU) and in
   particular its key intergovernmental body, the European Council, poses
   no exception. Especially in the domain of EU foreign and security
   affairs, the unanimity requirement governing this institution allegedly
   allows nationalist governments to torpedo any attempt to build up a
   credible European defense force and a unified foreign policy stance. In
   this article, we take issue with the claim that multilateral summits
   merely result in ``hot air{''} by looking at whether and how decisions
   made during EU summit meetings affect the European defense industry. We
   argue that investors react positively to a successful strengthening of
   Europe's military component a vital part of the intensified cooperation
   within the European Security and Defense Policy (ESDP) since such
   decisions increase the demand for military products and raise the
   expected profits in the European defense industry. Our findings lend
   empirical support to the view that financial markets indeed evaluate the
   substance of European Council meetings and react positively to those
   summit decisions that consolidate EU military capabilities and the ESDP.
   Each of the substantial council decisions studied increased the value of
   the European defense sector by about 4 billion euros on average. This
   shows that multilateral decisions can have considerable economic and
   financial repercussions.},

Abstract = {This article is motivated by two trends in international relations (IR):
   the general trend toward global neoliberalism, and the discursive turn
   in IR scholarship. Neoliberalism, while not fully practised anywhere,
   has become the dominant discourse and normative measure of economic
   policy ideas around which policy debates coalesce. This all is the more
   noticeable among the lesser-developed countries. This article attempts
   to explain this gradual shift in the global political economy where most
   discussions centre around a core set of ideas and beliefs about how the
   system ought to function. Given that evidence of this
   ideational/discursive shift predates the end of the Cold War and changed
   out of step with the steady growth in economic interdependence, new
   approaches are warranted. What is argued here is that the study of
   social interaction among states will shed considerable light onto how
   the international system has developed into its current state.

Title = {Blocking resolution: How external states can prolong civil wars},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {47},
Number = {2},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {What explains the effect of external intervention on the duration of
   civil war? The literature on intervention has made some progress in
   addressing this question, but it has been hindered by an assumption that
   states intervene in civil wars either to help one side win or to
   facilitate negotiations. Often, however, external states become involved
   in civil war to pursue an agenda which is separate from the goals of the
   internal combatants. When states intervene in this fashion, they make
   wars more difficult to resolve for two reasons. First, doing so
   introduces another actor that must approve any settlement to end the
   war. Second, external states generally have less incentive to negotiate
   than internal actors because they bear lower costs of fighting and they
   can anticipate gaining less benefit from negotiation than domestic
   insurgents. Through Cox regressions using data on the goals of all
   interventions in civil wars since World War II, this article shows that
   when states intervene with an independent agenda, they make wars
   substantially longer. The effect of independent interventions is much
   larger than that of external interventions generally, suggesting that
   the established finding that external interventions prolong civil war is
   driven by a subset of cases where states have intervened in conflicts to
   pursue independent goals.},

Abstract = {This article challenges the orthodox, `pan-nationalist' view of the
   impact of the Cold War and President Clinton's role in the Northern
   Ireland peace process. It is argued that this orthodox view places much
   faith in the `front stage'; self-congratulatory accounts of political
   actors who sought to enhance their reputations through involvement in
   the peace process. A theatrical metaphor is deployed to `go behind the
   scenes' and produce a more nuanced account of the influence of the US
   President. It is argued first, that the pan-nationalist charade
   deliberately exaggerated Clinton's role in order to demonstrate the
   power of `unarmed struggle' and win over a key republican audience to
   the peace process. Second, the British government, to some extent,
   played its `villainous' role in the pan-nationalist charade because it
   understood the Sinn Fein leadership's problems in bringing a united
   republican movement into a ceasefire. Third, the peace process was
   emerging well before the US President took his cue from Irish
   nationalist politicians to enter the political stage. Fourth, the
   `pan-nationalist' view does not consider the malign impact of the US
   role on unionism, which underlined unionist isolation and undermined
   pro-Agreement unionism. Finally, it is argued that President Clinton's
   grasp of the `realities' of Northern Irish politics was not firm and the
   President oscillated between an overoptimistic `modernising' view of the
   conflict and over-pessimistic primordial - `Rosy Catholics' and `Dour
   Prods' - view neither of which accurately describes the conflict.

Abstract = {This article addresses the relationship between scientific expertise and
   policy in European chemicals regulation. We argue that the role of
   scientific expertise in the European regulation of chemicals varies
   across decision-making levels, countries, and stages of the policy
   process. Our case study of the role of scientific expertise in the
   regulation of brominated flame retardants illustrates considerably
   different manifestations of this interconnected process across
   regulatory arenas, even though this case concerns a single group of
   substances. On the European Union level, we find a mix of technocracy
   and politicization; in Sweden, a clear-cut politicization; and in
   Poland, noninvolvement. Such differences can be explained by a
   combination of factors, in particular frame dominance, and mobilization
   of advocacy coalitions.},

Abstract = {Since the 1980s, reforms have dominated government agendas around the
   world; governments embarked on a remarkable journey of innovation. The
   pace of reform is not likely to abate. An increasing number of public
   policy issues call for the active contribution of many actors across and
   beyond government and require government to work outside of conventional
   boundaries. They compel government to use its authority and resources to
   enable and empower others. Increased complexity and uncertainty within
   policy issues and governance contexts are prompting governments to
   improve their ability to anticipate, intervene, innovate, learn, and
   adapt. Future reforms will necessitate an expanded view of the roles of
   government and citizens.
   While government remains the steward of collective interest with the
   power to intervene, government needs to explore how it can work with
   citizens and other actors to produce results of high public value. As
   governments move towards producing results with citizens, they strike a
   more complete set of relationships and expand the repertoire of roles
   each can play to achieve results. These reforms will allow a broader
   definition of public results that emphasizes the importance of both
   public policy and civic results. The latter build credibility, while the
   former increase legitimacy. Both enhance citizens' trust in government.
   Public administrators have thus far been working from an incomplete
   definition of results that does not give sufficient weight to civic
   results.
   Finally, future reforms will also require a more dynamic understanding
   of governance and public administration that supports the building of
   capacity. Capacity building in new areas is required to pursue the
   public good in an increasingly unpredictable global environment, but
   this work must begin by valuing and preserving existing capacities.
   Central among these is the focus on compliance, the hallmark of good
   government. It includes: a respect for the rule of law and public
   institutions; due process; accountability; and public sector values.
   These factors contribute to providing a solid institutional foundation
   for public organizations. Public administrators should also preserve
   their focus on performance. This includes: making government more
   productive and efficient; improving service delivery across
   organizational silos; being responsive to the expectations of citizens;
   improving governance processes; and harnessing the power of modern
   information and communication technologies.
   Notwithstanding concerted efforts to build government capacity to
   anticipate, detect and intervene, unpredictable events and shocks will
   occur. Given this, government must also focus on resilience by building
   the capacity to innovate, learn and adapt, and by ensuring a more
   equitable distribution of risks. Implementing measures to improve
   anticipative, innovative and adaptive capacities will require targeted
   investments for the long term and tolerance of some ``excess{''}
   capacity. Ultimately, this will require recognition that less
   government, and more efficient government, does not necessarily amount
   to better government.},

Abstract = {In the 1990s, a number of post-Communist states adopted diaspora laws
   that defined the target group ethno-culturally, thus seemingly
   confirming the continued relevance of Hans Kohn's distinction between
   ethnic Eastern and civic Western nationalism. This article, however,
   posits that while Kohn's dichotomy may be valid, its related
   implications are often not. The ethnic content of the diaspora laws, and
   the content of ethnic nationalism behind them, is much more nuanced, and
   not all ethnically tinted diaspora polices are discriminatory or
   otherwise contrary to international standards. Using the case of the
   2001 Hungarian Status Law and the European organizations' reaction to
   it, the first part of the article draws attention to the often neglected
   fact that international standards do not ban ethnically based policies
   altogether but allow for some distinctions in treatment based on
   ethno-cultural criteria. The second part of the article focuses on the
   case of Ukraine and further challenges the accuracy of the civic-ethnic
   dichotomy by showing how the politics of the Ukrainian diaspora law was
   driven not by a clash between civic and ethnic nationalism but by a more
   complex tension between different variants of ethnic nationalism, a
   neo-Soviet imperial vision, strategic bargaining, and changes in
   electoral fortunes for unrelated reasons. The Ukrainian case also shows
   how, in addition to international norm diffusion, another-and rather
   counterintuitive-path towards internationally compliant diaspora
   legislation may be the presence of substantial domestic divisions on the
   national issue, which forces the elites to compromise on a less ethnic
   law.},

Title = {Is Rule by Majorities Special?},
Journal = {POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {58},
Number = {1},
Pages = {26-46},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {One way of making decisions is for political associates or their
   representatives to vote on each issue separately in accordance with the
   majority principle and then take the cumulative outcomes of such
   majority decision making to define the collective choice for public
   policy. We call such a system one of majorities rule. Thought of in
   spatial terms, majorities rule is equivalent to the principle of making
   decisions according to the issue-by-issue median of voter preferences.
   If popular control and political equality are core democratic values,
   they can be rendered as requirements on a collective choice rule,
   involving resoluteness, anonymity, strategy-proofness and
   responsiveness. These requirements entail that the collective decision
   rule be a percentile method. If we then add a requirement of
   impartiality, as exhibited in a collective choice rule which would be
   chosen behind a veil of ignorance, then the issue-by-issue median is
   uniquely identified as a fair rule. Hence, majorities rule is special.
   Some objections to this line of reasoning are considered.},

Abstract = {The view of terrorists as entrepreneurs is not new. Yet, unlike
   traditional entrepreneurs, they are not motivated by profits. This
   article argues that terrorists are social entrepreneurs. They are
   motivated primarily by social returns. Furthermore, their main output is
   a public good due to its non-rival and non-excludable properties. Using
   social entrepreneurship theories, this article presents an alternative
   view of the incentives behind the formation of terrorist organizations.
   It concludes with a discussion of policy implications of this framework
   for combating terrorism.},

Journal = {STUDIES IN CONFLICT \& TERRORISM},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {33},
Number = {8},
Pages = {757-782},
Abstract = {The conventional wisdom is that weak and failed states are at great risk
   of becoming havens for transnational terrorist and guerilla groups. The
   assumption is that lack of enforcement capabilities enables militant
   organizations to infiltrate and fill the ovacuum of powero that is
   created in the absence of a strong state. This article argues, though,
   that this is only one of the ways in which weak states are attractive to
   militant groups. It explores the various mechanisms through which the
   vacuum of power translates into opportunities for such groups. These
   mechanisms include the easiness of acquiring support and recruitment
   within refugees or marginalized populations; the ability of the violent
   non-state transnational organization to establish a osurrogate stateo in
   supplying institutions and services that enhance its public appeal; the
   relations between civil or communal conflict and the success of such
   groups; and the use of transnational violent groups as proxies for other
   states. Using the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) and
   Hezbollah in Lebanon as the primary cases, as well as two mini-cases
   from Central America and Africa, the paper illustrates the working of
   these mechanisms and contributes to our understanding of the relations
   between state weakness and transnational violent non-state
   organizations.},

Abstract = {What makes some states more militarily powerful than others? A growing
   body of research suggests that certain `non-material' factors
   significantly affect a country's ability to translate resources into
   fighting power. In particular, recent studies claim that democracy,
   Western culture, high levels of human capital, and amicable
   civil-military relations enhance military effectiveness. If these
   studies are correct, then military power is not solely or even primarily
   determined by material resources, and a large chunk of international
   relations scholarship has been based on a flawed metric. The major
   finding of this article, however, suggests that this is not the case. In
   hundreds of battles between 1898 and 1987, the more economically
   developed side consistently outfought the poorer side on a
   soldier-for-soldier basis. This is not surprising. What is surprising is
   that many of the non-material factors posited to affect military
   capability seem to be irrelevant: when economic development is taken
   into account, culture and human capital become insignificant and
   democracy actually seems to degrade warfighting capability. In short,
   the conventional military dominance of Western democracies stems from
   superior economic development, not societal pathologies or political
   institutions. Therefore, a conception of military power that takes into
   account both the quantity of a state's resources and its level of
   economic development provides a sound basis for defense planning and
   international relations scholarship.},

Abstract = {This article addresses three recent developments in historical
   sociology: (1) neo-Weberian historical sociology within International
   Relations; (2) the `civilizational analysis' approach utilized by
   scholars of `multiple modernities'; and (3) the `third wave' cultural
   turn in US historical sociology. These developments are responses to
   problems identified within earlier forms of historical sociology, but it
   is suggested each fails to resolve them precisely because each remains
   contained within the methodological framework of historical sociology as
   initially conceived. It is argued that their common problem lies in the
   utilization of `ideal types' as the basis for sociohistorical analysis.
   This necessarily has the effect of abstracting a set of particular
   relations from their wider connections and has the further effect of
   suggesting sui generis endogenous processes as integral to these
   relations. In this way, each of the three developments continues the
   Eurocentrism typical of earlier approaches. The article concludes with a
   call for `connected histories' to provide a more adequate methodological
   and substantive basis for an historical sociology appropriate to calls
   for a properly global historical sociology.},

   liability and asset in managing globalization},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {17},
Number = {3},
Pages = {383-399},
Abstract = {The diversity of market economies that constitute the European Union
   (EU) presents both constraints and opportunities for Europe when it
   comes to shaping the post-neoliberal global economic order. Diversity is
   a constraint in that it often prevents strong common positions in global
   negotiations and thus undermines the ability of Europe to exercise its
   collective hard power resources. Paradoxically, however, the EU's
   enduring diversity over time has become the source of a different type
   of power that also provides Europe with opportunities to shape the
   nature of global economic governance. By reconciling commitments to
   greater economic openness and extensive multilateralism with national
   discretion, the EU enjoys `model power'. This type of power is based in
   specific institutional innovations within the EU that accommodate
   internal diversity and allow the EU to exercise important, if limited,
   influence over the substantive content and rules guiding the management
   of globalization.},

Abstract = {The Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region has been afflicted by Uighur
   political activism and ethnic violence for the past few decades.
   interethnic relations between the Uighurs and Han Chinese have been
   extremely tense. Why is Xinjiang so vulnerable to interethnic violence?
   Why are intergroup dynamics between the Uighurs and Han Chinese so
   volatile? This paper examines Uighur-Han Chinese relations in
   contemporary Xinjiang and probes conditions that facilitate interethnic
   violence. Utilizing Fredrik Barth's approach to ethnicity that
   emphasizes boundaries, this paper examines in detail how the rigid
   interethnic boundary between the Uighurs and Han Chinese has been
   constructed and strengthened in Xinjiang. Perceived differences have
   generated mutual distrust and discrimination between the two groups that
   make intergroup communication and understanding difficult and therefore
   very limited. In situations such as that in Xinjiang, where a rigid
   intergroup boundary is in place and civic engagements across groups are
   lacking, intergroup conflict is extremely hard to avoid.},

Abstract = {We address focal questions about the growth of ``third-party{''}
   government and new forms or tools of governance and the extent and
   impact of their increasing use to implement public policy and the
   ``Public will.{''} Our goal is to sharpen this discussion by bringing
   empirical evidence to bear on key arguments and assertions in the
   debate. In particular, along with the other contributors to this journal
   issue, we look for evidence that government control and democratic
   responsiveness are loosening and that the public sector is evolving into
   a ``state of agents,{''} where grovernment authority is widely dispersed
   and diluted and accountability to the public is weak. Although we find
   that the government exercises very limited oversight of for-profit and
   nonprofit ``agents of the state,{''} we also show that the
   organizational structures and incentives that governments establish to
   promote service quality, efficiency, equity, and effectiveness play a
   vital role in program and service outcomes, even if governments are not
   engaging directly in service provision.},

Title = {War's dark glamour: ethics of research in war and conflict zones},
Journal = {CAMBRIDGE REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {23},
Number = {2},
Pages = {349-369},
Abstract = {The article addresses three questions concerning violent conflicts in
   Sri Lanka, Burma and southern Thailand: How is it possible to
   investigate questions of war and conflict in the field, especially
   concerning access and exit options? Access was gained in different ways
   in all three areas depending on the respective situations; special
   conditions and restrictions influenced the type and quality of data to
   be collected. The second question concerns the ethics and permissibility
   of research and data collection in conflict zones. What are the dangers
   or risks for both researcher and the local informants? What will be the
   quality of data so gathered? Third is a related question of ethics, that
   of impartiality: this is less a question of whether it is possible than
   of whether it is permissible for the researcher to stay `neutral' in
   violent conflicts. This also has to be determined individually and in a
   different manner for each conflict zone. It is obvious that all
   researchers violate the ideal of `objectivity' implicitly or explicitly
   from the start, yet this need not invalidate their findings. The paper
   concludes that research in conflict zones is mandatory, despite all
   doubts and qualifications. Only making such zones public can shape
   perceptions, give voice to the voiceless and so prevent these conflicts
   becoming invisible'war without witness'.},

Title = {Unbundling task conflict and relationship conflict The moderating role
   of team goal orientation and conflict management},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {21},
Number = {3},
Pages = {334-355},
Abstract = {Purpose - This study seeks to explore team goal orientation as a team
   characteristic that affects team members' self-regulation, and conflict
   management approach as a self-regulation tactic Its purpose is to
   investigate the moderating effect of team goal orientation and conflict
   management approach on the linkage between task conflict and
   relationship conflict
   Design/methodology/approach - Data were received from 529 team members
   in 120 R\&D teams in Taiwan The hypothesis is tested using hierarchical
   regressions
   Findings - The results indicate that team goal orientation and a
   conflict management approach moderated the relationship between task
   conflict and relationship conflict The positive relationship between
   task conflict and relationship conflict was weaker under conditions of
   higher team learning orientation and lower team performance orientation
   The positive association between task conflict and relationship conflict
   was also weaker among teams that engaged in cooperative conflict
   management and did not engage in the avoiding conflict management
   approach.
   Research limitations/implications - The study is cross-sectional in
   design, limiting the ability to make causal assertions about links
   between task conflict and relationship conflict.
   Practical implications - To prevent detrimental relationship conflict
   triggered by task conflict, supervisors may need to use goal orientation
   disposition as a criterion in selecting team members Supervisors also
   could frame the tasks and discussions of team members towards learning
   rather than performance goals, enabling team members to openly share
   divergent opinions and take advantage of task conflict Originality/value
   - The study facilitates understanding of how to unbundle the linkage
   between task conflict and relationship conflict in teams, along with
   making contributions to conflict theory.},

Abstract = {The effects of organizational networks on adoption behavior may vary
   over time in response to institutional environments. We found support
   for this argument in an analysis of the diffusion of a job search
   training program among Finnish employment offices. The results indicated
   that the adoption behavior of collaborative organizations and brokerage
   position in the local network were related to early adoption of the
   program. The results further showed that the adoption behavior of
   structurally equivalent organizations tended to inhibit early adoption
   of the program. Finally, the results indicated that brokerage position
   in the whole network was related to non-adoption.},

Abstract = {Militaries work intentionally, visibly and in a politically controlled
   manner to fulfill their formal assignments as the professional
   perpetrators of external violence on behalf of the state. It is to this
   level of military action that the existing literature on the civilian
   control of the military is confined. However, through the intensive
   interaction between the military and civilians, the effects of formally
   controlled military activity go beyond the professional domain and are
   felt in civilian areas, where, in the long term, military activity helps
   create structures of unequal power relations. Given its structural
   dimension, this aspect of the military is not necessarily or immediately
   visible to the main agents involved; hence, it is divorced from
   effective civilian control. I conceptualize this neglected type of
   control as effectual control, distinct from the theoretically
   well-established notion of operational control. This paper theorizes the
   essence of effectual control. International Politics (2010) 47, 104-124.

   territorial innovation models `clusters' has been the most commonly
   adopted by policy-makers.
   However, cluster policy implementation requires careful management if
   the different actors are to be properly engaged and committed. In this
   article, we will argue that a great deal rests upon the quality of
   leadership both at the strategic level of regions, or other
   administrative scales, and of individual projects or initiatives such as
   cluster support organisations. The main issues and challenges of
   leadership will be outlined.
   Furthermore, we examine cluster policy in the Austrian region of Styria
   where its successful application has assisted the transformation of the
   region from a crisis point in the 1980s. We consider what has been
   achieved and how the adoption of a particular `distributed' style of
   leadership has been effective in creating a strong institutional base,
   achieving cooperation across organisational, sectoral and other
   boundaries and building lasting partnerships based upon mutual
   self-interest.},

Abstract = {This article examines recent parental leave initiatives in France and
   the UK within the context of broader debates about family policy.
   Specifically, it analyses the 2006 Work and Families Act and changes to
   the Complement de Libre Choix d'Activite. It argues that the discourse
   of parental choice in both countries is deployed to open up the space
   for public policy and renegotiate the boundaries between the public and
   private spheres. However, the dynamics of family policy remain highly
   path-dependent. In Britain, the equalities lobby is important but the
   abstract logic of the market dominates, while in France natalist policy
   focuses on the `working mother'.},

   supranational regulation within the broader effort of the European Union
   (EU) to include diffuse interests in the policy process. I track 60
   legislative proposals initiated by the European Commission between 1996
   and 2007 and estimate the change made in response to the requests of the
   body representing decentralized interests - the Committee of the
   Regions. I find that the Commission responds favorably to requests more
   than a third of the time and that substate politicians are more
   influential on proposals dealing with regional cohesion. The data also
   show that the policy importance of the amendments is the main predictor
   of the Commission's willingness to accept the advice of subnational
   governments. Furthermore, the Commission, being a non-elected and
   technocratic body, is more likely to hear the policy preferences of
   local and regional stakeholders when the public expresses
   dissatisfaction with EU democracy.},

   Alignment and Discordance in Community Collaboratives},

Abstract = {In an effort to deal with complex community issues in a more
   comprehensive and cohesive manner, communities have increasingly created
   locally based interorganizational entities, referred to here as
   community collaboratives. Community collaboratives are comprised of
   representatives from multiple organizations and public agencies who meet
   regularly for the purpose of identifying and implementing strategies for
   improving their community's response to a specific issue of public
   concern. This article explores the role of problem frames and
   perceptions of problem frame alignment among members of community
   collaboratives. Specifically, this study uses an innovative combination
   of social network analysis methods and hierarchical linear modeling to
   explore how differences in the extent to which stakeholders view
   themselves in alignment with other members and how much they are
   perceived to be in alignment by other members effects the outcomes of
   the collaborative as a whole. Findings are based on data from members of
   48 different domestic violence community collaboratives. Results suggest
   that the presence of stakeholders who are perceived to be
   philosophically out of sync by other stakeholders with regards to their
   understanding of domestic violence but do not acknowledge this apparent
   disconnect can negatively impact the effectiveness of the collaborative
   over and above the impact associated with the general degree of
   alignment in the collaborative. Implications of results for public and
   nonprofit organizations seeking to provide leadership in promoting the
   effectiveness of community collaboratives are discussed.},

Title = {Mediation: depolarizing responsibilities to facilitate reconciliation},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Pages = {4-19},
Abstract = {Purpose - Parties' respective share of responsibility in a conflict is a
   topic that many mediators have difficulty approaching from fear of
   radicalizing discussions. The present paper aims to propose a strategy
   to help mediators facilitate parties' acknowledgement of their role in
   the escalation of a conflict.
   Design/methodology/approach - The strategy is tested using a
   quasi-experimental design using real case mediation in partnership with
   Commission des normes du travail du Quebec (CNT).
   Findings - The results indicate that it has a significant impact on the
   parties' acknowledgement of their share of responsibility,
   reconciliation and the settlement rate.
   Research limitations/implications - Although the research design has
   good external validity, the strategy should be tested in other settings
   such as family mediation.
   Practical implications - The results show that the par-ties' perceptions
   that they played no role in conflict escalation and that the other is
   responsible for the whole situation are at the heart of any conflict.
   Originality/value - This study empirically tests an interesting and
   valuable approach to mediation.},

Journal = {CAMBRIDGE REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Pages = {145-163},
Abstract = {The random and indeterminate nature of the current unipolar world
   suggests a condition of increasing entropy. There are two reasons for
   this claim. First, relative capability advantages under unipolarity do
   not translate as easily as they once did into power and influence over
   others. Second, systemic constraint is a property that limits actors'
   freedom of action by imposing costs and benefits on certain kinds of
   actions. Unlike past multipolar and bipolar systems, the current
   unipolar system exerts only weak, if any, systemic constraints on the
   unipolar power and all other actors as well. Thus, polarity has become a
   largely meaningless concept. Today, system process rather than structure
   best explains international politics, and this process is one of
   entropy. Finally, I suggest two pathways from unipolarity to a more
   balanced system: one is fairly consistent with standard balance-of-power
   realism but adds an ideational component; the other restores equilibrium
   by means of entropy.},

Title = {The Dark Duo of Post-Colonial Ideology: A Model of Symbolic Exclusion
   and Historical Negation},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT AND VIOLENCE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {4},
Number = {1},
Pages = {106-123},
Abstract = {Post-colonial nations experience a specific set of socio-structural
   conditions that foster a unique duo of ideologies. These are the
   ideology of Historical Recognition versus Negation (or HRN) and the
   ideology of Symbolic Projection versus Exclusion (or SPE). These
   ideologies operate in tandem to legitimize material and symbolic
   inequality in response to specific and contested aspects of
   post-colonial social structure and history. HRN is promoted by the
   dominant group to legitimize inequality in outcomes experienced by
   Indigenous peoples in post-colonial societies where historical injustice
   is objective fact (objective historical injustice). SPE is promoted by
   the dominant group to claim ownership of the national category in
   post-colonial societies where there is an inability to logically deny
   that Indigenous peoples ``belong{''} to the nation (undeniable
   belongingness). I present the Post-Colonial Ideology Scale (PCIS-2D),
   which assesses these two distinct ``dark{''} ideologies. Exploratory and
   Confirmatory Factor Analyses validated the factor structure of the
   PCIS-2D in undergraduate (N = 373; Study 1) and community (N = 447;
   Study 2) samples of New Zealand (NZ) citizens. The PCIS-2D evidenced
   good construct validity, as SPE and HRN predicted unique variance in
   voting preferences and social policy attitudes controlling for
   demographics, Big Five personality, and System Justification ideology
   (Study 2). These results indicate that HRN and SPE are distinct
   ideologies that explain unique variance in support for a range of social
   and political issues. At the systemic level, HRN and SPE form a joint
   ideological system that legitimates inequality in two critical social
   domains: one relating to resource allocations, the other relating to
   representation and ownership of the national category.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES},

Volume = {33},

Pages = {367-399},
Abstract = {This article examines `disproportionality'. It begins by tabling some
   suggestions for how greater `proportionality' can be attained and then
   maintained, particularly in international security operations. A process
   termed `proportionalisation' is proposed. Lessons from `traditional'
   strategic studies need to be re-asserted. This is so that some of the
   observed limitations with recent operations can be addressed. Losing
   sight of key objectives is unhelpful, not least when an essential
   clarity of focus and leadership is required. Today, a return to some
   classical notions is required to address the observed strategic vacuums,
   together with an improved intelligence methodology being needed. This
   article concludes by arguing that `disproportionality' emerges when
   `high politics' become increasingly disconnected and removed from their
   empirical bases and `low politics'. Greater connection needs to be
   engendered. Otherwise, in the absence of proportionality, strategies
   will increasingly fail, command and control will falter, and the desired
   goal of `operational success' will elude us.},

Journal = {AFRICAN AFFAIRS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {109},
Number = {434},
Pages = {1-21},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This article discusses the Bush administration's African policy legacy
   and its implications for the Obama administration. Many have argued that
   the events of 9/11 led the administration to view the African
   subcontinent differently, and that the US has altered its conception of
   national interests in the region. The tripling of American foreign aid
   to the region is noteworthy. AFRICOM's creation also suggests a policy
   shift. The article is nonetheless sceptical that these changes represent
   a paradigmatic shift in policy towards Africa, rather than a partial and
   inconsistent adjustment made possible by a conjunction of quite specific
   circumstances. Indeed, these circumstances provided an opportunity to
   redefine US foreign policy towards the region, which the Bush
   administration largely failed to do. The article argues that the weight
   of the American diplomatic presence in the region has continued to
   decline, because of the worsening institutional fragmentation in the
   foreign policy apparatus, contradictions in policy, and the decline in
   the State Department's institutional capacity. As the Obama
   administration defines US policy in the region, it must address most of
   the same conundrums as its predecessors, but with less leverage than
   past administrations and constrained by the fiscal effects of the worst
   recession in sixty years.},

Abstract = {This article is concerned with high stakes testing in England, where
   system-wide market-oriented reforms have been introduced into the
   school-based education system. It focuses in particular on the
   consequences of such testing in terms of accountability, teaching,
   learning and resourcing. The article argues that not only are there
   serious consequences associated with the testing regime, but there are
   also doubts about the validity of the test results. Moreover, there are
   concerns about whether a focus on high stakes test results is meeting
   the needs of society more generally: there is a strong argument for
   indicators used for the purposes of accountability to tie in with the
   wider goals of education.},

Abstract = {The process of transitional justice in Latvia after 1991 and the public
   debates that surrounded it created a number of controversies. One such
   notable conflict dealt with lustration, and it involved Latvia's
   political establishment and intelligentsia. While the politicians
   supported the public's right to have full access to the secret KGB
   files, the intellectuals demanded that Latvia's society should be
   protected from making mistakes in its judgments and therefore the
   available documentation should be studied first by state-appointed
   experts. Each position addressed the issue of lustration from a
   distinctive perspective, and these reflected not merely political
   disagreements. Instead, they reflected conflicts of vision that had deep
   historical roots.},

Abstract = {Despite the extended nature of many transitional justice processes,
   collection of relevant longitudinal primary data, especially at an
   individual level, is rarely observed as a means of assessing the impact
   of formal measures. This article reports on a panel survey conducted in
   2002-2003 and 2008 with 153 victims of apartheid-era violations from
   Cape Town, South Africa. During the interval between the two waves of
   the survey, both undertaken after the Truth and Reconciliation
   Commission (TRC) completed its work, government policies concerning
   reparations, prosecutions and pardons undermined the compromises that
   were central to the TRC process and integral to the democratic
   transition. The data analysis shows that approval of the unique
   conditional amnesty offered by the TRC was at first surprisingly high,
   with many respondents acknowledging its practical rationale, but it fell
   dramatically by 2008. This decline in support is associated with an
   increased sense of the unfairness of amnesty and dissatisfaction with
   the extent of truth recovery. Knowledge of and attitudes about
   prosecutions and pardons do not appear to be contributing factors,
   though the results indicate a greater desire for accountability, even at
   the risk of instability. The findings emphasize the need for rigorous,
   ongoing evaluation of transitional justice processes to appreciate
   properly the complex and dynamic nature of individual attitudes and the
   influence of emergent events.},

Title = {Impact Assessment, Not Evaluation: Defining a Limited Role for
   Positivism in the Study of Transitional Justice},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {4},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {355-376},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Discussions of impact assessment and evaluation are the newest
   installment in the brief history of the field of transitional justice.
   Noticeably, a positivist logic of inference is being favored in these
   discussions. This article argues that a distinction should be made
   between impact assessment and evaluation, and that the role of
   positivist approaches is best conceived of as contributing to the
   former. Evaluation, on the other hand, should be undertaken by those
   analysts willing to embrace and promote normative ideals, to which they
   compare practices on the ground. This type of `comparison to the ideal'
   is the province of interpretive-critical logics of inference. After
   carving out a modest role for positivism, the article presents a
   quantitative analysis of transitional justice impact to show how such a
   logic is good for grounding observers' expectations for different types
   of transitional cases. The analysis demonstrates that transitional
   justice mechanisms do not have a uniquely destabilizing effect across
   such cases. The article concludes with a syncretist view - that
   interpretive, ideal-based evaluations should proceed alongside
   positivist impact assessments.},

Abstract = {The cabinets of the European Commission are seen to play a crucial role
   in the policy-making process. So far, however, they have in many
   respects remained `black boxes'. In this article we `unpack' the
   demographic composition in terms of nationality of three commissions'
   cabinets. The standard portrayal of cabinets has been that of national
   enclaves and points of access. Reforms during the period have required a
   more multinational composition. Our study shows that not only have the
   new rules been implemented: the new formal requirements have become
   over-fulfilled and increasingly so. In 2004, 96 per cent of the cabinets
   contained more nationalities than formally prescribed and 57 per cent of
   the personnel were non-compatriots of their respective commissioners.
   Based on studies of comparable phenomena, it is reason to believe that
   decomposition of a particular demographical cluster within an
   organizational unit reduces the impact of such demographical factors on
   officials' decision behaviour.},

Abstract = {Available data have consistently pointed up the failure of U.S. policies
   to reduce undocumented migration from Latin America. To shed light on
   the reasons for this failure, we estimated a series of dynamic models of
   undocumented entry into and exit from the United States. Our estimates
   suggest that undocumented migration is grounded more in mechanisms
   posited by social capital theory and the new economics of labor
   migration rather than neoclassical economics. As a result, U.S. efforts
   to increase the costs of undocumented entry and reduce the benefits of
   undocumented labor have proven unsuccessful given the widespread access
   of Latin Americans to migrant networks. The main effect of U.S.
   enforcement efforts has been to reduce the circularity of Latin American
   migration.},

Abstract = {The dramatic rise in inequality in the United States over the past
   generation has occasioned considerable attention from economists, but
   strikingly little from students of American politics. This has started
   to change: in recent years, a small but growing body of political
   science research on rising inequality has challenged standard economic
   accounts that emphasize apolitical processes of economic change. For all
   the sophistication of this new scholarship, however, it too fails to
   provide a compelling account of the political sources and effects of
   rising inequality. In particular, these studies share with dominant
   economic accounts three weaknesses: (1) they downplay the distinctive
   feature of American inequality-namely, the extreme concentration of
   income gains at the top of the economic ladder; (2) they miss the
   profound role of government policy in creating this
   ``winner-take-all{''} pattern; and (3) they give little attention or
   weight to the dramatic long-term transformation of the organizational
   landscape of American politics that lies behind these changes in policy.
   These weaknesses are interrelated, stemming ultimately from a conception
   of politics that emphasizes the sway (or lack thereof) of the ``median
   voter{''} in electoral politics, rather than the influence of organized
   interests in the process of policy making. A perspective centered on
   organizational and policy change-one that identifies the major policy
   shifts that have bolstered the economic standing of those at the top and
   then links those shifts to concrete organizational efforts by
   resourceful private interests-fares much better at explaining why the
   American political economy has become distinctively winner-take-all.},

Abstract = {In an effort to explain the rise of unwed parenthood in the inner city
   over the past several decades, a large body of research has attributed
   the phenomenon in part to low-income men's unwillingness to commit to
   long-term, monogamous relationships. A major limitation of these
   studies, however, is that virtually none attempt to understand
   relationship dissolution by comparing low-income inner-city men in
   monogamous and nonmonogamous long-term heterosexual relationships.
   Drawing from a convenience sample of thirty-eight low-income monogamous
   and nonmonogamous men, this article develops a typology of three
   cultural logics of action used by respondents to motivate behavior in
   relationships: doubt, duty, and destiny. These cultural logics help to
   explain how poverty influences sexual action; nevertheless, this
   typology supports an emerging literature demonstrating the ways in which
   the sexual ``culture of poverty{''} is contingent, contradictory,
   indeterminate, and multivocal.},

   administration sought a politically progressive alternative to
   ``pacification{''} campaigns waged by the French against the Vietnamese
   revolution. But its architects could not come up with a substitute for
   the conventional military reliance on massive firepower, which brought
   devastation to the Vietnamese people and failed to crush the ``Viet
   Cong.{''} The Americans were again unsuccessful in transferring
   legitimacy to their allies in Saigon. After the war, the notion of
   counterinsurgency was kept alive among military writers. Rechristened as
   ``COIN,{''} it has been given the task of providing cover for further
   ``dirty wars{''} in Iraq and Afghanistan.},

Title = {Sabotage! The Origins, Development and Impact of the IRA's
   Infrastructural Bombing Campaigns 1939-1997},
Journal = {INTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY},

Volume = {25},

Abstract = {At various moments in the twentieth century the Irish Republican Army
   (IRA) in its various incarnations have used the tactic of
   infrastructural bombing, notably in their 1939 attacks in England on
   electricity pylons and in the summer of 1971 in Northern Ireland on its
   electrical distribution network. In 1996 the British Security Service
   (MI5) foiled an attack by the IRA aimed at causing a total electrical
   blackout of the greater London area, a plan that would have seen major
   disruption in the capital for many weeks or months. Using recently
   declassified material this paper seeks to re-evaluate the impact of
   these IRA infrastructural sabotage campaigns that have until now either
   been ignored or judged to have been derisory or incongruous failures.
   This paper demonstrates the historical development of this tactic from
   both the IRA's perspective, and that of those who were tasked with
   hindering it, highlighting the devastating potential of such tactics in
   the future.},

   Improved Performance},
Journal = {INTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {25},
Number = {6},
Pages = {778-799},
Abstract = {After major intelligence failures it is often asked why intelligence and
   security officials failed to heed the many `wake-up calls' that had been
   provided by earlier failures and surprises. This article addresses this
   question by examining intelligence failures as `focusing events', which
   is a concept used in the literature on government policy making to
   explain how disasters and crises can stimulate policy change and help
   organizations and decision-makers learn. It argues that in order for an
   intelligence failure such as a major terrorist attack to inspire
   improved intelligence performance - to be a true wake-up call - that
   failure must not only act as a focusing event to bring more attention to
   the threat, but it must also lead to increased intelligence collection
   and greater receptivity toward intelligence on the part of
   decision-makers.},

Abstract = {This chapter examines the adopter fatigue phenomenon in the diffusion of
   nanotechnology and microelectronics innovations. It is hypothesized that
   innovations spread through a social system in an s-curve and that the
   speed of technology adoption is determined by two variables p and q
   where p represents the speed at which adoption takes off and q the speed
   at which later growth occurs. However, this two-variable model has been
   criticized as an over-simplification of a complex reality hence the need
   to examine adopter fatigue phenomenon defined as the hesitation, delay,
   or refusal by an individual to adopt an innovation on account of
   prevailing circumstances including the rapid evolution of new
   technologies. This phenomenon is particularly relevant to nanotechnology
   and microelectronics products and processes which are characteristically
   continuously refined and upgraded. Because the phenomenon is a symptom
   of poverty, it is recommended that overcoming adopter fatigue be
   achieved through multidisciplinary approach including empowering
   individuals by subsidizing the cost of adoption, and developing
   ancillary infrastructure such as electricity. Both governments and
   non-governmental organizations, in the spirit of
   public-private-partnership, should act in synergy in solving the
   poverty-linked problem of adopter fatigue.},

Abstract = {For many centuries, the gross world product was flat. But as technology
   penetrated many economies, over time, the world economy has expanded.
   Technology will continue to shape the future of commerce, industry and
   culture with likes of nanotechnology and microelectronics directly or
   indirectly playing major roles in redesigning the global economic
   structures. These technologies will drive other industries and will be
   central to a new international economy where technology capability will
   determine national competitiveness. Technology-intensive firms will
   emerge and new innovations will evolve a new dawn in wealth creation.
   Nations that create or adopt and then diffuse these technologies will
   profit. Those that fail to use technology as a means to compete
   internationally will find it difficult to progress economically. This
   chapter provides insights on global technology diffusion, the drivers
   and impacts with specific focus on nanotechnology and microelectronics.
   It also discusses the science of these technologies along with the
   trends, realities and possibilities, and the barriers which must be
   overcome for higher global penetration rates.},

Title = {Making migrant domestic work visible: The rights based approach to
   migration and the `challenges of social reproduction'},
Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {17},
Number = {5},
Pages = {840-859},
Abstract = {In recent years, the production of a gendered and racialised underclass
   of non-citizen domestic workers has come to play an increasingly
   important role in meeting the socially reproductive needs of middle
   class Malaysian households. This article considers the extent to which
   rights based approaches to migrant worker rights endorsed by both
   International Organisations and regional and local (Malaysian)
   nongovernmental organisations are sufficient in tackling the problems
   and issues faced by female migrants employed as domestic workers. The
   first part of the article critically engages with the dominant `rights
   based approach to migration' endorsed, in particular, by the
   International Labour Organisation (ILO) suggesting that this approach
   fails to make a substantive commitment to gender justice, not least,
   because of the way in which domestic work remains a largely invisible
   and frequently unrecognised form of employment. The second part of the
   article draws upon data collected from key activist organizations
   engaged in struggles on behalf of migrant domestic workers in Malaysia.
   This discussion is situated within the broader context of debates over
   the role of economic rights within feminist understandings and critiques
   of human rights and `rights based approaches'. Noting the dominance of
   the issue of violence against women (VAW) within feminist human rights
   discourse, I argue that whilst the VAW framework is a useful tool for
   understanding how and why women migrants may be vulnerable to abuse, it
   is perhaps not enough and there is a need to think more critically about
   how questions of women's economic status and `rights' feature in
   discussions of the gendered and racialised nature of (care) work in the
   global economy.},

Volume = {17},

Pages = {860-888},
Abstract = {This research speaks to two themes on which little empirical work has
   been carried out in IPE: tourism and social reproduction. It focuses on
   changing relations of social reproduction in two tourism communities in
   Central America - Placencia in Belize and Monteverde and Costa Rica. In
   contrast to the majority of literature on social reproduction, the
   starting point for this analysis is not the reprivatisation of social
   reproduction but rather an exploration of how actors in tourism
   communities in Central America negotiate the tensions between capitalist
   development and social reproduction in a context of minimal state
   provision. Drawing on extensive field research in these communities, I
   identify a gap in social reproduction generated by women's intensive and
   anti-social working conditions in the tourism industry combined with
   enduring attitudes that social reproduction remains the responsibility
   of women. The paper explores the responses to this gap, setting out two
   clear trends - the `contracting out' of social reproduction and the
   construction of policies which aim to minimise the impact of tourism
   development on social reproduction. I argue that both of these responses
   represent privatised solutions to the social reproduction dilemma and
   urge continued support for progressive policy responses.},

Title = {The Political Economy of the MDGs: Retrospect and Prospect for the
   World's Biggest Promise},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {15},
Number = {2},
Pages = {293-306},
Abstract = {The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) were endorsed unanimously by all
   189 UN member states and emerged as one of the central pillars of the
   global fight against poverty. However, the changes the MDGs brought
   about have been mixed at best. Though there are some notable successes,
   the MDGs have failed to bring about a substantial shift towards tackling
   global poverty and have had only a weak impact on the World Bank and
   International Monetary Fund. Several reasons are put forward for this
   failure: the continuing lack of political concern with poverty; the lack
   of a social movement behind the MDGs; and the lack of a well formed
   epistemic community for the MDGs to tie into. However, this paper argues
   that it would be wrong to dismiss the MDGs as a complete failure. The
   MDG project should instead be seen in a long term context as having
   played a role in changing international values and contributed to the
   emergence of an international norm that sees poverty in an affluent
   world as being morally unacceptable.},

Abstract = {After presenting evidence that the current system of congressional
   oversight of intelligence is failing, this article analyzes how the
   system has been undermined by a toxic combination of problems: the
   intelligence committees' inherent informational disadvantage in relation
   to the executive branch, the jurisdictional morass in which the
   committees must operate and their own internecine partisanship. The
   article discusses a range of specific changes that could be made, but
   concludes that the critical ingredient in strengthening the oversight
   system is to emphasize the development of strong, nonpartisan committee
   leadership.},

Abstract = {This article examines the EU's role in the emergence of international
   development policy in the 10 member states from Central and Eastern
   Europe (CEE). Development policy provides useful insights into policy
   making as it is a key way that states operationalise their foreign
   policy. Thus, development policy gives us insights into the foreign
   policy priorities of the new member states. This article reviews the
   emergence and elaboration of policy relating to international
   development in the new member states and explores how far we have
   witnessed the Europeanisation of development cooperation in CEE states.},

Abstract = {The mythology of the European Union (EU) in world politics can be told
   and untold in many different ways. This article focuses on the lore or
   stories of who did what to whom, the ideological projection of the past
   onto the present and the escapist pleasure of storytelling in looking at
   the mythology of `global Europa' - the EU in the world. It concludes
   with a reflection on the way in which the many diverse myths of global
   Europa compete for daily attention, whether as lore, ideology or
   pleasure. In this respect the mythology of global Europa is part of our
   everyday existence, part of the EU in and of the world.},

Abstract = {Latin America (LA) can count some strong research centers with a
   tradition of research excellence in certain disciplines such as medicine
   and biology, nuclear technology, metallurgy and materials, among others.
   Latin American countries have generated networks of researchers across
   disciplines, centers, etc. within a country, and linking two or more
   countries in the region (e. g., Argentina-Brazil Bi-National Center for
   Nanoscience \& Nanotechnology, CABN). Additionally, collaborations have
   extended beyond LA, mainly to the EU and the USA. In general, these
   programs have been quite successful in the generation of
   interdisciplinary nanoscience and nanotechnology (N \& N) research. The
   relation between academia and industry has been improving in the last
   few years, but it is still weak. In particular, funding incentives for
   N\&N efforts have encouraged joint efforts and contributed to new
   dimensions in collaborations. This chapter reviews the state of
   nanoscience and nanotechnology in Chile, Brazil, Argentina and Mexico.},

Title = {Sexual Politics and Ascriptive Autonomy},
Journal = {POLITICS \& GENDER},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {6},
Number = {4},
Pages = {573-600},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {I explore the notion of ascriptive autonomy as a conceptual and
   political tool that can be used to understand and enact potentially
   liberatory practices that enable marginalized people to have greater
   individual autonomy. ``Ascriptive autonomy{''} refers to the sense in
   which autonomy is partly constituted by the conferral of the status of
   ``autonomous individual.{''} Autonomy is both a capacity to determine
   one's own ends and a status conferred by virtue of being recognized by
   others. I focus on the link between these two facets of autonomy insofar
   as recognition may enable the development of capacity. In certain
   situations, autonomy may be ascribed even if one lacks some requirements
   associated with the capacity for autonomy because of either
   institutional or psychic constraints that follow from oppression. In
   such instances of ``selective, purposeful misrecognition,{''} ascription
   may lead to the cultivatation of the capacity for autonomy while opening
   up a space for politics. To demonstrate this, I recast the feminist
   debate over sexuality using the terms of ascriptive autonomy. When
   viewed through the lens of misrecognition, we can better respond to
   critiques that charge proponents of the ``pro-sex{''} position with
   focusing on sexual pleasure at the expense of sufficient attention paid
   to the constraints faced by women.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the issue of cross-border mobility of persons
   viewed from a social inequality perspective. After considering the
   significance of social closure and border control for the historical
   development of modern states and citizenship, it offers a critique of
   restrictions on mobility rights enforced by liberal states. On the basis
   of empirical data on visa regulations, it demonstrates that mobility
   rights are distributed highly unequally, favouring citizens from rich
   democracies. This tendency has been accelerated and driven by the
   processes of globalization. The final discussion argues that under
   conditions of increased mobility, the polarization between those who are
   granted mobility rights and those who are not tends to grow.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the parliamentary debates and decision-making
   related to the highly contentious EU directive on services. It is
   intended as a contribution to the academic debate on political conflict
   lines in the European Parliament. Our argument is that neither the
   left-right cleavage nor a territorial one (old versus new Member States)
   can fully explain conflict at stake on socio-economic issues. Rather,
   what we can observe is cross-cutting opposition between `regulators' and
   `liberals'.},

Title = {When Child Soldiers Reconcile: Accountability, Restorative Justice, and

Volume = {2},

Abstract = {The international consensus that child soldiering must end does not
   extend to agreement over best practices for helping demobilized children
   to reconcile with their communities and integrate meaningfully into
   them. Based on experience in an unusually successful non-governmental
   organization (NGO) program that the author designed for a group of a
   dozen former boy combatants in post-conflict Sierra Leone, he advocates
   that humanitarian agencies address two paradoxical needs among such
   children: acceptance and accountability. Many organizations serving
   children affiliated with fighting forces, however, limit themselves to
   community-building and skills training, while avoiding questions of
   personal well-being. By ignoring children's submerged guilt and shame,
   such programming potentially imperils both the children themselves and
   those around them, since these feelings may erupt in unfettered fury
   directed either internally or externally. Dictating to ex-fighters that
   they are not at fault for their actions may seriously exacerbate the
   situation.
   A case study of the author's dance/movement therapy group with
   ex-combatant teenagers illustrates a methodology - based in kinesthetic
   empathy - for fostering a sense of collective agency and self-worth, and
   a restored capacity for positive interaction. Through improvisational
   dancing and dramatizations of their time with the rebel army, the 12
   youths dispelled long suppressed rage and practiced reconnecting with
   others. Given the liberty within a safe space to acknowledge their
   experiences, and mourn their suffering and that of those whom they had
   caused to suffer, the former boy soldiers discovered a route to
   reconciliation with a community that had shunned them for years. The
   youths' earnest public dramatization of their wartime history prompted
   local elders to welcome them to assume productive adult roles in the
   devastated area's development.},

Abstract = {European citizenship is marked by a tension: between a citizenship that
   is derivative of the nation-state and a citizenship that is defined by
   free movement. Approaching this tension as symptomatic of a deep-rooted
   contradiction between integration and mobility that is constitutive of
   modern social formations, this article develops a political sociology of
   mobility that challenges territorial and culturalist accounts of
   European citizenship. It does so by exploring the political enactment of
   European citizenship by marginalized subjects, whose engagement in
   relations of exchange serves as the ground for acts of European
   citizenship that `mobilize mobility'. This is illustrated by an analysis
   of the 2005 Declaration for the Rights of Sex Workers in Europe.},

Abstract = {This article explores the possibility of resistance under conditions of
   extreme state power in liberal democracies. It examines the strategies
   of migrants without legal status who, when threatened with one of the
   most awesome powers of the liberal state-expulsion-shed their legal
   identity in order to escape the state's reach. Remarkably, in doing so,
   they often succeed in preventing the state from exercising its sovereign
   powers. The article argues that liberal states are uniquely constrained
   in their dealing with undocumented migrants. Not only are they forced to
   operate within the constraints of the international legal order-making
   repatriation contingent on the possession of identity documents-but the
   liberal state is also constitutionally limited in its exercise of
   coercion against the individual. The article concludes that it is those
   individuals who have the weakest claims against the liberal state that
   are most able to constrain its exercise of sovereignty.},

Abstract = {In justifying participation in military intervention in Afghanistan and
   Iraq as part of the ``war on terror,{''} Australian Prime Minister John
   Howard invoked the memory of Australian sacrifice in war, linked most
   prominently to the so-called ``Anzac myth.{''} This paper explores the
   role of memory politics in enabling military intervention, discussing in
   the process the relationship between sites and forms of remembrance and
   broader discourses of national identity. This use of collective memory
   has significant implications for debates about Australian identity, and
   suggests the need for approaches to the study of international relations
   to take seriously the role of memory politics in coming to terms with
   conditions of possibility for particular security policies and
   practices.},

Abstract = {The authors analyze the effects of structural adjustment and violence on
   international migration from selected countries in Latin America by
   estimating a series of event history models that predicted the
   likelihood of initial migration to the United States as a function of
   the murder rate, economic openness, and selected controls in the country
   of origin. Although several theories posit a connection between
   structural economic change and violence, such a pattern held only in
   Nicaragua, where the homicide rate increased as the economy was opened
   to trade and average incomes deteriorated. Moreover, only in Nicaragua
   was lethal violence positively related to out-migration. In Mexico,
   Costa Rica, and Guatemala, rising violence reduced the likelihood of
   emigration. Violence does not appear to have uniform effects on patterns
   of international migration but depends on broader social and political
   conditions within particular countries.},

Abstract = {Participants in randomized trials sometimes prefer to be assigned to one
   arm rather than another. While randomization aims to ensure that
   participants with different preferences are spread equally among the
   arms of the trials, it cannot always address the possible effects of
   participant preferences on outcomes, compliance, and attrition. This
   paper discusses the conceptual, design, and statistical complications
   associated with preference effects and evaluates a number of
   experimental designs that have been proposed to gauge and minimize the
   effect of participant preferences.},

Abstract = {The globalized security situation characterized by transnational threats
   and international interventionism in ``new wars,{''} connect non
   traditional local actors and traditional global actors to one another in
   unprecedented ways. We argue that children in particular need to be
   highlighted because they are highly pertinent to the globalized security
   situation, yet they make up one of the few agents that have remained
   non-politicized in the eyes of the scholarly community. The article
   suggests a framework of analysis that can generate analyses on security
   of traditional as well as non-traditional agents. Placing
   non-traditional groups in the center of attention serves to mirror the
   complexities of the current security situation better.},

Abstract = {The article provides a critical analysis of how IPE might engage with
   the question of ethics. After reviewing existing calls to bring ethics
   and ethical considerations within the mainstream of the discipline
   several questions are made. Drawing from critical and post-structural
   thought, it is argued that existing accounts of ethics privilege a
   problematic separation between ethics and power. Power is depicted as
   obligation - as power over -while ethics is depicted as an ameliorative
   other to power. We draw out several limits in this separation -
   including the reification of market subjectivities of contract,
   individualism, and a problematic global scale - arguing that ethics
   should be seen as a constitutive discourse like any other. Power is
   re-phrased as productive, as the power to. We conclude by articulating a
   pragmatist research agenda that seeks to foster the kernel `possibility'
   in discourses of ethics while retaining sensitivity to the potential
   constitutive `violence' of ethics. Given this dilemma, we argue that
   ongoing practices of `resistance' - in both practical and scholarly
   senses - should be a central problematic for engaging with the
   (political) question of ethics in IPE.},

Abstract = {This article argues that foreign languages are another part of the
   `missing dimension' of intelligence. By examining the role of linguists
   in Y stations and at Bletchley Park in the Second World War, the article
   explores the institutional language policies developed for intelligence,
   and the working practices of those with foreign language skills. The
   article suggests that certain issues raised by this case study might be
   usefully examined in other intelligence contexts: the ways in which
   foreign language requirements are officially represented, the
   problematics of foreignness for recruiters, the status and identities of
   language workers, and the implications of professional translation
   practice within an intelligence environment.},

Abstract = {Although the impact of open innovation on a global scale on the
   collaboration between universities and foreign industry is clearly
   important, empirical evidence from the field is lacking. This chapter
   investigates the collaboration between Hungarian universities and
   foreign companies in research and development. The chapter attempts to
   provide a relevant picture of the research-related linkages of Hungarian
   universities and foreign companies by employing secondary data processed
   from various data-banks. The analysis suggests that foreign direct
   investment and foreign companies play major roles in the
   internationalisation of research during this second decade of the
   transition process. Assessing the research and technology products which
   have originated in university-industry collaboration is no easy task.
   According to experimental measurements and pilot data-bank, there were
   more joint publications involving foreign than domestic companies, and
   the citation value per publication was significantly higher with the
   former. Data-bank also show that developments in new technology in terms
   of patent figures rarely involved university-owned or co-owned
   inventions, although there is some evidence there are more patents which
   are university-related than owned. Domestic invention and the foreign
   ownership of patents represent one more sign of Hungarian involvement in
   global innovation in the development of new technologies.},

Abstract = {This article explores the homogenising pressures of globalisation and
   institutional change in the state-led model of capitalism, within the
   purview of the `varieties of capitalism' literature. In light of the
   observation that the national political economies which are the
   exemplars of the state-led model have undergone a more fundamental
   change towards the liberal market model than the other non-liberal
   variant (namely, the coordinated market model), the article asks what
   systemic (structural-institutional) factors make the state-led model
   less resilient in the face of pressures for change. Focusing on
   corporate governance in South Korea as an illustrative case study, the
   article argues that the absence of the kind of institutional
   complementarity (that is, mutually reinforcing link) between the key
   capitalist sub-systems found in the coordinated market model can help to
   explain the profound, and even path-shifting, change in the state-led
   model.},

Abstract = {Using cross-national governance indicators and evidence from a recent
   Bulgarian survey, this essay examines political reforms in Bulgaria and
   Romania since EU accession and, in particular, the `backsliding'
   hypothesis-that these countries have abandoned or reversed the reforms
   they introduced in order to qualify for membership of the European
   Union. It finds no systematic evidence either that these countries have
   been backsliding or that their trajectories differ significantly from
   their first-wave Central and East European neighbours, though governance
   reforms have slowed after accession. The second part of the essay
   focuses on the mechanisms responsible for the lack of significant
   backsliding, emphasising the role of continued conditionality through
   the safeguard clauses, EU funding and increasing linkage between new and
   old EU members, including opportunities for East Europeans to work and
   travel in Western Europe.},

Title = {Descriptive Representation by Gender and Race/Ethnicity in Municipal
   Bureaucracies: Change in US Multiethnic Cities, 1987-2001},

Abstract = {We explore the extent of employment inequalities between Latinas,
   African American women, and white (non-Latina) women (and their
   coethnics) in public sector managerial positions in multiethnic US
   cities. Our analysis of Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)
   data from 1987 and 2001 indicates that all groups of women suffer from
   underrepresentation at the administrator level, especially in agencies
   that have regulatory and distributive policy commitments, but that
   Latinas and African American women show the lowest levels of
   representation. Moreover, Latinas and African American women are
   substantially underrepresented among professional workforces in almost
   all municipal departments; however, white (non-Latina) women achieve
   parity in many cities. Among pairs of coethnics (e.g. African American
   females versus African American males), we find that males are usually
   better represented than females, but even in multiethnic cities large
   disparities remain between white males and all other groups in the
   ability to claim and retain the most prestigious municipal government
   positions. We are concerned that the continuing lack of progress made by
   members of traditionally disadvantaged groups may further compromise the
   representativeness and legitimacy of bureaucracies in many multiethnic
   citesand may also present a serious barrier to addressing important
   public policy challenges in these cities.},

   trafficked persons, this analysis discusses protective agents' roles as
   gatekeepers, interpreters and knowledge brokers in identifying
   trafficked persons and in managing their experience after the temporal
   moment of `rescue' has come to pass. This work further investigates the
   concept of carceral protectionism and maps how Dutch protective
   interventions have impacted trafficked and potentially trafficked
   persons.},

Abstract = {This article compares German and Soviet ideas behind raising penal units
   on the Eastern Front during World War II and their employment in combat,
   but focuses on Soviet practice. In an attempt to tighten discipline in
   the Red Army, Stalin adopted the basic draconian measures used by Leon
   Trotsky, his most bitter rival, during the Civil War of 1918-1922 but he
   considerably intensified the scale and scope of repressions thus
   elevating the brutality on the Eastern Front to new heights. U

Abstract = {States and international organizations often attempt to influence the
   behavior of a target government by employing conditionality-i.e., they
   condition the provision of some set of benefits on changes in the
   target's policies. Conditionality may give rise to a commitment problem:
   once the proffered benefits are granted, the target's incentive for
   continued compliance declines. In this paper, I document a mechanism by
   which conditionality may induce compliance even after these benefits are
   distributed. If conditionality alters the composition of domestic
   interest groups in the target state, it may induce permanent changes in
   the target government's behavior. I construct a dynamic model of
   lobbying that demonstrates that conditionality can reduce long-term
   levels of state capture. And I test the model's predictions using data
   from the accession of Eastern European countries to the EU.},

Abstract = {The general role of symbolic power in contributing to the legitimacy of
   security has been acknowledged, and this article seeks, more
   specifically, to advance the understanding of gendered power dynamics
   and (in)security. It demonstrates how, through their first decade of
   existence, nonstate crisis centers in Northwest Russia contributed to
   security but also to the (unintentional) marginalization of women's
   security. Their emphasis on victims acting on their own behalf, inducing
   them to becoming acting subjects, is a misrecognition of the effect of
   symbolic power in this field. The refusal by the Russian (patriarchal)
   legislature of anti-domestic violence law, combined with the hesitancy
   of public institutions' personnel (doctors, police, judges) to provide
   support for women, gives the local crisis centers, which lacked
   financial resources, little choice about which intervention strategies
   to prioritize while emphasizing women's personal responsibility.},

Abstract = {This article contributes to the integration of Neighbourhood
   Europeanization in the literature on Europeanization. Based on insights
   from Membership and Enlargement Europeanization, we reveal important
   inconsistencies of Neighbourhood Europeanization through ENP as well as
   a lack of robust empirical support for its effectiveness. We define core
   dimensions and determinants of Neighbourhood Europeanization and
   implement this analytical framework for the case of Ukraine. The
   analysis clearly demonstrates substantial asymmetries in ENP policy
   across the three dimensions we chose - democracy promotion, economic
   co-operation and JHA, which clearly reflect the inconsistency of the ENP
   concept: top-down formulation of EU interests combined with weak
   conditionality. ENP inconsistencies could however be overcome through
   widening linkages and improving financial support to mobilize and
   strengthen positive local support of EU demands and rewards.},

Title = {The Ogaden War and the Demise of Detente},
Journal = {ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {632},
Pages = {26-40},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The failure of detente has been a popular theme among historians of
   American foreign policy, with opinions divided as to where the
   responsibility for this failure lies. A commonality among all points of
   view, however, is the importance of events in the third world,
   particularly in the ``Arc of Crisis.{''} One such event-the Ogaden War
   between Ethiopia and Somalia-prompted Zbigniew Brzezinski, President
   Carter's national security advisor, to comment that detente was
   ``buried{''} in the Ogaden. His point was that Carter's new approach to
   the cold war was put to the test during the Ogaden War, and there the
   policy's untenability was proven. The policy's failure, in turn,
   encouraged Soviet adventurism, which further alienated the American
   public from Carter's attempt to fight the cold war. Carter's policy
   eventually led to the withdrawal of the SALT II (Strategic Arms
   Limitation Talks) Treaty and, as Brzezinski claimed, the collapse of
   detente. This article discusses Carter's foreign policy toward the
   Ogaden War, considers the accuracy of Brzezinski's claim, and reaches
   conclusions regarding the role of the Carter administration in the
   demise of detente.},

Abstract = {This research examines the potential of information disclosure for
   environmental regulation. The research attempts to answer questions of
   what impact information disclosure has on corporate environmental
   practices and what interferes with its effective use. A case study of
   Indonesia's pioneering informational environmental regulation reveals
   (i) both indirect (e.g. anticipation of external pressure) and direct
   (e.g. internal learning support) informational effects that enhance
   environmental awareness at the top management level and stimulate
   changes in production processes and (ii) detrimental effects of
   disclosed information that maintain or strengthen the extant power of
   regulated firms over environmental groups and local communities
   affected. Regulatory efforts can be leveraged by public disclosure of
   information regarding firms' environmental performance, especially where
   the state monitoring and enforcement capacities are weak. However, the
   introduction of policies of this kind without consideration of different
   market conditions and political and administrative culture may impede
   the effectiveness of this potentially useful regulatory method.},

Abstract = {Despite their high out-migration rate, Puerto Ricans in the United
   States send less money than Dominicans and Mexicans to their relatives
   back home. One explanation for the low level of private transfers of
   Puerto Ricans is that public disbursements, especially for nutritional
   assistance, housing subsidies, and educational grants, may well be the
   safety net in Puerto Rico that remittances serve in other countries. In
   addition, most Puerto Ricans are covered by unemployment and disability
   insurance, and many have earned benefits such as Social Security,
   Medicare, and veterans pensions. Finally, Puerto Rico's higher standard
   of living, compared to other Latin American countries, may mean that
   many migrants do not feel as obliged to send money to their country of
   origin as Mexicans or Dominicans do. The broader implications of
   remittances for understanding the transnational ties between Puerto
   Ricans on and off the island are examined and compared with the other
   two groups.},

Abstract = {Scholars have long recognized the impact transformative political events
   have had on migration patterns in individual countries, but few have
   extended these ideas to the current period of political transition
   taking place across Latin America. Through analysis of data from the
   Latin American Migration Project (LAMP) and the Mexican Migration
   Project (MMP) from across Peru, Nicaragua, and the Mexican states of
   Guerrero and Oaxaca, the authors offer cross-national and subnational
   evidence of the role political ``shocks{''} play in determining the
   demographic and socioeconomic profiles of migrants from these areas over
   the past twenty years. The results suggest that even in times of
   democratic opening, citizens' migration decisions are in part driven by
   political considerations.},

Abstract = {This article argues that detached, impersonal and `objective' social
   science research is inadequate to investigate complex social phenomena
   such as poverty and development. `Engaged' research into the subjective
   realities of people's experience leads to a more nuanced and complete
   understanding of not only those elements which can be objectively
   measured, such as income and consumption, but the full complexity of
   poverty. Listening to the stories and `words from the heart' of people
   who, as partners in the research, reconstruct their own lived
   experiences, and their analysis, knowledge and aspirations, democratizes
   knowledge, and leads to a more complete and nuanced understanding of
   elements such as hunger, discrimination, social exclusion, stigma, and
   disempowerment. Such research, done with empathy and respect, ethical
   concern and personal accountability, and without compromising the search
   for the truth, is both legitimate and has academic and practical value.
   The knowledge and insights derived from it can be invaluable in efforts
   to secure the human rights of disadvantaged and oppressed people, and in
   the design and evaluation of public policy.},

Abstract = {Erving Goffman's attention to the concept of framing provided modern
   sociolog with a critical means for expanding explorations of the
   cultural terrain of meaning-making. Frame analysis concerns the manner
   in which individuals perceive and respond to particular events and
   circumstances. Since Coffman's introduction of the term, the concept of
   framing has been expanded considerably in sociological inquiry. What
   Coffman and many of his adherents may not have imagined, however, is
   that frame analysis serves as a useful tool for improved comprehension
   of how low-income individuals interpret and present images of their
   social reality. By drawing from literature that makes use of frame
   analysis in sociological subfields somewhat removed from research on
   race and poverty and incorporating data from low-income African American
   men who reside in Detroit, this article explores how these concepts can
   enrich and advance sociologically grounded cultural inquiry into poverty
   and argues that scholarly approaches to considering the agency of the
   poor can be revised and enriched.},

Abstract = {Using the political conflict in Peru as a case study, the author argues
   that the thesis that rape is a weapon of war obscures other rape regimes
   during political conflict. These include rape as consumption,
   opportunistic rape, rape by neighbors or family members, forced
   prostitution and rape in the aftermath of war. Neglect of forms of
   sexual violence that do not fit the rape-as-a-weapon-of-war script
   seriously impedes the transformative potential of processes of
   transitional justice, as it allows for the continuation of (sexual)
   violence against women that perpetuates hierarchies based on gender,
   race and class.},

Abstract = {Recent attempts to revive counterinsurgency strategies for use in
   Afghanistan and Iraq have been marked by a determination to learn
   lessons from history. Using the case of the campaign against the Mau Mau
   insurgency in Kenya of 1952-60, this article considers the reasons for
   this engagement with the past and the issues that have emerged as a
   consequence. The article disputes the lessons from British colonial
   history that have been learned by military planners, most obviously the
   characterization of nonmilitary forms of British counterinsurgency as
   nonviolent. Although it contests some of these supposed precedents for
   successful counterinsurgency in British military history, the article
   also identifies more generalizable elements of the Kenyan case.
   Particular emphasis is given to the effects on the nature of
   counterinsurgency, a reliance on locally recruited allies, and the
   decentralization of command.},

Abstract = {This study focuses on interactions between intergovernmental
   organizations (IOs) working in the anti-corruption realm. It
   investigates the factors that enhance IO cooperation. Based on
   expectations derived primarily from the organization theory literature
   and, more specifically, from exchange theory, we develop a set of
   hypotheses regarding the relevance of IO financial resources, expertise,
   prestige, and bureaucratic culture on the likelihood that IOs will
   engage in cooperative behavior. The study tests these hypotheses on the
   formal and informal collaborative networks formed between seventeen IOs
   engaged in anti-corruption work. The results of the tests offer support
   for most of the hypotheses and suggest several additional arguments
   explaining the likelihood of inter-organizational collaboration.},

Journal = {EUROPE-ASIA STUDIES},

Volume = {62},
Number = {5},
Pages = {807-827},
Abstract = {Party nationalisation, defined as the homogeneity of party strength
   across a country, has recently become a major issue in research. Even
   though territory is a salient political question in the post-communist
   countries in Europe, party nationalisation in these countries has been
   neglected by the literature so far. This article presents data on party
   nationalisation for 20 countries over the period 1990-2007. It shows
   that the nationalisation of party systems in post-communist democracies
   is closely related to the territorial structure of social divisions,
   except for cases where the electoral systems provide for a high degree
   of nationalisation, or where super-presidentialism inhibits the creation
   of strong nationalised parties.},

Abstract = {Braddock's perpetuation hypothesis argues that racial segregation is
   self-perpetuated over the life cycle and across institutional settings.
   Studies examining the relationship between segregation and college
   choice consistently show that black students who attend segregated
   schools are more likely to choose predominantly black colleges over
   predominantly white colleges. This study extends previous research by
   considering not only blacks but also Hispanics, Asians, and whites.
   Consistent with Braddock's claim, results show a positive association
   between the ethno-racial composition of schools and first college
   preference for all demographic groups considered. However, this
   association disappears for blacks and Hispanics after controlling for
   the ethno-racial composition of the nearest two- and four-year colleges.
   These findings indicate that geographic context better explains the
   perpetuation of segregation than same-group preferences.},

Abstract = {This chapter aims to provide a new readiness matrix called `innovative
   manufacturing readiness levels (IMRLs)' to evaluate and assess the areas
   of micro and nanotechnology maturity including their performance. The
   study employs a case study approach through which the practicability and
   applicability of the IMRLs conceptual matrix were verified and
   confirmed. A case study with laser-based manufacturing technologies
   explores the stages of micro and nano technologies (MNTs)' maturity,
   including the key issues and performances that contributed to the
   development of a new assessment tool. Concerning intense global R\&D
   competition in MNTs, this study exhibits a forward-looking approach in
   assessing MNTs maturity and performance. A generic conclusion is reached
   by which product designers and technology managers position themselves
   and take into account risk reduction exercises related to MNTs. The
   novelty of the research could be that organizations, which develop and
   use MNTs, have an opportunity in applying such a specific assessment
   matrix to quantify the technology readiness of unreleased MNTs.},

Abstract = {In this article, I examine the gendered politics of the Yakama
   Reservation food economy. Drawing from ethnographic data, I discuss the
   importance of culture and health as human rights. My analysis reveals
   that indigenous people's health and well-being deteriorates as
   traditional cultural practices are undermined within a globalized and
   neo-colonial context; however, I also find that indigenous women are
   resisting the social, political and economic forces that limit Yakama
   people's rights to culture and health. Traditional cultural teachings
   place women in a position of power, as they control an important source
   of wealth: the food supply of the people. Today, women are reclaiming
   this position of power as they resist widely available convenience and
   fast foods to nurture their families and provide for a healthier next
   generation on the reservation. In doing so, our people are able to
   resist the hegemony of the capitalist food system, which supplies most
   of the food on the reservation and allows us to begin envisioning a
   Yakama feminist approach to human rights work.},

Abstract = {Colonel Edward M. House, the close personal confidant of American
   President Woodrow Wilson, disembarked in Great Britain in January 1916
   on a mission to bring the First World War to a close under the auspices
   of American mediation. Although his mission, which culminated in a
   secret pact between the United States and Great Britain known as the
   House-Grey Memorandum, has been studied by several scholars, the
   involvement of British intelligence with respect to that mission has
   never received more than cursory attention. Through a careful analysis
   of the surviving documents, this article reconstructs British
   intelligence's activities with respect to House's mission, examines the
   countermeasures that House employed as he attempted to protect the
   secrecy of his negotiations, delineates the role played by different
   British intelligence agencies and assesses their response to their
   findings.},

   organized armed groups. There are various so-called ``new groups{''} of
   paramilitaries that cannot be qualified as a party to the conflict as a
   whole. Due to a lack of complete information about the organization of
   these groups, it is also difficult to identify at least some of them as
   such with certainty. Hence, an operation against these groups occurs in

   poverty reduction strategy paradigm},
Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {17},
Number = {5},
Pages = {816-839},
Abstract = {This article invokes Gramscian theory in an effort to better grasp the
   reorganization of social reproduction under neoliberal globalization. It
   argues that recent transformations in the world development order
   warrant a rethinking of the concept of social reproduction, towards
   acknowledging the increasingly apparent role of transnational governance
   institutions in organizing social reproduction processes, particularly
   in peripheral countries. To substantiate this argument, the article
   interrogates the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper development approach,
   the most visible policy tool of the post-Washington Consensus. In the
   Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper process, the World Bank has started to
   link debt relief administered through the Enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor
   Country (HIPC II) initiative to the delivery of basic social services to
   the poor, and directly finances human capital investments through
   conditional cash transfer programs. While conditionalities attached to
   Bank funding continue to promote the privatization of various state
   functions associated with social reproduction, especially in the areas
   of health care and education, the Bank, at the same time, funds `social
   inclusion' programs that directly absorb some of these functions. This
   signals the emergence of a new social reproduction regime of
   `conditional inclusion' under World Bank leadership.},

Abstract = {As a result of reforms in the Russian power sector, vertically
   integrated monopolies have been broken up, generation companies
   privatised, and a competitive electricity market introduced. This
   article discusses the key acts of the reform, the political and economic
   circumstances in which it has been enacted, and the challenges being
   confronted. These include, in particular, the impact of the financial
   crisis and the structural weaknesses it has exposed, the changing
   relationship between the gas and electricity market, the understanding
   of `market competition' and pricing held by key actors, the problems
   caused by adhering to pre-determined targets, and the imperative of
   ensuring a `socially responsible' transition.},

Abstract = {This article explores the gender regime that regulates access to, and
   the biased power distribution embedded in, political office at the local
   level, a seriously underresearched unit of analysis. Ultimately, it aims
   to contribute to wider reflection on the informal rules entrenched in
   political parties' candidate selection processes. I do so by analyzing
   candidate lists in the context of the application of a quota law. The
   article is empirically grounded in Spanish subnational politics. I find
   that quota laws do not eliminate gender differences among parties:
   Inequality is less marked in organizations with long-established gender
   quotas than in those where recent quotas, targets, or goals are used.
   Nonetheless, the prevalence of pervasive sexist organizational cultures
   within the parties impedes a greater efficacy of gender quotas. Finally,
   I show that women are more likely to recruit women than men and that
   women's agency in its diverse forms boosts female representation.},

Abstract = {It is analyzed how size differences among countries affect the benefits
   from climate coalitions. It is shown that size differences lead to
   smaller coalitions and greater benefits than coalitions among identical
   countries. The importance of trigger strategies for supporting
   cooperative solutions is considered. A real world example, based on the
   world's six largest emitters, is used to illustrate the implications of
   size differences in terms of emissions versus valuations of benefits.
   Climate coalitions become smaller when ranking in terms of benefits is
   different from ranking in terms of emissions. Three cases of benefit
   valuations are considered: benefits equal (i) share in world emissions,
   (ii) share in world GDP, and (iii) share of world population.},

Abstract = {This article compares the debates and demonstrations about Darfur that
   have taken place in the Sudan, the United States, and Qatar and
   illuminates how political violence is apprehended and cultural
   identities are constructed. The rallies that occurred among Sudanese
   inside and outside the Sudan following the 2009 indictment of President
   Omar Hassan al-Bashir by the International Criminal Court (ICC) are
   particularly revealing. Examining what has been represented worldwide as
   the first genocide of the twenty-first century brings to light the
   ideologies that are expressed in impassioned political positions.
   Ideology, which implicitly undergirds the mixed emotions with which the
   ICC warrant was received, has been fundamental to the Darfur story from
   the start of the crisis in 2003. Describing Darfur in three distinct
   sociopolitical arenas, one sees various scenarios that are akin to a
   play with multiple actors and scenes, each of which is contextually
   mediated and expertly produced. The disconnections, ruptures, and shifts
   in the flow of this narration point to the disparities in the
   situational, local, regional, and transnational forces at work.},

Abstract = {The literature on legislative decision-making and bargaining in the EU
   has reached a common conclusion that the European Parliament
   (Parliament) and the Council of the European Union (Council) are on an
   equal footing in the main legislative procedure, the co-decision
   procedure. We present theoretical and empirical evidence to suggest that
   this is not the case. First, our analysis of the formal rules reveals
   that the Council has conditional agenda-setting power due to a change in
   the majority thresholds for adopting legislation from the first to the
   second reading in the Parliament. This change has important implications
   for the internal dynamics of the Parliament and its institutional powers
   vis-a-vis the Council. Testing these analytical considerations of the
   formal decision rules against voting data on all co-decision legislation
   adopted in the two institutions between 1999 and 2004, our empirical
   findings show that: first, from 1999 to 2004 coalition formation in the
   Council fell predominantly along the traditional left-right political
   dimensions when negotiating co-decision proposals. Second, when
   disagreement over legislation is recorded in the Council, a strong
   divide can also be found in the Parliament. Third, when the Parliament
   is divided along party political lines, it is less likely to be able to
   meet the absolute majority requirement for amending the proposal adopted
   by the Council. Lastly, Parliament amendments are most likely to be
   adopted when a decision by voting is requested by a party group
   associated with the main ideological contingency in the Council.},

   examination, this article explores the pros and cons of regional and
   inter-regional energy co-operation. In spite of present unilateral and
   bilateral manoeuvres on the part of EU Member States to the contrary, a
   common energy security policy appears feasible over the next five to ten
   years. However, EU-Russian co-operation in the energy sector is not
   likely to improve considerably over this period, and EU attempts to
   counterbalance the dominant and growing position that Russia has
   occupied in the supply of gas to EU countries by seeking alternative
   energy supply from central Asia are likely to be thwarted by
   countervailing Russian measures.},

Abstract = {This article examines the nexus between the EU's goal of being a leading
   actor on the world stage in devising a global solution to the threat of
   climate change and the performance of its Member States in meeting their
   climate change obligations. In doing so the article will discuss the
   concept of EU leadership, examine the modes of leadership the EU has
   employed in pursuing its climate protection objectives, scrutinize the
   extent to which EU Member States are actually living up to their Kyoto
   obligations and analyse how the EU's own performance, credibility and
   legitimacy in this area affects its aspirations to be a key
   norm-entrepreneur in the establishment of a post-2012 climate change
   agreement. The article concludes with a balance sheet of some of the
   Union's key successes and failures and closes by highlighting some
   potentially inconvenient truths that might frustrate the EU's climate
   protection aspirations.},

Abstract = {The European Commission proposal on the liberalization of energy markets
   has been widely debated in policy, stakeholder and academic circles both
   for its content and the potential consequences for the structure of the
   EU gas and electricity markets. However, little has been said about the
   empirical evidence produced by the European Commission to support this
   legislative package. Since the Impact Assessment (IA) system has been in
   place, there have been concerns regarding quality and adequateness,
   especially when quantifying costs, benefits and risks, selecting policy
   options and considering stakeholder opinions. This article examines how
   these crucial issues were factored into the IA on the liberalization of
   EU energy markets. It is concluded that the selected policy option
   reflects the position of some stakeholders at the expense of the
   available evidence on its impacts on markets, society and the
   environment.},

Abstract = {Kathleen Thelen is one of the leading scholars studying incremental
   institutional change. In her early works from the 1990s, she introduced
   the conceptualization of different modes of incremental change. These
   modes have central attention in her recent co-edited book with James
   Mahoney, Explaining Institutional Change (2010). Compared with Thelen's
   earlier work, this book provides clearer definitions, addresses the
   explanatory factors of institutional change, and discusses the patterns
   and sequences of gradual institutional change. The theory presented by
   Mahoney and Thelen, however, seems overambitious and subject to a need
   to be overly crisp and clear.},

Journal = {ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {629},

Abstract = {Much of the research explaining the generosity of antipoverty programs
   has focused on the perceived deservingness of the poor. While the notion
   of deservingness is useful in explaining the scope and general outlines
   of policy, it does not help us understand the development and change of
   the specific policy instruments that constitute antipoverty policies.
   The author argues that to better understand the development of
   antipoverty policy tools aimed at changing the behavior of the poor, we
   need to analyze how policy elites frame both the causes of poverty and
   the nature of the poor. He illustrates the utility of this approach by
   analyzing congressional antipoverty discourse in two periods, comparing
   the ``Great Society{''} period of 1964 to 1968 and the ``neoliberal{''}
   era of 1981 to 1996, and shows how policymakers' frames about the causes
   of poverty and about the capacities and desires of the poor shaped the
   specific antipoverty policies adopted in each period.},

Abstract = {This case study shows that despite a rich endowment of natural
   resources, fertile land, and repeated oil booms, the Republic of the
   Congo has been unable to forge a national identity out of diverse and
   hostile tribes. Tribes engage in politics as a zero-sum game, where
   those in power exclude the rest, and those out of power plot to retake
   it. This political culture has led to endemic instability, corruption,
   economic decline, and intense intertribal animosity. For the first three
   decades after independence, Congolese followed Soviet and Chinese models
   for economic development that entailed the nationalization of industry,
   the neglect of agriculture and consumer goods, economic development
   through five-year plans, and political rule through a one-party state.
   This model transformed the country, a food exporter at independence,
   into a food importer; failed to maintain the transportation
   infrastructure left by France; and created a proliferation of
   money-losing state enterprises and an unsustainable expansion of the
   state bureaucracy. The turn to democracy in the 1990s brought not
   stability but civil war as the tradition of zero-sum politics lives on.},

Title = {Policy Lessons from Iraq on Managing Uncertainty in Intelligence
   Assessment: Why the Strategic/Tactical Distinction Matters},
Journal = {INTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {25},
Number = {3},
Pages = {290-308},
Abstract = {This paper focuses on how pre-existing policy priorities and goals among
   policy elites in the US, UK, and Australia encouraged the blurring of
   strategic and tactical intelligence assessment as a mechanism for
   legitimising the Iraq invasion. Through the selective use and
   interpretation of sometimes vague or unsubstantiated tactical and
   technical intelligence and the many uncertainties it contained,
   proponents of the war were able to undermine existing strategic
   assessments on Iraq by introducing a range of possible, but largely
   unsubstantiated, threat scenarios as justification for military action.
   The paper argues that in so far as intelligence reforms are needed, they
   should be focused primarily on the interface between analysis and policy
   making, and the issue of how policy makers interpret and understand the
   uncertainties that intelligence assessments necessarily contain.},

Title = {Re-entering the Lists: MI5's Authorized History and the August 1914
   Arrests},
Journal = {INTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {25},
Number = {4},
Pages = {415-452},
Abstract = {The 2009 Authorized History of MI5 carried a new defence of its August
   1914 operation, in which Vernon Kell, its first Director, supposedly
   scored a coup by capturing all 21 German agents working in Britain. The
   Authorized History went against the version of events given in my
   article `Entering the Lists', published by this journal in 2006, and
   backed up its case with a new arrest list. This article considers that
   new list, and its supposed origins in an MI5 document from 1931. Once
   again it demonstrates the impossibility of turning MI5' s foundation
   myth into history, by showing that not only is the account in the
   Authorized History internally inconsistent, but the arrest list consists
   of 22 names arbitrarily selected from later case summaries, then wrongly
   footnoted to an MI5 document which contains a different list of 21
   names. Indeed, by claiming authority from the only arrest list known to
   have been challenged within MI5 itself, the Authorized History merely
   reinforces the conclusion that Kell fabricated his most famous victory.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF WOMEN POLITICS \& POLICY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {31},
Number = {1},
Pages = {44-66},
Abstract = {To what extent does candidate gender influence voter support in state
   legislative elections? This question is addressed in a candidate-level
   analysis of campaigns involving men and women in 20 states in the 1990s.
   The findings demonstrate some statistically significant differences by
   gender-women actually receive a higher percentage of the vote, although
   these effects are insufficiently large to influence their likelihood of
   winning. Additional analyses consider characteristics of districts and
   states that increase or dampen support for women. For example, women
   receive a greater vote percentage in districts where education levels
   are higher and where there is a larger proportion of African Americans.
   Overall, the major conclusion to emerge is that women have a slight edge
   over men in gaining voter support, but factors such as candidacy status,
   partisanship of the district, and campaign spending have a much stronger
   influence on election outcomes.},

Abstract = {Unlike most nation-states, the EU faces the challenge of actively
   creating and sustaining myths about its polity. In this article we
   explore if and under what conditions the story of a `Green Europe'
   represents a successful new myth on the European project, which is
   appealing to present and future generations and capable of generating
   legitimacy for EU politics. Exploring the narratives of policy leaders
   (storytellers) we trace the functional role of environmental policy for
   the EU polity as a whole, establish the legitimating role of
   environmental policy for the EU and search the extent to which the
   environmental narrative is constructed as an identity-building story. We
   argue that, while the actual performance of the EU in environmental
   policy might raise some doubts about the credibility and hence
   sustainability of the Green Europe myth, `green' has become a brand
   attribute of the EU to the European public and carries a high level of
   legitimacy and potential for identification.},

   technological innovations connote better ways of achieving results. This
   chapter assesses different areas countries can experience technological
   innovations and notes that most African countries are lagging below
   expectations in this regards using secondary data sourced from
   International Telecommunication Union (ITU), United Nations Statistical
   Divisions (UNSTAT), among others. From the analytical perspective, the
   chapter established that the low levels of technological innovations in
   Africa is one of the major reasons why the continent remains in the low
   developmental echelon compared to other regions of the world. Thus, this
   chapter submits that adequate efforts should be placed on functional
   education, health system and technology related innovation programs.
   Besides, Africa and indeed all developing world must revamp their
   infrastructures, especially transportation, power and communication
   towards development in the 21(st) century.},

Abstract = {Agricultural technology development and transfer is a driving force for
   national development. The perspective is to reduce poverty and hunger
   facing people by adopting new measures to raise income and attain
   household food security. This is attainable through the establishment of
   research institutions, extension services, farmer organizations, and
   public private participation. The primary function of extension service
   is to deliver efficient and effective transfer of agricultural
   technologies to farmers as a factor for rural development. The
   importance of technology development and transfer approaches in
   developing countries has been recognized as a tool for economic
   development. Technology development and transfer economics create
   employment opportunities, reduce poverty, and enhance economic growth.
   Therefore, better agricultural technologies and better policies can
   serve as catalysts for economic return. This chapter examines the
   components of agricultural technology development and transfer and
   offers implied lessons for emerging technologies like nanotechnology and
   microelectronics transfer and diffusion.},

Abstract = {This article is a continuation of two essays by the same author on
   Soviet and Russian economic debates between 1987 and 2002 published in
   Europe-Asia Studies in 2006 and 2007. In the most recent phase of these
   debates, between 2003 and 2007, as in previous phases, the questions
   raised went far beyond the usual realm of economics. The questions
   raised included whether Russia should attempt to become a `Western'
   country marked by democracy and a market economy serving the individual
   interests of its citizens or whether it was more important to become a
   great power again; whether Western patterns of political and economic
   life are suitable for Russia or whether the attempt to import foreign
   institutional structures is doomed to failure, making it necessary for
   Russia to find her own way. The discussion here is based on a
   qualitative content analysis of the most important economic journals and
   selected monographs.},

Abstract = {This article contends that decommodification is an appropriate concept
   for understanding diverse initiatives such as fair trade, microfinance,
   open source, social enterprises, and the environmental commons as
   component features of a common process. Decommodification is conceived
   as any political, social, or cultural process that reduces the scope and
   influence of the market in everyday life. Given recent transformations
   in market societies, a more expansive framework for decommodification is
   urgently required. Decommodification would insulate non-market spheres
   from market encroachments; increase the provision of public goods and
   expand social protection; promote democratic control over the market by
   creating economic circuits grounded in a logic predicated on social
   needs rather than profit; and undermine market hegemony by revealing the
   market's true social costs and consequences. By ensuring basic needs,
   enhancing individual capacities and capabilities, and promoting social
   cooperation and collaboration, decommodification constitutes a central
   feature of an egalitarian agenda.},

Volume = {48},

Abstract = {This article notes a lack of communication between two broad schools of
   scholarship on regional integration: EU studies and analyses of the `new
   regionalism'. It is argued that the existence of this divide, which is
   perpetrated by proponents of both schools, is an impediment to the
   elaboration of useful theory as well as being a missed opportunity. The
   benefits and problems of using the EU as a comparator in studies of
   regionalism are assessed. While the mistake of giving the EU analytical
   primacy as a benchmark or model is to be avoided, it is argued that
   careful treatment of accumulated insights from EU studies (including a
   proper re-inspection of classical integration theory) brings clear
   methodological and meta-theoretical benefits for the project of
   comparative regional integration scholarship.},

Abstract = {Since the second half of the twentieth century, studies have documented
   the presence of women and men among migrants to and from Latin America.
   This study analyzes gendered patterns of U.S. migration from a variety
   of nations south of the border and examines how the probabilities of
   migrating on a first U.S. trip shift over the life course and by legal
   status. Using life history data from the Mexican and Latin American
   Migration Projects (MMP and LAMP), the author estimates the conditional
   likelihoods that male and female household heads and spouses of a given
   age migrate with or without documents on a first U.S. trip from four
   nations (Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica) and
   from Puerto Rico. On the whole, findings suggest that the male-led
   process of undocumented migration from Mexico differs sharply from the
   female-led process of documented migration from the Dominican Republic
   and that the gendered patterns of U.S. migration from Nicaragua and
   Costa Rica fall somewhere in between. In contrast, Puerto Rico-U.S.
   mainland migration does not vary sharply by gender. These diverse
   gendered migration systems have implications for our understanding of
   migration in the Americas.},

Abstract = {Scholars have questioned whether international migrants from Latin
   America are able to transfer their levels of education into the U.S.
   labor market. In this article, the author examines the data from the
   Latin American Migration Project for Guatemala, Mexico, Costa Rica, and
   Nicaragua to observe the ability of each of the immigrant groups to
   convert prior education into occupational attainments within the U.S.
   labor market. Results show intercountry differences in the ability of
   the immigrants to translate educational attainments into occupational
   outcomes. Nicaraguans are by far the most educated and are much better
   able to translate home country schooling into highly skilled U.S.
   occupations. However, findings reveal that Nicaraguans have received
   more of an occupational benefit from having legal documents. The author
   argues that in addition to divergent patterns of educational
   selectivity, the contrasting treatment of Nicaraguans and Mexicans by
   U.S. immigration law seems to be responsible, at least in part, for
   their very different positions in the U.S. labor market.},

Abstract = {Can international relations (IR) be studied productively with field
   experimental methods? The two most common existing empirical approaches
   in IR rely on cross-national data, detailed case studies, or a
   combination of the two. One as yet uncommon approach is the use of
   randomized field experiments to evaluate causal hypotheses. Applying
   such methods within IR complements other theoretical, case study, and
   observational research, and permits a productive research agenda to be
   built by testing the micro-foundations of theories within IR. This
   argument is illustrated by exploring how field experimental methods
   could be applied to two existing areas: how international institutions
   facilitate cooperation, and whether international actors can promote
   democracy in sovereign states.},

Abstract = {On 15 July 2004, a public protest was staged in the state of Manipur, in
   India's Northeast, to oppose the rape and custodial killing of a young
   Meitei woman, Thangjam Manorama, by soldiers of a counter-insurgency
   paramilitary battalion, the Assam Rifles, who suspected she was a
   militant. At this protest, several women appeared nude, holding a banner
   that read `Indian army rape us'. This analysis considers how we might
   read the nudity and the statement `Indian army rape us'. I argue that
   the language of law, human rights and women's rights as human rights,
   are inadequate to analyze the protest and the events surrounding it
   because they do not situate the protest within larger political
   struggles in the Northeast. Further, such universalist approaches take
   categories like `Indian citizen', `woman' and `tribal' as a given and do
   not allow for an engagement with how these categories are mutually
   constituted, or the law's complicity in their constitution. Accordingly,
   concerns about contested notions of citizenship that are at the heart of
   the Manipur protest cannot be adequately addressed within this
   framework. Instead, I suggest a postcolonial feminist analytics as an
   alternative means to engage with the political questions raised by the
   protest.},

Abstract = {This article explores the development of the Kriegsmarine's signals
   intelligence service, the B-Dienst, and its role in operational planning
   prior to 1939. It challenges the prevalent view that the Kriegsmarine
   had little interest in intelligence gathering and contends that the
   naval leadership understood the implications and possibilities of this
   new intelligence source. By employing hitherto unused source material
   the article demonstrates how the B-Dienst was systematically protected
   and nurtured by the naval staff. Consequently the Kriegsmarine entered
   the Second World War with a well-prepared signals intelligence machinery
   from which it reaped the rewards in the first half of the conflict.},

Abstract = {Where and how citizens get their political information remains a key
   component of political decision-making. While traditional media outlets
   remain significant, new and newly discovered forms of media are growing
   in importance. One media grouping, women's magazines, emerged as a
   full-fledged source of political information in the 2004 presidential
   campaign. Politics is not a routine subject for magazines like O, the
   Oprah Magazine; Ladies Home Journal; or Latina. Even style magazines
   like Vogue covered the 2004 campaign. Despite their typically ``softer''
   focus, these magazines covered the same issues and provided the same
   level of attention to softer, style-based concerns as current events
   magazines. However, soft and hard news outlets differed significantly in
   the use of partisan terminology and the emphasis on strategic behavior.
   Women's magazines did not subscribe to the game coverage typically
   prevalent in presidential coverage.},

Abstract = {Studies about college majors largely ignore non-citizen or immigrant
   populations. Using the administrative data front two public universities
   in Texas, the author examine students' major choices by citizen status.
   In the context of legislation providing in-state tuition access for
   undocumented students (H.B. 1403, effective 2001), the author tests the
   effects of the policy on students' choices of major. Foreign-born
   populations have a higher propensity to select majors in Science,
   Engineering and Math (SEM) and a lower propensity to enroll in social
   sciences than citizens. Domestic students exhibit variable propensities
   to opt for SEMs, depending on their race. There is evidence of
   behavioral changes pre- to post-H.B. 1403, with foreign-born populations
   shifting away front high-return majors.},

Abstract = {The mid-1950s marked the beginning of tremendous growth in the Soviet
   Union's foreign economic relations. Based on archival research, this
   article argues that this growth masked two contradictory processes. On
   the one hand, Kremlin leaders encouraged ever more economic engagement
   with the world. On the other hand, the Soviet system discouraged
   industrial managers from producing for export, and it often caused
   precious imports to be wasted. This struggle between industry and the
   Kremlin over foreign trade gave impetus to the treadmill of reforms
   launched by the Khrushchev leadership.},

Abstract = {Previous studies have established strong and robust effects of EU
   political conditionality on democracy in the neighbouring countries. We
   test these effects against the claim that historical legacies condition
   the likelihood of successful democratisation-and possibly the EU's
   political conditionality as well. Based on a panel study of 36 countries
   of the Eastern and Mediterranean neighbourhood of the EU between 1988
   and 2004, we show that cultural legacies of religious civilisation are
   indeed conducive to or inhibit democratisation, and reduce the effects
   of political conditionality, but they do not explain away the EU's role
   in promoting democratic consolidation.},

Abstract = {Although not in the Rome Treaty, the EEC/EU has gradually developed
   fundamental rights narratives which constitute a political myth. They
   have a common basis of foundational claims, placing fundamental rights,
   retrospectively, as inherent to the EU and based on a common European
   heritage. Like all myths, this narrative contains factual error, but is
   believed and acted upon by both institutional myth-makers and civil
   society actors. Through mythological free-riding on the Member States
   and the Council of Europe, the EU has been relatively successful in
   avoiding myth competition. Success in the longer run depends on broader
   myth appropriation, coherence and competition with other narratives.},

Journal = {POLITICS \& GENDER},

Volume = {6},
Number = {4},
Pages = {517-544},

Abstract = {This article uses intersectionality as an analytical tool to explore
   struggles for institutional space in policy processes in two ostensibly
   contrasting contexts: ``republican{''} France and the
   ``multicultural{''} United Kingdom. Specifically, the article undertakes
   within-case analysis of three policy processes. In France, we discuss
   the debate over laicite', or secularism, the subsequent formulation of
   the March 2004 law banning the wearing of religious signs in state
   schools, and the creation of the High Authority for the Fight Against
   Discrimination (HALDE). In the UK, we examine the problem definitions,
   language, and subject positions constructed by the 2008 Single Equality
   Bill. The result of these analyses is that institutional actors employ
   similar (though not identical) practices in relation to intersections,
   which have similar outcomes for minority groups on either side of the
   English Channel. Through what we term a ``logic of separation,{''}
   institutional actors severely curtail the ``institutional space{''}
   available to minority ethnic groups to make complex and intersectional
   social justice claims. Even though France and the UK are often portrayed
   as opposites with regard to constructions of citizenship, we argue that
   these seemingly differing traditions of citizenship end up having a
   similar effect of misrecognizing minority women and men's experiences
   and demands.},

Journal = {REGULATION \& GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {4},

Pages = {435-464},

Abstract = {Policymakers globally have debated (and often implemented) the idea of
   consolidating numerous financial regulatory supervisory entities into
   one unitary entity. This article uses a computational model to explore
   the effect such a decision would have on supervisory performance. Using
   insights from organizational scholarship on consensus-making among
   individuals within organizations, the simulation suggests that under
   most conditions a unitary supervisory entity yields lower performance
   than smaller, numerous entities with unique mandates, keeping the number
   of regulatory inspectors constant. This result arises from the
   heterogeneity of perspectives being shared within the entity and the
   influence of precedent actions. The results also show a decreasing
   utility to disaggregation: performance decreases when too few inspectors
   share among themselves in building consensus. When insufficient
   heterogeneity within supervisors exists, unitary frameworks outperform
   multi-entity frameworks. These findings have implications on the design
   of supervisory frameworks and contribute to research on
   consensus-building, heterogeneous group membership, and computational
   modeling.},

Abstract = {This article discusses the often forgotten contributions of black
   African infantry to the French and British war efforts from Europe to
   Asia during the Second World War. It traces the relationship between
   black African soldiers and their imperial rulers as it evolved over the
   course of two global conflicts from 1914 to 1945. The article points out
   how racist preconceptions about the ``inferior{''} abilities and
   intelligence of Africans paralleled white Americans' prejudices against
   African-Americans and how the British and French attempted to
   systematically omit, diminish, or discredit the achievements of African
   soldiers.},

Abstract = {Just as the financial crisis began to make its impact felt in Russia,
   the Russian Central Bank altered its monetary policy, switching to an
   inflation-fighting strategy that made the interest rate a major
   anti-inflation weapon but also targeted the exchange rate. This brought
   the bank's strategy into line with those of other central banks. This
   new policy, a result of the ``New Monetary Consensus{''} of the late
   1980s, is analyzed in this article in the context of the Russian Central
   Bank's response to the worldwide financial crisis and the need to focus
   on a range of issues including the country's economic development,
   currency stabilization, and banking sector development.},

Abstract = {International organizations (IOs) have been widely criticized as
   ineffective. Yet scholars and practitioners assessing IO performance
   frequently focus on traditional modes of governance such as treaties and
   inter-state dispute-resolution mechanisms. When they observe poor
   performance, moreover, they often prescribe a strengthening of those
   same activities. We call this reliance on traditional state-based
   mechanisms ``International Old Governance{''} (IOG). A better way to
   understand and improve IO performance is to consider the full range of
   ways in which IOs can and do operate-including, increasingly, by
   reaching out to private actors and institutions, collaborating with
   them, and supporting and shaping their activities. Such actions are
   helping to develop an intricate global network of public, private and
   mixed institutions and norms, partially orchestrated by IOs, that we
   call ``Transnational New Governance{''} (TNG). With proper orchestration
   by IOs, TNG can ameliorate both ``state failure{''}-the inadequacies of
   IOG-and ``market failure{''}-the problems that result when the creation
   and evolution of norm-setting institutions is highly decentralized.
   Orchestration thus provides a significant way for IOs to improve their
   regulatory performance. Some IOs already engage actively with private
   actors and institutions-we provide a range of illustrations,
   highlighting the activities of the UN Environment Programme (UNEP). Yet
   there remains a significant ``orchestration deficit{''} that provides
   real opportunities for IOs. We draw on the lessons of existing IO
   activities to suggest additional possibilities for improving IO
   performance.},

Abstract = {Recent debates regarding the effectiveness of regulatory policymaking in
   the European Union (EU) focus on the merits of soft, non-binding forms
   of regulation between public and private actors. The emergence of less
   coercive forms of regulation is analyzed as a response to powerful
   functional pressures emanating from the complexity of regulatory issues,
   as well as the need to secure flexibility and adaptability of regulation
   to distinctive territorial economic, environmental, administrative, and
   social conditions. In this article we empirically assess the above
   normative claims regarding the effectiveness of soft regulation
   vis-a-vis uniformly binding legislation. We draw on an exploratory
   investigation of the application of the Integrated Pollution Prevention
   and Control Directive of the EU in four countries. Our study reveals
   that effectiveness in the application of soft policy instruments is
   largely contingent upon strong cognitive, material, and political
   capacities of both state regulators and industrial actors involved in
   regulatory policymaking. In the absence of those conditions, the
   application of soft, legally non-binding regulation may lead to adverse
   effects, such as non-compliance and the ``hollowing out{''} of the
   systems of environmental permits to industry. In the medium term, such
   developments can undermine the normative authority of the EU.},

Abstract = {The EU is often assessed against the standard of democracy, which it has
   no fair chance to fulfil. A new and attractive normative agenda is
   needed if the EU is to escape its deep legitimacy crisis. This article
   proposes to substitute the discourse on the democratic deficit of the EU
   with a discourse on its contribution to transnational justice. Whilst
   the democratic discourse most often focuses on parliamentary competences
   and divided government, the discourse on justice centres on the people,
   puts primary emphasis on power asymmetries and on overcoming the
   obstacles to justifiable political outcomes. The proposal to analyse the
   EU in terms of justice does not lower the normative standard but
   corrects it.},

Abstract = {Although migration from Mexico to the United States is more than a
   century old, until recently most other countries in Latin America did
   not send out significant numbers of migrants to foreign destinations.
   Over the past thirty years, however, emigration has emerged as an
   important demographic force throughout the region. This article outlines
   trends in the volume and composition of the migrant outflows emanating
   from various countries in Latin America, highlighting their diversity
   with respect to country of destination; multiplicity of destinations;
   legal auspices of entry; gender and class composition; racial, ethnic,
   and national origins; and the mode of insertion into the receiving
   society. The review underscores the broadening of international
   migration away from unidirectional flows toward the United States to new
   streams going to Europe, Canada, Australia, and Japan, as well as to
   other countries in Latin America itself.},

Abstract = {Although Latin American migrants to the United States, particularly
   Mexicans, are typically portrayed as poor and uneducated, some, such as
   Peruvians, are disproportionately well educated compared to those who
   never left their countries. This article examines who emigrates and why
   by comparing migrants' selectivity from Mexico and Peru. Using the
   Peruvian data of the Latin American Migration Project (LAMP), collected
   in five communities in Lima between 2001 and 2005, and comparable data
   for twelve urban communities from the Mexican Migration Project (MMP),
   the authors compare the determinants of out-migration from these two
   countries. The results show that the difference in migrant selectivity
   is not so much attributable to migrants' legal status, urban versus
   rural origins, demographic background, or geographic distance. Rather, a
   crucial difference lies in the nature of migrant networks, or how
   networks develop over time and how migrants utilize networks in
   migrating.},

Abstract = {Since their adoption in the 1970s, compliance with European Union (EU)
   procurement directives has been problematic. Many studies have reported
   on the effectiveness of the directives, mostly in terms of the impact on
   the openness of public procurement and the impact on cross-border trade.
   However, research on the explanation (or the lack) of compliance with EU
   directives is limited. This article identifies the directives which are
   most sensitive to non-compliance. A multidisciplinary model for
   explaining compliance is presented, drawing from criminal theory,
   economics, social psychology and public purchasing. The impact on
   compliance is quantified, using survey data from purchasing
   professionals of the Dutch Ministry of Defence. The results indicate
   that both the expected gains of compliance and the organizational
   pressure have a positive impact on compliance. In contrast, no support
   is found for the effect of certainty and severity of sanctions and the
   perceived resistance of suppliers in case of non-compliance.},

Abstract = {This article traces the progress of the open method of co-ordination in
   research policy, and examines one of its strands, the Mobility Strategy,
   as a `best practice' OMC. Despite the critical analyses it has received
   to date, we argue that the OMC has shown the potential to impact on
   national systems and achieve convergence, albeit not necessarily of a
   quantitative kind. Under the Ljubljana Process, the OMC has been
   confirmed as the central method of governance to further develop the
   European research area and here we put forward several recommendations
   for its future application.},

Abstract = {This article confirms the validity of the hypothesis that national
   interests were the driving force behind the process and outcome of
   negotiations for the EU's next financial perspective for 2007-13. The
   hypothesis is tested by comparing hypothetical coalitions based on
   quantified national interests (partial net budgetary balances) and the
   actual (documented) coalitions. Based on these results, the article also
   discusses implications of the `net balances problem' for the 2008/09 EU
   budget review.},

Title = {A principal-agent analysis of China's sovereign wealth system: Byzantine
   by design},
Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {17},
Number = {3},
Pages = {481-506},
Abstract = {The paper provides an explanation for a puzzling aspect of China's
   nascent sovereign wealth system, namely the ever-more obvious
   competition between China's officially designated sovereign wealth fund
   (SWF), the China Investment Corporation (CIC), and the foreign exchange
   reserve management agency, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange
   (SAFE). We outline an analytical framework which illuminates the various
   pathways by which state leaders seek to address a principal-agent
   problem common to all sovereign wealth funds. We suggest that state
   leaders select corporate governance regimes that mesh with what we call
   the state's `governance endowments'. We then substantiate the claim that
   China's particular governance endowments have led China's leaders to
   embrace a corporate governance model premised on competition among the
   state's sovereign wealth investors. We trace the intense bureaucratic
   conflicts that shaped the creation of CIC and then show how SAFE was
   subsequently drawn into competition with CIC in the area of high risk,
   high yield investment. Although China's SWF tournament emerged as a
   quite unintended consequence of bureaucratic politics, China's
   leadership has since tacitly endorsed this rivalry because it has
   supplied the government with valuable carrot and stick mechanisms with
   which to discipline fund managers.},

Journal = {INTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY},

Volume = {25},
Number = {4},
Pages = {500-520},
Abstract = {This article analyses the gap between government ambitions and actual
   outcomes in the case of European counter terrorism intelligence
   cooperation. Specifically, it investigates why Europol has not managed
   to live up to its tasks despite outspoken government support. Drawing on
   rational choice institutionalism, the study suggests why bureaucrats
   might be motivated to resist calls for international cooperation. By
   examining the process by which Europol has developed as an actor in the
   counter terrorism field, this article shows how development in the field
   of intelligence cooperation is not exclusively the reflection of
   government preferences. It concludes by suggesting that scholars could
   gain greater insight from a less state centric approach to the study of
   intelligence. In addition, the article suggests that policy makers
   cultivate a greater familiarity with bureaucratic factors and that they
   continually work with those factors in mind.},

Journal = {INTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {25},
Number = {4},
Pages = {453-478},
Abstract = {The literature on intelligence little describes or comparatively
   analyzes the intelligence services of insurgent groups. This article
   partially fills the gap by assessing the intelligence activities of FARC
   -the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia. FARC intelligence displays
   similarities to, as well as sharp differences from, the intelligence
   activities of other insurgent groups and established states. Like FARC
   as a whole, FARC intelligence is decentralized. Its strength is its
   focus on tactical military intelligence. Collection on strategic
   political issues, analysis, and counterintelligence are relatively weak.
   FARC's intelligence weaknesses limit its prospects for strategic success
   and its intelligence related vulnerabilities offer the Colombian
   government opportunities to exploit.},

Abstract = {This case study charts the transformation into one of the richest
   democracies in the world of a country devastated by war and in the hands
   of a dictatorship and a powerful foreign patron, the United States.
   Early South Korean governments focused on economic development and
   anticommunism as their survival strategy in a lethal international
   environment at the front lines of the Cold War. They produced
   unprecedented economic growth rates and a thriving middle class, which
   in turn pushed for political democratization, which was realized in
   1987. During the twenty years of democracy since 1987, Korean leaders
   fell to charges of corruption-the old way of doing business-and were
   prosecuted through the court system-the new way of doing business. In
   the process, the role of civil society rapidly grew with the rapid
   expansion of nongovernmental organizations. Despite a decade-long effort
   to defuse tensions with North Korea, since the election of the
   conservative president, Lee Myung-bak, in 2008 tensions have escalated.},

   how. While clan politics and regional grievances may still influence
   struggles over the distribution of power and wealth, their importance
   has diminished in recent years. Instead, observable political conflict
   has centred around competing financial-industrial groups, which
   represent the diverse, and at times clashing, interests of Kazakhstan's

Pages = {889-912},
Abstract = {By centralizing the material foundations of daily life, the burgeoning
   `Everyday IPE' literature has the capacity to make significant advances
   in achieving a more integrated political economy approach. The
   literature's theoretical framework, however, needs to be expanded to be
   able to adequately address the ways that households and reproductive
   relations are impacted by the global economy. Addressing this gap, this
   article attempts to carve out a heuristic space that can more clearly
   establish variations in the social and economic purpose of households
   over time and understand how these shifts have been shaped by, and
   shape, the social relations of capitalism. It then brings this framework
   to bear on the case study of Canadian neoliberal restructuring,
   demonstrating that through labour market and welfare restructuring, and
   the promotion of private and individual social reproduction strategies,
   the neoliberal state's aggressive reordering of people's daily lives
   extends too, into the household and spheres of reproduction.},

Abstract = {This article examines the intersection of race, gender, and American
   political development in the National Association of Colored Women
   (NACW) in the mid-twentieth century. In the late 1940s and 1950s, the
   NACW was one of the last remaining autonomous Black organizations that
   could truly be called ocivic.o Membership was decentralized, active, and
   widespread among female citizens who might not otherwise be engaged in
   public affairs. Political change and subsequent developments in African
   American and women's organizations in the mid-twentiethh century
   encouraged NACW leaders to begin considering new approaches to
   organizing Black womanhood. The collective identity that defined NACW
   clubwomen's public activism as local, nonpolitical, and nonpartisan
   eventually gave way to more deliberately nationalized, partisan, and
   political forms. This article argues that NACW clubwomen worked in
   solidarity and shared common goals with other African American and civil
   rights organizations, but faced a transformation unique to women's
   clubs, one that involved questions not only about who would participate
   in public life, but also about how and through what kinds of
   organizations. The struggles of the NACW to integrate the collective
   identities that defined their race and their gender, on the one hand,
   with forms, and, on the other hand with strategies of organization are
   particularly useful for thinking and theorizing about contemporary forms
   of intersectionality.},
