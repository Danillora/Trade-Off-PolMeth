Abstract = {Regional organizations sometimes intervene to preserve democracy in one
   of their Member States. When a regional organization has developed a
   democratic identity, non-intervention in case of violation of democratic
   principles would damage its credibility domestically and
   internationally. Nonetheless, violations of democratic principles
   sometimes go unsanctioned. Building on case studies of
   (non-)interventions by the EU, Mercosur and SADC, we show that the
   ideational costs of pressure by third parties and the interests of the
   regional leading powers can explain the enforcement of democracy by
   regional organizations. Third party pressure remains ineffective,
   however, when there is a clash between regional identities.},

Journal = {ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {628},

Abstract = {There are several contexts in which randomization in research design is
   not possible. Researchers may be interested in the effects of
   large-scale events or policy initiatives, or of complex causal processes
   that cannot be replicated. Threats to external validity in randomized
   experiments will lead to greater dividends for some research questions
   in a quasi-experimental design. Quasi-experiments can offer
   opportunities for testing causal theories, if they are carefully
   constructed to counter threats to internal validity. Furthermore,
   randomization is not a simple guarantee against threats to internal
   validity where few units of observation are used. An appreciation of the
   intersection of these approaches-between stronger quasi-experiments and
   weaker randomized experiments-can help guide our choice of experimental
   method. One can make the same argument about the benefits of pursuing
   good opportunities with quasi-experiments over scant opportunities with
   randomized experiments as is made more often in reverse.},

   Roles, Responsibilities, and Influence of UN Human Rights Officers},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS PRACTICE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {2},
Number = {1},
Pages = {28-48},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The increasing presence of UN human rights staff across the globe, the
   detailed information that they collect, and the expanding number of
   human rights venues that their information is being fed into is rapidly
   changing the profession and perceptions of UN Human Rights Officers. One
   outcome of these changes is that Human Rights Officers, who report to
   the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, are gaining greater potential
   for influencing how governments and non-governmental organizations
   respond to human rights abuses. Yet, at the same time, Human Rights
   Officers are not provided with a pre-deployment training program that
   prepares them for what they are about to experience when they start
   working in some of the most dangerous areas of the world. This article
   explains not only why predeployment monitoring training should be put in
   place as soon as possible, but it sketches out a training program that
   corresponds to the changing roles, responsibilities, and influence of
   Human Rights Officers and the implications that these changes have on
   their work. More specifically, this article proposes that training
   should focus on providing simulated real-life scenarios that aim to
   professionalize and, in some instances, standardize monitoring and
   advocacy methodologies and techniques.},

Journal = {POLITICS \& SOCIETY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {38},
Number = {1},
Pages = {119-148},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The French and German political economies have been significantly
   reconfigured over the past two decades. Although the changes have often
   been more piecemeal than revolutionary, their cumulative effects are
   profound. The authors characterize the changes that have taken place as
   involving the institutionalization of new forms of dualism and argue
   that what gives contemporary developments a different character from the
   past is that dualism is now explicitly underwritten by state policy.
   They see this outcome as the culmination of a sequence of developments,
   beginning in the field of industrial relations, moving into labor market
   dynamics, and finally finding institutional expression in welfare state
   reforms. Contrary to theoretical accounts that suggest that
   institutional complementarities support stability and institutional
   reproduction, the authors argue that the linkages across these realms
   have helped to translate employer strategies that originated in the
   realm of industrial relations into a stable, new, and less egalitarian
   model with state support.},

Abstract = {This article examines the paths and powers of women who have occupied
   presidential positions around the world from 1974 through 2008. While
   women have had less success in obtaining presidential posts compared to
   prime ministerial offices, there have been recent notable gains.
   Developing a typology of presidential positions, I find that
   presidential positions are still overwhelmingly dominated by men.
   Moreover, men tend to hold greater powers in their presidential posts
   than women. Strong women presidents are still exceedingly rare,
   particularly those elected by popular vote and absent familial ties to
   male leaders. Overall, the comparative presidency continues to be a male
   domain.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the construction of what the authors term a
   `tripartite standards regime' (TSR) by looking at the pragmatic
   emergence of standards development organizations (SDOs) and national
   accreditation bodies (NABs). The authors explain how, through their
   network of audit, the TSR is entangling intermediaries and processes
   into specific supply chains. Moreover, they argue that the emphasis
   placed on the role of `metrology' is overstated in the literature.
   Rather, the concept of `standards' better captures the more complex,
   underlying processes involved in the construction of the TSR. They
   present evidence gathered through a review of data collected from SDOs'
   and NABs' websites, official documents, international trade agreements,
   and the directories published by the National Institute of Standards and
   Technology and the International Organization for Standardization. They
   argue that the TSR acts as a techno-economic network that is global in
   reach and serves a key coordinating role in facilitating international
   trade. As such they see the TSR as fundamental to the movement towards
   `governing at a distance' that is part and parcel of the neoliberal
   shift from government to governance.},

Abstract = {Utilising a new documentary source, namely correspondence between A. K.
   Chesterton (1899-1973), one of the most important figures of the
   post-war far right in Britain, and H. J. van den Bergh (1914-1997), the
   head of the South African Bureau of State Security (BOSS), this article
   presents a case study that leads to an enhanced understanding of the
   nature and workings of the overseas activities of the South African
   security apparatus during the 1960s, its allies and its targets. The
   article examines and evaluates the evidence presented in this
   correspondence regarding the covert operations of the South African
   secret services against anti-apartheid activists and other exiled
   `subversives' based in Britain. It will demonstrate how the South
   African apartheid regime operated through an ideologically aligned far
   right proxy to physically disrupt anti-apartheid meetings and to monitor
   exiled dissidents, their activities and potential sources of finance, as
   well as exploring how Chesterton helped to refine van den Bergh's
   personal intellectual framework and his definition of the who and what
   stood behind `sabotage' and `subversion' in South Africa.},

Abstract = {This case study of the Japanese colonization of Manchuria in the first
   half of the twentieth century shows enormous economic achievements at
   the cost of enduring Chinese hostility over the brutal methods employed.
   Japan failed to create a sense of nationhood among Manchuria's diverse
   population of Han Chinese, Manchus, Mongols, Koreans, and Japanese. In
   an attempt to leverage cultural differences, Japan created segregated
   worlds that could not coalesce into a nation. Although it established an
   elaborate system of state institutions, the fiction of Manchu imperial
   rule and the reality of Kwantung Army dominance meant that the state
   institutions disappeared along with the Japanese Army upon its defeat in
   World War II. However, Japan did create an enduring transportation and
   communication infrastructure as well as a comprehensive heavy industrial
   base of mining, metallurgy, and machine tools that transformed Manchuria
   into the most industrialized part of Asia outside the Japanese home
   islands.(1)},

Pages = {293-327},
Abstract = {This article analyses the emergence of United Russia (Edinaya Rossiya)
   as a dominant party by examining the behaviour of Russia's governors.
   Using original data on when governors joined United Russia, the article
   demonstrates that those governors with access to autonomous political
   resources were more reluctant to join the dominant party. By showing
   that Russian elite members made their affiliation decisions on the basis
   of calculations about their own political resources rather than simply
   being coerced by the Kremlin, this article provides evidence for a
   theory of dominant party formation that casts the problem as a two-sided
   commitment problem between leaders and elites.},

Abstract = {Offshore finance provides an incubator and testing ground for
   propositions concerning fundamental debates in international political
   economy. The common feature among offshore financial products is
   calculated ambiguity: the ability to give diametrically opposed but
   legally valid answers to the same question from different quarters. Thus
   offshore allows individuals and firms to enjoy simultaneous ownership
   and non-ownership, to be high profit and loss-making, heavily indebted
   but also debt-free, and for investment to be foreign and domestic. The
   advantages conferred to individuals and firms, however, tend to
   undermine the stability of the financial system. Using indirect
   governance techniques, transnational networks of regulators have sought
   to coercively simplify offshore finance, with mixed results. Focusing on
   ambiguity as central to offshore finance complements earlier theoretical
   treatments of this realm from law, anthropology and international
   relations. Empirically, the recently enhanced surveillance of offshore
   centers has produced new data facilitating future quantitative studies,
   which complement more anthropological approaches to this subject.},

Abstract = {This article identifies the limitations of classical, sociopolitical,
   and interactive analytical axes for explaining the crisis of paradigms
   and the content of Brazilian foreign policy and to propose alternative
   perspectives to overcome these limitations. A constructivist axis is
   used to examine the co-constitution of agent and structure and to
   identify the possibilities of change. A poststructuralist axis is used
   to show that Brazilian ``Foreign Policy{''} reproduces practices of
   differentiation and is connected to the containment of challenges to
   identity. A postcolonial axis is used to show that Brazilian foreign
   policy can provide answers to the challenges of interaction with
   diversity through self-reflection and culturally diverse criticism to
   inequality.},

Title = {The Social Construction of Globality},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SOCIOLOGY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {4},
Number = {3},
Pages = {219-235},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Today the concept of globality is widely used to describe a condition
   characterized by the presence a single sociopolitical space on a
   planetary scale. Yet international relations theory has been either
   unwilling or unable to understand the global realm in sui generis terms.
   This paper argues that if we want to make coherent sense of the global
   realm and its relationship to the international system, we must account
   for how globality has been constructed as a social fact. The paper then
   tries to provide some of the foundations of such an account by analyzing
   how a distinctively global space was forged out of changing cosmological
   beliefs about the makeup of the terrestrial surface during the
   Renaissance, and how these new beliefs in turned conditioned the
   possibility of modern practices of territorial demarcation and national
   identity construction. If valid, this interpretation implies that the
   order of analytical priority between the international system of states
   and the global realm ought to be reversed, and hence also that a sui
   generis account of globality must be built on the recognition that the
   world was global well before it became international in any recognizably
   modern sense of this latter term.},

Abstract = {This article compares the transition into legal permanent residence
   (LPR) of Mexicans, Dominicans, and Nicaraguans. Dominicans had the
   highest likelihood of obtaining such residence, mostly sponsored by
   parents and spouses. Mexicans had the lowest LPR transition rates and
   presented sharp gender differentials in modes: women were found to be
   mostly legalized through husbands, while men were sponsored by their
   parents or through provisions of the Immigration Reform and Control Act
   (IRCA). Nicaraguans stood in between, presenting few gender differences
   in rates and modes of transition and a heavy dependence on asylum and
   special provisions in immigration legislation. These patterns are found
   to stem from the interplay of conditions favoring the emigration of, and
   the specific immigration policy context faced by, migrant pioneers; the
   influence of social networks in reproducing the legal character of
   flows; and differences in the actual use of kinship ties as sponsors.
   The implications of these trends on the observed gendered patterns of
   migration from Latin America are discussed.},

Volume = {48},

Abstract = {Analysis of the Commission's role in policy implementation has focused
   largely on the administrative rather than political level. Yet little
   attention has been paid to the importance of high-level Commission
   actors, such as Commissioners and Director-Generals at this stage. This
   article analyses the role of a working group (WG) of Commissioners in
   monitoring and co-ordinating the implementation of trans-European
   networks (TENs) in transport. It argues that formally institutionalized
   structures for intra-College co-operation provide important arenas for
   creativity, entrepreneurship and consensus-building. Ultimately, the
   consistent and sustained political involvement of Commissioners improves
   the Commission's administrative co-ordination and may, ultimately, help
   secure better policy implementation.},

   about Making Referrals},
Journal = {ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {629},
Pages = {30-52},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The author draws from in-depth interviews with thirty-nine black and
   Latino custodial and food service workers at the University of
   California, Berkeley, to determine how workers make decisions about
   making job referrals. Interviews were revelatory. Drawing from widely
   available and institutionalized scripts about what makes a good worker,
   jobholders assessed jobseekers' orientation toward work as well as what
   effect this orientation might have on their own reputations on the job
   to determine whom to help and how much to do so. Because of ethno-racial
   differences in how unemployment was interpreted, Latinos were more
   likely than their black counterparts to help and to do so proactively
   These findings suggest that theories of social capital mobilization must
   take into consideration individuals' access to and deployment of
   cultural resources to fully understand the circumstances under which
   actors are mobilized for instrumental action.},

Abstract = {This article reflects on the recent Chilean experience of accountability
   actions, particularly the attempted prosecution of perpetrators of past
   human rights violations. While acknowledging the undoubtedly substantial
   impulse provided by the dramatic October 1998 UK arrest of former
   dictator Augusto Pinochet, it focuses on domestic actors and drivers in
   a post-1998 revival of such attempts. The article examines the extent
   and limitations of recent change in the area of prosecutions in Chile,
   noting that these have been undertaken at the insistence of private
   actors rather than the state. It also notes that the self-amnesty law of
   1978 is still textually intact despite advances in restricting its
   application with regards to certain categories of internationally
   proscribed crimes. Finally, the article examines some explanatory
   factors for both recent advances and remaining blockages in the Chilean
   human rights accountability scenario.},

   Emissions Trading?},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {15},
Number = {2},
Pages = {197-224},
Abstract = {This article explores whether emissions trading is morally defensible To
   do so it examines three different kinds of moral consideration Which
   might be used to judge emissions trading. The first kind makes what I
   term an `ethical' objection, and holds that utilising market instruments
   to combat climate change is inherently objectionable. I examine three
   versions if this `ethical' argument but find none persuasive. The
   remainder of the article considers two additional moral considerations,
   both of which appeal to principles of justice. Drawing on these it
   argues that emissions trading can be morally defensible but only it it
   meets these two demanding moral criteria. First, the costs of emissions
   trading should be shared equitably. The paper examines what this might
   mean and criticises the leading account of what constitutes a just
   distribution of emissions Second, emissions trading must make an
   appropriate contribution to climate mitigation. A number of ways in
   which current emissions trading schemes signally fail to meet this
   second criterion are then noted. The article concludes that emissions
   trading schemes could in principle be morally defensible but only if new
   schemes are introduced or existing schemes are radically redesigned in
   line with the principles outlined in the article.},

Abstract = {This article examines the cultural legacy of Galicia, a region
   comprising parts of Poland and Ukraine, once united under the
   Austro-Hungarian Empire. Using survey data compiled by the Comparative
   Study of Electoral Systems, we reconstruct the region of Galicia
   electoral district by electoral district, finding that Galicians today
   are far more civic than their compatriots. Sharing higher levels of
   political efficacy, Galicians are more likely to vote, and when they do,
   they are more likely to support parties who oppose the successor left.
   The vehicle for this cultural persistence, we argue, could be the
   (Greek) Catholic Church, which Galicians attend at far higher rates than
   the rest of Ukraine or Poland.},

   politicians, and businesspeople often do support the same (neoliberal)
   agreements and policies, the worldviews motivating and embodied in their
   endorsements are consistently different. Economists' formalized
   neoclassical theory fully endorses international market liberalism,
   primarily on the basis of expected benefits for consumers, and
   substantially de-emphasizes conflicts of interest across nations.
   Businesspeople's and politicians' more informal and practical support
   for `free trade' agreements primarily values them for their benefits to
   producers, and frequently evokes visions of win-lose competition among
   nations. Empirically, I defend these arguments using qualitative data
   from a comparative-historical study of the formation of the 1989
   Canada-US Free Trade Agreement and the 1994 North American Free Trade
   Agreement.},

Journal = {POST-SOVIET AFFAIRS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {26},
Number = {1},
Pages = {58-76},
Month = {JAN-MAR},
Abstract = {How do minority-majority districts affect the voter behavior of
   minorities and election of minority candidates in Ukraine? Studies on
   minority-majority districts in the American politics literature suggest
   that such districts are instrumental to election of minority candidates.
   Very few scholars have extended such research to other countries. This
   article examines the impact of minority-majority districts on electoral
   outcomes in Ukraine, in which ethnicity is apparently a salient issue
   but ethnic identity is complicated by multiple cleavages based on
   ethnicity, language, and region. Using district-level census and
   electoral data, the relationship between the ethnic composition of an
   electoral district and election of minority candidates is examined.},

Title = {Towards a New Theory of Intelligence Failure? The Impact of Cognitive
   Closure and Discourse Failure},
Journal = {INTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {25},
Number = {2},
Pages = {147-182},
Abstract = {Oscar Wilde captures the deep challenges relating to intelligence when
   he states that, `it is the spectator, and not life, that art really
   mirrors'. This statement elucidates the negative force of cognitive
   closure on intelligence, as well as bringing attention to the importance
   of an understanding of the human factor in intelligence production, and
   its relationship to discourse failure. Intelligence literature after
   9/11 has focused on the causes and nature of intelligence failure,
   though few inquests have conceived intelligence as a deeply cognitive,
   and therefore mental and moral landscape that needs to be explored in
   all its complexity. Intelligence operators, like art spectators,
   perceive reality filtered through all sorts of implicit and explicit
   ideological prisms, and these ideologies, whether they are political
   assumptions or social orthodoxies, manifest themselves as cognitive
   closure, and shape the discourse in intelligence organizations, as well
   as between these organizations and society at large. This paper
   consequently argues that discourse failure is increased because of a
   flaw in the epistemic process among intelligence operators and
   consumers.},

Pages = {327-349},
Abstract = {Al Qaida and its jihadist allies shape their plans and operations
   substantially in response to threats they face from authoritarian
   intelligence services of the Middle East. While most jihadists initially
   believed that victory over their `near enemies' so-called `apostate'
   regimes should be their top priority, the ruthlessly effective security
   apparatuses of their home countries were significant factors in the
   transition to `global jihadism', which emphasized the fight against the
   `far enemy': the United States. This article presents al Qaida's views
   of the region's domestic intelligence services by examining captured
   documents and open source materials.},

Title = {The crisis of social reproduction in rural Mexico: Challenging the
   `re-privatization of social reproduction' thesis},
Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {17},
Number = {5},
Pages = {913-945},
Abstract = {Warning of a global crisis of social reproduction, feminist IPE has come
   a long way to demonstrate how the restructuring of the global political
   economy increases obstacles to exercise social reproduction activities
   and thereby endangers social reproduction tout court. While feminist IPE
   explicitly points to the need for empirical studies of the ways in which
   this global crisis of social reproduction manifests itself in specific
   contexts, much of the literature remains rather theoretical and at the
   macro level. This article addresses this gap with a case study of the
   crisis of social reproduction in rural Mexico, focusing on the
   transformations of the conditions of social reproduction, gender regimes
   and the roles of children. The findings of this case study challenge the
   universal applicability of the `(re-)privatization of social
   reproduction' thesis. The main argument is that instead of emphasizing
   the shifts between the public and the private sphere and the retreat of
   the state from social provisioning, it is essential to reorient our
   focus towards the changing and context-specific forms of state
   involvement, and their implications for the transformation of social
   reproduction conditions, if we are to gain a better understanding of the
   variety of ways in which the global crisis of social reproduction
   manifests itself in different locations.},

Abstract = {The impact of the introduction of EU Single Area Payments (SAPs) on farm
   expansion strategy in Lithuania is investigated, utilising farm
   accounting and survey data. The introduction of the SAP has a positive
   influence on farmers' intentions to expand their area compared to a
   baseline scenario of the hypothetical continuation of pre-accession
   policy. The switch in policy has a more pronounced effect on farms that
   were previously credit constrained. While the SAP has been presented as
   a support that is decoupled from production, its introduction may have
   ex post coupled effects, through an income multiplier effect on credit
   constrained farmers.},

Abstract = {Alexander Lyon Macfie emphasizes an unexpectedly favorable international
   and domestic environment (not much recognized at the time), in
   combination with extraordinary leadership, to explain the success of
   Ataturk in creating the modern Turkish state. Internationally, the loss
   of the Christian and Arab parts of the Ottoman Empire during the Balkan
   and First World Wars left a cohesive Turkish ``national{''} core in
   Anatolia, while revolution and civil war in Russia put Turkey's
   principal enemy out of action during the early stages of the struggle.
   Domestically, the survival of Turkish units of the Ottoman army left an
   institution capable of imposing order, while the survival of elements of
   the Committee of Union and Progress, the party that ruled over the
   Ottoman Empire both before and during World War I, left an organization
   capable of providing an institutional framework for the development of
   civil institutions. In addition, mainly Turkish Ottoman scholars had
   written extensively on the possibility of using Turkish national
   identity as the basis for a future state. Mustafa Kemal (Ataturk) then
   astutely used the power afforded by his position as a military officer
   in Anatolia to unite rival political movements in a Turkish national
   movement capable of laying the foundations of a new secular (nation)
   state.},

Abstract = {Trade between nations is very crucial in the process of economic and
   technological growth. Directly or indirectly, trade facilitates the
   process of technology innovation, transfer and diffusion. It offers the
   trajectory to evaluate and understand how technology penetrates
   economies and remains a good indicator to measure national progress on
   technology creation and assimilation. The growth link between
   international trade and economic development could be traced to the
   classical trade theory of Adam Smith, and David Ricardo and the modern
   neoclassical trade model of Heckscher-Ohlin (H-O). While there is no
   single model that captures the route to economic development, this
   chapter explores how African countries working closely can harness and
   utilize technological advancements to improve their share of global
   trade so as to accelerate their overall economic growth and development.},

Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {17},
Number = {2},
Pages = {178-208},
Abstract = {The proliferation of regional economic agreements involving East Asian
   economies in the years since the financial crises is usually explained
   in the political economy literature by reference to economic factors.
   These agreements have been viewed either as a response to the costs of
   increasing interdependence and/or to the demand by domestic exporters to
   level the playing field when their rivals benefit from preferential
   trade agreements. A detailed examination of economic data finds no
   support, however, for the argument that intra-regional economic
   interdependence in East Asia has increased significantly since the
   financial crises. Case studies suggest that business has not played a
   major role in either promoting or opposing the agreements - not
   surprisingly in that the agreements are unlikely to have a major
   economic impact, and are not being widely used. Rather than there being
   an `economic domino' effect at work, the new East Asian regionalism is
   best understood as being driven by a `political domino' effect.},

Abstract = {In less than two decades, Russians have come to support their regime,
   but the 2008 world economic crisis questions whether this support can
   continue. Drawing on a June 2009 New Russia Barometer survey, the
   article asks how much difference the economic crisis has made for
   political support. A model with hypotheses about the potential influence
   on political attitudes of socialization and political performance as
   well as economic conditions is set out. Statistical analysis is used to
   compare the importance of macro-economic evaluations of the national
   economy with micro-economic household conditions. Determinants of regime
   support in 2009 are compared with pre-crisis NRB surveys.},

Abstract = {A very important yet little known front in the Russian Civil War existed
   in neighbouring Xinjiang, a region in China's northwest, that was at
   that time self-governing. In Xinjiang, Russian White Commanders and
   their troops gained sanctuary, financial assistance, food and shelter
   from Chinese provincial leaders, and then used those sanctuaries to
   launch operations against Soviet forces. However, by 1921, Red Army
   troops destroyed any remaining organised White forces, which then melted
   into the Chinese landscape. The ramifications of the Russian Civil War
   in Xinjiang had important impacts on the people of Xinjiang, and on
   Russia and China as well.},

Year = {2010},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Pages = {109-125},
Abstract = {Rather than in terms of the inevitable demise of a destabilising process
   of speculation, this article explores the `credit crunch' as a window on
   the fabrication, and measure of the proportions of a political shift
   driven by market actors and financial innovation. The Basel process
   reconceptualised banks as risk navigators and generated a competitive
   hierarchy within the global banking industry determined on a gauge of
   this capacity. This private regulatory regime promoted market inflation
   and rendered institutional liquidity and risk transfer definitive of
   market power. In turn, a ballooning credit derivatives market broke the
   limits of financial production and defined state actions in the face of
   crisis. A shift from a central concern with solvency to that of
   liquidity thinly masks a profound redistribution of power from the
   public to the private. By swapping private assets of uncertain value for
   government bonds, central banks have effectively recognised that the
   products of innovation in the private sphere are global money. The state
   is in a curious bind. It takes on limitless exposure to private
   liabilities while its reform agenda is constrained to calling for
   greater levels of transparency and tackling the worst excesses. Promises
   of substantive reform remain only that, reflecting dissonance between
   reality and an entrenched faith in a progressive innovation spiral.},

Abstract = {This paper systematically surveys the dominant processes and key issues
   of China's governance reforms over the 30 years since the reform and
   opening period began. It summarizes the major achievements and the
   ongoing problems of this 30 year long process. The paper offers a brief
   analysis of the underlying reasons for these reforms and the main
   characteristics of China's governance model. After enumerating an array
   of factual evidence, it claims that the main thrust of China's
   governance reforms is from unitary governance to pluralist governance,
   from centralization to decentralization, from rule of man to rule of
   law, from regulatory government to service oriented government, and from
   internal party democracy to people's democracy.},

Abstract = {The collapse of the Soviet Union was an exceptional experiment in the
   economic history of the world, which made the post-socialist countries
   the subject of various economic studies. Different researchers and
   organizations tend to monitor the progress of economic and institutional
   reforms through inventing different indexes (indicators), apparently
   trying to understand how to detect the end of the transition process.
   The European Union, opening its door to accession candidates and
   starting negotiations with a number of eastern European and Baltic
   states, was the first to rely on those assessments of progress in
   reforms for making decisions on the readiness of the countries in terms
   of economic and institutional development to become a member of the
   European family. This study tries to link the actual assessments of
   reforms (start of negotiations) and the available set of indicators to
   construct an empirical model. We apply statistical techniques of limited
   dependent variable models to reveal the most important criteria followed
   by the `EU admission committee' and capture them in limited dependent
   variable models, which are applied to evaluate the readiness of a number
   of other post-socialist countries to start hypothetical negotiations
   with the EU. Based on available empirical results the factors captured
   in the model include the share of public expenditure in GDP, GDP per
   capita, private sector share of GDP, share of trade with EU in external
   turnover, democratization and inflation (macroeconomic stability). Our
   empirical assessments show that there are several transition economies
   (Albania, Armenia and Georgia), which despite not having candidate
   status, offer better general standing in terms of `accession criteria'
   than the current candidates. This fact may suggest to policy-makers
   (other geopolitical conditions being equal) to consider these countries
   for future EU enlargement waves.},

Abstract = {A complex web of racialist and nonracialist structural forces, along
   with cultural forces, have adversely impacted life in inner-city black
   neighborhoods. Yet a number of studies have raised questions about the
   real effects of living in such neighborhoods, including the widely cited
   studies on the Moving to Opportunity experiment. The author highlights
   studies that provide compelling evidence for considering the cumulative
   effects of residing in poor segregated neighborhoods. While some of
   these are structural, others are cultural, such as the effects of
   prolonged exposure to cultural traits that originate from or are the
   products of racial exclusion. Advancing the argument that structural
   conditions provide the context within which cultural responses to
   chronic economic and racial subordination are developed, the author
   suggests a holistic public policy perspective whereby the complex web of
   structural and cultural factors that create and reinforce racial
   inequality is recognized and appreciated. To illustrate this
   perspective, he highlights the Harlem Children's Zone, which President
   Obama has identified as a model for the creation of a national program
   of ``promised neighborhoods{''} to address chronic racial and economic
   subordination.},

Abstract = {Given increases in hostility and violence targeting Russia's migrant
   minorities since the late 1990s, local and international scholars, human
   rights groups, and others have focused predominantly on relationships
   between the ethnic Russian majority and the non-Russian ethnic
   minorities. The emergent xenophobic activism among ethnic minorities, or
   inter-minority xenophobia, has received much less attention. Mass survey
   data from the Russian Federation is used in a systematic comparison of
   attitudes toward migration among ethnic Russians vs. ethnic
   non-Russians. Attitudes are also compared across select ethnic
   non-Russian groups to address this growing, if counter-intuitive,
   problem in Russia's ethnic relations arising from migrations.},

Abstract = {A report published by the Consultative Group on the Past (Consultative
   Group) in January 2009 recommended that a `Legacy Commission' be
   established for Northern Ireland that would fulfil a reconciliation,
   truth-recovery and justice mandate. The work of the Consultative Group
   highlights how international justice norms are interpreted at a local
   level in a way that takes account of local histories and priorities.
   This article critically examines the proposed Legacy Commission and
   finds that the framework outlined by the Consultative Group does not
   sufficiently challenge discourses of violence that hinder the bedding
   down of positive peace in Northern Ireland. Universal human rights and
   justice concepts remain peripheral to this framework, which avoids the
   type of profound conflict analysis that might advance societal stability
   and harmony. Instead of challenging the structural and institutional
   inequalities that underpinned the violence of the conflict in Northern
   Ireland and opening up new pathways to accessing truth and justice, the
   Consultative Group's report advocates a truth-recovery process that is
   not open to public scrutiny and is couched in the language of
   forgetting, which begs the question whether this is a genuine attempt to
   explore sidelined or dissenting narratives of conflict, or merely
   another forum in which to contain them.},

Abstract = {In this article we provide a conceptual and argumentative framework for
   studying how institutional design can enhance civic participation and
   ultimately increase citizens' sense of democratic ownership of
   governmental processes. First, we set out the socio-political context
   for enhancing the democratic governance of regulatory policies in
   Europe, and highlight the way in which civic participation and
   democratic ownership is given equal weight to economic competitiveness.
   We then discuss the potential for institutionalized participatory
   governance to develop and its prospects for improving effective and
   democratic governance in the multi-layered European polity. We conclude
   by outlining a research agenda for the field and identifying the
   priorities for scholars working interactively with civil society and

Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Pages = {27-52},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {On June 15, 2007, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) adopted the
   ``2007 Decision on Bilateral Surveillance over Members' Policies,{''} a
   landmark reform that modernizes the general principles of the IMF's
   bilateral surveillance. This paper assesses the first year of the
   Decision's implementation in Article IV reports. We develop a
   questionnaire based on the key aspects of the Decision, which is used to
   evaluate Article IV reports published before and after the adoption of
   the new Decision for twenty-four countries. We find that the Decision
   has significantly increased the overall quality of Article IV reports,
   with improvements noted in emerging-market, advanced, and developing
   countries. Bilateral surveillance is more focused on external stability
   and core macroeconomic policies. Exchange rate analysis, in particular,
   has improved significantly. We note, however, that the integration with
   multilateral surveillance remains relatively weak and that cross-country
   spillovers still do not receive sufficient attention. Moreover, while
   most reports examine domestic stability in some detail, the link between
   domestic stability and external stability is not adequately analyzed. On
   the issue of the even-handed application of the Decision, we conclude
   that implementation has been broadly similar across country income
   groups, although differences remain for specific aspects of the
   Decision.},

Title = {France in Algeria: The Heritage of Violence},
Booktitle = {NATION BUILDING, STATE BUILDING, AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT: CASE STUDIES
   AND COMPARISONS},
Year = {2010},
Pages = {30-47},
Abstract = {This case study examines the French legacy of economic centralization,
   army dominance, and political violence in Algeria. Just as nineteenth-
   and twentieth-century France experienced political and economic
   instability involving difficult transitions from one regime to another,
   so has postindependence Algeria. The development of the oil industry has
   reinforced this trend. France faced stiff opposition to its rule, which
   it imposed through its army. Postindependence leaders have all had
   military backgrounds or close ties to the army. Given the tightly
   controlled elections and the deepening ethnic divisions between
   Algeria's Arab and Berber-Tamazight citizens, political legitimacy
   remains tied to the thinning ranks of those who fought during the bitter
   war for independence. Successions are destabilizing and often violent.
   Because Algeria was an integral part of France during the colonial
   period and was administered through institutions in Paris, France left
   only a faint institutional imprint, although there was a strong

Title = {The perils of consensus: How ASEAN's meta-regime undermines economic and
   environmental cooperation},
Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},

Pages = {262-290},
Abstract = {The member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
   have been frequently criticized for adhering to a long-standing norm of
   strict non-interference in each other's domestic affairs, thereby
   hampering collective efforts to address regional problems. This article
   presents an analytical model of international institutions that shows
   how underlying norms and principles - the meta-regime - govern the rules
   and procedures of specific international regimes. It then applies this
   model to ASEAN's trade and anti-haze regimes, demonstrating how ASEAN's
   underlying meta-regime has frustrated attempts to liberalize trade and
   reduce air pollution. While ASEAN's purview has extended well beyond its
   original security mandate and it has developed new rules and procedures
   to handle the new issues, its underlying norms and principles
   consistently limit its ability to handle regional problems. In the
   conclusion, we discuss how the ASEAN states might be able to foment
   cooperation in these issue areas without completely abandoning its
   foundational norms and principles.},

Pages = {609-638},
Abstract = {As dramatically evidenced by the global financial crisis, the
   interaction of domestic regulatory systems has significant international
   consequences. Nevertheless, these relationships have received only
   limited attention from international relations scholars. This special
   issue, therefore, provides a detailed examination of international
   market regulation - the processes through which the domestic regulatory
   activities of states and other actors set the effective rules of
   internationally-exposed markets. To this end, we borrow and extend on
   arguments developed by historical institutionalists in comparative
   politics and American political development. In particular, the
   contributions adapt two mechanisms - policy feedbacks and relative
   sequencing - to explain state and bureaucratic preferences over
   international market regulation as well as bargaining strength in
   relevant negotiations. In addition to contributing to central IPE
   debates about international economic governance, the individual
   contributions shed light on a number of important empirical domains such
   as corporate accounting, intellectual property, pharmaceuticals, hedge
   funds, and financial market standardization.},

Abstract = {Critics of US intelligence focus extensively on the alleged inability
   and unwillingness of intelligence agencies to learn and adapt. Analysis
   of eight counterinsurgency wars suggests instead that external factors
   largely influence the intelligence-related performance of whole
   governments, including organizational structures, unity of effort and
   command, adequacy of resources, and leadership quality. Assessment of
   the performance of US intelligence since 9/11 indicates that the same
   variables influence the performance of US intelligence, suggesting that
   the US intelligence reform debate focuses too narrowly and on the wrong
   factors.},

Abstract = {Gender equality is an important aspect of the foundational myths of the
   European Union (EU). However, despite a number of equality policies, the
   gender myth has been largely unsuccessful in creating a sense of loyalty
   among European women. This article draws on two cases studies, parental
   leave policy and liberalization of the airline industry, to investigate
   why the myth of gender equality has not resonated with European women.
   The first case demonstrates that, if the European gender narrative runs
   up against contending national myths, the EU narrative may be
   undermined. The second case shows that if EU gender initiatives are
   forced to compete with dominant narratives in the economic sphere, they
   are quickly undermined. In other words, the EU gender myth, though well
   grounded in legislative reality, is too weak to create the gender equal
   polity that it envisions.},

Journal = {EUROPE-ASIA STUDIES},

Volume = {62},
Number = {1},
Pages = {145-171},
Abstract = {This article examines the transfer of the OECD corporate governance code
   to Hungary. It documents the process of code transmission, and assesses
   its impact through an examination of corporate governance in the three
   largest Hungarian private companiesMagyar Telekom, MOL and OTP. The
   article illustrates the disjuncture between formal commitment to code
   adoption and its effective implementation, with a case study of the
   abortive takeover bid by OMV for MOL in 2007-2008. The reasons for the
   disjuncture are related to national and corporate contextual conditions,
   management incentives and the channels of transmission.},

Abstract = {Controversy over alleged CIA responsibility for the 1961 assassination
   of Congolese leader Patrice Lumumba continues to swirl despite a
   negative finding by the US Senate Church Committee in 1975. A new
   analysis of declassified and other Church Committee, CIA and State
   Department documents, memoirs of US and Belgian covert operators, and
   author interviews with former executive branch and Church Committee
   officials shows that the CIA Congo Station Chief was an influential
   participant in the Congo Government's decision to `render' Lumumba to
   his bitter enemies. Moreover evidence strongly suggests the Station
   Chief withheld his advance knowledge of Lumumba's fatal transfer from
   Washington policymakers, who might have blocked it. Flaws in the Church
   Committee's verdict are traced to CIA delays in providing key cables,
   staff overreliance on lawyers' methodology, and political pressure to
   water down original draft conclusions. What happened in Lumumba's case
   provides insight into the contemporary problem of establishing
   accountability in US anti-terrorist programs. Current rendition policies
   are also characterized by ambiguous performance standards for covert
   operators on the ground and difficulty in pinpointing US responsibility
   within the intimate relationship between the CIA and foreign government
   clients. The Church Committee's experience clarifies the conditions for
   meaningful outside regulation of anti-terrorism operations today.},

Abstract = {What is the content of Europeanization? Which causal relationships
   should be explained? Which theory should be used? In answering these
   questions, the article forwards a conceptualization of Europeanization
   based on Historical Sociology and Social Constructivism, which implies a
   departure from the practice in the current Europeanization literature to
   concentrate on the contemporary with a narrow focus (EU-ization) at the
   expense of the historical with a broad focus (Europeanization). It is
   suggested that the causal relationships to be explained are the transfer
   of European ideas across time and space using a `present-as-reality'
   definition of the European idea set. In doing so, it becomes apparent
   that Europeanization cannot be accepted as either static or something
   that is solely connected to the EU, and that Europeanization has been
   characterized by diffusion patterns going both into and out of Europe
   and sociological processes involving subtle shifts in process,
   structure, agents and conceptions of `Other' and `Significant We'.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to contribute to the debate about the role and
   autonomy of European agencies, and it is argued that in order to capture
   a fuller picture of their functioning, we need to go beyond a legal
   framework, taking into account institutional features that involve both
   formal and informal processes. We also need to follow processes over
   time in order to avoid snapshot images and to be able to identify
   dynamics of institutionalization and change. The article examines the
   evolution of the European Environment Agency (EEA) from its inception in
   1991, and analyses its gradual transformation from a legal to a living
   institution in the EU system. Over the years the agency has become a
   more loyal partner to the Commission in the European administrative
   system, balancing the ability to have a credible voice on the one hand
   and the need for stability and a secure resource supply on the other.},

Abstract = {This article draws on data from the Mexican Migration Project and the
   Latin American Migration Project to study patterns of occupational
   mobility among male migrant household heads who have returned from the
   United States to Mexico, Costa Rica, Guatemala, and Puerto Rico. In
   general, migration to the United States increases the likelihood of
   upward mobility relative to nonmigrants if it begins at a relatively
   young age (before twenty-five), particularly in Costa Rica and
   Guatemala, where mobility is generally more fluid. In all countries, but
   especially Mexico, mobility prospects depend on a migrant's own
   characteristics and the characteristics of the U.S. trip, as well the
   context of return. Education generally enhances occupational achievement
   upon return, as does greater U.S. experience and the holding of a
   nonmanual U.S. job, but taking more trips and having legal U.S.
   documents are generally associated with lower odds of occupational
   achievement at home.},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {What kinds of politics are (re) produced when a transitional justice
   expert seeks out the victim, elects to rescue him from his marginality,
   categorizes him and represents him on the world stage? More
   specifically, given the fact that transitional justice experts
   legitimize their existence on the basis of speaking about and for
   victims, is it ever possible for the expert to exercise `responsibility'
   to the victim's story in ways that contribute to the genuine empowerment
   of the victim? The main aim of this contribution is to make some
   tentative remarks on how, and what kind of, victims are `produced' by
   the transitional justice industry. In the first section I make some
   generalized observations regarding the political subjectivity of victims
   produced when transitional justice experts speak about and for victims.
   In the second section I then look at how Khulumani Support Group, a
   South African-based social movement of over 55,000 members, has
   negotiated the contradictions brought about by the transitional justice
   industry and its representations - in a sense of speaking both about and
   for victims. I conclude that since `the story' is the main point of
   encounter between the authoritative expert and the marginalized victim,
   `responsibility to the story' should mean more than being nice to
   victims or adhering to rigorous scientific and ethical standards; it
   should also, if not principally, be about redistribution of resources
   and power. In exercising responsibility to the story experts need to
   dismantle trusteeship and reproduction of colonial relations.},

Abstract = {College major choice varies substantially by gender, race, and ethnicity
   among college graduates. This study investigates whether these
   differences are present at the start of the college career and whether
   they can be explained by variation in academic preparation. It estimates
   a multinomial logit to evaluate whether students of similar academic
   backgrounds make similar college major choices at the start of their
   college career. The results demonstrate that significant differences by
   gender, race, and ethnicity persist in initial college major choice even
   after controlling for the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) score of the
   student and the high school class rank of the student. Gender
   differences in major choice are much larger than racial and ethnic
   disparities. Furthermore, women are significantly more likely to switch
   away from an initial major in engineering than are white men.},

Abstract = {This study examines the prospects for new European Union (EU) member
   countries in pursuing their foreign policy objectives in relations with
   China. Both the Czech Republic and Slovakia cherished an idea of making
   China an alternative economic partner. However, after 1989, China
   perceived these states as minor, almost unimportant partners, regardless
   of their efforts. Their profile was raised by EU accession but there was
   little change in their strength in terms of bilateral relations with
   China. The article investigates the failures and partial successes of
   the Czech and Slovak relationships with China, comparing their different
   approaches to the balance between focusing on political and human rights
   issues and the pursuit of economic and business interests.},

Abstract = {The early years of the green revolution heralded a new era of technology
   adoption and increasing productivity in agriculture. This momentum has
   not been sustained, giving rise to food shortages and widespread poverty
   in developing countries. This chapter reviews processes and models of
   technology transfer in agriculture in developing economies and concludes
   that previous efforts were not demand driven and therefore lacked the
   ingredients for diffusion. The drivers of technology transfer are
   discussed. A number of factors responsible for the low rate of
   technology transfer especially the absence of public policies on
   technology transfer are identified and linked to the transfer of
   emerging technologies, mainly biotechnology and nanotechnology. The
   chapter recommends the development of public policies, development of
   the private sector, establishment of partnerships between the two
   sectors and development of infrastructures especially in rural areas.},

Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {15},
Number = {2},
Pages = {225-254},
Abstract = {Enormous new markets in uncertainty and in carbon have been created
   recently, ostensibly to enhance the cost-effectiveness of both finance
   and climate action. In both cases, however, creating the abstract
   commodity framework necessary to make sense of the notion of
   `cost-effectiveness' has entailed losing touch with what was supposedly
   being costed, helping to engender systemic crisis. The new financial
   markets expanded credit and multiplied leverage by isolating,
   quantifying, slicing, dicing and circulating diverse types of
   uncertainty; the resulting unchecked pursuit of liquidity led to a
   catastrophic drying up of liquidity. The carbon markets, meanwhile, by
   identifying global warming solutions with reductions in an abstract pool
   of tradable pollution rights and linking them with `offsets'
   manufactured through quantitative techniques, ended up blocking
   prospective historical pathways toward less fossil fuel dependence and
   thus exacerbated the climate problem. Unsurprisingly, both markets have
   provoked strong, if diverse and confused, movements of societal
   self-defence. This pattern of action and reaction constitutes a chapter
   in the political history of commodification as significant in some ways
   as that describing the movements to commodify land and labour analysed
   by Karl Polanyi.},

Year = {2010},
Pages = {263-276},
Abstract = {This case study shows the difficulties of forging a national identity
   and creating effective state institutions in an archipelago state of
   enormous ethnic and linguistic diversity. Papua New Guinea faces no
   major international security threats. The former colonial power,
   Australia, bowed out peacefully, but left behind a population
   inadequately educated to staff modern state institutions. Although the
   country has an extensive endowment of natural resources, these have not
   produced general prosperity. Rather, they have raised the exchange rate,
   making it more difficult for other sectors of the economy to develop.
   State services, elementary schooling, the road system, hospitals, and
   policing do not extend to all parts of the country. Most political
   parties and political leaders have a very narrow regional following.
   Although regular and highly contested elections have been held since
   independence, and despite a free and active press, corruption has
   increased and violent crime is endemic.},

Abstract = {Active labor-market policies (ALMPs) have developed significantly over
   the past two decades across Organization for Economic Cooperation and
   Development (OECD) countries, with substantial cross-national
   differences in terms of both extent and overall orientation. The
   objective of this article is to account for cross-national variation in
   this policy field. It starts by reviewing existing scholarship
   concerning political, institutional, and ideational determinants of
   ALMPs. It then argues that ALMP is too broad a category to be used
   without further specification, and it develops a typology of four
   different types of ALMPs: incentive reinforcement, employment
   assistance, occupation, and human capital investment. These are
   discussed and examined through ALMP expenditure profiles in selected
   countries. The article uses this typology to analyze ALMP trajectories
   in six Western European countries and shows that the role of this
   instrument changes dramatically over time. It concludes that there is
   little regularity in the political determinants of ALMPs. In contrast,
   it finds strong institutional and ideational effects, nested in the
   interaction between the changing economic context and existing
   labor-market policies.},

Abstract = {Islam has a 1,000-year history in West Africa; in East Africa it is even
   longer. What started out as liberating efforts by Muslims in Africa
   degenerated into oppressive regimes over time. Over the centuries,
   conquest increasingly came to define Islam's approach in Africa. How
   Africa manages its necessity to accommodate Islamic elements in its
   midst is one of the continent's most daunting challenges. On the one
   hand, the region is home to a substantial number of Muslims. On the
   other hand, there is a connection between religious radicalism and
   poverty. Tanzanian President Jakaya Kikwete, a Muslim, suggested that if
   belief is the potential seed of radicalism, then poverty is the
   fertilizer. Overcoming the factional divide within Islam is important
   because the fissures are latent in countries with large Islamic
   populations. How Africa manages this challenge has profound long-term
   implications for peace, stability, and development on the continent.},

Title = {``Euro-Islam{''}: Going Beyond the Aporiatic Politics of Othering},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SOCIOLOGY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {4},
Number = {3},
Pages = {236-252},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Is a ``Euro-Islam{''} possible? Whether at the level of theory, practice
   or policy, very few scholars and practitioners pay enough sustained
   attention to the fact that how we think/not-think, speak/silence,
   inscribe/erase, and address/ignore various aspects of ``Islam in Western
   Europe{''} has much to do with the concepts of ``identity{''} and
   ``other.{''} Whereas policy-makers, activists, peace-advocates, and
   fear-mongers continuously deploy these concepts for or against certain
   strategies, agendas and purposes, it is important to ``deconstruct{''}
   these concepts so as to open up a horizon for thinking the possibility
   of a Euro-Islam. This paper thus argues that thinking of Euro-Islam
   implies an aporiatic politics of ``Othering{''} and that it is possible
   to go beyond this aporia in a certain way by using a new approach for
   thinking about Islam in Europe. I develop this framework through a
   deconstruction of the concepts of ``identity{''} and ``other{''} using a
   non-Aristotelian logic of ``without,{''} the pair of undecidable
   concepts immunity/auto-immunity, and Derrida's notion of
   ``negotiation.{''}.},

Abstract = {This article examines the statistical system of the United
   States-featuring fourteen principal statistical agencies and sixty to
   seventy units in other federal agencies-focusing on the system's highly
   decentralized nature and the ways in which the agencies attempt to
   evaluate the status of issues relevant to the mission of their
   departments and to provide information helpful in the creation of new
   policy. The history and challenges of the various agencies are examined,
   with the article showing that these challenges are inevitably tied to
   the cabinet departments to which they are attached. The article also
   examines recurrent issues facing the U.S. federal statistical system,
   including functional separation of statistical activities from
   regulatory activities, centralization versus decentralization, hiring
   structure of directors, data confidentiality versus access, policy
   relevance versus policy-making involvement, and contracting out
   statistical activities versus agency-conducted statistical activities.},

   significant impact on economic welfare and on innovation. In this
   article, we explain the economics of discrimination as it applies to the
   Internet, and we offer a new approach for identifying anticompetitive
   discrimination. Our proposal would require a complaining content
   provider to prove (i) the broadband service provider has discriminated
   in favor of some affiliated content provider that is ``similarly
   situated{''} to the independent content provider; (ii) such disparate
   treatment is based on affiliation and not on some other consideration;
   (iii) the independent content provider has been unreasonably restrained
   in its ability to compete; and (iv) the harm it suffers as a result of
   the discrimination would likely redound to the harm of broadband users.},

Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {5},
Number = {2},
Pages = {107-139},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {An important theory of international cooperation asserts that
   governments comply with international law because of the reputational
   costs incurred by reneging on public agreements. Countries that sign
   binding international agreements in the realm of monetary relations
   signal their commitment to an open economic system, which should
   reassure international market actors that the government is committed to
   sound economic policies. If the theory is correct, we should observe
   evidence that noncompliance is in fact costly. I test this argument by
   examining the effect of noncompliance with Article VIII of the IMF's
   Articles of Agreement on sovereign risk ratings. The results show that
   noncompliance with the agreement mitigates any benefits that accrue to
   Article VIII signatories. The empirical evidence suggests that, in
   addition to improving economic and political conditions at home,
   governments in the developing world would improve their access to
   financial markets by signing and complying with international monetary
   agreements.},

Journal = {ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {628},

Abstract = {The question of how causal effects are transmitted is fascinating and
   inevitably arises whenever experiments are presented. Social scientists
   cannot be faulted for taking a lively interest in ``mediation,{''} the
   process by which causal influences are transmitted. However, social
   scientists frequently underestimate the difficulty of establishing
   causal pathways in a rigorous empirical manner. We argue that the
   statistical methods currently used to study mediation are flawed and
   that even sophisticated experimental designs cannot speak to questions
   of mediation without the aid of strong assumptions. The study of
   mediation is more demanding than most social scientists suppose and
   requires not one experimental study but rather an extensive program of
   experimental research.},

Abstract = {Randomized field experiments should take a more central place in
   qualitative research. Although field experimentation is often considered
   a quantitative enterprise, this paper illustrates the compatibility of
   field experimentation with various types of qualitative measurement
   tools and research questions. Integrating qualitative and quantitative
   data within field experiments allows investigators to move past simple
   average treatment effects and explore mechanisms of the identified
   causal effect. A more novel proposal is to use field experimentation as
   the organizing methodological framework for archival, ethnographic, or
   interpretive work, and to use ethnographic methods as the primary source
   of measurement in ``experimental ethnography.{''} Sustained research and
   theoretical specificity can address some of the seemingly incompatible
   features of qualitative and field experimental methods. For example,
   small sample sizes are acceptable as part of a research program, and
   some theories of historical patterns or rare events could be
   disaggregated into smaller cause-and-effect linkages to test with field
   experiments in theoretically relevant contexts.},

Abstract = {While the impact of an attorney's sex has been examined with respect to
   trial court processes (e.g., jury decision making), no one has
   previously studied its effects on appellate court decision making. In
   this article, we argue that the application of gender schemas by some
   justices results in a devaluing of the arguments made by women
   litigators. Our findings suggest that women orally arguing attorneys are
   less likely to receive a favorable vote by a justice than are the male
   counsel they oppose and that conservative justices are more likely than
   their liberal counterparts to vote against litigants represented by
   female counsel at oral argument. This suggests that the ideology of
   elites influences whether they apply gender schemas in a negative
   fashion. We also find that justices are more likely to side with female
   lawyers in women's issues cases, indicating that the justices'
   perceptions of female lawyer expertise are enhanced in those cases.
   These findings persist even after controlling for multiple factors,
   including attorney expertise, the sex of the justice, amicus
   participation, party capability, and judicial ideology.},

Abstract = {Drawing on data from a year's fieldwork in Northeast China and several
   visits to the Russian Far East, a senior scholar and a current PhD
   candidate examine migration between Russia and China, focusing on the
   Chinese context. Does evidence support claims of large-scale legal or
   illegal Chinese migration to Russia since 1991? The number of Chinese
   working in Russia is assessed in terms of Chinese global migration, and
   shifting economic and demographic conditions in the two countries are
   considered with respect to prospects for future Chinese migration.},

Volume = {12},

Pages = {464-483},
Abstract = {Contrasting the socio-political contexts of large-scale development and
   the HIV/AIDS crisis in Lesotho, our analysis captures important
   historical conjunctures that expanded opportunities for the mobilization
   of women's rights as human rights. Local women's rights organizations,
   such as Women and Law in Southern Africa (WLSA), found greater support
   and resonance for women's rights claims amid the socio-political context
   of the AIDS crisis, in marked contrast to the stifling of those same
   claims during a period of neoliberal, nationalist development
   initiatives in Lesotho. The AIDS crisis in particular introduced new
   international actors that helped support a `frame bridging' strategy
   whereby women's rights were characterized as health rights, rooted in a
   critique of the AIDS crisis that identified the role of gender
   inequality as an important driver of the epidemic. These links to
   transnational feminist networks as well as to international health
   agencies bolstered the critiques of gender inequality articulated by
   WLSA and other women's rights advocates, helping usher in a series of
   legal changes in Lesotho in 2003 and 2006.},

Abstract = {This article examines the economic myths that surround the process of
   European integration. It argues that while such myths once played an
   important role in fostering identification and support for the process,
   they no longer serve that function. Instead, these economic myths have
   become a focal point for contestation and concern. Europeans will have
   to develop a new mythology to explain and justify their process of
   integration as a result.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF WOMEN POLITICS \& POLICY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {31},
Number = {1},
Pages = {67-92},
Abstract = {This article critically examines Ronald Dworkin's theory of equality of
   resources from a feminist perspective. In particular, it focuses on a
   specific set of gender issues: the injustice of gender inequality
   generated by the gender division of labor in the family. Referring to
   Peter Blau's theory of social structure, I conceptualize the unequal
   situation of women at work and in the family as being structural. This
   article contends that Dworkin's theory of equality is found to be
   problematic when dealing with structural aspects of gender inequality.
   Dworkin's categorization of ``luck'' does not properly take account of
   the injustice of the gendered social structure over which individual
   women have no control. This article argues that his hypothetical
   insurance market does not adequately deal with the disadvantages that
   women suffer within the gendered social structure, and that his
   redistributive tax system fails to compensate women for inequalities
   resulting from effects of the gendered social structure.},

Abstract = {By guaranteeing college admission to all students who graduate in the
   top 10 percent of their high school class, Texas H.B. 588 replaced an
   opaque de facto practice of admitting nearly all top 10 percent
   graduates with a transparent de jure policy that required public
   institutions to admit all applicants eligible for the guarantee. The new
   admission regime sent a clear message to students attending high schools
   that previously sent few students to the Texas flagships. Using 18 years
   of administrative data to examine sending patterns, we find a. sizeable
   decrease in the concentration of flagship enrollees originating from
   select feeder schools and growing shares of enrollees originating from
   high schools located in rural areas, small towns, and midsize cities, as
   well as from schools with concentrations of poor and minority students.
   For new sending schools, we find substantial year-to-year persistence in
   sending behavior, which increased after the top 10 percent policy was
   implemented.},

Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},

Volume = {15},
Number = {2},
Pages = {255-273},
Abstract = {In this article we unpack the `black box' of carbon offsetting through a
   critical examination of the technologies and techniques that create
   carbon credits. Drawing on empirical research of compliance (Clean
   Development Mechanism) and voluntary carbon offset markets, we highlight
   the diversity of technologies, techniques and devices involved in carbon
   offsetting, ranging from refrigerant plants to systems of calculation
   and audit. We suggest that polarised debates for and against offsetting
   do not adequately reflect the considerable variations between types of
   offset project and governance practices in the compliance and voluntary
   offset markets. Using conceptual insights from governmentality theory
   and science and technology studies we assess the tensions in making
   standard, fungible carbon credits. In conclusion, we suggest attention
   to the technologies and materiality of carbon offsetting allows a fresh
   perspective on somewhat entrenched debates about the advantages and
   disadvantages of offsetting.},

Abstract = {This article explores the effort, during the last decade, to develop a
   set of global standards and codes to govern international capital
   markets. I posit that, despite global capital market pressures, this
   effort should have limited success in low and middle-income countries.
   Drawing upon a historical institutionalist framework, I suggest that
   domestic political institutions, as well as interests, often will lead
   to the failure of governments to implement global codes and standards.
   After describing briefly the motivations for and substance of the
   standards and code project, I summarize trends in the national
   implementation of such standards. I then point to several instances of
   policy feedback, in which the existing domestic regulatory institutions
   in middle-income countries rendered the adoption of new international
   rules difficult, technically as well as politically.},

Title = {Can FTAs deliver market liberalization in Japan? A study on domestic
   political determinants},
Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {17},
Number = {2},
Pages = {209-237},
Abstract = {The last decade has witnessed Japan's transformation from one of the
   last hard core multilateralists to an active negotiator of free trade
   agreements (FTAs). This striking policy shift raises the question as to
   whether FTAs can finally deliver substantial liberalization of the
   Japanese market, a goal long sought by Japan's trading partners and
   domestic champions of structural reform. I argue that Japan's ability to
   negotiate such high-yield FTAs (with large trading partners, and
   encompassing substantial market access concessions and multiple WTO plus
   commitments) will hinge upon the intensity of lobbying by the
   internationalized business sector to overcome the resistance of
   uncompetitive sectors; and the centralization of domestic policy-making
   in order to break the protectionist inertia of traditional
   subgovernments. In developing this argument, I modify existing
   demand/supply models of FTA policy to factor in the preferences of
   societal actors in the game of selective and discriminatory
   liberalization and to take into account the influence of domestic
   political institutions through the logic of principal-agent relations.},

Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {5},
Number = {4},
Pages = {475-496},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Market instruments, such as emissions trading or pollution taxes, are
   less costly than ``command and control{''} regulation. Yet technological
   standards are common in international environmental agreements and now
   figure prominently among proposals to mitigate global warming. I show
   that technological standards can be combined with market instruments to
   create collective enforcement power. They allow states to
   internationally enforce technology installation, so the payoff to free
   riding decreases. A notable feature of the argument is that
   technological standards and market instruments are complements, while
   previous research has treated them as substitutes. Empirically,
   technological standards are most valuable if international cooperation
   is difficult to enforce and the rate of technological change in
   concerned industries is slow.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {4},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {397-420},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {For countries rebuilding in the wake of violence and repression,
   memorials, museums and places of memory represent a critical terrain
   where the past is confronted and conflict can be addressed.
   Memorialization, however, has not always been as intentional and
   strategic as other transitional justice practices, and evaluation of its
   impact is limited. This article focuses on the work of the International
   Coalition of Sites of Conscience and an evaluation of the youth programs
   of three of its members: the Liberation War Museum in Bangladesh, the
   Monte Sole Peace School in Italy and the Villa Grimaldi Peace Park in
   Chile. The evaluation found that the sites had a number of impacts on
   the young people who visited them, including changing opinions, raising
   awareness, improving relationships, encouraging civic engagement and
   increasing emotional understanding of the human consequences of
   atrocity. The article questions how such impacts relate to wider social
   processes (for example, human rights reform, violence prevention and
   transitional justice) and how social and political processes affect the
   potential for individual and group impacts. It argues that transitional
   processes can make better use of the specific resources memorial sites
   have to offer.},

Title = {European Regional Structural Funds: How Large is the Influence of

Abstract = {The allocation of Structural Funds, the most important component of the
   European Union (EU) cohesion policy, is subject to intense bargaining
   between national governments and across layers of political governance.
   Using Structural Funds data for each cohesion objective over 1989-99, we
   examine which variables, economic and political, determine the actual
   funds allocation. We test our hypotheses with a Tobit model that
   accounts for the two-stage allocation process and our limited dependent
   variables. Our results indicate that economic criteria are not the only
   determinants of funds allocation. Indeed, we find that the political
   situation within a country and a region and the relations between
   various layers of governance influence the allocation process. This
   article is also the only study to measure the impact of additional funds
   provided by the region or the country itself, and to differentiate the
   analysis by cohesion objective.},

Volume = {48},

Abstract = {Unlike most prior literature in finance and economics, this article
   focuses on events in the political economy and examines the integration
   of European equity markets over the 1988 through 2002 period using two
   innovative techniques that assess how the level of integration in equity
   price indices changes over time. The results show that notwithstanding
   the rising interdependencies between the European and US equity markets
   during the mid- to late 1990s, the long-run integrative relationships
   governing the European markets strengthen only in the late 1980s. This
   evidence suggests that despite several years of political willingness by
   European leaders to integrate economies, the equity markets only
   responded to the Delors Report (1989) and the Strasbourg Declaration
   (1989) that the European Economic Community would move towards European
   Monetary Union, but they provided little positive long-run response to
   subsequent developments pertaining to European Monetary Union.},

Abstract = {Nanotechnology is science at the size of individual atoms and molecules.
   At that size scale, materials have different chemical and physical
   properties than those of the same materials in bulk. Research has shown
   that nanotechnology offers opportunities to create revolutionary
   advances in product development. It also has the potential to improve
   assessment, management, and prevention of environmental risks. There are
   however, unanswered questions about the impacts of nanomaterials and
   nanoproducts on human health and the environment. This chapter describes
   state-of the-science review, exposure assessment and mitigation, and
   potential macro ethical issues that must be considered to mitigate risk

Abstract = {The article analyses the evolution of European competition policy. It is
   argued that the content, form, and scope of competition regulation has
   undergone a major transformation over the past fifty years, which is
   related to broader socio-economic developments. Until the mid-1980s,
   competition policy formed part of the institutional nexus of the postwar
   order of `embedded liberalism', underpinned by a Fordist accumulation
   regime and Keynesian welfare institutions. It exemplified strong
   neo-mercantilist and protectionist traits, allowing for significant
   distortions of competition, whenever justified for general reasons of
   industrial and social policy. Since the mid-1980s, gradually, a
   neoliberal `competition only' vision came to dominate, giving rise to a
   more market-based competition regime, in which private rather than
   public actors prevail, and which seeks to create an ever-bigger `level
   playing field' of free markets. This transformation is linked to the
   broader context of the disruption of the postwar social order and the
   rise of neoliberalism. A public-private alliance of transnational
   actors, consisting of the European Commission's DG Competition and
   transnational business elite networks, were the driving forces behind
   the `neoliberalisation' of competition policy.},

   the intellectual capabilities on nanotechnology and microelectronics
   research and education are still evolving and some foundation
   technologies like electricity and ICT needed to drive and support them
   are not available. Lack of management efficiency and good governance
   continue to stall progress in the continent. In these matrixed four
   sub-chapters, these issues are discussed including a new model, Generic

Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},

Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Pages = {129-154},
Abstract = {While it is widely accepted that corruption negatively affects economic
   growth, why some countries achieve rapid growth under rampant corruption
   remains a puzzle. This article sheds light on this issue by examining
   the role of trust in the corruption-efficiency relationship. It argues
   that in countries with a relatively low level of trust, corruption tends
   to be more predatory and inefficient than corruption in countries with a
   relatively high level of trust, which tends to be less predatory (or
   relatively more `efficiency-enhancing'). To illustrate their arguments,
   the authors first conduct a qualitative comparative case study of China
   and the Philippines. They then further subject their ideas to a
   quantitative test using a pooled data set of 65 countries in two time
   periods. Both their case study and statistical test support their
   general hypothesis that trust mitigates the negative effect of
   corruption on economic growth.},

   explores the potential and limitations of private voluntary regulation
   through a detailed matched pair case study of two factories supplying
   Nike, the world's largest athletic footwear and apparel company. These
   two factories have many similarities - both are in Mexico, both are in
   the apparel industry, both produce more or less the same products for
   Nike (and other brands) and both are subject to the same code of
   conduct. On the surface, both factories appear to have similar
   employment (i.e. recruitment, training, remuneration) practices and they
   receive comparable scores when audited by Nike's compliance staff.
   However, underlying (and somewhat obscured by) these apparent
   similarities, significant differences in actual labor conditions exist
   between these two factories. What drives these differences in working
   conditions? What does this imply for traditional systems of monitoring
   and codes of conduct? Field research conducted at these two factories
   reveals that beyond the code of conduct and various monitoring efforts
   aimed at enforcing it, workplace conditions and labor standards are
   shaped by very different patterns of work organization and human
   resource management policies. The promotion of these alternative
   work/human resources management practices can complement traditional
   monitoring efforts in ways that promoted improved labor standards.},

Abstract = {This article confirms that labour productivity in the European economies
   has continued to slow down in recent years. U.S. productivity growth has
   been higher than in the EU, but only since 2001. At the same time, both

   growth is now higher than in U.S. This article proposes that
   productivity growth be explained by demand dynamics, and investment in
   particular, not forgetting the influence of employment, along with other

Title = {The New Financial Development Paradigm and Asian Bond Markets},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {15},
Number = {4},
Pages = {493-517},
Abstract = {For the better part of the last century, the debate between
   `liberalisers' and `interventionists' marked thinking about the
   relationship between finance and development. It has by now been
   superseded by the emergence of the discourse of financial system
   development, which links economic growth to the development of the
   financial sector. As the risks entailed by wholesale financial reform
   came to the fore in the financial crises of the 1990s and early 2000s,
   emphasis shifted from liberalising financial markets to building
   institutional frameworks to accommodate investment. Arguably, the
   emergence of the financial-system-development discourse occurred within
   a wider shift in the neoliberal paradigm towards institution building.
   These changes are particularly pronounced in East and Southeast Asia.
   This paper argues that a convergence of opinions has occurred between
   Asian financial policy elites, previously strong supporters of the
   bank-based developmental state model, and the liberalisers, represented
   through international financial institutions such as the IMF. This
   consensus is geared towards the expansion of capital markets and a
   generally more neoliberal, market-oriented mode of economic governance.
   To illustrate this claim, this paper traces institutional changes in
   Asian financial systems since the 1997-98 financial crisis. Although
   local characteristics remain, a common feature is the more salient role
   of bond markets in the financial system. This is the result of the
   conscious and deliberate development of local currency debt markets by
   policymakers. However, the new consensus narrows down the space in which
   economic policymaking takes place. Yet, by re-politicising financial
   system development, this space could be broadened again.},

Volume = {15},

Pages = {421-444},
Abstract = {Drawing on and contributing to materialist state theory, the regulation
   approach and institutional economics for more than three decades, Bob
   Jessop can certainly be considered one of the foremost Marxist political
   economists of our time. Recently, he has taken on board the cultural
   turn in social analysis by developing a highly original cultural
   political economy of the knowledge-based economy. As a contribution to
   the further development of a cultural political economy that is
   sensitive to the cultural dimensions of social life while retaining an
   emphasis on capital accumulation and state regulation, this article
   directs attention to the limits of Jessop's approach and suggests
   possible amendments to the theory. In particular, the article highlights
   the need to move beyond a concern with regulation towards a cultural
   political economy of complexity and emergence.},

Abstract = {This article presents findings from a qualitative case study assessment
   of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) in Sierra Leone. It
   contributes to the empirical evidence concerning the psychologically
   healing effects of postwar truth telling processes and adds
   significantly to the specificity of such findings. The article
   distinguishes between the experiences of truth telling among the
   educated elite minority and the majority of local residents, and shows
   that these divergent experiences are related to different levels of
   access to the benefits, and incorporation of the international
   discourses, of postwar healing. It concludes with a word on the ability
   of the TRC to catalyze healing in the local context of Sierra Leone and
   the benefits of the ethnographic approach for the assessment of
   transitional justice mechanisms.},

Abstract = {From 1934, ethnicity in the internal passport was a key feature of the
   USSR's ethnicity regime. Following Stalin's death, all attempts to
   abolish ethnicity from the Soviet internal passport failed. This article
   examines the removal of ethnicity from the internal passport in the
   post-Soviet period as a key indicator of the new state policy on
   ethnicity. Grounded in the scholarly literature on ethnicity in
   post-Soviet Russia, drawing on the media, interviews, and the work of a
   key actor, Valeriy Tishkov, ethnologist and Yel'tsin's Nationalities
   Minister, this paper traces the process of passport reform. The central
   government's policy towards ethnicity outside the federalism framework
   is analyzed.},

Abstract = {This article deals with the issue of gender and migration in a
   comparative manner. It aims at identifying factors that affect the
   gender composition of migratory streams, including family formation and
   children. It compares two contrasting streams: Mexican migration to the
   United States, which has traditionally been male-dominated; and
   Paraguayan migration to Argentina, which comprises a larger proportion
   of women with patterns of migration relatively similar to those of their
   male counterparts. Using quantitative information from the Mexican
   Migration Project and the Paraguayan Migration Survey, and qualitative
   in-depth interviews, the authors examine differences in patterns of
   migration and the factors associated with them. The article concludes
   that differences are due mainly to historical traits in the initiation
   of the flows, the economic and social role of women in each sending
   country, migration policies and border controls, and the contexts of
   reception (resource opportunities).},

   Higher employment rates are in general positively associated with

   market policies (ALMP), and negatively with institutions and policies
   which induce rigidity in the labour market. We also find evidence that
   the relation between ALMP and employment levels is non-monotonic and
   that it is conditional on the informal institutions prevailing in

Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Pages = {73-95},

Abstract = {Given the popular wisdom that the U. S. government influences IMF
   policies and tends to support the business community, it might be
   expected that IMF programs benefit U. S. firms abroad and thus borrower
   nations are attractive destinations for U. S. foreign direct investment
   (FDI). Surprisingly, no study has tested the impact of IMF loans on U.
   S. FDI. Controlling for common explanations in the literature, we use a
   treatment effects model and interviews with IMF staff researchers to
   investigate whether countries under different kinds of IMF programs
   receive more U. S. FDI than countries not under IMF arrangements. Using
   panel data for 126 developing countries from 1980 to 2003, we find that
   IMF borrowers tend to be more attractive to U. S. investors but not all
   IMF programs have the same effect. Our findings suggest that differences
   in loan duration, the extent of borrower input in policy decisions, and
   loan amounts affect borrowers' leverage with the Fund and the U. S.},

Journal = {POLITICS \& GENDER},

Volume = {6},

Abstract = {Social scientists are increasingly taking a more complex theoretical
   approach to the role of stereotyping in the electorate's evaluation of
   political candidates. Within this literature, most studies investigate
   the impact of one stereotype on the public's evaluation of candidates
   from an underrepresented group. We build on and extend this literature
   by exploring what we term ``intersectional stereotyping{''}: The role of
   stereotypes in shaping the electorate's evaluation of political
   candidates who share dual membership in stigmatized groups women and
   sexual minorities. We empirically examine the impact of intersectional
   stereotyping in a unique 2003 survey of national adults. Our results
   indicate that gender, both of the respondent and the candidate, plays a
   key role in shaping attitudes toward gay and lesbian political
   candidates. These findings suggest that intersectional stereotyping
   plays a nuanced role in evaluations of candidates; in certain contexts
   gender stereotypes are more significant, and at other times stereotypes
   about sexual minorities appear to be driving evaluations of candidates.},

   low. At independence, the local elite who had cooperated with France
   during the colonial period took political control, while France retained
   its economic interests and protected them by overturning a military coup
   in 1964. The Gabonese used the centralized administrative structures
   inherited from the colonial period to impose personalistic clan rule.
   Much of Gabon's middle class works in this government bureaucracy, which
   controls the economy. The second president of Gabon remained in power
   from 1969 to 2009 and was, apart from royal families, the world's
   longest-ruling leader. Although his rule constituted a shift in the
   ethnic groups controlling the government, he maintained political
   stability by forging a coalition of carefully balanced ethnic groups, by
   relying on his own clan to staff his inner circle, and by protecting
   French interests to retain French support.},

Title = {Hedge Funds as `War Machine': Making the Positions Work},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Pages = {9-28},
Abstract = {The paper criticises current metaphorical characterisations of hedge
   funds as either trader/arbitrageurs or speculator/gamblers. We argue
   that these two different characterisations share a
   definition-identity-outcome frame within which hedge funds are separate
   and distinct from other financial actors, and engaged in an activity of
   buying and selling assets with `real' and fixed risk/return
   characteristics. To break with this frame, our article makes two
   discursive moves. First, it counters metaphor with analogy by replacing
   the metaphor of buying and selling with the analogy of war, drawing on
   Deleuze and Guattari's concept of `war machine'. Second, it combines the
   military analogy of war with our own political and economic concept of
   conjuncture to emphasise the relevance of space and time in
   understanding hedge fund practice and performance. These two moves open
   up a different approach which highlights the interconnectedness of hedge
   funds with other financial actors, and the increasing difficulty of
   distinguishing hedge funds from other financial and non-financial
   companies who now engage in combat using identical strategies. The
   techniques of shorting and leveraging are presented as weapons not tools
   because hedge funds are not just active traders, but active manipulators
   of those trades, when the goal is to `make the positions work'. We
   conclude, however, that this strategy becomes more difficult on new
   terrain as the economic conjuncture shifts from excess liquidity to
   credit crunch.},

Pages = {696-723},
Abstract = {After years of acrimonious debate among leading industrialized states,
   the G20 reached an agreement in 2009 on the regulation of hedge funds.
   Anchored in an institutional theory of government action that draws on
   historical institutionalism, this article finds that cleavages between
   liberal market economies (US, Britain) and organized market economies
   (Germany, France) determined the failure to regulate hedge funds in the
   1990s, the origins of a self-governance regime in the mid-2000s, as well
   as the nature of the G20 agreement in 2009. Historical institutionalism
   offers an important complement to theoretical traditions in
   international political economy (IPE) that stress the role of states'
   market power in shaping international regulatory regimes, especially in
   accounting for how the evolution of state preferences affect the nature
   of international regulation over time. The article concludes with
   suggestions for how historical institutionalism can be extended beyond
   its typical purview in comparative politics to give analytical and
   substantive nuance to the study of international market regulation.},

Abstract = {This article examines policies and public attitudes concerning the issue
   of Soviet and Nazi genocides in Ukraine after the `Orange Revolution'.
   The central question is whether such factors as regional political
   culture affect contemporary policies and public attitudes towards these
   important historical issues. The article uses a 2008 survey conducted
   for this study by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology to
   analyse determinants of public attitudes concerning the question of
   whether Soviet and the Nazi policies were genocidal. It finds that
   regional political culture is the most significant factor affecting
   policies and attitudes towards the Soviet genocide in Ukraine.},

Abstract = {Although asylum for lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transsexuals has been
   on the international human rights agenda since the early to mid 1990s,
   lesbian asylum cases do not tend to figure centrally in analyses of the
   relationship between refugee law and international human rights law.
   While a number of regional and comparative studies of lesbian asylum
   exist by legal activists and scholars, a discussion of the politics of
   lesbian asylum claims has so far remained absent from both feminist and
   queer studies. In this contribution, I explore how the subject of
   lesbian asylum is treated within the context of film and visual media.
   Focusing particular attention on Angelina Maccarone's 2005 film Unveiled
   about an Iranian lesbian asylum-seeker, I consider the ways in which
   film and media might transform how we conceive of and imagine lesbian
   rights. As I will suggest, Unveiled offers important insights into the
   kinds of representational challenges that are specific to lesbian asylum
   claims. In this way, I argue, the film constitutes a much-needed
   intervention into current advocacy on behalf of the issue of lesbian
   asylum.},

Abstract = {The issue of EU gas supply security has become more and more important
   in the 2000s in the context of gas market liberalisation and the
   question of the reliability of Russia as a supplier. One answer to these
   problems is EU gas diversification, specifically the opening up of a
   fourth gas corridor to supply the EU with gas from Central Asia via the
   `Caucasus' or `southern' route. The feasibility of this strategy might
   now be called into question. This article reviews the new strategies
   that could emerge in the producing countries as well as those of
   international oil companies, and then examines what the consequences
   might be as far as the EU's diversification strategy is concerned. The
   article identifies some of the problems and limits of these strategies.},

Abstract = {This article argues that American media reports of the Jessica Lynch
   case illustrate some of the ways in which gender has been reordered,
   policed and disciplined within the United States (and North America more
   broadly) in the wake of 9/11 and in the context of war. The study of a
   key gendered representation of the war - and of the way gender
   interlocks with race, class, nationality and sexuality in these
   representations - tells us not only about how the war was sold to the
   American public, but also about the degree to which normative and
   disciplinary gender roles can be stretched, or not, within domestic
   society and the ways in which contemporary media portrayals of foreign
   adventures serve to reinforce these gender norms. Ultimately we argue
   that media portraits of Jessica Lynch demonstrate how little the simple
   inclusion of women in the military acts to disrupt sexist systems of
   power and meaning.},

Abstract = {This article uses the case study of Indonesian governments' attempts to
   construct a 1,000 kilometer toll road through the densest parts of Java
   to shed light on how governments with a checkered past of enforcing
   contracts and protecting private property rights go about establishing
   the requisite regulatory framework to attract private investment for
   infrastructure. While regulatory reform has taken place in Indonesia,
   vested interests and power will keep the country's political economy
   from taking on World Bank-promoted best practice characteristics.
   Programs that promote private sector participation in infrastructure
   need to be reconsidered where the main ingredients for these programs'
   success exist in small measures.},

Abstract = {This article examines the potential for Franco-German leadership in the
   EU-27. Leadership in the sense of shared leadership to achieve
   collective European goals can be exercised in different ways: by
   promoting the deepening and/or widening of European integration, by the
   active search for European compromises on disputed issues or by means of
   crisis management in European affairs. The Franco-German potential for
   performing such a leading role inside the European Union can be seen as
   being a function of French and German formal and informal power
   resources, of the shape of the institutional environments in different
   EU policy fields, of the prevailing preference configurations and issue
   coalitions in the Council and of the deliberate political strategies of
   French and German political leaders. The article analyses how far the
   enlargement of the European Union to 27 Member States has eroded the
   combined leadership capacities of France and Germany. Under specific
   conditions and circumstances - which should be less frequent in the
   EU-27 than before - the two European core countries might still be able
   to provide the kind of leadership which an enlarged Union needs perhaps
   more than ever.},

Abstract = {This article discusses options to facilitate movement of workers between
   high-income and developing countries within the framework of trade
   agreements, focusing on the European Union's partnership agreements with
   neighbouring countries. Existing frameworks for co-operation offer the
   possibility of expanding temporary rather than longer-term or permanent
   movement of workers since extant trade agreements provide scope for
   negotiating specific market access commitments for services, including
   those delivered through the cross-border movement of natural persons.
   Even though the potential for such `embodied' trade in services will not
   be anywhere near what would be associated with substantial
   liberalization of migration regimes, furthering the services trade
   dimension in the European Union's trade agreements offers significant
   potential Pareto gains. For the partner countries these gains from
   temporary movement of service providers are both direct - through
   greater employment and revenue from providing services in the European
   Union - and indirect - by helping to increase and sustain higher growth
   at home.},

Abstract = {The Nordic countries have no tradition of judicial review by courts and
   have generally been hesitant to make use of the preliminary ruling
   procedure in the European Union. New data indicate that Nordic courts
   prefer to solve as many EU-related judicial disputes as possible without
   involving a supranational organ such as the ECJ. Building on two
   comprehensive surveys of Danish and Swedish courts and judges, this
   study challenges the theory of judicial empowerment when explaining
   judicial integration in the EU. The article argues that in order to
   explain when and why Member State courts make use of the preliminary
   ruling procedure, a much deeper understanding of the prevalent
   legal/political culture and concept of democracy in each Member State is
   required. In particular, the distinction between majoritarian versus
   constitutional democracies may help us understand why majoritarian
   democracies express greater scepticism towards supranational judicial
   review.},

Abstract = {How has China's food safety administrative system changed since it was
   founded in 1949? How can we periodize the process of this historical
   transformation in terms of regulators, regulatees, and regulatory tools?
   This review article offers an analytical framework that distinguishes
   three regimes in the history of China's food safety governance: an old
   regime of command and control (1949-1977), an intermediate regime of
   mixed instruments (1978-1992), and a new regime of regulatory governance
   (1993-ongoing). In the article the regimes' features, advantages,
   disadvantages, and development tracks are discussed, and the groundwork
   is laid for an analysis of China's emerging regulatory state. Finally, a
   new notion of ``transitional regulatory state{''} is used to define the
   current Chinese regulatory state based on its food safety regulation.},

Abstract = {Indigenous peoples are the only distinct segment of national populations
   having voting membership in UN bodies devoted to defining their rights
   and advancing their concerns. This unusual result was the result of the
   confluence of three factors familiar to students of transnational social
   movement politics: a) presence within UN offices and bodies of
   supporters opening forums and agendas to indigenous concerns, b)
   deference to the growing network of indigenous activists by
   anthropologists-the professional community best placed to serve as
   advocates speaking on behalf of indigenous communities, and c)
   indigenous activists' success in developing and projecting a
   globally-valid indigenous identity as ``peoples{''} simultaneously
   uniting the various indigenous communities and providing a rationale for
   establishing voting rights that enough other actors could be persuaded
   to accept. Comparison with UN treatment of other groups indicates that
   indigenous voting rights are more likely to remain an isolated success
   rather than a harbinger of similar practices in other UN bodies.},

Abstract = {Protecting Children Affected by Armed Conflict - Accountability for
   Monitoring, Reporting and Response: This article examines the creation
   of a system for monitoring and reporting of grave violations of
   children's rights in armed conflicts, which was first recognized as a
   key priority in the 1996 Machel Study on the Impact of Armed Conflict on
   Children. Since then, the Security Council has been focusing on the
   issue of children and armed conflict, which culminated in the adoption
   of Resolution 1612 in 2005 and the subsequent formal establishment of a
   monitoring and reporting mechanism. The Security Council today is more
   actively engaged on issues related to children and armed conflict than
   any other thematic issue, and a clear link between its peace and
   security agenda and the concern over children and armed conflict has
   been established. This article reviews the evolution of the mechanism
   for monitoring, reporting and response to issues facing children in
   armed conflict, and analyzes situations where it has been implemented in
   practice. Particular attention is paid to the way that this mechanism
   has addressed accountability among those who commit crimes against
   children as well as those who seek to protect them. While progress has
   been made, the mechanism is still young and there are a number of
   challenges and uncertainties in bringing about real changes in the lives
   of children affected by armed conflict.},

Journal = {REGULATION \& GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {4},
Number = {1},
Pages = {22-47},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In this article we examine how information problems can cause agency
   slippages and lead to governance failures in nonprofit organizations.
   Drawing on the principal-agent literature, we provide a theoretical
   account of an institutional mechanism, namely, voluntary regulation
   programs, to mitigate such slippages. These programs seek to impose
   obligations on their participants regarding internal governance and use
   of resources. By joining these programs, nonprofit organizations seek to
   differentiate themselves from nonparticipants and signal to their
   principals that they are deploying resources as per the organizational
   mandate. If principals are assured that agency slippages are lower in
   program participants, they might be more likely to provide the
   participants with resources to deliver goods and services to their
   target populations. However, regulatory programs for nonprofit
   organizations are of variable quality and, in some cases, could be
   designed to obscure rather than reveal information. We outline an
   analytical framework to differentiate the credible clubs from the
   ``charity washes.{''} A focus on the institutional architecture of these
   programs can help to predict their efficacy in reducing agency problems.},

Abstract = {This article examines the use of gender in constitutions and its
   significance for gender equality. New democracies, and some older ones,
   are increasingly including gender provisions in their constitutions.
   What is the impact of these provisions on women's political and economic
   status? Does constitutionalizing gender serve to empower women? If so,
   what kinds of provisions have an empowering effect and under what
   conditions? To address these questions, we trace the political use
   (legislation, policy, and judicial interpretation) of gendered
   constitutional provisions in Botswana and South Africa, countries that
   differ substantially with respect to how they have
   ``constitutionalized{''} gender. The case studies demonstrate how
   constitutional provisions provide a legal basis and legitimacy for
   women's rights advocacy and how they influence the content of
   legislation and judicial review of laws and policies.},

Title = {Global fair trade: Humanizing globalization and reintroducing the
   normative to international political economy},
Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Pages = {103-128},
Abstract = {Since the mid-1990s fair trade has gained consumers and public
   attention, but international political economy (IPE) scholars have had
   little to say about this new phenomenon. Since the fair trade concept is
   based on consumer behavior that incorporates moral and ethical choices,
   it cannot easily be explained by mainstream IPE theories which are
   predominantly based on the rational actor model. This paper examines the
   fair trade movement, discusses its history, its impressive growth and
   the ethical and social agenda it promotes. Fair trade is an anomaly that
   cannot be explained by mainstream rationalist ontologies. Instead, the
   authors argue, IPE theories need to consider classical political economy
   works which reveal many valuable insights regarding moral and/or ethical
   concerns. By reintroducing normative considerations fair trade can
   reconnect consumer and producer, move our theories beyond merely
   rationalist ontologies and humanize globalization.},

Abstract = {This case study describes Haiti's transition from the richest colony in
   the New World in the eighteenth century to one of the poorest countries
   in the twentieth century. Large plantations were subdivided into
   subsistence plots in the early nineteenth century, and subsequent
   environmental degradation through deforestation and erosion destroyed
   formerly productive lands. Haiti's precipitous economic decline,
   however, took place after the colonial powers-Spain, France, and the
   United States-had left, most notoriously under the three-decade-long
   rule of the Duvalier family. The Duvaliers feared and persecuted the
   educated elites who might contest their rule, causing an exodus of
   educated Haitians. The Duvaliers' hopes for economic development based
   on tourism, labor-intensive exports, and foreign aid could not keep up
   with population growth. Their overthrow, however, brought political
   instability that undermined hopes for prosperity. Despite a stable
   international security environment, a rich endowment in natural
   resources, and proximity to the U.S. market, Haiti has been unable to
   move beyond a tradition of strongman rule and highly flawed political
   leadership.},

Abstract = {Visions of the post-conflict reintegration process in Sierra Leone as a
   moment of healing, reconstruction, opportunity and rehabilitation do not
   take into account the experience of women and girls who were raped
   during the conflict. For them, the post-conflict period is often
   characterized by trauma, silence and stigmatization. This article
   examines wartime rape in relation to the liberal family model and the
   perception of sex as a `private' social concern rather than a public
   security issue.},

Abstract = {Africa's economic development will result from conscious efforts
   directed towards diversification and increased productivity in its
   low-performing agricultural sector. Technology development, transfer and
   uptake, which are low for now, are indispensible necessities in this
   respect. The purpose of this chapter is to review the characteristics,
   importance, constraints and technology adoption process of African
   agriculture to identify factors that enhance or hinder technology
   uptake. This is with a view to isolating lessons for developers or
   packagers of new agricultural or other technologies for Africa,
   especially nanotechnology and microelectronics which are evolving and
   transformational. The attributes of technologies that have made desired
   impact in African agriculture included cheapness, simplicity,
   observability, visibility of results, usefulness, compatibility with
   existing technologies and farm- or farmer-specific socio-economic or
   socio-cultural conditions. Case studies of the welfare-enhancing impacts
   of adopted agricultural technologies were examined under use of
   fertilizers, improved varieties and biotechnology. Useful lessons for
   development and transfer of nanotechnology and micro-electronics to
   Africa were highlighted.},

Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},

Volume = {15},
Number = {4},
Pages = {565-596},
Abstract = {The aim of this article is to contribute to our understanding of the
   role that political institutions play in the reform processes of
   national corporate governance regimes. I argue that existing theories
   are limited in that they conceive of political institutions' impact on
   corporate governance largely in terms of a deterministic influence on
   the political coalitions that emerge and on the policy outcomes. Based
   on the analysis of the paradigmatic case of a consensual democracy -
   Switzerland - I show that the consensual polity does not directly
   determine the outcome of a reform process, but rather the direction of
   causality between legal changes and changes in practices as well as the
   nature of the changes. Consensual polities require large parliamentary
   majorities for legal change to happen. Therefore, corporate practices
   are likely to change before legal rules and less demanding forms of
   institutional change, such as `layering', are favoured.},

Abstract = {Recent declassifications of the official histories of Central
   Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency activities in the
   Vietnam War give historians a sharper outline of the overall American
   intelligence effort in that conflict and a trove of supporting details.
   While scholars will have to use the new releases with caution, the
   histories (when combined with appraisals from the Armed Services) offer
   glimpses of the scale of the US intelligence program and some of the
   complications that hindered its effectiveness. Two particular features
   stand out when these materials are viewed in conjunction: the
   disconnectedness of the various agencies' and Services' efforts from
   each other (and from decision makers in Washington); and the
   difficulties that all of them had in working with America's South
   Vietnamese allies. The picture emerging is thus one of a congeries of
   largely independent intelligence campaigns working simultaneously
   against the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong targets. Intelligence miscues
   did not lose the Vietnam War for the Americans and South Vietnamese, but
   it now seems clearer that they made victory less likely.},

Abstract = {This article explains Europarties' inability to act and position
   themselves cohesively in EU politics. It develops a theoretical
   framework based mainly on domestic parties' disincentives to agree on a
   common Europarty position. The framework is applied to the case of
   social democracy and fiscal competition. Despite opportunity for
   agreement, (dis)incentives related to self-economic interests and
   domestic institutional settlements (and corresponding electoral
   calculuses) were aggravated by substantive ideological preferences. The
   case implications are drawn on literatures on the national parties'
   general positioning on EU issues as well as on Europarties and the EU
   agenda.},

Abstract = {The notion that the EU is a trade power is central to studies of the
   Union's international presence. Credible threats to withhold access to
   Europe's markets are said to provide the Union with leverage in respect
   of other trade partners. This article queries the continuing ability of
   the European Union to act effectively this way. The current Doha malaise
   is a symptom of deeper changes in the international trade system. As
   emerging markets become more affluent and participate in foreign direct
   investment, their interest in market access per se become less important
   relative to other areas of regulation.},

Abstract = {This paper challenges the views in the fields of International Relations
   and International Law that treat the significance of law in the
   international system solely on the basis of the contemporary context
   marked by the increased institutionalization of world politics. Instead
   of focusing on the relationship between rules and the conduct of actors,
   we conceptualize the co-constitutive relationship between law and
   politics, and incorporate the multiple forms of legal-political
   expression that constitute power relations and dynamics into our
   analysis. Three dimensions of the co-constitutive relations between Law
   and Politics are explored: legal forms, legal constraints, and the
   indeterminacy of law.},

Abstract = {This article examines how family researchers use federal statistics,
   particularly from the U.S. Census, to understand the realities of trends
   concerning the family unit. The article shows that these data have
   helped researchers to understand the major, largely irreversible
   revolution that has taken place in America in the ways that people
   engage in family formation, make interpersonal commitments, and take on
   caregiving obligations. In addition, the article makes clear the
   importance of understanding these changes to make and evaluate policy,
   such as governmental efforts to promote marriage. The article also shows
   the usefulness of federal data in allowing researchers to track the
   development of a new stage of life, termed by some the ``age of
   independence{''} or ``emerging adulthood,{''} and points to the need to
   keep fine-tuning, rethinking, and updating the categories that are being
   measured.},

Journal = {JCMS-JOURNAL OF COMMON MARKET STUDIES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {48},
Number = {3},
Pages = {475-500},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The article investigates the institutional and policy choices regarding
   the EU's relations with the countries and regions covered by the
   European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP). It juxtaposes the notion of special
   relationship inaugurated by the Lisbon Treaty to three models for
   organizing relations with proximate countries: pre-accession, the
   European Economic Area (EEA) and association. The convergence-access
   paradigm is found to be the basic pillar of the EU approach. The article
   brings in a series of dilemmas concerning the design and the
   implementation of the ENP as well as perceptions from selected partner
   countries. As a potential way to manage tensions and dilemmas inherent
   in the EU strategy, the article proposes an altogether novel dimension:
   decentred integration geared towards polity-building that could
   partially delink convergence and access. The last section maps out four
   scenarios for the future directions of the ENP that cover the whole
   continuum from piecemeal enhancement of the policy to the creation of a
   European Partnership Area underpinned by a new tier of institutions.},

   agreement and governments facing domestic constraints are more likely to

   We test this prediction with data from a survey with high-level
   officials from all EU Member States for the case of the negotiations
   concerning the EU Financial Perspective 2007-13. The evidence provides
   support for our argument and casts doubt on studies that suggest either
   that there are no differences in bargaining strategies across EU member
   countries or that the main differences exist between old and new EU

Abstract = {Political dynamics and outcomes around the globe have been transformed
   by globalization, new patterns of human mobility, and the development of
   innovative transnational social networks. These new political processes
   are rooted in communities and networks that are not restricted by
   geographic location. Although politics has been delinked from territory
   in this way with regard to processes and actors, this does not mean that
   transnational politics focuses exclusively on universal issues or global
   approaches to social justice. Rather much of the new transnational
   politics is intensely focused on specific locations, identities, and
   issues (for example, ``globalized{''} neighborhood associations,
   ethnicities, patrimonialism). Transnational politics also includes new
   conceptions and practices of citizenship and accountability (for
   example, legislative seats reserved for expatriate labor migrants) as
   the body politic becomes increasing mobile, political affinities
   delinked from geographic proximity, and critical constituencies reside
   outside of the territory of the state. This article outlines a new
   approach to investigating the actors and processes at the heart of
   contemporary transnational politics, with a particular focus on the ways
   in which diasporas are strategically constructed and mobilized to
   advance political goals through the use of salient symbols, identity
   frames, and social networks.},

Abstract = {This case study describes North Korea's descent from being the most
   industrialized part of the Korean Peninsula to being one of the world's
   poorest countries, with a fraction of the per capita GNP of South Korea.
   The North Korean government inherited a strong sense of nation and
   established strong state institutions, but failed to create prosperity
   over the long run. It rapidly rebuilt the war-damaged Japanese colonial
   infrastructure and outpaced South Korea economically until it fully
   nationalized industry and commerce. It never left a war footing, but
   approached economic development like a military campaign. In a quest for
   economic self-sufficiency, it implemented a succession of multi-year
   plans and collectivized agriculture, but then allowed agriculture and
   light industry to languish to focus on heavy industry. The Kim family
   increasingly ruled through a narrow group of family connections and
   long-time supporters, executing or imprisoning any political opposition.
   The devastating famine of the 1990s led to a reemergence of private
   commerce in daily necessities and increasing seepage of information from
   the outside as Koreans crossed the Chinese border in search of work. The
   regime has floundered for a solution, but resists political
   liberalization, having seen its consequences in the former Soviet Union,
   which collapsed.},

Title = {INTERCULTURAL RELATIONS AND THE DRIVE TO PROSECUTE SEXUAL VIOLENCE
   DURING THE INTERNAL ARMED CONFLICT IN PERU},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL FEMINIST JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {12},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {319-340},
Abstract = {Sexual violence during the Peruvian internal armed conflict has come to
   light through the work of the Peruvian Truth and Reconciliation
   Commission (2001-3) and Peruvian human rights and feminist
   non-governmental organizations (NGOs). This paper examines one feminist
   NGO's response to sexual violence during the internal armed conflict
   (1980-2000) and to their theorizing practices that contribute to the
   construction of a new culture of law. Examining the Study and Defense of
   Women's Rights (DEMUS) project on sexual violence in Manta, Huancavelica
   brings to light the narrow legal, political, socio-cultural and
   linguistic avenues available for addressing this violation. This
   analysis suggests that any effort to address sexual violence during
   internal armed conflict must attend to the legacy of colonialism because
   it undermines the goals of transitional justice by denying the victims
   personhood and circumscribing the conceptual optic through which to
   address human rights violations. DEMUS' project illustrates the
   possibility of transforming the culture of law through an intercultural
   optic that centers the subjectivities of the victims including but not
   limited to victimhood.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL FEMINIST JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {12},
Number = {2},
Pages = {177-201},
Abstract = {Japan's high level of socio-economic advancement notwithstanding, the
   level of women's representation in Japan lags behind that in not only
   other advanced countries but also many developing countries. This
   article aims to elucidate the causes of the under-representation of
   women in Japan. Preceding studies suggest that multiple, intertwining
   factors have had a collective influence on the number of women
   representatives. Based on these studies, I highlight four factors which
   affect women's representation: the electoral system; socio-political
   culture; electoral quotas; and the activities and attitudes of women
   concerning their own representation. I discuss how these factors have
   influenced the under-representation of Japanese women, in effect
   demonstrating that all the above factors have had negative impacts.
   Among these, the most serious obstacle is women's lack of enthusiasm for
   a larger political presence, which is sustained by Japanese political
   culture and social customs. I argue that strong women's voices calling
   for more women representatives are the necessary basis for measures to
   improve the under-representation of women.},

Title = {Interrogating `Gender' in Development Policy and

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL FEMINIST JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Pages = {3-24},
Abstract = {International development institutions have adopted `gender' as a
   fundamental component of any policy, programme or project. However, the
   meaning of this is often far from the original aims of feminists
   fighting for a commitment to more equal gendered power relations and
   social justice. This article offers a detailed study of one particular
   strand of development funding - tourism-based microenterprises - and
   outlines the ways in which `gender' is constructed at three different
   levels: the World Bank, the Honduran government and a tourism
   development project in Copan. It supplements analysis of policy
   documents with the interpretations and perspectives of policy-makers and
   development workers to present a rich empirical picture of the complex
   and sometimes contradictory ways in which gender is understood at all
   stages of the development process. It then uses this analysis to
   demonstrate how these particular interpretations of `gender' influenced
   the outcomes of the project and why it ultimately failed in its goals of
   integrating indigenous women into the process of tourism development.},

Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Pages = {147-164},
Abstract = {This is an article about the outcomes of the mass marketing of retail
   financial products in the USA since the early 1980s. Our aim is to
   change the frame of the debate about the democratisation of finance by
   evaluating the extension of credit and ownership as a major social
   innovation led by profit-seeking retail banks. We focus on privately led
   social innovations of income supplementation through credit and of
   security through property. Put simply, we ask: to what extent has this
   social innovation of credit and ownership released wage and salary
   earners from the tyranny of earned income? To this end we present
   empirical evidence from the United States, which suggests that the
   extension of credit and asset ownership in an unequal society is
   self-defeating because it does not abolish the tyranny of earned income
   and, indeed, it tightens the vice insofar as low-income individuals and
   households accumulate debt but not assets. The implication is that
   finance as privately led social innovation has failed and it is time for
   fundamental rethinking of much that has been taken for granted.},

Abstract = {Human rights and global feminist praxis have enabled important political
   work that addresses the transnational scope of gender violence. While
   the notion of women's human rights has this great positive potential, it
   has also been critiqued by scholars and activists as yet another site
   where uneven, global relationships are perpetuated and where addressing
   a material violence can perpetuate another kind of violence,
   particularly through the discursive act of representing `victims' and
   explaining the causes of human rights violations. For instance, in the
   US, those wishing to seek aid as subjects of sex trafficking must often
   argue their own cultural `backwardness' in order to be legible as
   `legitimate' victims. Through a critical look at US governmental sex
   trafficking documents and legal cases, this work explores how `victims'
   come to be defined and represented through adjudicating discourses; such
   discursive inquiry suggests that the paradox of universality at the
   heart of human rights necessitates more than the strategy of including
   women in order to ensure justice.},

   requirements to kill lawfully, there is a certain degree of convergence
   between them. In order to reach concrete conclusions about cases in
   which the requirements are met simultaneously, various operations of the
   police are assessed. This assessment shows that the requirements can be
   met in various situations by both branches. The most important are when
   the targeted people use firearms - in this case a killing can be
   legitimate. When no firearm is used, it might be indicated that a
   killing is prohibited. Preventing an escape by resorting to lethal force
   can be legitimate if no non-lethal means are available to prevent an
   escape and if it can be presumed that the targeted person would present
   violent behaviour in further situations.},

Title = {Between Euroscepticism and Eurosupport: The Attitudes of Urban and Rural
   Populations in Poland 2000-2008},
Journal = {EUROPE-ASIA STUDIES},

Volume = {62},

Pages = {1503-1525},
Abstract = {Three main factors explain public support for EU membership: utilitarian
   expectations, the role of values and ideas, and class partisanship. In
   the Polish case, public opinion polls and issues more specific to
   Poland, such as the role of the Catholic Church, populist political
   parties and profound Euroscepticism among farmers, suggest that although
   these theoretical explanations overlap, each of them has a different
   explanatory value. The economic approach remains the best predictor of
   support for EU membership, and whereas values and identity are closely
   linked to and dependent upon economic expectations, the impact of
   national politics appears largely decoupled from Polish Euroscepticism.},

Title = {The Effect of Governor Support on Legislative Behaviour in the Russian
   Duma},
Journal = {EUROPE-ASIA STUDIES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {62},

Pages = {125-143},
Abstract = {Until the 2007 Duma election, the Russian polity displayed several
   characteristics that should have allowed regional leaders to have an
   impact on deputies: a federalist system, an electoral system that
   encouraged regional representation, weak political parties, and regional
   leaders with electoral resources. Recent research on Russian
   mixed-member Duma elections argues that governors influenced the
   election of single-member district deputies. This raises the spectre
   that governors could have influenced the behaviour of these deputies.
   Using data from the third post-communist Duma, I demonstrate that
   single-member district deputies backed by regional leaders in the 1999
   Duma election behaved differently from others in two critical areas:
   parliamentary party choice and support for the presidential legislative
   agenda. Governor support did not, however, affect committee choice.},

Abstract = {Safety regulation - in the form of pre-market approval, licensure,
   screening, and product entry limitations - governs numerous market
   realms, including consumer finance. In this article, we ask whether the
   effects of safety regulation go beyond safety and affect consumers'
   beliefs about the distribution of products they can use. We model
   ``approval regulation,{''} where a government regulator must approve the
   market entry of a product based upon observable, unbiased, and
   non-anticipable experiments. We show that even if regulator and firm
   disagree about only quality standards, the disagreement induces the firm
   to provide more information about its product than it would in the
   absence of regulation. Put differently, purely first-order disagreements
   in regulation generate second-order consequences (more certainty about
   product quality). These second-order consequences of regulation are
   sufficient to generate first-order effects among end-users (more
   consumption of superior products), even when users are risk-neutral. In
   other words, even if approval regulation produces little or no
   improvement in safety or quality, it still aggregates information useful
   to ``downstream{''} product users; these users will exhibit higher
   consumption and will more readily switch to superior products. In
   contrast with libertarian analyses of entry regulation and licensure,
   the model predicts that entry restrictions may be associated with
   greater product or service utilization (consumption) as well as with
   greater price sensitivity among consumers. Because contemporary
   cost-benefit analyses ignore these second-order effects, they are
   unlikely to capture the possible confidence effects of approval
   regulation.},

Abstract = {Structures of employment in low-wage industries, a diminished wage and
   hour inspectorate, and an unworkable immigration regime have combined to
   create an environment where violations of basic workplace laws are
   everyday occurrences. This article identifies four ``logics{''} of
   detection and enforcement, arguing that there is a mismatch between the
   enforcement strategies of most federal and state labor inspectorates and
   the industries in which noncompliance continues to be a problem. In
   response, the authors propose augmenting labor inspectorates by giving
   public interest groups like unions and worker centers a formal, ongoing
   role in enforcement in low-wage sectors. In three case studies, the
   authors present evidence of an emergent system-one that harkens back to
   a logic proposed by the drafters of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)
   but never implemented-of empowering those closest to the action to work
   in partnership with government.},

Abstract = {This article argues that Africa's development rests not on aid, but on
   three key pillars: knowledge, entrepreneurship, and governance. Africa
   needs to think outside of the box when establishing these pillars.
   However, to make these three levers work, a change in mindset is a
   prerequisite. Africa has to start dreaming big dreams that empower it to
   see long-term. Africa must restructure societies so that networks beyond
   closed ethnic networks are more prominent. The larger social capital
   that will result will build a foundation for development. Africa also
   needs to incorporate new actors in its development agenda, including
   faith-based organizations, the diaspora, and the business class; and it
   must encourage immigrant entrepreneurs, especially Asians, to come in as
   chase rabbits. Better governance will come from the transformation of
   people from subjects to citizens. For success in international trade,
   Africa needs to learn the lessons of the Savannah, where the effective
   pack is the king.},

Abstract = {In this article we examine how post-industrial Britain and Denmark
   undertake vocational training for low-skilled retail workers.
   Specifically, we evaluate whether leaders in training skilled industrial
   workers are also doing the best job with low-skilled service workers.
   While Danish retail is increasingly becoming a haven for low-skilled
   workers, British workers are gaining in skills levels with the
   transition to services even in the retail sector. While some suggest
   that social democratic countries have sacrificed the political interests
   of low-skilled workers in order to protect core manufacturing workers,
   we find no evidence of this. Rather, the high expectations of vocational
   training in Denmark have forged barriers to the easy admission of
   low-skilled service workers, while the British system provides more
   entry points for vocational training at different levels. The structures
   of coordination that had narrowed the gap between white-collar and
   blue-collar manufacturing workers during the industrial age are creating
   new cleavages in the post-industrial economy.},

Abstract = {Federal statistical agencies are funded and supervised by elected and
   appointed politicians. What counts as politial interference is not
   self-evident. This article offers a working definition of interference,
   emphasizing the importance of an agency offering its best judgment
   regarding accurate measurement of a given phenomenon, its ability to
   apply state-of-the-art science in that measurement, and its protection
   from preclearance of the resulting statistical product. Interference is
   indicated by efforts to shape statistical products to achieve political
   advantage. Statistical adjustment to correct the differential undercount
   in the decennial census is used to illustrate political interference.},

Abstract = {Peter Gabriel and other allies created WITNESS nearly 20 years ago -
   shortly after the Rodney King incident in Los Angeles. At the time, our
   founders asked: `What if every human rights worker had a camera in their
   hands? What would they be able to document? What would they be able to
   change?' Since 1992 WITNESS has engaged with the risks, opportunities
   and possibilities for action that emerge from the power of moving images
   - training and supporting human rights activists worldwide to create
   real change through our methodology of `video advocacy'. Yet now an
   increasing number of people worldwide have cameras. Participants,
   witnesses and perpetrators are all filming. Videos (particularly mobile
   video) make it possible to document and publicize human rights struggles
   - from monks marching for freedom in Rangoon and the election protestors
   in Tehran, to individual voices speaking out against injustice on
   YouTube. However, despite the growing online circulation of images of
   human rights violations, of victims and survivors, there is limited
   discussion of crucial safety, consent and ethical concerns -
   particularly for people who are filmed. Issues around consent,
   representation and re-victimization and retaliation have emerged even
   more clearly in an open and networked online environment. Video is being
   reworked, remixed and recirculated by many more people. New
   possibilities for action by a global citizenry have arisen, but these
   carry with them real dangers. The human rights and technology
   communities can help lead the way in confronting these challenges. The
   article concludes with suggestions for approaches based on norms,
   technology solutions, and other ideas that could be deployed to begin to
   address these emerging issues.},

Abstract = {Principal-agent analyses of delegation to international organizations
   have advanced our understanding of international cooperation through
   institutions. However, broader tests of why and when states delegate are
   not possible without a clear means for objectively identifying and
   measuring delegation. This paper develops a metric for delegation based
   upon the services the agent provides to its principals and the resources
   and autonomy it has to provide those services. This numerical metric is
   continuous and generalizable to a wide variety of principal-agent
   relationships. This paper then demonstrates the face validity of the
   measure with case studies of delegation to the International Atomic
   Energy Agency (IAEA) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The
   paper concludes with a test of Realist and Institutionalist hypotheses
   for cooperation using the delegation metric, demonstrating the
   complexity of the underlying reasons we observe delegation.},

Title = {Contested hybridization of regulation: Failure of the Dutch regulatory
   system to protect minors from harmful media},
Journal = {REGULATION \& GOVERNANCE},

Abstract = {The hybridization of regulatory modes and instruments is currently a
   popular way to improve public regulation. However, it is still unclear
   whether combinations of hard law and soft law, co-regulation, and
   legally enforced self-regulation really make regulation more effective.
   Using the analytical framework of the ``really responsive regulation{''}
   approach, in this article we explore effectiveness problems in a hybrid
   regulatory system that tries to protect minors from harmful media. In
   our analysis of low compliance rates in the context of system failures,
   we argue that effectiveness problems seem to arise from poorly informed
   staff members, lack of internal and external controls, low rule
   enforcement, insufficient overlap between public and private interests,
   poor social responsibility in the Dutch media sector, deficiencies in
   the institutional framework, an inconsistent regulatory strategy, and
   inadequate responses from responsible regulators. Furthermore, based on
   our case study we argue that institutional dynamics of standard-setting
   activities can be detrimental to regulatory goal achievement if there is
   no compensation at the systemic level. Ongoing ``regulatory care{''}
   through control, corrective responses, and rule enforcement seems to be
   crucial for a hybrid regulatory system to perform well.},

Abstract = {Conceptualizations of cyberspace security can be divided into two
   related dimensions, articulated as ``risks{''}: risks to the physical
   realm of computer and communication technologies (risks to cyberspace);
   and risks that arise from cyberspace and are facilitated or generated by
   its technologies, but do not directly target the infrastructures per se
   (risks through cyberspace). There is robust international consensus,
   growing communities of practice, and an emerging normative regime around
   risks to cyberspace. This is less the case when it comes to risks
   through cyberspace. While states do collaborate around some policy
   areas, cooperation declines as the object of risk becomes politically
   contestable and where national interests vary widely. These include the
   nature of political opposition and the right to dissent or protest,
   minority rights and independence movements, religious belief, cultural
   values, or historical claims. The contrast between the domains has led
   to contradictory tendencies and paradoxical outcomes.},

Abstract = {Increasingly, the categories of professionalism are being employed to
   describe human rights work. Within the broader category of `human rights
   professionals', a significant sub-group, that of field-based human
   rights staff of intergovernmental organizations, has been subject to
   particular scrutiny. This article explores issues of the
   professionalization of this group, while drawing implications for all
   human rights field workers. Following a brief overview of the history of
   human rights field operations, the question is raised: what is at stake
   in a process of professionalization? Next, it is asked whether those
   components identified as central to the development of a profession -
   shared values, a body of scientific knowledge, and procedures and
   systems to apply that knowledge - exist in a reasonably welldefined form
   with reference to human rights work. We then take stock of the extent to
   which these components have come together in generating an actual sense
   of professional identity and a culture of professionalism. In
   conclusion, some remaining challenges are identified and suggestions are
   made for measures that may contribute to reinforcing the existing
   momentum and further consolidating the profession.},

Abstract = {Economic zones are facing difficulties to control their endogenous
   process of technology creation. Technology poverty does exist. How to
   ensure that fragile economic zones become more resilient in capturing
   technology? How to achieve a competitive advantage in non-agile
   economies and get a larger category of their populations benefit from
   it? These challenges have taken all serious developmentalists by storm.
   Unfortunately, the so-called `technology transfer' does not yield to the
   outcomes it promotes resulting to mitigated results in non-agile
   countries. This chapter argues that in an unpredictable and changing
   environment, technology diffusion is part of a complex change process
   which needs to be dealt with in a comprehensive manner. It cannot take
   place without revisiting the capability formation dilemma in non-agile
   economies. The technology-driven capability should therefore be
   supported by strategic policies and public private institutions.
   Technology diffusion may appear as the systemic link between shared
   wealth creation and collective efficiency.},

Abstract = {On the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human
   Rights, feminists are at a critical juncture to re-envision and
   re-engage in a politics of human rights that underscores the creative
   displays of grassroots resistance by women globally and affirms
   transnational feminist solidarity. In highlighting feminisms and human
   rights that are antiracist and social justice oriented, this issue
   highlights new research that reveals the transformative potential of a
   feminist human rights praxis that embraces collective justice. In this
   introduction, we discuss dominant critiques of human rights frameworks
   and explore critical human rights activism `from below' in order to
   establish the context for this special issue on new directions in
   feminism and human rights.},

Abstract = {The EU, as is commonly held, is a different form of political rule: a
   polity based on rationality and functional interests, not emotional
   appeals. Without reference to the narrative of the nation or the state,
   the question emerges as to whether the European Union needs or has
   myths? If it does, what are they and how successful have they been? The
   aim of this article - indeed of the special issue - is to explore the
   role of political myth in creating normative and cognitive foundations
   for governing in the EU and to examine whether these are applicable to
   the case of the European Union.},

Title = {Industrial Restructuring in Romania from a Bilateral Trade Perspective:
   Manufacturing Exports to the EU from 1995 to 2006},
Journal = {EUROPE-ASIA STUDIES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {62},
Number = {5},
Pages = {779-805},
Abstract = {The article presents an analysis of changes in the volume, structure and
   quality of Romanian manufacturing exports to the EU since 1995 in order
   to determine the nature and extent of industrial restructuring in
   Romania. We argue that the observed five-fold increase in the volume of
   manufactured exports from Romania to the EU over more than a decade-long
   period, although it is a positive development, still hides a persistent
   reliance upon labour-intensive and low value-added products. Only
   towards the end of the examined period have Romania's export patterns
   begun to resemble those of the more advanced Central and East European
   countries, reflecting the more important role played by intra-industry
   exports of differentiated products, the gradual transition from labour
   intensive, low valued-added exports to more technology-intensive ones
   and the improvement in product quality.},

Title = {The Performance of Liquidity in the Subprime Mortgage Crisis},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Pages = {71-89},
Abstract = {`Liquidity' is highly significant to representations of the crisis that
   gripped financial markets from the summer of 2007. A wide-ranging
   `liquidity crisis' is typically traced to the collapse of prices in
   markets for assets backed by or derived from the repayments of American
   subprime mortgagors, while public authorities are said to have responded
   by `restoring liquidity' to markets in these now `distressed' and `toxic
   assets'. Here the category of performativity is developed to enable a
   critical investigation of liquidity. The performance of liquidity in
   booming subprime markets is shown to have turned on the affirmation and
   exemplification of wider norms present in wholesale asset markets, and
   upon specific calculative and emotional valuations of risk through
   underwriting procedures, bond rating and hedging. However, the
   performance of liquidity contained its other, illiquidity, and this
   surfaced in subprime markets because asset prices symbolised risk
   valuations which could not capture incalculable future uncertainties. As
   the crisis broke, talk of liquidity and illiquidity licensed particular
   policy responses and closed down wider political debate.},

Booktitle = {NATION BUILDING, STATE BUILDING, AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT: CASE STUDIES
   AND COMPARISONS},
Year = {2010},
Pages = {85-100},
Abstract = {This case study shows how national integration was hindered by the
   Soviet decision to make nations and nationalities the basis for the many
   republics forming the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) or
   Soviet Union. When the strong center disappeared in 1991, the Soviet
   empire fractured along these national lines. This study describes the
   political and economic model developed by Lenin and Stalin that so
   influenced economic and political development throughout the world.
   Lenin created the original one-party state in which a vanguard political
   party oversaw a social revolution. He fostered worker management of
   enterprises and assumed a confluence of state, worker, and nationality
   interests that would mean that both nationalities and the state would
   ultimately wither away. Stalin greatly centralized power through the
   collectivization of agriculture, the nationalization of industry and
   commerce, the development of five-year economic plans, and the
   introduction of forced-draft industrialization that transferred
   agricultural resources to industry. This had the unintended consequence
   of creating a state based on patronage, which in turn fed corruption and
   constrained economic development. Stalin's reliance on terror to impose
   his will contributed to these problems.},

Abstract = {This article reports on a survey examining sources of income and their
   effects on the mental health and subjective quality of life of residents
   in nine rural Russian regions. Using conventional measures of depressed
   mood and respondents' assessments of the quality of their lives in
   different domains, the authors find that the emergence of a mixed
   economy, that generates income from salary and wages and household
   enterprises, as well as government transfers, has produced
   differentiation in the subjective psychological as well as material
   quality of rural residents' lives.},

Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {17},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {762-790},
Abstract = {One of the most dramatic instances of international market regulation in
   the twentieth century was the adoption of a multilateral, enforceable,
   intellectual property protection regime at the end of the Uruguay Round
   of trade negotiations in 1994. The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of
   Intellectual Property (TRIPS) ushered in a new era of high standards of
   intellectual property protection, requiring profound and costly domestic
   institutional changes in many, many countries. International market
   regulation has increasingly penetrated domestic regulatory environments
   in ways that have compromised domestic political bargains. Historical
   institutionalism can help to explain the emergence of a global regime
   for intellectual property protection as a product of institutional
   change in the US. Historical institutionalism provides a lens to examine
   the directly political (rather than technocratic or efficiency
   maximizing) processes establishing domestic and international power
   relations.},

Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {17},
Number = {3},
Pages = {562-588},
Abstract = {This paper engages in a preliminary examination of US antidumping
   actions against China and addresses the conditions under which US
   industries are likely to initiate antidumping petitions against Chinese
   firms and obtain affirmative antidumping rulings from regulatory
   authorities. We conjecture that China's accession into the World Trade
   Organization (WTO) has not enhanced the prospect of Chinese firms
   successfully defending themselves against antidumping suits initiated by
   the US for three reasons. First, the rather dramatic expansion in
   US-China trade and, in particular, in US imports from China, has led US
   antidumping authorities to more aggressively pursue antidumping cases
   against China. Second, WTO membership has resulted in increasing US
   investment in China, thus undercutting the competitive advantage of some
   small domestic firms relative to those that have invested in the Chinese
   market, and leading the former to lobby more rigorously for protection
   from Chinese imports. Third, as China has agreed to the non-market
   economy (NME) designation in antidumping investigations for up to 15
   years upon accession, its NME status has led US antidumping authorities
   to apply more stringent criteria in antidumping investigations. We
   support our argument with statistical analyses of the pattern of US
   antidumping initiation and adjudication against China.},

   based on the perceived and practical relationships of Africans with each

   continent, the author proposes both intellectual and pragmatic steps for
   continental integration. Using concrete examples, as well as generative

   the creation of a new ethic of politics, this article seeks to advance a

Abstract = {Most studies of truth commissions assert their positive role in
   improving human rights. A first wave of research made these claims based
   on qualitative analysis of a single truth commission or a small number
   of cases. Thirty years of experience with truth commissions and dozens
   of examples allow cross-national statistical studies to assess these
   findings. Two recent studies undertake that project. Their findings,
   which are summarized in this article, challenge the prevailing view that
   truth commissions foster human rights, showing instead that commissions,
   when used alone, tend to have a negative impact on human rights. Truth
   commissions have a positive impact, however, when used in combination
   with trials and amnesties. This article extends the question of whether
   truth commissions improve human rights to how, when and why they succeed
   or fail in doing so. It presents a `justice balance' explanation,
   whereby commissions, incapable of promoting stability and accountability
   on their own, contribute to human rights improvements when they
   complement and enhance amnesties and prosecutions. The article draws on
   experiences in Brazil, Chile, Nepal, South Korea and South Africa to
   illustrate the central argument.},

Abstract = {The authors examine the impact of remittances on the schooling of
   children in various Haitian communities with a high incidence of
   out-migration. After addressing the endogeneity of remittance receipt,
   they find that, in some communities, remittances raise school attendance
   for all children regardless of whether they have household members
   abroad. However, in other communities, this effect is observed only
   among children living in households that do not experience any family
   out-migration. Hence, while the receipt of remittances by the household
   lifts budget constraints and raises the children's likelihood of being
   schooled, the disruptive effect of household out-migration imposes an
   economic burden on the remaining household members and reduces
   children's school attendance. As such, remittances ameliorate the
   negative disruptive effect of household out-migration on children's
   schooling in some migrating communities in Haiti and, therefore,
   contribute to the accumulation of human capital in the midst of extreme
   poverty.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {4},
Number = {2},
Pages = {230-250},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The international community accepts that peace, justice and development
   are indivisible properties of human freedom and thus wants a more
   coordinated approach to postconflict recovery. Today, transitions to
   democracy are typically launched through constitutional negotiations and
   anchored in efforts to fix broken state institutions or create new ones.
   These are settled strategies for addressing the social and economic
   causes of conflict in troubled societies. Transitional justice (TJ) has
   been slow to appreciate or capitalize on the inherent potential of these
   political processes to further justice and peace. By not taking a wider
   view of the opportunities for change that are presented by the
   transitional moment, TJ limits its capacity to construct the
   institutions that must work if a return to conflict is to be prevented.
   With this in mind, prominent practitioners have begun to look at how to
   extend TJ's brief to include a wider set of issues linked to social
   justice. They are also looking for concepts and tools to bridge the
   divide between the field and related disciplines. This article presents
   South Africa's transition as a case study of this wider view and is
   written from the perspective of a practitioner who was involved in
   building the postapartheid democratic state. It aims to contribute to
   the current debate about TJ's stake in postconflict transitions.},

   regulation for HIV/AIDS pharmaceuticals in India and Brazil},

Abstract = {While both India and Brazil are seriously affected by the HIV/AIDS
   epidemic, each country has chosen a different approach to providing
   affordable pharmaceutical treatment. Whereas the Indian government has
   paved the way for market-driven solutions, Brazilian public authorities
   are strongly involved in the research and production of HIV/AIDS
   medication. Brazilian regulations permit comprehensive and free
   provision of HIV/AIDS drugs, whereas the majority of the affected
   population in India does not receive adequate pharmaceutical treatment.
   To explain the different policy outputs, we draw on the developmental
   state literature. Efficient decisionmaking structures, a devoted
   bureaucracy, and effective policy instruments enable public authorities
   to provide public goods even in the context of relative scarcity. We
   show that the assumptions of developmental state theory have to be
   complemented by the assessment of civil society actors' potential to
   trigger governmental interventions in the market.},

Abstract = {Like it or not, the European Union, in the wake of Lisbon, has become an
   international actor. It now faces two major external challenges. The
   first is to develop a strategic vision for a potentially tumultuous
   emerging multi-polar world. The European Council's December 2008 `Report
   on the Implementation of the European Security Strategy' recognized
   that, over the last five years, the threats facing the EU had become
   `increasingly complex', that `we must be ready to shape events {[}by]
   becoming more strategic in our thinking'. The second challenge is to
   help nudge the other major actors towards a multilateral global grand
   bargain. Such a bargain will be the necessary outcome of the transition
   from a US-dominated post-1945 liberal world order, towards a new
   21st-century order accommodating the rising powers and sensitive to the
   needs of the global south. Without such a comprehensive and co-operative
   bargain, the emerging multi-polar world will be rife with tensions and
   highly conflict-prone.},

Title = {Second Among Unequals? A Study of Whether France's ``Quota Women{''} are
   Up to the Job},
Journal = {POLITICS \& GENDER},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Pages = {93-118},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The introduction of France's ``parity{''} law in 2000 raised fears of
   electing inferior women candidates via a gender quota. France has since
   held two legislative elections, with the proportion of women in
   parliament rising from 10.9\% to 12.3\% in 2002, and 18.5\% in 2007.
   These rises permit an empirical evaluation of whether ``quota women{''}
   measure up to those elected without a quota. New women parliamentarians
   are compared to their male counterparts and to women elected before 2002
   to see whether there are any noticeable differences in their background
   (profession, age, and prior experience) and their levels of
   parliamentary activity (including numbers of bills, reports, and
   questions introduced).
   The findings challenge the notion that parity is producing weak
   politicians. The slightly different profiles of men and women
   politicians reflect wider barriers to women's political careers that
   would not have been overcome without the parity law. Once women are
   elected, the volume of activity shows no evidence of being gendered,
   suggesting that women are as effective in the job as men. These findings
   imply that sex is a barrier to entry but not to performance, reinforcing
   claims for the use of quotas to overcome entry barriers and negating
   claims that quotas produce second-rate parliamentarians.},

Abstract = {This article examines the design of evaluations in settings where there
   is a choice as to how an intervention is to be introduced and evaluated.
   It uses data from a supervision program for offenders on probation in
   the UK (Bruce and Hollin forthcoming) that had been indicated by a pilot
   evaluation in one probation area to merit wider-scale implementation and
   evaluation. For the remaining two probation areas in the region, a
   randomized controlled allocation of participants to conditions was
   recommended. One of the areas adopted a stepped wedge design, in which
   probation offices were randomly allocated sequentially to the program.
   The second area opted to launch the program across the whole area
   simultaneously, with a retrospective sample as control group. The
   article compares the results of implementation in each probation area
   and seeks to draw wider inferences about the management of program
   implementation and the randomized controlled designs appropriate for
   similar field studies.},

Abstract = {This article proposes to apply a praxeological approach to study
   contemporary constitutionalism. The approach is conceptualized following
   critical constructivist research on constitutionalism that focuses on
   experience and expectation when studying the contested meaning of norms
   in international relations. It argues that the concept of memory offers
   an important view on the language-based concept of experience which
   extends beyond the confines of behavioural approaches that study
   habitual change with regard to norms. The article offers a conceptual
   discussion of approaches to constitutionalism, emphasizing the
   distinction between modern and contemporary constitutionalism and their
   respective foci on regulatory versus cultural practices, introduces a
   praxeological dimension of horizons and elaborates on political memory
   and myth as concepts of functional memory.},

Journal = {REGULATION \& GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {4},
Number = {4},
Pages = {485-506},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Regulators in different countries and domains experiment with regulatory
   tools that allow organizations to adapt regulation to their individual
   circumstances, while holding them accountable for their self-regulation
   systems. Several labels have been coined for this type of regulation,
   including systems-based regulation, enforced self-regulation,
   management-based regulation, principles-based regulation, and
   meta-regulation. In this article, these forms of regulatory governance
   are classified as belonging to one family of ``process-oriented
   regulation.{''} Based on a review of diverse empirical and theoretical
   research, it is suggested that the family of process-oriented regulation
   tends to have a positive, albeit varied, impact on organizations'
   performance, and the factors that shape this inconsistent effect are
   analyzed. Building on aspects of Parker's normative construct of
   ``meta-regulation,{''} the article explores the extent to which her
   innovative notion of a learning-oriented approach to regulation might
   overcome some of the weaknesses of prevalent process-oriented
   approaches. It is proposed that under conditions of regulatory
   uncertainty or entrenched and prevalent non-compliance or both,
   meta-regulation is likely to have many advantages over other forms of
   process-oriented regulation. Yet realizing these advantages requires a
   rare combination of high regulatory capacity, a stable regulatory
   agenda, and a supportive political environment.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to expose some limitations of dominant discourses
   about European integration. It argues that the attempt to move towards a
   more federalist Europe underpinned by the ideal of `post-national
   citizenship' (Habermas) is both unrealistic and undesirable. The
   populism and ethno-centric nationalism endangering the European project
   emerged in Europe not despite the cosmopolitan agendas of its elites,
   but arguably, in response to their ambitious agendas. A more realistic
   view on nationalism is imperative for a better understanding of European
   integration; one capable of addressing the appeal of populist politics.},

Abstract = {Cambodia's trials of the leaders of the Khmer Rouge raise the question
   of whether this process of historical accountability will have a broader
   impact on Cambodian political culture. A reasonable hypothesis is that
   the trials will restore Cambodians' faith in the rule of law, a faith
   undermined by the failure of the state to take action against the
   miscreants for 30 years. Based on a 2007 nationally representative
   survey - conducted well before the trials began - the authors find that
   Cambodians hold a strong preference for strict adherence to legal
   universalism. Because support for the rule of law is so strong, the
   trials are unlikely to make it stronger. Understanding transitional
   justice processes requires that the state of society prior to the
   implementation of justice processes be understood so that change can be
   measured. Moreover, cultural values may be just as likely to be causes
   of transitional justice processes as results.},

Abstract = {An indicator can be defined as a statistic used as part of an assessment
   exercise. There have been three relatively distinct waves of interest in
   indicators at the national level. Indicator work creates both
   opportunities and hazards for federal statistical agencies. Indicators
   not only increase the accessibility of federal statistics but also
   expose statistical agencies to charges of partisanship that can
   jeopardize both the credibility of their products and the agencies'
   abilities to accomplish their core mission of collecting data from an
   increasingly wary public. Managing the tension between the scientific
   and political dimensions of indicator work involves acknowledging the
   value-laden nature of indicator development and establishing a clear
   division of labor, with political entities assuming responsibility for
   grappling with the most obviously normative issues and statistical
   agencies limiting their involvement in such work to the provision of
   statistical scientific expertise.},

Volume = {48},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {After the enlargement of 2004, the European Union (EU) has introduced an
   open-ended framework for accession negotiations. Although the ultimate
   aim is still to ensure the integration of candidate countries, the
   timing and modality of membership is not guaranteed in advance. This
   article utilizes a political economy model to demonstrate that
   open-ended accession negotiations would lead to suboptimal outcomes in
   the form of inadequate convergence reforms undertaken in the candidate
   country and poor membership prospect offered by the EU. This analytical
   finding is compatible with and can be useful in understanding the
   dynamics of deteriorating reform output in Turkey and weakening EU
   commitment to Turkish membership since the start of the open-ended
   accession negotiations process in 2005. Two necessary conditions must be
   satisfied to overcome such adverse outcomes in the enlargement process:
   (i) the EU and the accession country must renew their commitments to
   reform and integration through a new political bargain; and (ii) they
   should follow this bargain with periodic summits for co-ordinating their
   commitments in the face of shocks to, or emerging deadlocks in, the
   process of open-ended accession negotiations.},

Abstract = {Perceptions of the EU tend to be studied by examining responses to
   targeted opinion polls. This paper looks instead at how citizens draw
   Europe into a wider discussion of politics and political problems. Based
   on a series of group discussions with taxi-drivers in Britain, Germany
   and the Czech Republic, it examines the motifs speakers use to explain
   the origins of problems, the assumptions they make about their
   susceptibility to address, and how, when these patterned ways of
   speaking are applied to the EU, they serve to undermine its credibility
   as a positive source of political agency.},

Title = {The Cumulative Causation of International Migration in Latin America},

Abstract = {The theory of the cumulative causation of migration posits that as
   migratory experience grows within a sending community, the likelihood
   that other community members will initiate a migratory trip increases.
   This diffusion is expected to vary across time and place according to
   differences in the mechanisms guiding this behavior. The author compares
   the effect of the prevalence of migratory experience on the likelihood
   that adult men would take a first U.S. trip between 1965 and 2001 from
   the Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, Mexico, Nicaragua, and Puerto Rico.
   Both the consistencies and inconsistencies among countries suggest that
   the cumulative causation of migration is an important dynamic in
   perpetuating migration, although it does not contribute equally to all
   migration streams. In all countries except Nicaragua, as more members of
   a community gain U.S. migration experience, other nonmigrant community
   members are increasingly likely to take a first U.S. trip. In Nicaragua,
   U.S. migration was mainly driven by the Contra War and U.S. political
   asylum extended during that time.},

   integrating participatory methods into human rights-based research. It
   describes the development of a participatory action research approach

   grounded in human rights and community participation. It reflects the
   principles of anti-oppressive social work and the ethics of undertaking
   research with vulnerable populations. In line with other contributions

   does knowledge about the story come from and how is it passed on?';
   `What spurs ethical thinking at an individual and organizational
   level?'; and `How can ethical sensitivity and strategic effectiveness be
   combined?'},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL FEMINIST JOURNAL OF POLITICS},

Pages = {25-44},
Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to examine the gendered politics of
   social work in the Indian city of Mumbai, locating it in a post-colonial
   context. In order to do this secondary sources are examined along with
   empirical data collected by the authors. These are interpreted through
   the framework of a social constructionist methodology that draws on
   political sociology as well as elements of post-colonial theory and
   Foucauldian post-structuralism in order to acknowledge agency within a
   `location' marked by both constraints and opportunities. The article
   explores the circumstances in which politicians and administrators find
   themselves in Mumbai. In considering gender and developing a strategy of
   what we term ` political essentialism', it is shown that those involved
   have been drawing on experiences in civil society and using imagined
   dualisms of gender to position themselves as shapers of social work in
   Mumbai.},

Abstract = {This analysis draws on data from a survey of women in English-speaking
   Canada to examine whether early exposure to politics in the home can
   counteract the effects of female socialization. We examine the effect of
   parents' political activity on their adult daughters' interest in
   politics, political knowledge, and participation in both electoral
   (e.g., party membership and voting) and nonelectoral (e.g.,
   demonstrations and political consumerism) forms of political action. We
   find that a politically active mother can have a role-model effect (net
   of other factors, such as education and age, that might affect a woman's
   level of political engagement) and that her influence outweighs that of
   a politically active father.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the content and nature of American intelligence
   with regard to Finland in 1941-1944. The significance of intelligence
   was that it supported connections between the United States and Finland
   at a time when both external and internal circumstances inhibited the
   functioning of normal state to state relations between the two nations.
   The evolution of wartime conditions guided the interests of American
   intelligence. The main conclusion is that American intelligence in
   Finland can be interpreted as communication on multiple levels between
   two states.},
