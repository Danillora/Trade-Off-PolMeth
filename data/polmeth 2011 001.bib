Abstract = {Research on state-business relations has traditionally focused on
   business associations' lobbying activities. However, as these
   organizations started to assume a more active role in their country's
   economic life, scholars began to look at another distinct role of
   business associations: their formal participation in policy making. This
   article examines to what extent Turkish business associations are taking
   part in the foreign economic policy-making process, which, in turn,
   leads to two sub-questions: (1) Through what kind of mechanisms is a
   pattern of interaction established between the state and the business
   associations? (2) Does the state transfer a part of its administrative
   functions to the private sector? This article examines the institutional
   setting established during the liberalization wave of the 1980s and has
   gradually evolved up to the present, through which the state has
   maintained its role as the policy maker yet has allowed the private
   sector to play a role in the process because it is deemed to be capable
   of administering specific functions more efficiently than the state.},

Abstract = {Instead of supporting the use of one standardized data set as proposed
   by Coe and Neumann, this response argues that scholars should continue
   to be required to construct arguments and offer justifications for what
   they are examining when they say they are analyzing presidential
   discourse, regardless of methodology. Two reasons are offered for this
   position. First, presidential communication is inherently difficult to
   define and/or delimit. Second, scholars of presidential discourse should
   be wary of the possible creation of a new ``canon{''} within their
   object of study. The response concludes by suggesting that even if Coe
   and Neumann's argument is persuasive to readers, we should be careful
   about promoting one data set over other possibilities. Our individual
   research questions should set the parameters for the data sets we use,
   and scholarship on presidential discourse only benefits from continued
   argumentation about what it is, why it matters, and how it might be best
   understood.},

Abstract = {Having two votes for the same election or two simultaneous elections
   with different electoral systems provides a golden opportunity to
   ascertain the impact of the electoral system and to sort out the
   relative magnitude of mechanical and psychological effects on parties
   and voters. The authors propose a new methodology for estimating such
   effects and apply that methodology to 13 elections, 9 in Switzerland and
   4 in Japan. The authors find mechanical effects to dominate in half of
   the elections examined, most particularly in the more recent Swiss
   elections. They discuss the implications of these findings.},

Abstract = {Hungary has always been an integral part of Europe. Since 2004, it has
   been a member of the European Union. Among the general population,
   awareness of being citizens of Europe is weak; within the political
   class, there is a lack of expertise and readiness to focus intensively
   on European politics. The executive, however, successfully organized
   Hungary's EU presidency in the first half of 2011. The results are
   ambivalent: the Roma strategy is positive. But among the European
   public, the presidency was a debacle. The dispute over the media law and
   the new constitution cast a shadow on the presidency. Indeed, the path
   Hungary pursues in domestic policy will decide its future position in
   the EU as well.},

Abstract = {This research note describes the population of the French members of the
   Assemblee Nationale (deputies) from the beginning of the Fifth Republic.
   Through a statistical analysis of the makeup of 13 legislatures (from
   1958 to 2007), it, on the one hand, provides a portrait of the deputies,
   and, on the other hand, describes the evolution over time of the
   deputies. At first glance, it appears that the presence of women in the
   Assemblee Nationale is quite recent and, second, that the generational
   effects are more or less linked to political alternations. Third,
   despite the progressive disappearance of certain professions, the
   socio-professional structure is particularly stable, and, fourth, the
   renewal of deputies is very circumstantial. Finally, they rarely abandon
   office during their term in legislature.},

Volume = {34},

Abstract = {This article poses the question of whether reform politicians' pursuit
   of institutional goods may, under certain circumstances, lead to the
   creation of inefficient political institutions. The theory of weakening
   political actors through the creation of inefficient political
   institutions, as elaborated by Terry M. Moe, is applied in a comparative
   analysis of two main elements in the recent Danish administrative
   reform: the consolidation of 270 municipalities into 98 larger ones, and
   the creation of five new macro regions with special responsibilities. In
   contrast to the coherent institutional structure of the municipalities,
   the level of coherence in the regional reform elements is inappropriate
   and inefficient. The article shows that the different institutions in
   the municipalities and the regions can be interpreted as an attempt by
   the (national) reform parties to prevent other political actors from
   gaining access to future substantial, as well as institutional, goods.},

   Property},
Journal = {POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {39},
Number = {6},
Pages = {724-748},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {What, if any, is the problem with treating bodies as objects or
   property? Is there a defensible basis for seeing bodies as different
   from ``other{''} material resources? Or is thinking the body special a
   kind of sentimentalism that blocks clear thinking about matters such as
   prostitution, surrogate motherhood, and the sale of spare kidneys? I
   argue that the language we use does matter, and that thinking of the
   body as property encourages a self/body dualism that obscures the power
   relations involved in all contracts that cedes authority over the body.
   Recognising the self as embodied, however, also makes it harder to
   insist on sharp distinctions between activities that involve the body
   and those that ``just{''} involve the mind, hence harder to justify
   refusing payment for explicitly body services while condoning it for
   those to which the body is more incidental. I therefore provide a modest
   defence of monetary compensation for those who ``donate{''} bodily
   products or services. Compensation does not, however, mean markets for
   there is at least one sense in which the body is special. This is that
   more so, and more intrinsically than other markets, markets in body
   parts or bodily services depend on inequality. I use this to make a case
   against such markets.},

Abstract = {Although previous research has suggested that the opposition's ability
   to form pre-electoral coalitions (PECs) in authoritarian elections is
   crucial for the electoral outcome, little has been written about why and
   when such coalitions are formed. The aim of this article is to fill this
   empirical and theoretical gap. A theory that combines oppositional
   parties' office- and policy-gaining potential when creating such
   coalitions is proposed. The article utilizes a unique database of 111
   competitive authoritarian elections and provides a representative sample
   of strategically chosen cases. It is shown that, coalitions are more
   likely when structural conditions favor oppositional victories and when
   oppositional parties have a distinctive policy agenda in relation to the
   incumbent government. These factors are shown to be more important than
   electoral institutions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This paper reviews the arms trafficking in Colombia taking into account
   three components. The first one, the origin of the traffic, where the
   arms come from, and the context that allows the existence of a stock of
   the black market of arms. The second one describes the possible routes
   used by the traffickers. To finalize, this paper identifies the
   destination of the arms smuggling in Colombia.},

Abstract = {The present paper proposes to analyze the possible meanings in which the
   ancient Stoa has thought about the cosmopolis politically (i.e., in
   terms of construction and excercise of power) without dismissing the
   moral dimension. Bearing this in mind, we consider it decisive to
   analyze the kind of bond that can be established between the idea of
   ``citizen of the world{''} (kosmopolites) and the notions of justice
   (dikaiosyne) and common law (koinos nomos). Furthermore, we believe that
   the articulation between these concepts will allow us to support the
   following hypothesis: that the cosmopolitan mandate, though ordering a
   social behaviour form from a set of values, it simultaneously
   establishes a hierarchic relationship (namely, of power) among those who
   `embody' the precepts of common law and justice, and the rest of the
   citizens, who should obey them.},

Abstract = {This is an empirical study of democratization and globalization in East
   and Southeast Asia and in Southern Africa (the country of Mauritius,
   specifically). By examining specific countries, I hoped to develop a
   general theory of democratization and globalization in rapidly
   developing countries, using a political economy approach. This approach
   was instrumental in discerning why some countries, notably Taiwan, were
   able to democratize and others, like mainland China, remain
   authoritarian, even in the face of rapid economic development. I
   compared countries at similar income levels and examined the
   relationship between their economic development path (globalization) and
   political liberalization (or lack thereof) to test the theses that
   globalization results in more or less political control by the
   government.},

Abstract = {Carl Schmitt is, undoubtedly, one of the authors who more has influenced
   the political theory in Spain. The aim of this study is to clarify in
   what measure he influenced the figure of one of the biggest conservative
   thinkers of the second half of the 20th century in Spain, Gonzalo
   Fernandez de la Mora. The theory of History, the conception of the
   political and the projection of his theory in the international
   relations shape the three axes of this comparison. From this perspective
   there appear points of contact and of difference and it will be verified
   how, assuming partially the schmittian categories, Fernandez de la
   Mora's thought turns out to be, in a sense, an answer to the work of the
   German author. From the perspective of the Plettenberg's jurist
   Fernandez de la Mora's thought might be qualified of ``liberal{''}.},

Abstract = {This paper offers the groundwork of an alternative to mainstream
   (un)employment theory that builds on Marx's account of the `active army'
   and `relative surplus population'. With special application to the
   current neoliberal era, Marx's long-range labour market analysis is
   connected to a mid-range account of capitalism's uneven development in
   historical practice. This alternative approach is then adapted to an
   `empirically adequate' statistical mapping of the relative surplus
   population's contemporary global composition. Under neoliberal global
   capitalism, the relative surplus population is identified as being
   larger than the active army, and is unevenly composed and distributed
   across developed, developing and underdeveloped countries.},

Abstract = {The uncertain political status of America's millions of undocumented
   immigrants and their children has exposed deep and ongoing disagreement
   about how US citizenship should be accorded to foreign-born persons. I
   identify the principle of jus temporis, a law of measured calendrical
   time, that has worked in concert with jus soli and consent to construct
   citizenship law since the nation's founding. Jus temporis translates
   measured durations of time such as ``time in residence{''} or ``time
   worked{''} into entitlement to rights and status. It creates temporal
   algorithms in which measured calendrical time plus additional variables
   (e.g., physical presence, education, or behavior) equals consent to
   citizenship. I explore recent scholarly references to temporal
   principles and trace the history of how jus temporis was invoked by the
   nation's first Supreme Court jurisprudence on citizenship and the first
   Congressional debates about immigration and naturalization. Scholarly
   convergence on the principle of jus temporis as well as its originalist
   pedigree imbue this principle with the potential to resolve contemporary
   disagreements about the rights and status of foreign-born persons in the
   US.},

   foreign policy. More precisely, it measures and compares their
   productions in French and in English (output) and the citations to this

   measured using the Canadian Foreign Relations Index. Then a
   representative sample of bibliographies taken from books and articles
   written by English-language scholars and published between 1997 and 2007
   is analyzed. Various conclusions on the place of French and
   French-language scholars in the field are drawn from these data,
   including their small contribution to Canadian foreign policy and the
   absence of citations to works in French by English-language scholars.
   Political implications of the results are discussed.},

Abstract = {The proliferation of opinion and overt partisanship in cable news raises
   questions about how audiences perceive this content. Of particular
   interest is whether audiences effectively perceive bias in opinionated
   news programs, and the extent to which there are partisan differences in
   these perceptions. Results from a series of three online experiments
   produce evidence for a relative hostile media phenomenon in the context
   of opinionated news. Although, overall, audiences perceive more story
   and host bias in opinionated news than in non-opinionated news, these
   perceptions-particularly perceptions of the host-vary as a function of
   partisan agreement with the news content. Specifically, issue partisans
   appear to have a ``bias against bias,{''} whereby they perceive less
   bias in opinionated news with which they are predisposed to agree than
   non-partisans and especially partisans on the other side of the issue.},

Abstract = {In this article, we use logit models to examine the role of the major
   characteristics of a political party's organization, (1) legitimation,
   (2) penetration/diffusion, (3) charisma, (4) ideology and (5)
   centralization/decentralization, in the institutionalization of parties
   in both pre-Soviet and post-Soviet Russian national parliamentary
   elections. The article begins by situating this research in the context
   of the theoretical and empirical literature on party origins,
   organizational development and institutionalization, in general, and
   party formation theories in post-communist countries, specifically. The
   impact of organizational features on electoral success or failure is
   analysed for 24 parties. The models correctly predicted both the
   successful and failed parties in the 2007 Russian Duma election and
   offer reasons for the apparent floating party system in Russia.},

Abstract = {``Dillon's Rule{''} and ``home rule{''} are terms often used to denote
   limited and expansive local government autonomy, respectively. In
   particular, much literature attributes Dillon's Rule with enormous
   influence over many and varied local government functions. This article
   explores the questions surrounding the true nature of Dillon's Rule and
   its influence, or lack thereof, on local government autonomy. The author
   explains that Dillon's Rule is a rule of statutory construction, while
   home rule lacks easy or uniform explanation. The article finds that home
   rule and Dillon's Rule are neither inapposite nor exclusive. The terms
   denote different concepts, each of which relates to local government
   autonomy, but in more subtle ways than often thought. Dillon's Rule
   exerts limited influence on local government autonomy.},

   so, it must be remembered that building contacts with countries within
   and beyond EuroAtlantic area and stronger relationships with all
   international organizations are more important than ever today. Turkey
   has proximity to many of the partner countries and supports the
   Partnership Policy of NATO. Turkey also believes that the enlargement of
   the Alliance contributes to the consolidation of security and stability
   in the whole Euro-Atlantic area. For this reason, we support the

Abstract = {This essay takes as its starting point an apparent tension between
   theories of democratic deliberation and democratic theories of
   multicultural accommodation and makes the case that many
   multiculturalists and deliberative democrats converge on an ideal of
   political freedom, understood as nondomination. It argues for
   distinguishing two dimensions of nondomination: inter-agentive
   nondomination, which obtains when all participants in a power relation
   are free from rule by others who can set its terms, and systemic
   nondomination, which obtains when the terms of a power relation itself
   are responsive to those they affect. Because inter-agentive and systemic
   nondomination do not covary, it is critical to distinguish between them,
   in order to build institutions and practices that promote both.},

Abstract = {The development and elaboration of the spatial theory of voting has
   contributed greatly to the study of legislative decision making and
   elections. Statistical models that estimate the spatial locations of
   individual decision-makers have made a key contribution to this success.
   Spatial models have been estimated for the U.S. Congress, the Supreme
   Court, U.S. presidents, a large number of non-U.S. legislatures, and
   supranational organizations. yet one potentially fruitful laboratory for
   testing spatial theories, the individual U.S. states, has remained
   relatively unexploited, for two reasons. First, state legislative roll
   call data have not yet been systematically collected for all states over
   time. Second, because ideal point models are based on latent scales,
   comparisons of ideal points across states or even between chambers
   within a state are difficult. This article reports substantial progress
   on both fronts. First, we have obtained the roll call voting data for
   all state legislatures from the mid-1990s onward. Second, we exploit a
   recurring survey of state legislative candidates to allow comparisons
   across time, chambers, and states as well as with the U.S. Congress. The
   resulting mapping of America's state legislatures has great potential to
   address numerous questions not only about state politics and
   policymaking, but also about legislative politics in general.},

Abstract = {This article discusses the development strategy adopted by the
   government of Lula in Brazil, during his eight years in office. It is
   observed that the economic policies had different theoretical
   underpinnings: orthodox economic theory (monetarist /neoliberal ideas)
   and approaches related to (neo) development. This situation means that
   in practice the strategy has unique characteristics (being a
   ``hybrid{''}). The conceptualization of this phenomenon has been defined
   as ``heterodox neo-developmentalist{''}.},

Abstract = {In the American research tradition, education has long been argued to
   push one toward a liberal political ideology. Traditionally, education
   has been associated with the upper classes of society and thereby with a
   more right-wing, conservative political ideology. Recent research
   demonstrates an inconsistent relationship between the ideological
   leaning of various political attitudes and education. This article
   reviews current theory on education and ideology and finds three
   perspectives dominate the literature: self-interest theses,
   developmental theses and socialization theses. Self-interest theories
   follow the traditional association of education with the upper classes
   and thereby with right-wing ideology. Developmental theses argue that
   education contributes to liberal political attitudes by stimulating
   cognitive development and expanding an individual's perspective.
   Socialization theses argue that education contributes to political
   attitudes by social learning processes. A specific example of a
   socialization perspective is the core values thesis. This thesis argues
   that education propagates the transmission of a society's core values.
   To this thesis, I add that an individual's personality is important in
   this process. As such I test a three-way interaction which provides
   support for the modified core values thesis: personality and context
   interact to influence the ideological leaning of our political
   attitudes. Comparative European Politics (201 1) 9, 292-316.

Abstract = {The role of symbolism in European integration provides one way of
   answering Craig Calhoun's 2003 call in Comparative European Politics for
   a means of transcending specific regimes of analysis in order to advance
   European studies. The article argues that our understanding of the
   integration process and the constitution of the European Union (EU) is
   furthered by broadly studying symbolic forms in a multiperspectival way.
   In contrast to much emphasis on heroic symbolic icons, the article
   studies more banal processes of symbolic construction that provide a
   deeper understanding of the symbolisation of European integration and
   enrich European studies more broadly. The article sets out how such
   processes could include the roles of physical icons such as maps or
   places, performative rituals such as days or museums, or discursive
   taboos such as mottos or texts. In this way the study of symbolism in
   European integration suggests a means of understanding how the EU
   becomes constituted as a political reality how it is `always already
   there and still in formation'. Comparative European Politics (2011) 9,

Abstract = {Gerard Neyrand, The multiple faces of women's precariousness
   The democratization of private relationships contributed to women's
   autonomy. At the same time, it rendered relationships more fragile,
   endangering an increasing number of couples. Breakaways are especially
   tough for women of popular extraction who must then raise children alone
   in a dreadful precariousness. The initial relational precariousness does
   not only generate economic precariousness, but also social and
   psychological precariousness. Such instability is unfortunately
   reinforced by conservative politics. To devise efficient countermeasures
   requires considering every form of precariousness simultaneously.},

Abstract = {From the perspective of a historical political analysis in the
   International Relations' field, it is shown that after the Post Cold War
   Era, the well-known global power of the United States has not been
   enough to create a ``new international order{''}, and on the contrary,
   it has opened a geopolitical competition in which an important group of
   powers have appeared, along with large size societies and political
   games which are beyond the Western world's understanding. In this
   context, despite of its economic and military power, the United States
   requires the need to create an active diplomatic structure that allows
   it to build a consensus in order to be able to act internationally,
   provided that unilateral actions create isolated actions easily, which
   could easily become the target of critics and the opponents'
   animadversion against the United States' lonely power.},

Abstract = {We study the coverage of U.S. political scandals by U.S. newspapers
   during the past decade. Using automatic keyword-based searches we
   collected data on 32 scandals and approximately 200 newspapers. We find
   that Democratic-leaning newspapers-i.e., those with a higher propensity
   to endorse Democratic candidates in elections-provide relatively more
   coverage of scandals involving Republican politicians than scandals
   involving Democratic politicians, while Republican-leaning newspapers
   tend to do the opposite. This is true even after controlling for the
   average partisan leanings of readers. In contrast, newspapers appear to
   cater to the partisan tastes of readers only for local scandals.},

Abstract = {Commonly used in studies of dwelling and political theory, the concept
   of quality of life is positioned more strongly every day. However, as
   its range of use expands, this seems to empty its real content to the
   point of becoming the most appropriate cliche for political campaigning.
   Through this paper, a journey in which the quality of life is linked
   with happiness, its connection with public and private virtues, its role
   in the world of consumption and globalized cities; is proposed. From an
   eminently empirical analytical view, the dangers of the semantic
   weakening of a concept for the forms of social interaction and ways to
   understand the sense of community are shown.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this text is to justify the teaching and learning of
   Politics in a civilian perspective of the Political Science studies in
   the Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana. It starts from a biblical myth
   to recognize the difficulty of any academy to establish a perfect
   educational curriculum because of the existence of multiple languages,
   methods, lexicons, and objectives of what Political Science means. It
   focuses its attention on the dichotomy, the identity and difference, in
   order to understand the stressful story of the existing political
   relation approaches. The previous context provides the perspective of
   three of the cultural determinations that cuts through the teaching of
   politics, namely: the cultural perspective, the historicist perspective
   and the legalistic perspective typical to Western life. The paper comes
   to the idea that if the intellectual effort is directed this way, it
   might lead to an academic and social domain in which the political
   culture can help in understanding, giving sense, and offering civic
   alternatives to face the conflicts of Colombian reality.},

Abstract = {Publicly, conspiracy theories are considered a bizarre mode of thought.
   In the academic discourse, they are unserious statements positioned
   between bad imitation of scientific theory and political pathology.
   Therefore, their authors and consumers experience a procedure of
   exclusion from the community of ``serious people{''}. But there are
   situations in which conspiracy theories are taken seriously, and
   established precisely as an exclusion device. These situations are
   predominantly interpreted as collective endangerment or political
   crisis. In that case, conspiracy theories stem from the center of
   political power as legitimate interpretation of reality. This was
   realized in an extreme way in the Nazi regime. So, the present academic
   discourse produces the Other by reason of standing for conspiracy
   theories. In political crisis and authoritarian or totalitarian regimes,
   the Other is produced by conspiracy theories. Historically, the academic
   attitude is partly produced by the consequences of the other attitude,
   through triple ``demystification{''} of the conspiracy panic of
   Nazism/Fascism, Stalinism and, in the West, McCarthyism. But,
   structurally, it is the attitude of conspiracy-theory panic, or mimicry
   in exclusion. We propose a different approach, one that will
   simultaneously avoid acceptance of conspiracy theories as ``facts{''}
   and their reduction to a phenomenon of mass hysteria. They should be
   considered beyond the opposition between delusion and hidden truth.
   Therefore, we define them as an interpretation pattern, structured as a
   double phantasm with the possibility of being traversed. This definition
   is close to Sloterdijk's conception of Cynical Reason, according to
   which we can differentiate between cynical and kynical conspiracy
   theories. Cynical conspiracy theories speak in the name of totalitarian
   and authoritarian power trying to defend an organismic community, and
   preserve a phantasmatic structure. Kynical conspiracy theories are
   speaking from the position of particular, fragmentational and singular
   agents. From the periphery of discourse, they criticize the power elite
   by indicating the cleavages that are concealed by cynics. In that way,
   kynical conspiracy theories perform a positive function as a way of
   ``exposing the dirty linen{''} of the political regime.},

Abstract = {Public attitudes towards the European Union (EU) are at the heart of a
   growing body of research. The nature, structure and antecedents of these
   attitudes, however, are in need of conceptual and empirical refinement.
   With growing diversification of the policies of the Union, a
   one-dimensional approach to attitudes towards the EU may be
   insufficient. This study reviews existing approaches towards theorizing
   EU public opinion. Based on this inventory, originally collected public
   opinion survey data (n = 1394) indicate the presence of five dimensions
   of EU attitudes: performance, identity, affection, utilitarianism and
   strengthening. The study furthermore shows that different predictors of
   EU public opinion matter to differing extents when explaining these
   dimensions. In light of these findings, we suggest tightening the link,
   conceptually and empirically, between attitudinal dimensions and their
   antecedents.},

Abstract = {Georgia and Turkey enjoy close ties and have smooth political relations.
   Turkey's main concerns vis-a-vis Georgia are economy and trade links.
   Consequently, Turkey managed to replace Russia as Georgia's biggest
   trade partner, citizens of Georgia can travel to Turkey without a need
   of visa, and Turkey attracts a large number of labor migrants coming
   mainly from Georgia's impoverished countryside. However, so far Turkey
   has failed to formulate a policy that would fully meet Georgian and
   Russian expectations at the same time. On the one hand Turkey showed
   reluctance to NATO's enlargement in the region and on the other, Turkish
   investments in Abkhazia as well as the lobby of the Abkhazian diaspora
   living in Turkey have posed challenges to Turkey-Georgia relations.},

Abstract = {Establishing civilian control of the military is an important challenge
   for new democracies. Surprisingly, however, there is no established
   conceptual framework for understanding what civilian control entails and
   how exactly weak or absent civilian control impinges upon democratic
   quality. This article addresses these lacunae, developing a new concept
   of civilian control for emerging democracies. It proposes to understand
   civilian control as the situation in which civilians have
   decision-making power in all relevant political matters. Differentiating
   civilian control as consisting of five decision-making areas, this new
   concept allows for a nuanced analysis of civilian control and
   comparative analysis. It also provides a comprehensive framework for
   systematically assessing the impact of incomplete civilian control on
   the various dimensions of liberal democracy.},

Abstract = {The implementation of climate change adaptation polices has barely
   occurred in developed countries. This paper examines to what extent the
   perceptions of political actors might hinder the development of
   adaptation policies. We study the Swiss case using computer aided
   textual analysis. Our results demonstrate that adaptation is still not
   perceived as an important dimension of climate change policy. Decision
   makers do not perceive links between adaptation, the Swiss economy and
   the energy supply. Adaptation is mainly considered an issue for
   developing countries and not as a way to reduce the impacts of climate
   change in Switzerland. Right-wing parties tend to consider adaptation a
   secondary issue and are more likely than those to the left to object to
   the formulation or the implementation of public measures.},

   Obama issued only two such statements over the next 18 months, including
   a stretch of almost 16 months without a single constitutional signing
   statement. While it is unclear exactly how the administration will
   proceed, there is evidence to suggest that other interpretive
   mechanisms, such as opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel and
   Statements of Administration Policy, could potentially play an increased
   role as a partial substitute for the politically unpopular signing
   statement.},

Abstract = {In several respects, the EU represents both a novel system of
   quasi-supranational governance and a novel form of political community
   or polity. But it is also a fragile construction for it remains a
   community still in the making with an ambiguous sense of identity and
   within which powerful forces are at work. This paper has three main
   aims: first, to stress the shifting nature of Europe's geographical
   frontiers and assess whether cultural frontiers have remained more
   stable throughout time. In particular, it examines the main criteria,
   which have traditionally been employed when having to decide who should
   be included and excluded from Europe. A different question concerns the
   requirements for EU membership and the monopoly of the adjective
   ``European{''} by the EU, which somehow has become to be identified with
   Europe. Second, to explore the prospects for the emergence of a European
   identity. Here, I argue that European identity stands as a
   ``non-emotional identity{''} in sharp contrast with traditional forms of
   national identity associated with intense nationalist feelings. Third,
   through the analysis of the most recent Eurobarometer (annual survey of
   EU's public opinion) to examine the views of Europeans regarding the EU
   at a time of a major global economic crisis. To conclude, the paper
   explores the main challenges to be faced by a still incipient European
   identity.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {32},
Number = {3},
Pages = {323-344},

Abstract = {The response of intergovernmental organizations (IGOs) to the pressure
   of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) is undertheorized. Scholarship
   on NGOs around IGOs is frequently idiosyncratic and laudatory, and we
   lack cumulation for cross-IGO generalizations about NGO impact within
   the frame of established international relations (IR) theory. From the
   central three IR paradigms (realism, liberalism, and constructivism) I
   elaborate a null and three alternative hypotheses to explain why an IGO
   would respond to NGO pressures. I benchmark these hypotheses to
   empirical indicators of NGO impact on IGOs. I then `test drive' this
   framework against the highly relevant, easily cross-comparable Bretton
   Woods Institutions. I find that the World Bank responds functionally to
   NGO pressure: NGO outreach serves its mission efficiency. The
   International Monetary Fund responds defensively: NGOs are an
   organizational threat to be managed.},

Abstract = {The main goal of this work is to explain the economic and political
   evolution and motivation that led to Japan's granting Brazil official
   development aid (ODA) between 1960 and 2008. A ``realistic{''} focus is
   used, because it allows the characteristics of such policy to be
   highlighted with each period studied. The case of Brazil was analyzed,
   taking into consideration diplomatic relations between the two countries
   and the ODA funds that Japan gave Brazil over the period. Two important
   facts partially explain the relationship between Japan and Brazil: 1)
   Brazil, as well as Mexico and Peru, received significant migratory flows
   from Japan from the beginning of the 20th century through the middle of
   the 1970s, and 2) Brazil has been one of Japan's most important
   commercial associates in the region since World War Two.},

Abstract = {The uprisings which swept across the Arab world beginning in December
   2010 pose a serious challenge to many of the core findings of the
   political science literature focused on the durability of the
   authoritarian Middle Eastern state. The impact of social media on
   contentious politics represents one of the many areas which will require
   significant new thinking. The dramatic change in the information
   environment over the last decade has changed individual competencies,
   the ability to organize for collective action, and the transmission of
   information from the local to the international level. It has also
   strengthened some of the core competencies of authoritarian states even
   as it has undermined others. The long term evolution of a new kind of
   public sphere may matter more than immediate political outcomes,
   however. Rigorous testing of competing hypotheses about the impact of
   the new social media will require not only conceptual development but
   also the use of new kinds of data analysis not traditionally adopted in
   Middle East area studies.},

Abstract = {Contemporary theories try to approach the methods of social sciences to
   the standards of natural sciences through the mathematical formalization
   of their instruments. This way gives the main reason for the assumption
   that democracy can only flourish above a certain of economic success.
   But the political culture cannot be cut off from the socio-cultural
   context and the historic evolution. The Andean area in a narrow sense
   (Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador) has experienced three main civilizatory
   periods: the prehispanic Indian civilization, the Spanish colonial time
   and the actual western modernity in a merely instrumentalist kind. All
   three currents furthered an authoritarian, centralist and collectivistic
   culture and were not favourable to the contemporary conception of human
   rights and to a liberal-democratic civic culture. And the adequate
   analysis of these currents cannot be carried out through the
   mathematization of social and cultural variables.},

Abstract = {Recent uprisings and unrests across the Middle East and North Africa
   (MENA) have brought new leadership to Egypt and Tunisia, and could
   possibly result in more leadership changes. While it is too early to
   assess the meaning and implications of the MENA uprisings, it is even
   more difficult to predict whether the current ferment could
   fundamentally reshape the region by bringing real democratic
   transformation. What is evident, however, is that the United States' old
   bargain with autocrats is collapsing and that U.S. strategic interests
   are seemingly better served, at least during this historic period, by
   working with governments that genuinely reflect the will of their
   people. This essay's central argument is that change and transformation
   in MENA has resulted from bottom-up, anti-establishment popular
   movements that have exposed the flaws of the U.S. foreign policy and
   will most likely challenge the conventional U.S. policies in the region
   for years to come.},

Abstract = {The author aims to present the etymology and history of the laicity
   principle as an important part of the political history of the West,
   particularly of France. The laicity idea has a very important place in
   the context of church-state relations, of separation of the two, and of
   their cooperation in certain areas (in models of cooperation). Since the
   concepts of laicity, secularism, secularisation and laicisation are
   often used in such a way as to make clear distinction impossible, an
   outline of their fundamental distinctions and an elucidation of possible
   ways of their use in political science seem to be fully justified. With
   regard to their etymological origins (Greek, Latin and French sources),
   the above-mentioned concepts are part of the common European tradition
   of establishing relations between the church and the state, relying on
   foundations which have demonstrated, in the course of history, their
   importance and various political applications.},

Abstract = {Previous studies show that reforms in labour market policies differ
   across countries. This may be partly owing to the impact of European
   integration on these policy reforms. Whereas most of these studies are
   qualitative case studies, the present study aims at explaining
   cross-national variation in expenditures on active labour market
   policies (ALMPs) quantitatively. Relying on pooled time-series data, the
   study tests whether and how Europeanization influenced activation. The
   analyses lead to the conclusion that the European Employment Strategy
   (EES) has contributed to shifts from passive to active labour market
   policies. Using new indicators, we trace the impact of specific
   mechanisms of the EES, resulting in evidence for the influence of mutual
   learning through the peer review programme.},

Abstract = {We present a theory of parties-in-legislatures that can generate
   partisan policy outcomes despite the absence of any party-imposed voting
   discipline. Legislators choose all procedures and policies through
   majority-rule bargaining and cannot commit to vote against their
   preferences on either. Yet, off-median policy bias occurs in equilibrium
   because a majority of legislators with correlated preferences has
   policy-driven incentives to adopt partisan agenda-setting rules-as a
   consequence, bills reach the floor disproportionately from one side of
   the ideological spectrum. The model recovers, as special cases, the
   claims of both partisan and nonpartisan theories in the ongoing debate
   over the nature of party influence in the U. S. Congress. We show that
   (1) party influence increases in polarization, and (2) the legislative
   median controls policy making only when there are no bargaining
   frictions and no polarization. We discuss the implications of our
   findings for the theoretical and empirical study of legislatures.},

   are becoming more important for Poland. The presidency of EU Council
   will reinforce the Europeanisation of politics and administration in
   Poland. But the country's administrative and political resources are

Abstract = {A certain degree of mystification surrounds all military decisions, as
   if their very existence stands for violence and irrationality
   incomprehensible to a fully civilized mind, and only justifiable with
   the harsh realities of the world. And yet, the armed forces in a liberal
   democracy are under civilian control, as is their spending. Their
   constitution and equipment reflect the role in which they are envisioned
   as well as goals they are intended to achieve. Concordantly, this
   article casts military spending policy as a rational and long-term
   process. Through large portions of the 20th century, explaining military
   procurement would have been focused on explanations of competitive
   military build-ups. Quite contrary to this, the contemporary policy
   challenges and solutions are more often compatible than competitive, due
   to the fact that the major players do not intend to make war on each
   other. Instead, the environment in which war-making is conceivably to
   take place is shared; an asymmetrical, low-intensity battlefield where
   once stood the threat of an all out war with an equal opponent. The
   intuitive approach to arming policy takes market structure and perceived
   security levels of countries into account. This article suggests that an
   improved perspective can sometimes be gained using a policy convergence
   framework. In particular, the author examines acquisitions of lighter
   armored vehicles with a fighting role by NATO member countries in recent
   years. The similarities in procurement projects such as Stryker (USA)
   and FRES (Great Britain) are viewed utilizing concepts of convergence
   mechanisms such as lesson drawing and policy emulation as compared to
   individual problem solving. A simplified model of military procurement
   is suggested in order to better distinguish these mechanisms. The author
   argues that in a high uncertainty context of military procurement
   coupled with urgency of the decision process, policy emulation can be
   preferable to technically more rational but higher cost policy-making
   processes.},

Abstract = {Standard interpretations of early American political thought and of the
   classical-republican tradition fit uneasily with an overlooked episode
   in the history of ideas: the reception of Machiavelli in
   seventeenth-century New England. Some puritans there not only found ways
   to justify bad means for good ends but also adopted a deeper, properly
   political Machiavellism, upholding the priority of popular judgment over
   elite wisdom and of institutionalized accountability over discretionary
   political authority. Unlike the eighteenth-century republicanism that
   has preoccupied modern scholarship, the theory of radical democracy
   associated with the first Machiavellian moment in America puts
   fundamental institutional reform and accountability with teeth on the
   agenda of democratic theory.},

Abstract = {In a global economy, a country's international economic ties affect both
   how desirable pre-electoral fiscal manipulation is to the government,
   and how costly it is to the government to engage in such manipulation.
   Governments are more likely to engage in pre-electoral fiscal
   manipulation when the country's exchange rate is flexible and the
   domestic economy is highly open to international trade, and when the
   exchange rate is fixed and the domestic economy is relatively closed to
   international trade. This argument is tested empirically through a
   quantitative analysis of changes in government debt in twenty OECD
   countries from 1974 to 2008.},

Abstract = {Jean-Claude Paye, LOPPSI 2: The French Patriot Act
   LOPPSI 2 inscribes in French law measures set up by the US Patriot Act
   after the 9/11 attacks. While its provisions target the weaker layers of
   the population, the text mainly aims at legalizing Trojans in computers
   and developing a gradual control on the Internet. It significantly
   develops a system for networking police records. LOPPSI 2 is the most
   advanced stage of a set of laws that started with the 2001 law on daily
   security.},

Abstract = {This study examines the role of women political bloggers and how they
   use their blogs for purposes related to politics, public policy, and
   current events. Based on a combined purposive-snowball sample, in-depth
   interviews were conducted with 20 women political bloggers in October
   2006. Findings show respondents blog about a range of topics, not
   necessarily unique to women. Generally, women use their blogs to inform
   their readers, check the media, engage in advocacy efforts, and solicit
   charitable contributions from their readers and more specifically, women
   ask their readers to vote and contact elected officials. Data show women
   deal with a range of challenges blogging most notably discrimination.
   Though a majority of women political bloggers reported they did not face
   discrimination, interviewees qualified their responses saying they
   witnessed discrimination and discriminatory attitudes, suggesting the
   political blogosphere is somewhat inhospitable to women.},

Abstract = {Conventional accounts of the Federal Convention of 1787 point to the
   many different compromises made at the convention, specifically the
   Great Compromise on representation and the Three-Fifths Compromise on
   slavery. Often these compromises are treated as separate events, the
   result of deliberation leading to moderation of delegate positions
   (presumably among the key states of Massachusetts and North Carolina).
   However, by applying the techniques of roll-call analysis, we find this
   traditional account is at best incomplete and probably misleading. While
   the Massachusetts delegation's behavior seems consistent with a
   moderation hypothesis, we find evidence that the other crucial vote for
   the Great Compromise-from North Carolina-is inconsistent with
   moderation, but can be linked through the agenda to the Three-Fifths
   Compromise over slavery, taxation, and representation. We conclude by
   arguing that this reconsideration of some of the convention's key votes
   should cause political scientists and historians to reevaluate how they
   see the compromises at the convention.},

Abstract = {At stake in the debates over value is the legitimacy of a theory that
   takes class exploitation as its object. The categories of value and
   surplus value are argued to be indispensable to that task since they
   permit analysis of revenue flows in capitalism as outcomes of a
   multilayered process that redistributes unpaid labor. Marxism requires a
   value theory capable of consistent theorization of the multiple
   mechanisms of surplus transfer/redistribution. Several contemporary
   approaches are briefly considered in the context of an argument for what
   some now call a ``singlesystem'' perspective: one that conceives the
   magnitude of capital (constant or variable) as the labor time equivalent
   paid for ( rather than the labor embodied in) the commodities purchased
   as capital. On this basis, the ground for a consistent value theory is
   secure.},

Abstract = {This article is focusing on radical right-wing populist voting in
   Eastern Europe, and shows that neither the mass society thesis nor the
   theory of social capital, in Putnam's tradition, has much explanatory
   value for explaining the support for radical right-wing populism.
   Individuals with low participation in civil society are shown not to be
   significantly more right-wing populist than others, so that
   participation in civil society organizations is not a shield against
   populism. That means, that claims that radical right-wing populism has
   risen in Eastern Europe over the past one and a half decades because of
   a weakly developed civil society, that is, because of a legacy of lack
   of civic virtues being born through participation in civil society
   organizations, must be questioned. Such claims are not finding support
   in the empirical results presented in this article. Acta Politica (2011)

Abstract = {What relationships can be formed between labor and liberty when labor is
   no longer necessarily experienced as the social indicator of alienation
   from liberty in the economy? It was Marx who first painstakingly
   developed these issues, formulating the theory of two reigns, that of
   necessity and that of liberty, within the context of the communist
   Utopia. Nonetheless, his positioning of the problem entailed a whole
   series of ambiguities. In basing ourselves on Andre Gorz's analyses, we
   will demonstrate the dependence of all thought about liberation on a
   philosophy of liberty that assumes, or fails to assume, a certain
   irreducible depth of any human collective, an inevitable heteronomy of
   the human condition.},

Title = {REVISITING CLASSICAL FUNCTIONAL THEORY: TOWARDS A TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY
   MICRO-POLITICS},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Pages = {16-39},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This paper returns to some themes found in David Mitrany's classical
   `functionalist' approach to international politics, in order to
   reconstruct practical principles that might be applied to contemporary
   politics as well as debates in International Relations and international
   political theory. It attempts to do this through two moves -
   `restoration' and `contemporary reconstruction'. In restoring some of
   the insights Mitrany provides us that have been somewhat obscured over
   time, the paper hopes to demonstrate the `function' behind functionalism
   - that its core assumptions as an approach (if not `theory') to
   international politics can prove to be just as instructive today as they
   were during the several decades of their initial development by Mitrany.
   Reconstruction, however, is necessitated by the observation that some of
   Mitrany's aspirations for functional theory - namely that it would
   produce `bonds' that not only transcend national communities, but
   provide for the unraveling of the nation-state system as we know it -
   were a bit utopian. Thus, the paper proposes several avenues to
   reconstruct classical functionalism for contemporary politics. The paper
   then discusses three small empirical illustrations where micro-political
   insights can be extracted and briefly analysed: peace camps, the
   Regional Cooperation Council of the former Yugoslavia, and a more
   detailed analysis of the so-called `surge' strategy in the ongoing
   US-Iraq conflict. It concludes with a two-pronged discussion on how
   micro-politics might speak to current debates in international political
   theory, and some mechanisms for securing functional spaces.},

Volume = {10},
Number = {2},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This paper seeks to contribute to the literature on political judgment
   by proposing that the faculty of judgment is essential for responsibly
   coping with the undeniable fact of distant suffering and the
   controversial duty of humanitarian intervention. To achieve this end,
   Mahmood Mamdani's text `The Politics of Naming: Genocide, Civil War,
   Insurgency' will be mobilized for a constructive dialogue about which
   specific conception of political judgment is at stake when we debate a
   situation like Darfur today. The main claim is that political judgment
   in times of acute crisis requires the members of the public sphere to
   strike a precarious balance between two contradictory impulses: the
   deliberative impulse to enlarge the pool of particular standpoints, and
   the decisionist impulse to finally bring the conversation to a halt and
   adopt a normative stance. The theoretical framework for this balanced
   view of the faculty of judgment will be articulated through a
   hybridization of Hannah Arendt's notion of an `enlarged mentality' and
   Jacques Derrida's concept of an `aporetic decision'.},

Abstract = {Guillaume Tiffon, Machines which make us work
   The setting-up of machines - and specifically automatic cash registers
   in large retail chains - constitutes a progress for companies because it
   enables them to make the clients work and to make new sorts of capital
   gain; but for cashiers and customers, it's different. Cashiers fear
   losing their jobs and can see that their work is going poor. If some
   customers recognize the importance of the time-saving argument, some
   others protest against the job cuts coming and consider that the gradual
   spread of machines is a part of a global trend of dehumanization and
   deterioration of services.},

Abstract = {Based on an examination of constitutional and other party documents,
   Canadian political parties have been described as stratarchically
   organized (Carty, 2002). We identify four models of internal party
   financial flows that correspond to different models of internal party
   organization. We then trace the financial flows into and within the four
   major Canadian political parties from 2004 to 2007 with a view to
   identifying the model of party organization that these flows indicate.
   Our evidence in some respects supports Carty's assertion that Canadian
   parties are stratarchically organized, but it also suggests that changes
   to the regulatory regime governing political finance have contributed to
   a centralization of power at the level of the national party and at the
   expense of candidates and local associations. This centralizing tendency
   is significant, as it may disrupt the bargain that underlies the
   stratarchical organization of Canadian parties.},

   a focus on proposed changes to employment standards legislation. We
   argue that contrary to claims of shared restraint and the pressing need
   for public austerity, Premier McGuinty's Liberal's have re-branded and
   re-packaged core neoliberal policies in such a manner that costs are
   socialized and profits privatized, thereby intensifying class
   polarization along with its racialized and gendered diversities.},

   the king over external affairs. In his writings, Yoo devotes little
   attention to the framers' rejection of British executive prerogatives.
   Even less does he acknowledge their commitment to a republic, a form of
   government in which sovereign power is vested not in an executive but in

Abstract = {Based on the assumption that lawmakers can only claim credit for public
   goods they produce, models of intergovernmental political competition
   predict that states with less ability to pay for public goods will
   respond more favorably to the price effect of federal grants. We offer
   the alternative assumption that confusion over proper credit assignment
   allows state lawmakers to claim credit for federal production. This
   produces the expectation that lawmakers in states with low ability to
   pay will be more likely to let federal money supplant own source
   spending, assuming that they will be able to continue claiming credit
   even as their share of production decreases. We test these competing
   assertions in data on transportation production in the American states
   between 1971 and 1996.},

Abstract = {International relations literature is well developed on the effects of
   United Nations intervention on the duration of crises. The global human
   rights community has on a case-by-case basis addressed some of the
   unintended effects of UN intervention, namely, substantial increases in
   the human sex trafficking trade into crisis areas. We bridge these two
   literatures and evaluate the effects of UN involvement in Kosovo, Haiti
   and Sierra Leone. We look beyond the intended effects of UN intervention
   and consider the unintended effects in a systematic and generalizable
   way. We argue that UN involvement has the unfortunate and unintended
   effect of increasing the rates of human trafficking in these crisis
   areas. Our work concludes that the UN should proceed with caution into
   crisis areas and have plans in place to avoid the potentially
   devastating externalities of otherwise well-intentioned efforts.},

Abstract = {The article explores the relevance of socioeconomic variables on
   partisanship in Central Mexico for the 2006 presidential election. We
   perform an exploratory canonical correlation analysis, a predictive
   binomial logit analysis and a further confirmatory set of OLS regression
   analyses. The analyses are based on a data set that uses electoral
   results as well as census information, constructed as 1.6 km (one mile)
   radii GIS neighborhoods, which allow for the integration of electoral
   and census geographies. The results suggest that income and education do
   not always influence party preferences in the same direction. In
   particular in the case of the vote for the left leaning party, these two
   variables have contradicting effects. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {This article uses a transactions approach to examine the ability of
   governments to develop and sustain negotiated solutions to major
   economic challenges. Where actors are embedded in long-term, repeated
   interaction, have long time horizons, and invest in monitoring and
   enforcement technologies, effective political exchange is more likely.
   In good transactions environments, policy bargains will be more easily
   renegotiated and therefore more flexible and durable. To examine the
   expectations the author looks to the puzzle posed by events in Australia
   and New Zealand, 1983-1996. Facing similar macroeconomic crises and with
   historically similar wage bargaining institutions and levels of union
   density both elect Labor governments, which then make opposite choices:
   A negotiated solution emerged in Australia but not in New Zealand.
   Relying on the secondary literature and interviews with key actors, the
   author finds support for the transactions approach. Findings here point
   to ways in which to broaden the study of so-called social pacts.},

   party group cohesion. Our formal model of legislative behavior suggests
   that when EP elections are proximate, national party delegations shift
   toward national party positions, thus weakening EP party group cohesion.
   Our Bayesian item-response analysis of roll calls in the 5th EP supports

Abstract = {What political institutions improve property rights? Building on the
   work of North and Weingast, this article argues that institutional
   checks on policy-making discretion ({''}veto players{''}) improve the
   property rights of investors regarding the value of the domestic
   currency. Veto players constrain the ability of policy makers to
   opportunistically pursue policy that may lead to a depreciated domestic
   currency. The study offers some of the first large-sample evidence that
   check and balance institutions lower the risk of expropriation, using a
   direct measure of investors' revealed preferences as the dependent
   variable. In particular, evidence from 127 countries over the period
   1975-2004 shows that the use of foreign currency as a store of value-a
   common hedge against domestic currency depreciation-decreases with the
   number of veto players in government. The findings are robust to
   multiple specifications, including instrumental variable models that
   exploit exogenous sources of institutional variation.},

Abstract = {Scholars of democratic theory and international political economy often
   disagree over the effects of globalization on state autonomy. Yet, each
   approach pays minimal attention to the contributions of the other to
   their common object of study. In an effort to remedy this situation, I
   identify the premises and procedural habits of each approach which tend
   to make it appear irrelevant to the other, and then adjust them to
   remove the appearance of irrelevance without impairing the integrity of
   each approach. The argument is illustrated by observations from Britain,
   France and Sweden in recent decades.},

Abstract = {The possibility that the Statutes of Autonomy regulate rights has been a
   matter that constitutionalist has turned out to be specially polemic in
   the last years. The STC 31/2010 concludes this topic proclaiming the
   effective constitutionality of the regulation of statutory rights and
   establishing his limited scope. The Constitutional Court has added that
   the statutory rights are not actually civil rights but simple mandates
   to the autonomous public power. This supposes that only they will be
   exigibles when the autonomous legislator has developed them. The
   statutory rights are materially linked to the own area of the autonomous
   community.},

Title = {Multiple Dimensions of Mobilization: The Effect of Direct Contact and
   Political Ads on Latino Turnout in the 2000 Presidential Election},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL MARKETING},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {10},
Number = {4},
Pages = {303-327},
Abstract = {Campaigns are not national, monolithic, one-size-fits-all events, but
   instead can be viewed as separate, segmented attempts to engage
   different groups of voters. This paper explores the effectiveness of
   different types of mobilization strategies among one group of voters,
   Latinos. Drawing from an integrated marketing communications framework,
   we argue that both direct contact and indirect contact should be
   effective in mobilizing Latinos, with the former having a stronger
   effect. In addition, we argue that targeted strategies should be more
   effective than general strategies among this segment of the population.
   We find support for these hypotheses using data fromthe 2000 TRPI survey
   and CMAG data.},

Abstract = {International studies programs are increasingly popular at colleges and
   universities across the United States, and most prior research and
   efforts have been has focused on the international studies major.
   However, institutions may often find it much easier to create a minor
   rather than a major program given scarce resources and a preexisting
   curriculum. This study focuses on the international studies minor. We
   complement a survey of the basic parameters of such minor programs in
   the United States with a case study that investigates how students
   implement the minor with their course selections at Truman State
   University, a public liberal arts university in the Midwest, which
   offers a fairly typical international studies minor. We end with
   suggestions for the improvement of such minors that can be implemented
   with existing course offerings.},

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {55},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-15},

Abstract = {In multiparty legislatures, the largest party or coalition may fall
   short of controlling a majority of plenary seats. However, plurality-led
   congresses generally endow the largest parties with extensive
   agenda-setting prerogatives, even when plenary majorities are lacking.
   In this article, we present a model and compelling evidence describing
   changes in the strategic behavior of committee chairs when majority
   control is lost. Using a dataset that includes all the bills proposed to
   the Argentine House in the last 25 years, we estimate success in
   committee in majority- and plurality-led congresses. We provide
   extensive evidence that the loss of majority control reduces the
   importance of the median voter of the plurality party while improving
   the success of the median committee voter.},

Abstract = {The present study takes as its departure point theoretical reflections
   on the concept of `model' for a discussion of the China model in
   particular, a model that has attracted increasing attention all over the
   world due to China's dramatic development. It surveys the origin and
   major conceptualizations of the China model in both the Chinese and the
   international context and presents on that basis a series of fundamental
   constituents of the China model in relation to China's economic,
   political, cultural and social development. Its central point is that
   the China model expresses socialism with Chinese characteristics, and
   therefore constitutes a developing country model with qualities that are
   specific to the Chinese context.},

Journal = {AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {46},
Number = {3},
Pages = {489-502},
Abstract = {This article examines the bipartisan nuclear `grand bargain', namely
   that Australia would only export uranium to states signatory to the
   Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), in framing Australian policy and debate
   towards India. India has not signed the NPT, and shows no willingness to
   do so. Since 2006 the domestic political and media debate regarding
   uranium sales to India shows that this grand bargain is fraying. This
   article explores the major arguments that have been elucidated by
   Australian political party leaders either for or against uranium sales
   to India and concludes with a discussion of the opportunities and
   challenges presented to Australia if it were to make an exception for
   India.},

Journal = {CONTEMPORARY POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {17},
Number = {4},
Pages = {447-465},
Abstract = {This article considers China's participation in two key areas of
   international affairs, climate change and nuclear non-proliferation,
   taking as its focus the high-profile global summits of 2009 and 2010,
   with a view to examining how it seeks to operationalise its foreign
   policy goals. Drawing on Cox's critical view of multilateralism as a
   `terrain of struggle' between a conservative developed North and a
   transformative developing South, the discussion examines the agendas of
   the USA as the world's leading power, on the one hand, and the
   developing countries and China on the other, the conference contexts,
   processes and outcomes. Neither simply acquiescent nor seeking to forge
   an `adversarial anti-hegemonic front', China's role is seen as one of
   bridge-builder between developed and developing nations, using both
   resistance and compliance to deflect US power plays and gain leverage in
   pursuit of a transformative `multipolar developmentalism' towards a new
   fairer international governance.},

Abstract = {The Efficient Market Hypothesis often seems to suggest only that most
   people cannot outguess the financial markets. But the originator of the
   hypothesis, Eugene Fama, made the stronger claim that people cannot
   outguess the financial markets because financial-market prices are
   correct: They incorporate all known information accurately. This view
   omits the role that human traders' interpretations of information must
   play if the information is to prompt them to buy or sell. Buyers and
   sellers disagree about the meaning of current information, so at least
   half of them must be wrong. Bringing in many more (but equally fallible)
   people to predict the future does not somehow make their (collective)
   answer oright.o This is a logical disproof of the Fama hypothesis, but
   the inherently speculative nature of financial markets makes its
   empirical falsification (or verification) ambiguous if not impossible.
   The hypothesis must therefore be considered an unscientific article of
   faith.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS IN LATIN AMERICA},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {3},
Number = {2},
Pages = {43-71},
Abstract = {This article argues that in Colombia, decentralization and electoral
   reforms adopted in the late 1980s and in the 1991 Constitution -
   designed to improve democratic quality - brought about a gradual
   deinstitutionalization of this country's traditional party system as an
   unintended consequence. Building upon resource-based theories of party
   configuration, we contend that in developing countries, where resources
   are usually crucial for party aggregation, ``democratizing{''} reforms
   designed to distribute power and resources in the political system can
   reduce local candidates' incentives to join and remain loyal to
   political parties, particularly when those parties' reputations are
   weak. In Colombia, these reforms (i) reduced the power of
   intermediate-level party leaders over the distribution of selective
   incentives, making these leaders less important for local politicians,
   and (ii) gave more political and financial autonomy to local candidates,
   reducing their need to join parties in order to advance their electoral
   goals. As a result, party cohesion and discipline become difficult to
   maintain, and the party system gradually deinstitutionalizes.},

Abstract = {Ramon de Salas was one of the fists theatricals of Constitutional Law in
   Spain. As professor at the University of Salamanca (1771-1795) he tried
   to modify the studies of Law, introducing the Enlightenment theories
   (Montesquieu, Filangieri, Beccaria, Heinnecio, Burlamaqui Wolf, Emer de
   Vattel, Puffendorf and Grocio). In fact, he translated some of the main
   European Enlightenment works by Genovesi, Montesquieu, Beccaria and
   Bentham. During the ``Trienio Liberal{''}, Salas wrote his most known
   work ``Lecciones de Derecho Publico Constitucional{''} (Lessons on
   Constitutional Public Law), which included not only a theoretical study,
   but also an analysis of the Spanish Constitution of 1812. His Lessons
   tried to introduce in Spain the political theories of Constant and
   Destutt de Tracy.},

Abstract = {Tamsin Shaw has suggested that Nietzsche's concerns included the
   ideological capacity of the state. I show that some support for this
   interpretation can be drawn from Nietzsche's own views about the threat
   to moral and intellectual independence posed by modern forms of
   political authority If taken seriously his insights allow us to
   appreciate how independent political judgment, and hence individual
   autonomy can be systematically imperiled by the operation of the modern
   state apparatus. In light of this discovery I begin to construct a
   genealogical theory of legitimate authority that citizens can deploy in
   order to check state power I argue that genealogical narratives have the
   power to impugn the normative authority of purportedly binding decisions
   and orders. Such narratives do so when they reveal a fault in the
   justificatory reasoning offered by state representatives in defense of
   their actions. At the heart of this theory there lies an account of the
   ways in which officers of the state can, and cannot, permissibly offer
   reasons in the course of justifying their decisions to citizens. Polity

Abstract = {This article discusses the findings of an ethnographic content analysis
   of students' written reflections as a means for assessing the learning
   outcomes of teaching introductory American politics in comparative
   perspective. It focuses especially on determining whether and how this
   approach enhanced students' understanding and retention of knowledge
   about U.S. government and politics by presenting them with cognitive
   conflict tasks that entail their appreciation of alternative approaches
   to situation assessment and problem resolution. In addition, it
   evaluates the extent to which learning about American politics in
   comparative perspective prompted political engagement and identifies
   some additional learning outcomes that have not been anticipated in
   previous scholarship.},

   policy},
Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {14},
Number = {2},
Pages = {235-257},
Abstract = {Environmental ethicists often criticize liberalism. For many liberals
   embrace anthropocentric theories on which only humans have
   noninstrumental value. Environmental ethicists argue that such liberals
   fail to account for many things that matter or provide an ethic
   sufficient for addressing climate change. These critics suggest that
   many parts of nature - e.g. non- human individuals, other species,
   ecosystems and the biosphere - often these critics also hold that
   concern for some parts of nature does not always trump concern for
   others. This article suggests, however, that such inclusive
   environmental ethicists have a different problem. For when there are
   many things of value, figuring out what to do can be extremely
   difficult. Even though climate change is likely to cause problems for
   many parts of nature, it will probably be good for some other parts.
   Inclusive environmental ethicists need a theory taking all of the things
   they care about into account. Otherwise they cannot provide definitive
   reason even to address climate change. Without this theory,
   anthropocentric liberals might argue that we should not accept an
   inclusive environmental ethic. Although there may be something wrong
   with this line of thought, it at least raises a puzzle for those
   inclined to accept these ethics.},

Pages = {117-122},
Abstract = {Marx and Engels argue that capitalism must ultimately destroy itself
   because it contains an internal contradiction: Capitalism requires wage
   laborers at first to be in competitive isolation from one another, lest
   their common interests become transparent and they unite collectively to
   improve their employment conditions. At a certain later stage of
   capitalism's historical development, however, competition eventually
   forces capitalists to bring their workers together in common workplaces
   (factories), where their shared interests can be immediately perceived
   and mutual grievances directly communicated. The Communist Manifesto's
   argument for the inevitable downfall of capitalism is epistemically
   naive in several ways, resting as it does on the idea that material
   interests are perceivable, and that an awareness of common problems
   translates automatically into a sense of shared interests powerful
   enough to motivate coordinated action for the sake of achieving
   economic-political reform.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to contribute to the evolving literature on the
   scholarship of teaching and learning. We do this by describing and then
   reflecting on what we have learned from a year-long freshman applied
   research seminar, ``International Affairs Knowledge and U.S. Foreign
   Policy Opinions.'' After surveying the literature on public opinion and
   U.S. foreign policy and materials on survey research and design, the
   students devised, pretested, administered (to 1300+ undergraduates),
   analyzed a survey and presented their findings. To do this, we had to
   provide them, in an abbreviated time frame, survey design, basic
   statistics as well as statistical software and work with themon how to
   summarize and present their findings. Their paper (Arbitter et al.,
   2010), in which some of their findings from the survey accord with the
   preexisting literature and much of it go beyond that, is one way of
   assessing our course. But, in this article, we discuss the ways such a
   course can meet many of the challenges held out to us as educators by
   such bodies as the Association of American Colleges and Universities
   (AAC\&U), especially if those following this path take advantage of the
   lessons we have learned.},

Journal = {POLITIX},

Pages = {81+},
Abstract = {The life course stories of elderly activists shows that this activism
   has to be linked with to types of explanations. On the one hand, this
   activism has to be read as the product of the exclusion from others
   organisations that these members have get through due to their age. On
   the other hand, this activism has to be read as the product of their
   will to be committed with people from the same generation. Therefore
   elderly organizations are less a place where elderly interests are
   defended than a place where elderly people can continue some kind of
   activism. Finally, this paper demonstrates that the comprehension of
   where elderly people get involved as activist has to be linked with the
   structure of inequality (i.e. the age segregation) that exists in social
   movements as in the whole society.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {50},
Number = {1},
Pages = {80-109},

Abstract = {There is a theoretical disagreement between the classical normative
   positive view on decentralisation, which states that the fragmentation
   of power shifts policy more closely into line with citizens'
   preferences, and a more recent critical view that states that
   decentralisation blurs attribution of responsibility. This disagreement
   can only be resolved by refining the understanding of specific
   institutional designs. The theoretical claim in this article is that the
   relation between multilevel governance and clarity of responsibilities
   is contingent upon the type of decentralisation in place. To test this
   proposition, individual data from an asymmetrically decentralised system
   - the Spanish State of Autonomies - are used. Results show that the
   relationship between decentralisation and clarity of responsibility has
   a u-shape. Responsibility attribution is clearer in regions with high
   and low levels of decentralisation, where one level of government
   clearly predominates over the other, than in regions with a more
   intertwined distribution of powers.},

   their research. We clarify the distinction between these concepts in an
   effort to help reduce discrimination and defuse misconceptions,

   fruitful for us as a discipline to better communicate this research to
   the wider public in the hope that public opinion and elite discourse
   will shift in a more tolerant and positive direction as a result.},

Title = {The Politics of Speed: Connolly, Wolin, and the Prospects for Democratic
   Citizenship in an Accelerated Polity},
Journal = {POLITY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {43},
Number = {1},
Pages = {58-83},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Is there a speed limit for democracy? Do the system imperatives of
   late-modern economic polities necessitate a shrinking of democratic
   oversight and control? Are the accelerated life-experiences of citizens
   in late modernity fundamentally hostile to the formation of civic
   identities, deliberative skills, and democratic habits? In this paper I
   examine recent work in democratic theory on social acceleration in order
   to address these questions. I argue that liberal theorists such as
   William Scheuerman focus excessively on institutional adjustments to the
   democratic polity rather than on ways in which democratic participation
   can be nurtured in an attempt to surmount the challenges of social
   acceleration. At the same time, radical pluralists such as William
   Connolly come close to romanticizing the effects of speed while ignoring
   its ill consequences for democracy (and for pluralism). I end the paper
   with an examination of the work of Sheldon Wolin, whose understanding of
   democracy has led him to formulate the idea of a ``multiple civic
   self{''} that is nurtured through slow-time political practices. Wolin's
   theory of the multiple civic self, I argue, offers us the best way to
   think about the challenges for democracy represented by social
   acceleration, especially in conversation with Connolly's emphasis on
   ``bicameral{''} citizenship and Bonnie Honig's treatment of the ``Slow
   Food{''} movement. Polity (2011) 43, 58-83. doi:10.1057/pol.2010.23;

Abstract = {In this article, I argue for a Marxian approach to critical terrorism
   studies. The methodological approach of critical terrorism studies
   focuses on the ways in which particular sets of state managers and/or
   agents working in conjunction with them are more or less directly
   implicated in specific terrorist `events', but my contention which
   complements an insight made by Richard Jackson - is that there is a need
   for more theory-laden analyses of the deeper, structural causes of state
   terrorism. I address this issue by advocating more sustained engagement
   with broader political-economic issues, and in particular to the ways in
   which capitalist development, capitalist imperialism and international
   class dynamics intersect not just to enable state terrorism but to
   actively produce it.},

Abstract = {Under the assumption of the original position, Rawls' theory of justice
   distinguishes two spheres of goods (basic rights, further social primary
   goods), each being submitted to its own principle, and the one enjoying
   lexical - i.e. absolute - priority over the other. The principle of the
   first sphere of goods is equality, the principle of the second is the
   difference principle. This paper criticizes this conception on several
   accounts. In our moral intuitions, we restrict the means devoted to the
   realization of basic rights for reasons that may be related to either
   the difference principle or to such other principles as ``number
   matters{''}. The way to these trade-offs does not start from Rawls'
   original position, but rather from a kind of deliberative democracy. At
   the opposite of the veil of ignorance, deliberative democracy takes into
   account all situated points of view and interests, while caring for all
   of them to be expressed in the public debate and for each of them having
   its arguments carefully taken into account in the decision process in a
   way that is not dependent on relationships of power. Public reason
   should also consider a more extended list of goods necessary for a
   conception of one's good life than Rawls does. Relative or comparative
   goods are necessary for realizing some projects of life. The original
   position hides the individual position of the participant, but not this
   general fact of human nature. Since Rawls does not adopt any rousseauist
   framework that would suppress the enjoyment of relative goods (in fact,
   such a framework would contradict the difference principle), he should
   modify the initial situation on which he constructs his theory. It
   should not be the original position, but rather Thomas Nagel's kantian
   view from nowhere.},

Abstract = {The paper analyses both the conflict between the federal government and
   organized crime groups, and the war between the organized crime groups
   themselves in Mexico at the beginning of the 21st century. The
   analytical framework consists of the analysis of violence and the
   dynamics of the conflicts according to the theoretical background
   defined by the Uppsala Conflict Data Program. The article briefly
   discusses the history of conflict, the relevant actors, incompatibility
   of values, the dynamics of clashes and possible solutions.},

Abstract = {With reference to three secondary schools in Beijing, this study
   investigates students' perceptions of multiple identities at four levels
   - self, local, national, and global - and the ways in which students
   form multiple identities. The study uses a mixed methodology of
   questionnaires and interview surveys to collect data, and identifies
   four patterns of Beijing students' multiple identities: a high value on
   self-identity, a strong affective orientation toward local and national
   identity, minimal distinction between local and national identities, and
   an imagined global identity. This study provides empirical data that
   both supplements and challenges the existing literature on citizenship
   and citizenship education in the context of globalization.},

   Including policy-style writing assignments in the curriculum teaches
   undergraduates the skills demanded by their future employers, helps
   future academics learn how to write grant and conference proposals,
   offers students practice at the highest levels of Bloom's taxonomy of
   learning, hones synthesis and analysis, teaches students to be
   client-oriented, and makes students more effective citizens.},

Abstract = {This work uses several empirical approaches to examine the effects of
   poverty and inequality on violence in the seven metropolitan areas in
   Colombia. To this end, this study describes the main determinants of
   violence in these cities; these determinants are all fundamental
   features of social instability. For this description, this paper uses
   several econometric approximations to compare and determine an adequate
   estimator for the analysis of Colombian urban violence. This hypothesis
   was supported by evidence showing that factors related to poverty,
   inequality, and education directly influenced violence in the cities.
   Because of their effects over time and their incidence rates across

Abstract = {The literature on legislative recruitment has existed largely
   independently of the literature on party clientelism in new democracies.
   The Romanian data on parliamentary representation can be used to show
   how the study of recruitment practices improves scholars' understanding
   of clientelistic exchanges between political parties and resource-rich
   constituencies. The findings point to considerable differences in
   recruitment patterns in new and established democracies, which can be
   traced to parties and interest groups' calculus of payoffs under
   different types of political regimes.},

Abstract = {The article is devoted to the analysis of the historical experience and
   prospects of constructing regional Siberian identity. The author focuses
   his attention on the peculiar social movement that originated in the
   second half of the 19 th century and was known as the ``Siberian
   regionalism{''}. Having conducted the detailed analysis of regionalists'
   theoretical constructions and real activity, A. Remnev shows that the
   factors that prevented the transition of the ``Siberian issue{''} into
   the stage of political separatism were for the most part of a temporary
   character. He draws the conclusion that regional identity of Siberians
   is still open for elaboration, and economic dependence, social and
   cultural abjection of Siberia, incompletion of integration processes
   under the conditions of inequality of territories might turn into the
   ground for protest and separatist sentiments.},

Abstract = {Philip Pettit's neo-Roman republican theory of non-domination is billed
   as a more egalitarian alternative to classical liberal theories of
   non-interference. As a theory of geopolitical affairs, however, his
   republicanism fails to fulfill this egalitarian promise in ways that
   closely echo John Rawls's liberal law of peoples. Pettit's republican
   law of peoples is ill equipped to address structural sources of
   transnational and global domination because it exaggerates the
   ontological separateness of peoples, it overvalues the self-sufficiency
   of states for purposes of achieving internal non-domination, and it
   conceives of domination too narrowly as an evil that must be
   intentionally or negligently imposed by identifiableagents.},

Pages = {208-223},
Abstract = {Grades matter. College grading systems, however, are often ad hoc and
   prone to mistakes. This essay focuses on one factor that contributes to
   high-quality grading systems: grading accuracy (or ``efficiency''). I
   proceed in several steps. First, I discuss the elements of ``efficient''
   (i. e., accurate) grading. Next, I present analytical results indicating
   how often our grading schemes are likely to be inefficient, and I also
   discuss the causes for grading inefficiency. The following sections
   describe ways to make our grading systems more efficient, especially by
   increasing the number of scores and by providing clearer guidance on
   what constitutes high-quality performance. Finally, I offer data from my
   own ``natural'' experiment in grading and offer some concluding
   comments.},

Abstract = {Feminist philosophy can make an important contribution to the field of
   genocide studies, and issues relating to gender and war are gaining new
   attention. In this article I trace legal and philosophical analyses of
   sexual violence against women in war. I analyze the strengths and
   limitations of the concept of social death-introduced into this field by
   Claudia Cardfor understanding the genocidal features of war rape, and
   draw on the work of Hannah Arendt to understand the central harm of
   genocide as an assault on natality. The threat to natality posed by the
   harms of rape, forced pregnancy and forced maternity lie in the
   potential expulsion from the public world of certain groups-including
   women who are victims, members of the `enemy' group, and children born
   of forced birth.},

   Organizational Culture in Civil Society Politicality},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CIVIL SOCIETY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Pages = {41-61},
Abstract = {This article explores the relation between organizational culture and
   the politicality of civil society organizations, or rather their social
   construction as political. It is based on a case study of a network (NW)
   of human rights NGOs in Nepal during the last few years of a Maoist
   insurgency and the period of autocratic rule by ex-king Gyanendra, and
   its immediate aftermath. Through detailed ethnographic material, this
   article highlights the central role of the NW's organizational culture
   in allowing it to act in ways that were recognized as political.
   Specifically, it shows how a process of `de-NGOization' of everyday
   practices and values enabled NW to become a credible actor for political
   change during a crucial period of Nepal's history. This article
   contributes to the ethnography of civil society, urges that more
   attention be paid to the relation of civil society to the political
   domain, and suggests ways forward in researching this topic.},

Title = {So Why Did the Guns Fall Silent? How Interplay, not Stalemate, Explains
   the Northern Ireland Peace Process},
Journal = {IRISH POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {26},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-18},
Abstract = {The precise rationale for, and timing of, the Northern Ireland peace
   process of the 1990s and beyond, which developed after more than two
   decades of conflict, has yet to be fully explained. It has been a common
   assumption that it arose from a stalemate involving the Irish Republican
   Army (IRA), the `regular' pro-state forces of the British Army and Royal
   Ulster Constabulary and the `irregular/ultra' pro-state loyalist
   paramilitary groups of the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) and Ulster
   Defence Association (UDA). Under this interpretation,
   military/paramilitary deadlock led to ripeness for peace, amid
   reappraisals by all parties to the conflict of the utility of violence
   accompanied by reinterpretations of earlier political orthodoxies. The
   IRA could not remove the British sovereign claim to Northern Ireland;
   British forces could not militarily defeat the IRA and loyalists and
   republicans were engaged in a futile inter-communal sectarian war. This
   stalemate thesis has obvious attraction in explaining why a seemingly
   intractable war finally subsided, but is less convincing when subject to
   empirical testing among republican and loyalist participants in the
   conflict. This article moves away from `top-down' generalist narratives
   of the onset of peace, which tend to argue the stalemate thesis, to
   assess `bottom-up' interpretations from the actual combatants as to why
   they ceased fighting. It suggests an asymmetry, rather than mutuality,
   of perception that there was `military' cessation by the armed non-state
   groups, with neither republican nor loyalist interpretations grounded in
   notions of stalemate. The article concludes by urging a wider
   consideration of the important and persistent interplay of the military
   and political in conflicts such as Northern Ireland.},

Abstract = {This article examines the implications of two distinct phases of
   international engagement in Kosovo. We argue that a number of flaws
   developed during UNMIK's administration (1999-2008), which continue to
   undermine Kosovo's stability. We then disentangle the complex
   inter-institutional relations between ICO, EULEX, UNMIK and the OSCE.
   Indeed, their incompatible positions towards Kosovo's status results in
   a lack of clarity, coordination and coherence that weaken Kosovo within
   four policy areas: Kosovo's international recognition and participation,
   the rule of law, interethnic relations and the fate of North Kosovo.
   While these shortcomings could be viewed as `unintended consequences',
   we argue more broadly that the Kosovo case illustrates the limits of
   liberal peacebuilding and the tensions and implications of strategic
   peacebuilding.},

Title = {Contesting Europe, or Germany's Place in Europe? European Integration
   and the EU Policies of the Grand Coalition Government in the Mirror of
   Parliamentary Debates in the Bundestag},
Journal = {GERMAN POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {20},
Number = {4},
Pages = {486-505},
Abstract = {This article explores how European integration is contested between
   political parties in debates of the German Bundestag. Distinguishing
   between `domestic' debates about the conduct of EU policy-making by the
   German government and `supranational' debates about the institutions and
   policies of the European Union, the article asks for thematic objects
   and patterns of polarisation between parties within these debates.
   Presenting empirical evidence from the manual coding of 23 plenary
   debates during the second `Grand Coalition' government, it is shown that
   the polarisation between parliamentary parties differs greatly at both
   levels of discussion. Whereas the antagonism between government and
   opposition appears to determine the polarisation of parties in
   `domestic' debates, more ambiguous and atypical position patterns emerge
   on behalf of supranational issues. Therefore, the article suggests that
   a differentiation of various levels of debate is helpful in capturing
   the polarisation of political parties over the issue of European
   integration.},

Abstract = {In this article, we present a new theory that, given the economic
   consequences of military spending, some governments may use military
   spending as a means of advancing their domestic non-military objectives.
   Based on evidence that governments can use military spending as welfare
   policy in disguise, we argue that the role of ideology in shaping
   military spending is more complicated than simple left-right politics.
   We also present a theory that strategic elites take advantage of
   opportunities presented by international events, leading us to expect
   governments that favor more hawkish foreign policy policies to use
   low-level international conflicts as opportunities for increasing
   military spending. Using pooled time-series data from 19 advanced
   democracies in the post-World War II period, we find that government
   ideology, measured as welfare and international positions, interacts
   with the international security environment to affect defense spending.},

Abstract = {This chapter focuses on how the United Kingdom, historically and
   contemporarily, has generally resolved the dichotomy between the
   conflicting public interest principles of media freedom to publish and
   governmental duty to protect, in the field of national security. The
   fundamental principles common to all democracies are discussed, the
   history of UK government/media interaction described, two detailed
   recent case studies are used of the UK's system of officially informed
   but voluntary self-censorship (during Afghanistan 1 and Iraq 2), and
   lessons on government/media balance are drawn. In today's high-speed
   international communications environment, it is no longer feasible for
   governments to suppress information widely in the public domain
   electronically and in other countries. Governments therefore achieve
   better protection of necessarily secret national and allied security
   information at source by not attempting to suppress publication of other
   security information seen by large numbers of insiders as being of low
   security importance.},

Journal = {AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {46},
Number = {3},
Pages = {389-406},
Abstract = {The Cotonou Partnership between the states of Africa, the Caribbean and
   the Pacific (ACP) and the European Union (EU) provides a case in which
   the human rights approach to development is being put into practice.
   This article uses the partnership to address broader questions regarding
   the effectiveness of the new approach to development. The EU-ACP
   partnership is innovative because it reflects the changing international
   consensus on development, but it is not clear if the norms used in the
   Cotonou Agreement have achieved the consensus needed to comprise any
   real shift in development policy. Moreover, it can be argued that what
   diminishes the efficacy of the human rights approach in the EU-ACP
   relationship is political conditionality as this mechanism may lead to
   interventions that are counterproductive to the establishment of stable
   democracy.},

Title = {Two Imaginaries of Citizenship in Turkey: the Republican and
   ``Ethical{''} Models},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POLITICS CULTURE AND SOCIETY},

Abstract = {Notions of sovereign state-rule and citizenship which rest on the
   twentieth century epistemology of state centrism define the ``right to
   have rights{''} in terms of a national, unified category of state
   membership. In its association of citizenship with state sovereignty,
   the republican citizenship model in Turkey allows the state bureaucracy
   to act with key unitary agency in managing the relationship between
   religion and politics. In contesting the republican model on both
   religious and civil grounds, a notion of ``ethical{''} citizenship has
   emerged based on the extension of rights and freedoms through citizen
   activism. This paper illustrates this process through a comparative
   analysis of the religiously inspired demand by female students to remove
   the headscarf ban and by Alevi individuals to remove the designation of
   Islam from national identification cards.},

Abstract = {Because of its low coal reserves, Hungary is more dependent on natural
   gas and oil imports than other East Central European countries.
   Therefore, in the past two decades, the country has focused on
   integration into the European energy market. Western European companies
   were brought into the country, the Hungarian oil company MOL expanded
   into neighbouring states, and Hungary involved itself in the two major
   gas pipeline projects Nabucco and South Stream. However, the government
   of Viktor Orban is increasingly emphasising autarky and more state
   influence. Conflicts with international investors and the European Union
   are pre-programmed.},

Abstract = {Approximately 2.5 million Hungarians live as national minorities in
   states bordering Hungary. Budapest's policy of promoting these
   communities so that they may preserve their national identity is met
   with scepticism. Neighbouring countries are concerned that this policy
   could trigger secessionist efforts. Before accession to the European
   Union, it had been possible to settle the conflict-laden issue of
   individual and collective minority rights. Now inter-state tensions have
   appeared again. Hungary's passage of a new citizenship law, which allows
   Hungarians abroad to acquire Hungarian citizenship, and its current
   confrontational, ethno-nationalist politics of nationhood are
   responsible for this.},

Abstract = {State politics researchers commonly employ ordinary least squares (OLS)
   regression or one of its variants to test linear hypotheses. However,
   OLS is easily influenced by outliers and thus can produce misleading
   results when the error term distribution has heavy tails. Here we
   demonstrate that median regression (MR), an alternative to OLS that
   conditions the median of the dependent variable (rather than the mean)
   on the independent variables, can be a solution to this problem. Then we
   propose and validate a hypothesis test that applied researchers can use
   to select between OLS and MR in a given sample of data. Finally, we
   present two examples from state politics research in which (1) the test
   selects MR over OLS and (2) differences in results between the two
   methods could lead to different substantive inferences. We conclude that
   MR and the test we propose can improve linear models in state politics
   research.},

   values whose turn has now finally come again. Gyorgy Doerner and Istvan

   want to re-name the house ``Hinterland Theatre{''}. A name with a
   programme. But how do things look in the hinterland? A visit to the
   country's southeast, the small part of the Banat on the Romanian and
   Serbian borders shows: decline and poverty dominate the picture. But

Abstract = {This article examines the relationship between collective memory,
   historical interpretation and political identity. It focuses on the
   dissolution of the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) as
   constructed through collective narrative memory, and on Marxist
   interpretations of history. The divisions within the party and the wider
   Marxist community, stretching from 1956 until 1991, were often framed
   around questions of historical interpretation. The events of 1989-1991
   created an historical and mnemonic crisis for CPGB members who struggled
   to reconcile their past identities with their present situation. Unlike
   the outward-facing revisionism of other political parties, this was an
   intensely personal affair. The solution for many was to emphasise the
   need to find new ways to progress socialist aims, without relying on a
   discredited grand narrative. In contrast, other Communist parties, such
   as the Communist Party of Britain, which had been established (or
   `re-established') in 1988, fared rather better. By adhering to the
   international party line of renewal and continued struggle, the party
   was able to hold its narrative together, condemning the excesses of
   totalitarian regimes, while reaffirming the need for international class
   struggle. British Politics (2011) 6, 453-478. doi:10.1057/bp.2011.24;

Abstract = {Many post-colonial states use ethnically-based redistribution (EBR)
   programs to address economic inequalities between dominant minority
   communities and professedly autochthonous majority communities.
   Nevertheless, despite considerable efforts such programs have generally
   failed in terms of advancing the economic status of majorities. In this
   article I will suggest that EBRs in postcolonial states are not solely
   intended to ameliorate economic gaps, but rather are also a policy tool
   used by governing elites to advance a narrative of state ownership, and
   by extension a decidedly non-liberal notion of democratic citizenship. I
   explore this claim through an analysis of Malaysia and Fiji, two
   post-colonial states characterized by persistent asymmetric claims by
   ethnic majorities who claim legitimacy by virtue of indigenousness. The
   discussion will focus first on the formation, deployment, and
   persistence of claims of ethnic hierarchy by professedly indigenous
   groups. Second, attention will be paid to how such claims are linked to
   demands for ethnically based redistribution following a direct challenge
   to extant ethnic hierarchies. Finally, the policies will be assessed
   both in terms of their stated economic objectives and in terms of their
   ability to generate a broader sense of autochthonous identity.},

Abstract = {This paper begins with an impression: in Hobbes' political philosophy it
   is possible to observe more than one idea of justice. This notion
   applies to actions and men. The first one rests in conformity of our
   actions with civil law. But there are disagreements with the
   interpretation of the second one. We show two different views. That of
   Leo Strauss, who says that justice of men is related with justice of
   passions. But he also says that the last is exclusively associated with
   fear of violent death. The other is F. C. Hood's, who says that this
   kind of justice rests in recognition of the obligation that natural law
   implies, which is an obligation of conscience. This work puts forward
   the following hypothesis: that justice of men has two coexisting
   meanings. First, it consists in justice of passions, but fear of a
   violent death is not alone among the passions that make men just.
   Second, it consists in the will, but not necessarily the act, of
   fulfilling the natural law.},

Abstract = {For years, scholars of elections have argued about whether campaign
   finance limitations adversely affect electoral competition. In this
   article, we examine how the institutional campaign finance restrictions
   differentially affect the performance of incumbents and challengers.
   Using elections for the state high court bench between 1990 and 2004, we
   demonstrate that candidate spending in judicial elections has
   diminishing marginal returns, but that the returns to challenger
   spending diminish more slowly than incumbent spending. Since this is the
   case, campaign finance restrictions that limit candidate spending
   disproportionately harm challengers, increasing the incumbency advantage
   and decreasing electoral competition. More specifically, we show that
   states with more stringent contribution limits have lower levels of
   candidate spending, and these restrictions thus put challengers at a
   competitive disadvantage.},

Abstract = {F. Meinecke gives us two models of the modern-day State: the modem
   Nationalstaat arising from a sense of politics and the modem
   Nationalstaat with a cultural imprint. In the former, the State (founded
   under the Staatsnation doctrine) is essentially political; it is formal
   in character, with a random and voluble content, based on
   ``contractualist{''} underpinnings, whilst its unitary nature stems from
   a ``Jacobin{''} conception. In the second, however, the State (founded
   under the Kulturnation doctrine) is considered to be a cultural product,
   has a substantive character (presupposing a fixed, non-voluble content
   related to the cultural ur-substance, conceived as a basic founding fact
   of the State), stemming from a ``Jacobin{''} conception with intensely
   ``organicist{''} underpinnings. The importance of Meinecke's theory of
   State is that these typified models serve to categorise the majority of
   cases of formation and evolution of the modem State in Europe and Latin
   America from the 19th century to the present time.},

Abstract = {Marxism's insistence on the inherently contradictory nature of
   capitalism remains an enduring strength compared with orthodox accounts,
   which are unable to explain recurrent crises. However, no less inherent
   to capitalism is the transformation of slumps into booms, and Marx saw
   crises as momentary and forcible solutions to capitalism's
   contradictions. Despite this, extensive Marxist controversies have
   concentrated on how capitalism enters rather than how it recovers from
   crises. This paper examines prevailing theories in terms of their
   capacity to explain both sides of capitalism's cyclicity, considering
   their theoretical consistency and offering some provisional empirical
   examinations. None of the major existing interpretations appears
   entirely satisfactory. While the evidence is far from conclusive, this
   essay tentatively suggests a synthetic interpretation based around
   disproportionality and changing value compositions of capital.},

Abstract = {This paper focuses on the left wing political parties which were
   established during the transition process to multiparty system in Turkey
   between 1946 and 1952. I tried to enlighten this process that is very
   significant in Turkish political life as it is considered a turning
   point in democracy struggle and which gives the opposition the
   opportunity to become organized and expresses itself in political the
   area. In this study, I aim at analyzing how this transition process is
   passed through and how open it is to the Turkish left.},

Abstract = {This article, based on studies of nationalism, discusses identity
   formation in the European Union and compares it to the nation-state. The
   starting point is that for all its economic benefits and political
   innovation, the EU is failing to provide people with the sense of
   belonging and extract political loyalty. By exploring what function
   identity serves - for the nation-state in the past and for the EU in the
   present - it is argued that while there are limits to the EU's ability
   to project a meaningful European identity, there are also limits to the
   nation-state's ability to meet the political challenges of contemporary
   societies. One way, and possibly the only way out of this `battle for
   identity' is to acknowledge the real impact of the EU on the
   nation-state and open an honest debate by both European and national
   elites about which challenges of our time can be met by the EU and which
   are better kept at the national level. A better understanding of how
   people's national aspirations, concerns and political demands are
   mediated between different levels of governance may lead to adapting
   their identities accordingly - loyalty and passion for the EU may follow
   too.},

Abstract = {Many artists who identify as politically committed are suspicious of art
   due to the Situationist argument that revolutionary art is impossible.
   If right, the argument also rules out a future artistic avant-garde. I
   believe that, by concentrating on the truth-telling possibilities of
   art, we can meet the Situationist argument. To do so, it is necessary to
   change the relationship art has to everyday life. We can then speculate

Journal = {POLITICS \& POLICY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {39},
Number = {5},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In this study, we explore whether perceptions of the Texas Supreme
   Court's legitimacy are influenced by ``new style{''} judicial campaigns
   and levels of political sophistication. Using a statewide survey of
   Texas registered voters, we find that knowledge about the Texas
   judiciary and politics more generally is associated with higher levels
   of support for the state's supreme court. However, an embedded
   experiment manipulating a judicial candidate's party and issue positions
   does not alter individuals' perceptions of the Texas court. These
   results suggest that concerns over the effect of increasingly
   politicized judicial elections on judicial legitimacy, at least in
   Texas, may be exaggerated.},

Abstract = {Scholars have found source cues-the political actors behind a policy
   issue-to be a potent cause of opinion change. The implication is an
   easily persuaded public. I advance the argument that the public is not
   so easily persuaded. A policy featuring group beneficiaries provides a
   highly informative cue, one that is likely to dominate source cues. This
   insight is based on research demonstrating that people ignore source
   cues if they engage the subject matter at hand. Using a variety of
   experiments, I find that group beneficiary cues often dominate source
   cues. However, I also find that source cues affect opinion if they
   provide unexpected information about (1) an endorsement that is contrary
   to the source's beliefs or (2) feature an extreme, disliked outgroup.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to contribute to the elaboration of a
   deliberative approach to global institutional design. A deliberative
   approach aims to embed processes of mutual reason-giving at the heart of
   international relations and global decision-making. The theoretical
   framework that orientates this discussion is the liberal approach to
   international law developed by John Rawls. It may seem strange to invoke
   this model: after all, Rawls does not specifically discuss the issue of
   global institutional design and indeed has been widely criticized for
   neglecting this topic. In fact, in its account of global public reason,
   Rawls's approach can be shown to contain important and surprisingly
   neglected resources for constructing a dynamic and inclusive theory of
   global deliberative politics.},

Abstract = {Although the overall representation of women in the field of political
   science has increased gradually over the last several decades, most
   gains are being achieved at junior levels. When considering the status
   of women in the profession, it is instructive to incorporate information
   on the presence of women in editorial positions at top-ranked political
   science journals. Our 2010 snapshot of women editors in the top 50
   journals in the field finds that on average, women are reasonably well
   represented in editorial positions in proportion to the ranks they hold
   in the profession overall and at PhD-granting institutions; however,
   substantial variation exists across journals. Our discussion of the
   role-model effect and the gatekeeping power of editors suggests that
   greater inclusion of women and others who bring different perspectives
   to research could result in a more vibrant range of research topics and
   methodological approaches published in a journal.},

Abstract = {Alessandro Stella, Slavery : an economic or a social system?
   The author propose to end here with a historiography of slavery as an
   ``economic model{''}, notably bound in the large plantations. Around the
   world and at European level in the long term, slavery can not be
   associated with any specific form of work organization or at any stage
   of an economy. Slavery comes first as a social construction, like the
   ability to watch as structural possession of a person by another, such
   as the ability to break all family ties in favor of the link to a
   master.},

Title = {Food Security in Iceland},
Journal = {ICELANDIC REVIEW OF POLITICS \& ADMINISTRATION},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {7},
Number = {2},
Pages = {491-510},
Month = {FAL},
Abstract = {The concept of food security applies in both poor and rich societies and
   concerns the steady availability of food in the right quantity and
   quality, at the right price. Globally, policies to assure it remain
   confused and world food prices are rising. Despite large exports of
   fish, Iceland produces only around half of its inhabitants' nutritional
   needs and relies significantly on imports, also for food production
   inputs like fodder and seeds. Icelandic supplies are affected by
   oligopoly in the retail market, and could be put at risk by events in
   other security dimensions ranging from natural disasters and
   infrastructure failures to terrorism, neighbouring conflicts and other
   people's shortages. Icelandic farmers have used the terminology of `food
   security' to press their claims for more home-grown production, and more
   recently also in their campaign against EU membership. The general
   public however shows little sign of security-awareness in this field.
   The government possesses suitable non-military security frameworks to
   address food-related risks and has initiated useful, general and
   specific, studies. Yet it has not developed a strategy or contingency
   plan for food security, even following the lessons of the 2008 economic
   crash and 2010-2011 eruptions. Suitable remedies would include larger
   emergency stocks and a range of measures to reduce vulnerability and
   improve resilience in crises. Above all, Iceland needs a balanced and
   open policy-making process to decide what its general future strategy
   should be as a food-producing and - importing nation. Food security
   could then be more precisely defined and pursued with the aim of
   minimizing threats and risks to that agreed vision.},

Abstract = {For twelve years New Labour as the governing party of the UK was
   apparently obsessed with control, ensuring as far as possible that every
   aspect of government policy remained centrally directed. However, there
   was also a growth in the use and importance of third sector agencies in
   the delivery, and latterly, in the strategic development of, public
   policy. This created an implementation gap in the delivery of policy and
   a problem in ensuring that key policy makers from the third sector
   remain `on-message'. In this paper we will demonstrate the difficulties
   that existed in retaining control while decentralising the delivery and
   development of public policy.},

Abstract = {The article analyzes the new roadmap for Turkey after the summer 2011
   elections as not a ``resumption{''} of unfinished business from the last
   nine years, but from the perspective of the ability of Turkey's ruling
   party, the AK Party, as well as the opposition forces and actors to
   ``transform{''} some anachronistic features of the dominant politics as
   well as deal with troubling new trends in society. The AK Party
   governments made progress in many areas by pushing forward a series of
   far-reaching reforms which have genuinely changed Turkish politics.
   However, Turkey under AK Party rule includes a society which has failed
   to shed its extreme hostility toward different ideas, identities and
   values. Moreover, current opposition parties and movements in Turkey
   continue to be weak in imagination, vision, capacity and leadership,
   which have led to rigidities and even deeper political divisions. More
   importantly, the new government will have to create new possibilities
   out of its past failures and turn paradoxes, contradictions and
   ambiguities in politics and society, in the country and in the region,
   into positive achievements.},

Abstract = {After 1991, almost all European post-Soviet republics evolved into
   authoritarian or, at best, hybrid regimes. The absence of an EU
   accession prospective that supported democratization in Central-Eastern
   Europe is only one aspect to consider for explaining the failure of
   democratization in the European post-Soviet neighbourhood. I argue that
   other elements also matter. This article examines failed democratization
   process through a comparative study of the political transformations in
   Russia, Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine. It formulates some hypotheses on
   democratization prospects in the area. I show that the process of
   transformation can be defined as pre-democratic. Finally, I highlight
   that the processes that should provide these countries with a solid
   democratic foundation suffer from the lack of powerful agents of change.

Abstract = {The French Government has had a complex relationship with globalization.
   Globalization is both a threat and a cradle for ideas. And French
   policy-makers have a love-hate relationship with the global dynamics
   underlying the European higher education reforms started in the 1990s.
   At the outset, higher education reforms, such as the Bologna process,
   were framed as a way to build Europe and fight against international
   competition. Yet, the mode of governance of these reforms mirrored the
   recommendations of international organizations and led to the precise
   outcome criticized in globalization, that is, greater competition. This
   article explores the relationship between international, European and
   domestic discourses and modes of governance. It uses insights from the
   literature on policy transfer and questions the sustainability of such
   ambivalence.},

Abstract = {The authors examine the impact of political party control of government
   on the restrictiveness of a U. S. state's abortion policy, measured by
   the enactment of a parental involvement law. The empirical results show
   that (1) institutional control of a state's legislative and executive
   branches of government by the Republican Party increases the likelihood
   a state will enact a parental involvement law, while Democratic Party
   control decreases this likelihood; (2) the more conservative state
   public opinion is on abortion rights, the more likely a state is to
   enact a parental involvement law; (3) public anti-abortion attitudes do
   not act as a moderating force on the link between political party
   control and the enactment of a parental involvement law; and (4) the
   impact of political party control on the enactment of a parental
   involvement law has grown larger over time.},

Abstract = {Scholars recognize that both citizens and elites may alter their
   behavior in response to salient stimuli. Epstein and Segal's (2000)
   measure of salience for the United States Supreme Court provided a valid
   and reproducible way to assess the political salience of cases. No
   comparable measure exists for state high courts. The authors introduce a
   measure of case salience for state supreme courts that is comprehensive
   and similar to the Epstein-Segal measure. We discuss the utility of this
   measure, compare it to several alternatives, provide descriptive
   statistics, and discuss the relationship between case salience and
   judicial behavior in state supreme courts.},

Abstract = {This article is a comparative study of the Cuban novels El libro de la

   (2006), Paisaje de otono (1998) by Leonardo Padura, and Cien botellas en
   una pared (2002) by Ena Lucia Portela. These narratives show the need of
   deconstructing identitary and teleological statements from the
   revolutionary discourse. Padura and Portela's novels also point out to
   new forms of agency that resist the post-utopian catastrophe, neglecting
   the end of history.},

Abstract = {The study uses a sample of six countries, three of them liberal
   democracies and the other three authoritarian or semi-authoritarian
   autocracies, paired at similar World Bank income classifications. It
   shows that government spending on social programs (such as health and
   education) was independent of the nature of the political system.
   Moreover, the level of government spending on social programs, both as a
   percentage of gross domestic product and of total government spending,
   and increased access or public provision, did not necessarily lead to
   more favorable outcomes in terms of the Human Development Index.
   Countries get similar results with private or nongovernmental funding
   and/or provision of social programs. Thus, in terms of inputs
   (government spending) and outputs or outcomes (human development),
   liberal democracies were not necessarily superior to authoritarian or
   semi-authoritarian countries in protecting economic and social rights,
   except in social security and social welfare programs, primarily for the
   poor and elderly.},

Volume = {41},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {One of the most profound changes in the interest group sector over the
   last fifty years is interest groups' increasing need to attract
   financial donors in order to assure long-term sustainability. Groups'
   growing propensity to attract `chequebook' members is thought to
   compromise their ability to foster the personal involvement of
   individuals in their communities. Yet we know very little about the
   consequences of these dynamics for the strength of the interest group
   sector in American communities. This widespread macro-level analysis of
   the interest group sector indicates that human capital is more important
   than financial capital for the strength of a community's interest group
   sector. Financially disadvantaged communities may still enjoy the
   benefits of a strong interest group sector provided they have a
   citizenry equipped with time to donate.},

Abstract = {In this article, we consider how the factors driving Anglo attitudes
   toward immigration changed in the post-9/11 era. We argue that in the
   aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, the immigration issue became
   nationalized, framed in a threat context. In this context, acculturation
   fear and anti-Latino sentiment are strong predictors of restrictionist
   sentiment; in the pre-9/11 period, these factors have little substantive
   impact on Anglo attitudes. We theorize that the current climate has
   helped ``activate{''} social identities, which in turn has deleterious
   consequences for the Latinos in the United States. Using data from the
   2000 and 2004 National Election Studies, we estimate a model of Anglo
   immigration attitudes. We show indicators of acculturation fear,
   anti-Latino sentiment, and media exposure significantly relate to Anglo
   immigration attitudes in the post-9/11 period but not the pre-9/11
   period.},

Abstract = {The public health paradigm provides a comprehensive framework for
   identifying target groups for action, setting objectives, identifying
   factors that influence risky behaviours, and generating policies to
   facilitate positive changes. What a public health approach lacks is a
   framework for the implementation of programs, and particularly with
   respect to communicating with and persuading target audiences to adopt
   recommended behaviours. This paper proposes that the discipline of
   marketing not only brings an innovative mindset to program planning, but
   also provides the means for effectively operationalising the conceptual
   frameworks and goals of health promotion and public health. Marketing
   not only includes an ecological perspective, but draws heavily from the
   social sciences with respect to models of attitude and behaviour change.
   This paper proposes that social marketing in the health area is the
   integration of marketing, the public health paradigm and the health
   promotion Ottawa Charter. This is illustrated by reference to a ` new
   4Ps'that complement marketing's traditional ` 4Ps'and target upstream
   environmental and commercial marketing factors.},

Abstract = {Early analyses of the impact of donor assistance for NGOs across
   post-socialist Eurasia documented the extent to which the ubiquitous new
   NGOs were disconnected from indigenous networks, lacked sustainable
   resources and capacity, and were accountable to donors rather than
   citizens and governments. Although this article does not entirely
   contest such conclusions, it examines the role of NGOs from a different
   normative perspective based on their role as conduits of change rather
   than as emblems of democratic participation or liberal representation.
   However, in its critique, the research does contend that there are three
   fundamental problems with the earlier, somewhat negative analysis: (i)
   too much was being expected of NGOs and donor assistance; (ii) scholars
   were attempting to judge the impact of the intervention far too quickly;
   and (iii) the focus on democracy and civil society obscured the critical
   `governance' impact that certain NGOs were having in terms of
   transforming decision-making and state power `behind the scenes'. From
   the empirical perspective of environmental NGOs in post-conflict Bosnia
   and Serbia, the paper uses a triangulation of quantitative and
   qualitative methods in order to ascertain better the impact of external
   assistance in terms of particular development skills and strategies
   employed by recipients. The conclusion reached is that donor funding
   seems to be exerting a positive longer-term impact on the transactional
   capacities of a small core of environmental NGOs in both locations.
   Organizations with the most developed transactional capacities, and the
   few organizations now able to engage transnationally, have obtained a
   succession of grants over a number of years and have had their
   transactional activities have been funded specifically by international
   donors via block grants. Although this does not necessarily prove a
   positive relationship between donor funding and transactional capacity,
   it nevertheless challenges more negative assessments in the existing
   literature.},

Abstract = {The essay discusses Marx's analysis of ``so-called primitive
   accumulation'' starting from the idea that contemporary global
   capitalism is characterized by new enclosures and by a set of other
   processes long considered characteristic of the historical transition to
   capitalism. A reflection on this temporal short circuit leads the author
   to an investigation of some of the peculiarities and difficulties of
   Marx's method as, for instance, the relationship between the historical
   and the logical order of exposition. Reading the temporal structures of
   capitalism against the backdrop of Marx's analysis of primitive
   accumulation suggests an emphasis on temporal heterogeneity, on the
   intertwining of continuity and rupture, of progress and catastrophe,
   that is far from any ``historicist'' interpretation of Marx. From this
   point of view, the author investigates some of the key questions
   connected to primitive accumulation: the production of labor power as a
   commodity as a specific and strategic form of the production of
   subjectivity, the concept of transition, the role of violence in
   capitalist development, and the relationship between formal and real
   subsumption of labor under capital.},

Abstract = {The dependency ratio (the ratio of the number of children and the
   elderly to the number of the working-age people) is decreasing
   significantly in Turkey, offering a very important opportunity for the
   country to accelerate its socioeconomic development. Yet, the
   opportunity will not last forever: it is expected to close around 2020.
   The best instrument in the hands of Turkey to turn this opportunity to a
   real advantage is improving the quality of education of its education
   services. The results of international tests, however, do not present an
   optimistic picture: According to the PISA 2009 results released by the
   OECD in December 2010, Turkey stands as the 32nd among 34 OECD
   countries, and 40 percent of Turkish 15-year-old students cannot reach
   basic competence level in mathematical literacy. Moreover, socioeconomic
   background plays a huge role in determining the success of the Turkish
   student, and schools are more or less segregated in line with the
   socio-economic background characteristics of their students. This paper
   underscores possible reasons and results of this situation, and what
   alternative future directions Turkey may take if learning outcomes can
   be improved.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This article reports on the findings of archival and field research in
   Nicaragua and includes interviews with 33 top-, mid-, and low-level
   rebel fighters who participated in the Nicaraguan Revolution. Several
   theories in political psychology are used to explore coalition formation
   and cooperation among Sandinista factions. The article also examines the
   lack of cooperation among the Contra fighters during the same time
   period. Several hypotheses are presented identifying sources of the
   Sandinista division into three factions and later unification into a
   single revolutionary force. Finally, the article offers our perspective
   on the factors that hindered cooperation among Contra factions and
   ultimately allowed the Sandinistas to emerge victorious in the
   revolution.},

Abstract = {In a world of growing security concerns, the armed groups outside of
   state environment, have attracted the attention of scholars interested
   in the regime's stability and the consolidation of national states.
   Activities of these actors reveal alternative networks of power,
   authority, independence and self-governance with a variety of
   territorial levels, both smaller and larger than the nation-state
   itself. Based on the analysis of actors as diverse as private police,
   gangs and mafias, this article analyzes the growth and importance of
   non-state armed action, structured around economic activities. Conclude
   with questions about conventional categorizations of states, the armed
   and unarmed, and the nature of sovereignty in the contemporary era.},

Abstract = {The Republic's account of the relation between talking about politics
   and doing politics illuminates the nature of political action. Plato's
   Socrates argues that those who ought to govern are those who know about
   politics and who know what politics is about, since political things are
   images of ideas. Socrates' alternative to democracy is thus an academic
   rather than an aristocratic elite-an elite of those who know. Yet the
   academic elite Plato imagined does not dispute the right of the people
   to decide between it, the aristocrats, and the men of the people.},

Abstract = {This study uses an experimental design to simulate the ballot counting
   process during a hand-recount after a disputed election. Applying
   psychological theories of motivated reasoning to the political process,
   we find that ballot counters' party identification conditionally
   influences their ballot counting decisions. Party identification's
   effect on motivated reasoning is greater when ballot counters are given
   ambiguous, versus specific, instructions for determining voter intent.
   This study's findings have major implications for ballot counting
   procedures throughout the United States and for the use of motivated
   reasoning in the political science literature.},

Abstract = {By way of partial and imperfect state of question, this document covers
   theories and concepts on two central issues: Inequalities and Peace, by
   indentifying different connections in both, theoretical fields and
   social and political actions performed by some iconic figures. Along the
   way, this paper focuses on imperfect peace, understood as those spaces
   and instances where is possible to detect actions that create different
   ways of peace, despite conflictive and violent context.
   Although academic settings do recognize the existence of an
   investigative tradition on inequalities -currently linked with studies
   about development and design, formulation and implementation of public
   policy-, its relation with peace theories is less explored. Studies
   about positive peace just started soon after the second postwar and they
   overcame the traditional idea of peace as the cessation of direct
   violence. Positive Peace is the spotlight for studies that recognize the
   existence of unjust, inequitable and exclusive social and economic
   structures that must be transformed.},

Abstract = {One of the most obvious trends in Western democracies, during the past
   decades, has been the decline of citizens' political support (that is,
   the growth of negative attitudes toward political parties, politicians
   and democracy). One explanation for this trend is that the number of
   political scandals has increased. However, the impact of political
   scandals on political support is not clear. Whereas the dysfunctional
   theory assumes that political scandals in general have an unfavourable
   impact on the political system, functional theory claims that political
   scandals can have positive effects. Using data from an experiment, this
   article analyses which theory is superior. It finds support for the
   dysfunctional theory: support for politicians and political parties was
   significantly eroded after exposure to scandal coverage whereas trust in
   institutions as well as satisfaction with democracy were not affected.
   The article concludes that political scandals contribute to the decline
   of political support.},

Abstract = {This study presents some theoretical considerations of the TEKEL
   workers' resistance movement in Turkey, focusing on four points. Those
   are: working-class formation in tension with identity formation;
   precariousness, which is examined by employing analytical distinctions
   between forms and modes of employment; the struggle for rights as a new
   pattern of class struggle; and the neoliberal citizenship regime, which
   implies sweeping labourers as a class away from the `political society'
   in favour of engagement with their cultural identities.},

Abstract = {Most survey-based research on campaign effects in British elections has
   focussed on exposure to the campaign. Far less attention has been given
   to how the campaign is perceived, although American research on the
   effects of negative campaigning suggests that this is a potentially
   important area. The article investigates the extent to which vote
   choices in the 2007 Scottish Parliament election were affected by
   perceptions of the parties' campaigns as `positive' or `negative'.
   Partisanship and increased exposure to a party's campaign increased
   individuals' chances of rating a campaign positively. Other things being
   equal, however, campaigns which come to be seen in a negative light
   backfire on the party responsible, reducing the propensity of people to
   vote for it. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Climate change has routinely been framed as an issue to be addressed
   through an intergovernmental regime guided by a set of large nations.
   The evolving reality of climate change policy development, in the U.S.
   and abroad, relies heavily on sub-national initiative. This article
   reviews the American climate policy odyssey, examining distinct periods
   in which respective intergovernmental roles have shifted. It devotes
   particular attention to the substantial expansion of state involvement
   between 1998 and 2007 and the more recent experience in which high state
   and federal engagement has produced a period of contested federalism. It
   concludes by exploring the growing likelihood that this arena will
   continue to be dominated in coming years by either state policy or some
   blending of state and federal authority.},

Title = {Committee bias in legislatures with a high degree of party cohesion:
   Evidence from Danish municipalities},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {50},
Number = {3},
Pages = {315-335},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The institution of committees in democratic legislatures has for years
   been said to bias policy making because the preferences of committee
   members differ from, and are more alike than, those of other legislators
   due to self-selection to the committees. Based on an analysis of United
   States Senate committees, Hall and Grofman suggested in 1990 that the
   preferences of committee members primarily diverge from, and are more
   alike than, those of non-committee members on policy issues that are
   salient to constituencies or at least to an easily definable segment of
   constituencies. This article argues that the logic of Hall and Grofman
   should in fact be reversed in legislatures characterised by highly
   cohesive parties. Accordingly, the main hypothesis is that in such
   legislatures the preferences of committee members are more likely to be
   alike than those of non-committee members in the committees that work
   with policy issues of less salience to constituencies. Using a
   large-scale comparative design comprising data collected in 2008 on the
   spending preferences of 1,348 Danish local politicians, evidence is
   found supporting this hypothesis. This finding points to the importance
   of considering the role of parties when assessing committee bias.},

Abstract = {The exchange of rationales among debate participants is necessary for
   legitimacy in a deliberative democracy. I show that witnesses in
   congressional committee hearings tend to use falsifiable rationales when
   they encounter moderate levels of disagreement and shift to
   nonfalsifiable rationales when they encounter extreme disagreement. I
   use data from a coding of hearings testimony on the Medicare program,
   held between 1990 and 2003, as well as from a survey of participating
   witnesses measuring their perceptions of disagreement at the hearing.
   The results identify conditions that enhance falsifiable discourse and
   help to establish the empirical grounding deliberative democratic
   theory.},

Abstract = {Poland's dependency on fossil fuels for energy is ``higher than average.
   Up to 94 percent of the country's electricity comes from coal. The
   mining and energy sectors are powerful pressure groups that block an
   environmentally friendly and sustainable energy supply. Ecological
   awareness in Poland is underdeveloped, climate policy hardly finds any
   acceptance. Critics warn of a vicious circle of backwardness.
   Restructuring for a low-carbon energy supply offers the chance for
   technological innovation, economic modernization, and access to new
   markets. The beginnings of a turnaround in energy and climate policy are
   there. This should be exploited - also in the EU. Energy policy ought to
   become a field of German-Polish cooperation.},

Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {105},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {Optimal jurisdiction size is a cornerstone of government design. A
   strong tradition in political thought argues that democracy thrives in
   smaller jurisdictions, but existing studies of the effects of
   jurisdiction size, mostly cross-sectional in nature, yield ambiguous
   results due to sorting effects and problems of endogeneity. We focus on
   internal political efficacy, a psychological condition that many see as
   necessary for high-quality participatory democracy. We identify a
   quasiexperiment, a large-scale municipal reform in Denmark, which allows
   us to estimate a causal effect of jurisdiction size on internal
   political efficacy. The reform, affecting some municipalities, but not
   all, was implemented by the central government, and resulted in
   exogenous, and substantial, changes in municipal population size. Based
   on survey data collected before and after the reform, we find, using
   various difference-in-difference and matching estimators, that
   jurisdiction size has a causal and sizeable detrimental effect on
   citizens' internal political efficacy.},

Abstract = {Poland is the only country in Europe that did not plunge into a
   recession during the global economic and financial crisis. Its capital
   market was less vulnerable than that of many European countries. Poland
   is not as dependent on exports as other countries in the region. At the
   same time, Poland was able to respond well to the crisis as well. A
   flexible labour market allowed for quick adjustments; a smart monetary
   and currency policy also helped.},

Abstract = {This article explores how the party-defined dimensionality of political
   competition relates to the number of parties competing in legislative
   elections. It demonstrates that a mathematical relationship between the
   number of electoral parties and the literature's concept of
   dimensionality follows from the variables' definitions; conversely, it
   argues that exploring the relationship between the number of electoral
   parties and a different concept of dimensionality conveys new
   information. Hence, it first argues that how we conceptualize
   dimensionality matters. Redirecting attention to the latter
   relationship, it then hypothesizes that party system fragmentation will
   go hand-in-hand with the appearance of new conflicts on the political
   agenda when the electoral system is permissive. Using a time-series
   cross-sectional dataset that includes at its core a new measure of
   dimensionality, it finds reasonable support for the hypotheses; however,
   at the elite level, new parties are found to play less of a role in
   politicizing new conflicts than expected.},

Abstract = {Incumbents are highly likely to win reelection at all levels of
   government, but scholars continue to debate the extent to which serving
   in office has a causal effect on winning. For city council elections it
   is unclear whether or not we should predict a causal effect at all. City
   councilors may not regularly seek reelection, and any apparent advantage
   could be entirely attributable to preexisting qualities rather than
   incumbency. This article uses a regression discontinuity design to
   provide evidence that city council incumbents are more likely to run and
   win their next elections because they served a term in office.},

Abstract = {International structures tie the hands of policy makers in the
   developing world. Dependency on the world economy is blamed for low
   growth, high volatility and less redistribution of income than average,
   but the effect of international constraints on mass politics is
   relatively unknown. This study examines how citizens of developing
   democracies assign responsibility for policy outcomes. A theory of the
   distribution of responsibility, combining insights from the political
   economy of development and the study of mass behaviour, is presented.
   Evidence from seventeen Latin American countries shows that citizens
   often blame policy outcomes on international and private-sector actors,
   to which they, as voters, have no direct recourse. Ties to world markets
   and the International Monetary Fund, especially foreign debt, shift
   responsibility towards international actors and tend to exonerate
   national politicians.},

Abstract = {This article discusses the changing influences on migration that
   destination states of migrant workers are exerting through bilateral
   labor agreements. As neoliberal trade policies have become more common
   across the Asia-Pacific, labor agreements have proliferated as well.
   Both bilateral and regional free trade agreements are now in place or
   under negotiation across the region. Likewise, states are engaging in
   labor relations liberalization through bilateral agreements,
   particularly those concluded between states with labor surpluses and
   others with labor shortfalls. Within these bilateral frameworks, new
   targeted migrant schemes have been introduced to expedite the process of
   getting workers to where they are needed. Workers' welfare has also been
   a hallmark of such agreements. This article will analyze several cases
   of agreements between the Philippines and migrant worker destination
   states in an attempt to find a model for bilateral labor agreements. The
   model could then be used to entice destination states hitherto reluctant
   to forge bilateral labor agreements into engagement with the Philippines
   on the issue. This research fills a void in the literature in regard to
   the structure and content of completed bilateral labor agreements
   between states. Although case studies from the Philippines will be used,
   it is expected that analysis and conclusions drawn will have wide
   regional applicability.},

Abstract = {In this article I argue that modern and postmodern critics of value
   theory share the premise that Marx's theory of value disables the
   project of emancipatory social change. The modern critics claim the
   theory is logically flawed and must be either resituated in a consistent
   logical framework or replaced by a Sraffian alternative. The postmodern
   critics claim that the theory is necessarily reductionist and excludes
   or renders secondary important axes of social struggle. I argue that by
   using a poststructural logic, Marx's theory of value can be interpreted
   in a way that both overcomes the perceived consistencies of the modern
   critics and is nonreductionist, allowing for the integration of
   noneconomic aspects of social struggle.},

Volume = {9},

Abstract = {France's regional languages have long suffered as a result of the French
   republican model, which denies the existence of minorities and hence the
   possibility of granting minority rights. It is sometimes argued by
   language rights specialists, however, that these should not be seen as
   special collective rights so much as linguistic aspects of existing
   fundamental individual rights. The present article examines France's
   potential to exploit instead this latter conception of language rights,
   building on the new constitutional status granted to the country's
   regional languages in 2008 to form a fresh approach to minority
   languages. Not only could this strengthen French republicanism, but
   could also serve as a useful model for language rights in other contexts
   that favour individual rights over groups rights.},

Abstract = {The crisis Argentina faced in the late 1980s legitimized a diagnosis
   that linked the country's poor economic performance to an inward-looking
   economy, excessive fiscal spending, unwarranted state regulations, a
   misguided set of incentives that failed to boost competitiveness and the
   ``economic populism{''} that privileged political goals over economic
   efficiency. Alternatively, the solution was sought in policies that
   privileged deregulation, the free flow of commodities and capital,
   privatization and a selective intervention of the state in the economy.
   In this article we will account for the shape of neoliberal
   restructuring in Argentina by drawing attention to the heavy costs
   stabilization imposed on the country as the decade progressed. We will
   emphasize the costs the workers were called on to bear and the responses
   that emerged from them to challenge neoliberalism.},

Abstract = {This article maps how Canadian political science has considered and
   shaped the logic of ``identity{''} across the institutional, societal
   and governance dimensions of this disciplinary subfield. Focusing on the
   ubiquitous analytic absence of ``race{''} in the mainstream literature,
   this article argues that mainstream Canadian political science
   reproduces a logic that limits the conversation to particular dimensions
   of `identity' (identity' as a basis of political action, a collective
   phenomenon denoting sameness and a core aspect of individual/collective
   selfhood) at the expense of others ('identity' as a product of social or
   political action, a product of multiple and competing discourses and a
   governmentality). In addition to this logic of `identity', eight
   methodological tendencies in the mainstream literature further impede
   analyses of `race'. By challenging these methodological tendencies,
   abandoning `identity' as an analytic category and reflecting on the
   consequences of deactivating and erasing `race', Canadian political
   scientists may become better equipped to interrogate the operating logic
   of `identity', to substantively incorporate `race' as a conceptual,
   analytic and explanatory device, and perhaps most critically, begin to
   redefine the canon.},

Abstract = {This article aims to evaluate the emerging patterns of decision-making
   in the European Union after the first Eastern enlargement through an
   analysis of voting positions in the Council of Ministers. By applying
   three methods (cluster analysis, factor analysis and Bayesian
   item-response modelling), it assesses the new spatial dimensions of EU
   policy-making. The results show that the level of open contestation at
   the Council meetings has risen following enlargement, but the general
   coalition-building patterns remain similar to the ones in the old EU.
   The analysis also indicates that it is possible to identify a winning
   coalition that constitutes the critical mass of the qualified majority
   of weighted votes for the periods before and after the Eastern
   enlargement. Furthermore, the size of the largest coalition in relation
   to the qualified majority threshold becomes smaller in the EU of 25
   member states, which may herald a new era of increased policy stability.},

Abstract = {Most scholarship on minority descriptive representation focuses on
   whether minority legislators are ``more{''} supportive of minority
   concerns than white legislators but does not address how descriptive
   representatives differ in the use of decision-making cues when
   advocating for minority interests. Drawing on data from four Congresses
   and comparing two sets of minority group representatives with their
   white counterparts and each other, the authors show that an important
   effect of descriptive representation is that racial/ethnic minority
   representatives are uniquely influenced in their advocacy of minority
   interests by cues that stand apart from the conventional
   liberal/conservative political ideological frame.},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Political socialization research has focused on the role of parents,
   extracurricular activities, and the school curriculum during adolescence
   on shaping early adult political behavior (Beck \& Jennings, 1982;
   Flanagan, Syvertsen, \& Stout, 2007; Torney-Purta, Richardson, \&
   Barber, 2004). However, no study to date has examined how properties of
   adolescents' social networks affect the development of adult political
   outcomes. Using social network analysis, we find that both a
   respondent's social integration in high school and his friends'
   perceptions of their own social integration affect the respondent's
   later political behavior as a young adult. Peer and network effects are
   at work in political socialization. This has important implications for
   our understanding of the development of social capital, political trust,
   and political participation, as well as our general understanding about
   how one's social network influences one's own attitudes and behavior.},

Abstract = {While the Scandinavian countries are well-known for their
   gender-egalitarian policies, there are important intra-Scandinavian
   policy differences. Through a comparative-historical analysis of Norway
   and Sweden, this article illustrates how structural factors (economic
   and political) and ideational factors (gender and religion) interact and
   combine to produce the particular national policy outcomes in the post-
   Second World War period, using public childcare as a comparative case
   study. The economic developments pursued by the countries in the postwar
   period are key to understanding the political party dynamics, the
   perpetuation (or lack thereof) of religious and centre-periphery
   cleavages, as well as the change in the political leadership's
   gender-ideological orientations, and the consequences of these factors
   for the evolution of public childcare policy. Norway has no
   institutionalised childcare guarantee, private ownership of childcare is
   high and religion plays a role in the national preschool curriculum. In
   contrast, Sweden has a binding national childcare guarantee, public
   ownership remains high and religion plays no role in the preschool
   curriculum. The policy differences are theoretically interesting as
   factors commonly hypothesised as important to gender-egalitarian policy
   outcome - on their own, or combined - cannot explain these differences.
   Thus, this article contributes important knowledge about the causal
   mechanisms behind gender-egalitarian policy development. The study fills
   a gap in the comparative welfare state literature by showing how
   structural and ideational factors are mutually reinforcing.},

Abstract = {We report the results of the first large-scale experiment involving paid
   political advertising. During the opening months of a 2006 gubernatorial
   campaign, approximately \$2 million of television and radio advertising
   on behalf of the incumbent candidate was deployed experimentally. In
   each experimental media market, the launch date and volume of television
   advertising were randomly assigned. In order to gauge movement in public
   opinion, a tracking poll conducted brief telephone interviews with
   approximately 1,000 registered voters each day and a brief follow-up one
   month after the conclusion of the television campaign. Results indicate
   that televised ads have strong but short-lived effects on voting
   preferences. The ephemeral nature of these effects is more consistent
   with psychological models of priming than with models of on-line
   processing.},

Abstract = {When faced with a regulatory constraint, firms can either comply, bribe
   the regulator to get around the rule, or lobby the government to relax
   it. We analyze this choice, and its consequences, in a simple dynamic
   model. In equilibrium, when the level of development is low, firms are
   more inclined to bend the rule through bribery but they tend to switch
   to lobbying when the level of development is sufficiently high. Bribery,
   however, is associated with holdup problems, which discourage firms from
   investing. If the holdup problems are severe, firms will never invest
   enough to make lobbying worthwhile. The country may then be stuck in a
   poverty trap with bribery forever. The model can account for the common
   perception that bribery is relatively more common in poor countries,
   whereas lobbying is relatively more common in rich ones.},

Title = {MILITARY SUPERVISION OF DEMOCRACY IN EGYPT: ENDEAVOURS OF THE ARMY TO

Abstract = {The text analyzes the ambivalent role of the army in the recent Egyptian
   revolution and the ensuing process of democratic transition. On the one
   hand, the overthrow of Hosni Mubarak's regime was a result of the
   activity of the army, which supported the protesters since the onset of
   the revolution. The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, the military
   body which has taken over power in Egypt, promises to ensure a peaceful
   transfer of power within a free and democratic system. On the other
   hand, some acts of the military authorities in the transitional period
   suggest that, in the next period of time, precisely the army could
   become the main blocking factor of the process of democratization. The
   authors deem that the main goal of the army is not to hold on to power,
   but to build such a political system in which it would enjoy a
   privileged position, free from civilian control. In the authors'
   judgement, if a halt to the process of democratization is to be
   prevented, the USA must make use of its influence and persuade the
   military leaders, who are preoccupied with their own reputation among
   the public, to carry through the initiated reforms.},

Abstract = {The Arctic has significant potential in natural gas, oil, and other raw
   materials. The development of fields requires enormous investments and
   technical skill. The predicted decrease in ice in the wake of climate
   change could benefit the exploration for and extraction of these raw
   materials. However, due to the sensitive ecological system, the highest
   environmental standards are to be applied. The greatest share of
   deposits is located in areas whose legal status has been clarified. The
   idea of a conflict over the resources is exaggerated. In fact, the
   situation lends itself to the joint extraction of resources.},

   whether undertaking these actions could be described as a responsible

   being a great power, the United States has a responsibility to act
   legally, legitimately and prudently. This framework is then applied to
   the current case study. The analysis concludes that it is not possible

Abstract = {Previous field experimental studies of the effects of e-mails on turnout
   show that e-mails are not effective at boosting turnout, even among
   populations that frequently use e-mail. However, these studies have
   primarily relied on text-only e-mails. The authors attempt to increase
   registration and turnout among university undergraduates by sending them
   videos created by fellow students encouraging students to register and
   vote. These videos are created by peers, are more engaging than text,
   and may appeal to individuals who are not likely to vote anyway. Field
   experimental results show that sending a video by e-mail did not
   increase registration or turnout. The authors conclude with a discussion
   of other methods that may be effective in increasing turnout in an
   online campaign.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF GENOCIDE RESEARCH},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {13},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {393-419},
Abstract = {The 1971 war in South Asia that ended with the break-up of Pakistan and
   the creation of Bangladesh has been framed in terms of genocide in
   popular representations and the nationalist history of Bangladesh. It
   has been depicted as genocide by the Pakistan army against the
   linguistically defined ethnic Bengalis in East Pakistan, in which three
   million Bengalis were said to have been killed. This article explores
   some of the problems with categorizing the killings of 1971; assesses,
   using detailed information on many incidents of violence during the
   year, which of them might be termed genocide according to the 1948 UN
   Convention for the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide;
   considers how to treat those crimes that do not fit the definition of
   genocide, and what the implications are for the quest for justice for
   the crimes of 1971. It concludes that genocide is not the most useful
   framework to analyze the conflict; that some of the killings committed
   by both sides could be termed genocide while others might not, but that
   they still constitute serious crimes; and that a broader
   conceptualization of the violence of the war and engagement by the
   international community were necessary to achieve true justice for the
   victims of violence in 1971.},

   German Left},
Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {34},
Number = {4},
Pages = {683-705},
Abstract = {This article explores the relationship between hard economic times,
   inequality, and support for the far Left, using the case of Die Linke,
   or `Left party', in Germany. Using recent survey data, the relationship
   among voters' social characteristics, economic attitudes, and rising
   electoral support for Die Linke is explored. In Germany, support for the
   far Left does not appear to be based solely on ideological extremism or
   economic pessimism, but also on beliefs about economic inequalities and
   governmental policy responses. This evidence indicates that supporters
   of the far Left are not simply `the losers' from economic modernisation,
   but rather citizens in both Eastern and Western Germany characterised by
   shared social and economic circumstances and similar beliefs about
   economic redistribution. It also suggests fruitful avenues for research
   on the relationship between economic decline and support for the Left
   across advanced industrial democracies.},

Title = {Communication of collective identity in secret social groups: Hypothesis
   of a holographic signature of member affiliation},
Journal = {BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES OF TERRORISM AND POLITICAL AGGRESSION},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {3},
Number = {3},
Pages = {198-224},
Abstract = {This work describes the theoretical basis for a non-phonemic method of
   detecting membership in secret social groups, such as cults, criminal
   gangs, drug cartels and terrorist cells. Beginning with the basic
   sociological proposition that every social group develops a distinctive
   socio-cultural order, it is postulated that the primary features of
   group identity will be encoded, via a multi-level
   socio-psycho-physiological process, into the field of bio-emotional
   relations connecting group members. This information is communicated in
   all group-related interactions by a holographic-like process and
   recorded in the members' brains as a unique signature of group
   affiliation. The group's identity signature should be present in
   measurements of interaction between members as a latent commonality
   marking group affiliation. It is hypothesized that the identity
   signature is enfolded as a hologram in the energy spectra of vocal
   interactions among group members. In clandestine groups, the effort to
   remain hidden should enhance the signal strength of the identity
   signature. It is expected that detection of unknown members can be
   achieved using the spectral commonality identified in the analysis of
   recordings of vocal interactions among known members as a reference
   signature for comparison with those of the vocal spectra of suspected or
   potential members.},

Abstract = {Most sub-Saharan African countries are neither liberal democracies, nor
   fully authoritarian. Officials from Western governments that provide
   assistance to these `hybrid regimes' often become apologists for their
   lack of democracy. Rather than cogently arguing why democracy promotion
   activities should not be a priority, such donor officials frequently
   claim either that their host country is more democratic than it actually
   is, or that it could not be any more democratic for the time being.
   Drawing on some 70 interviews with donor officials in three African
   countries - Kenya, Malawi and Rwanda - over a period of more than a
   decade, this paper examines numerous individuals' common use of three
   methods to deflect criticism of the democratic credentials of their host
   countries: (1) focusing on election day, rather than the campaign and
   conditions as a whole; (2) setting the standard very low (do not expect
   too much); and (3) setting a long time horizon (do not expect it too
   soon). Perhaps equally important, the paper also explores the various
   reasons why these donor officials make such excuses for authoritarian
   practices.},

Abstract = {One of the defining features of post-reunified East German political
   culture has been an enduring affinity for socialism. Although firmly
   opposed to the pre-1989 one-party state, a sizeable majority of East
   Germans nevertheless continue to value socialism. Whilst much scholarly
   research has investigated the strength and depth of socialist values, as
   well as their sources, comparatively little is known about their
   consequences, about if and how socialist values matter. This article
   seeks to redress this by examining linkages between socialist values and
   political participation, asking whether socialist values are merely
   passive, romanticised expressions, the effects of which are largely
   benign, or whether they have real-life behavioural consequences for
   democracy. Exploring this question using ALLBUS data from East Germany,
   five hypotheses are tested at the individual level. The results strongly
   demonstrate that socialist values impact upon social capital and
   electoral behaviour.},

   into question the age of liberal intervention begun in Kosovo in the

   commitments, bilateral co-operation and small-scale international
   missions whilst at the same time managing expectations about the UK's

Volume = {7},
Number = {3},
Pages = {241-263},
Abstract = {Three crises dominate today's globalized political landscape:
   trans-national terrorism, financial crisis, and climate change.
   Collectively, these crises have hurt civil society organizations and
   constricted their political space. Rights of association and to state
   information (the foundations of civic engagement) have been eroded in
   the name of `state security'; and their support base and,financial
   viability have declined. While not a death knell for civil society, it
   is important to understand how these new threats arose, how they relate
   to and synergize with each other, and how they balance new
   opportunities. Whereas the diversity of views found in the `anti
   globalization movement' appeared to have advantages at the turn of the
   millennium (caricatured by the slogan that the movement espoused `One
   big ``NO!{''} and many small ``YESSES{''}'), today this appears more as
   a weakness suggesting a lack of clarity, focus, and credibility. Yet,
   thanks to new technology and the growing confidence of civil society
   leadership in poorer countries, we are seeing the emergence of a new
   energy in civil society that focuses more on the processes of government
   than on its substance and which shows signs of transforming civic
   engagement and enhancing state accountability to citizens.},

Abstract = {Sociologists working in the area of health comprise one of the largest
   sociological specialties in the world. The field has expanded globally
   in response to growing recognition of the significant role of social
   factors in determining the health of individuals, groups, and
   populations. Ultimately, what allows health sociology to retain its
   unique character is (1) its utilization and mastery of sociological
   theory in the study of health and (2) the sociological perspective that
   accounts for collective causes and outcomes of health problems and
   issues. Today it can said that health sociology produces literature
   intended to inform medicine and policymakers, but research in the field
   is also grounded in examining health-related situations that inform
   sociology as well. This paper will briefly review the origins of health
   sociology and outline the transition to its current status before
   discussing the most recent developments in research techniques and the
   likely future direction of the field.},

Abstract = {In the European Parliament, different coalitions form from one vote to
   the next. To understand the process of coalition formation it is
   necessary to consider the inter-institutional context in which decisions
   are made. This paper develops hypotheses regarding how changes in the
   relations between the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers
   affect coalition formation in the European Parliament. The hypotheses
   are tested using roll-call data from the fifth parliamentary term. In
   line with expectations, it is found that coalition patterns are more
   consistent in relation to final decisions under the co-decision
   procedure (when both institutions come to an agreement) than they are
   under the consultation procedure. Furthermore, the closer relations
   between the institutions have increased the importance of the median
   party group on the left-right dimension in coalition formation.},

Title = {A ``Californian Algeria{''}? The Political Economy of Standardization in
   Colonial Agriculture (1930-1962)},
Journal = {POLITIX},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {24},
Number = {95},
Pages = {23+},
Abstract = {This article addresses the political economy of standards. Based on the
   study of a historical experiment of standardization in agriculture in
   colonial Algeria, it shows the various meanings and implications of
   standardization. In a mere economic way, standardization is about
   specifying the basic characteristics of a given product. In a more
   general way, standardization consists in transforming and homogenizing
   various social spaces, in order to help the product circulate among
   these. Indeed, in the colonial case, standardization aims at turning a
   seasonal market into a year-long mass market, controlled by producers'
   cooperatives. But standardization does not only fulfil economic goals:
   it also goes along with technicization of government, as colonial
   bureaucrats seek to relaunch European settlement in Algeria. Last,
   standardization shapes conducts of life. The raise of mass consumption
   can be considered as an attempt to pacify society. In that view,
   standardization can be seen as political, in the way that it reduces
   politics to an economic issue.},

Abstract = {Twenty years ago Leif Lewin made the case that altruistic motives are
   more common than selfish motives among voters, politicians, and
   bureaucrats. We propose that motives and beliefs emerge as reactions to
   immediate feedback from technical-causal, material-economic, and
   moral-social aspects of the political task environment. In the absence
   of certain kinds of technical-causal and material-economic feedback,
   moral-social feedback leads individuals to the altruism Lewin documents,
   but also to righteousness (moralized regard for the in-group and
   disregard for the out-group) and myopia (disregard for distant
   consequences). The mix of altruism, righteousness, and myopia increases
   the focus on winning the next high-stakes election rather than on
   discovering or enforcing socially productive institutions.},

Title = {The Lack of Water Resources as a New Security Threat in 21st Century},
Journal = {POLITICKE VEDY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Pages = {74-94},
Abstract = {Decreasing and continuously shrinking of water sources quality, having
   to human survival vital importance, has become a global trend. The
   negative impact of climate change, environmental degradation, dramatic
   population growth and steadily increasing demand for the agriculture,
   industry and households also develops more and more pressure on their
   existing resources, which makes the situation unsustainable in the long
   term. The main crisis is likely to come from a fact, that some countries
   will find it difficult to manage such problems. A third of the world's
   population lives in water-stressed countries now and by 2025, this is
   expected to rise to two thirds. For millions of people around the world,
   getting their right to water is becoming a matter of life or death. As
   water is becoming scarce, states will lead to focus greater attention on
   its distribution, which on the one hand, may increase political interest
   in the issue of water, but also, with the very high numbers of
   international water courses which are shared between countries, lead to
   a deepening of existing tensions in some regions. But it is more likely
   that international water disputes will be resolved peacefully, even as
   conflicts erupt over other issues. Globally, instances of cooperation
   have outnumbered water-related conflicts more than twice during the
   period from the middle of last century and the number of water-based
   cooperation projects is still increasing. Based on these facts more and
   more attention is paid to the cooperative aspects of shared water
   resources. However, at the same time it is not possible to meet the
   needs of all people. And that is why the conflict seems to be in some
   cases, mostly in arid countries already suffering from acute water
   scarcity, inevitable in the future.},

Abstract = {Lao Tzu and Marx together provide the basis of an epistemology based on
   ignorancenot on knowledge. The failure of an epistemology based on
   knowledge is shown by the internal inconsistencies afflicting mainstream
   economics: Economic theory predicts certain empirical phenomena but
   these fail to reveal themselves. In fact, the strongest research finding
   in development economics is that there are almost no robust empirical
   relationships between an implemented policy and its desired outcomes in
   the real world. A theory of ignorance can highlight many economic
   contradictionsand may even prove useful in understanding autistics.},

Title = {Climate change and human security in Tuvalu},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE PEACE \& SECURITY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {23},
Number = {3},
Pages = {293-313},
Abstract = {At the local level, global climate change is exacerbating current
   environmental conditions while creating entirely new environmental and
   human hazards. The thesis of this article is that these new threats
   merge with preexisting vulnerabilities, creating a hybridized force that
   ripples through every aspect of society and threatens human security.
   The vulnerabilities intensify as these communities lack the adaptive and
   developmental capacity to address the multifarious effects, further
   undermining their human security. This article examines the case of the
   Funafuti, Tuvalu, and the effect of a warming Southern Pacific Ocean on
   Tuvaluan societal structural flows and processes. As the case
   demonstrates, climate change becomes more than an environmental issue;
   rather, it is a global social problem bound by multiple human security
   issues. For extremely vulnerable countries like Tuvalu, the case
   suggests that a human security approach best captures the dynamics of
   climate impacts in vulnerable communities, and, as such, requires
   adjustments in the global climate regime's current approach. This
   conclusion also represents a challenge to current scholarship which
   suggests that the small islands will be uninhabitable simply from sea
   level rise.},

Title = {Neo(liberal) citizens of Europe: politics, scales, and visibilities of
   environmental citizenship in contemporary Turkey},
Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {15},
Number = {6-7},
Pages = {837-859},
Abstract = {The aim of this article is to critically interrogate articulations of
   environmental citizenship in contemporary Turkey. Specifically, I
   analyse articulations of environmental citizenship through citizen and
   activist narratives taken from interviews and focus group discussions. I
   argue that first, scalar focus on local spaces and individuated
   responsibility for action that emerge from the narratives are crucial to
   understand future environmental politics and possibilities in this
   context. Invoking recent discussions related to the politics and
   performativities of scale, in particular, allows consideration of the
   politics of visibility and other consequences of these scalar foci.
   Second, themes from narrative analysis show key convergences with
   Europeanization- and neoliberalization-related discourses and shifts.
   The resonance and overlap between these discourses and practices is
   significant, particularly as it shows citizen receptivity towards
   broader ideas related to increased citizen responsibility. As such, the
   research contributes to efforts to move away from theorization of
   processes such as neoliberalism as top-down, instead enabling
   examination of ways that these ideals are taken up, expressed, and
   refashioned by everyday citizens. The third argument that emerges from
   the analysis, following from the first two, is the need to theorize
   power more fully in discussions of environmental citizenship. Bridging
   with neoliberalism discussions is one possible way to move such a
   project forward.},

Abstract = {This article discusses the role of state, nation, and empire in the
   formation and early development of the US. While recent debates on
   empire have mainly focused on current US foreign policy and global
   power, this historical analysis shows that the founding and early
   development of an American nation-state was driven by empire-building. A
   discussion of the dynamic relationship between empire-building and
   nation-state formation in Europe generates the general framework for the
   application of these concepts to the historical development of the US.
   The entanglement of empire-building and nation-state formation
   undermines the argument that American political development is somehow
   exceptional, putting the formation of the US in the context of similar
   dynamics elsewhere.},

   concluding with a discussion of their impact on the German party system.},

Pages = {349-360},
Abstract = {Geography is an intrinsic part of national identities, and the
   contributions to this journal have reflected this throughout its
   existence. In this essay, we discuss how geography has shaped National
   Identities in particular ways. Several of the journal's articles have
   examined how would-be nationalists form a geographical image of the
   prospective nation in order to make it real or how they have turned
   various landscape elements into national icons. Other articles have
   specifically examined the vital role of geographical scale in mediating
   between national conceptions, subnational movements, supranational
   ideas, and globalization. Finally we look at those essays that
   specifically focus on the role of maps in constructing, displaying, and
   propagandizing national identity.},

Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},

Volume = {34},
Number = {4},
Pages = {819-837},
Abstract = {The literature on institutional innovation in European governance has
   been dominated by an inward-looking focus on the European integration
   process. However, in the context of a highly integrated and
   interdependent world, it is not possible to understand the evolution of
   European governance without taking into account developments in the
   international institutional environment. This article aims to contribute
   to the study of the interaction between global and European modes of
   governance by examining the impact of EU's engagement with the
   International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), and its predecessor the
   International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC) on the institutions
   of European accounting regulation. Following an analysis of the politics
   of international accounting harmonisation, it is demonstrated that EU's
   decisions to adopt the standards produced by the IASB, and to establish
   a new, differentiated European accounting regulatory mechanism, were
   driven by its desire to bolster European influence in the context of the
   IASC/IASB.},

Abstract = {This article explores the controversies provoked by two recent exhibits
   in which People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) draws
   analogies between animal exploitation and the Holocaust and slavery.
   PETA's comparisons between the plight of animals and that of Jews and
   blacks are transgressive insofar as they disrupt settled notions of
   species difference by challenging the sacrosanct moral divide between
   humans and animals, and insofar as they do this by re-connecting race
   and species difference in a historically charged way. In the end, the
   controversies over PETA's exhibits raise difficult questions about the
   intersection of race and species as hierarchical categories ordering
   social life, what comparisons are ``inadmissible{''} and why, and the
   responsibilities or obligations one social justice struggle might be
   said to have toward other struggles.},

Volume = {21},

Pages = {407-425},
Abstract = {Constitutional amendments in federal political systems have to be
   negotiated between national and subnational actors. While theories of
   negotiation usually explain the outcome by looking at these actors,
   their preferences and bargaining powers, the theoretical model developed
   in this article also includes their interaction orientation. The article
   determines a typical sequence of bargaining and arguing and identifies
   favourable conditions for co-operation based on different interaction
   orientations. The article states that actors can reconcile the
   conflicting logics of intergovernmental or party competition and joint
   decision making in constitutional politics through a sequence of
   bargaining and arguing. However, constitutional amendments negotiated in
   this way run the risk of undermining the legitimacy and functionality of
   constitutions.},

   order to determine to what extent indigenous concepts of democracy have

   here suggests that there is a significant correlation between the
   demands made by indigenous social movements over the past two decades
   and the new constitutional texts of both countries, which essentially
   embrace the alternative forms of citizenship and democracy espoused by
   indigenous social movement groups. For many activists, these changes
   open the door to what they perceive as a richer democracy.},

Journal = {POLITIQUE EUROPEENNE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {35},
Number = {3},
Pages = {7-28},
Abstract = {While the Council has long been considered as a simple interstate body
   within the European political system, its Presidency has been studied
   either in terms of ``responsibility without power{''} or as an
   opportunity for pursuing national interests, an opposition that has
   proven rather ineffective. Under the thesis of the Europeanization of
   the Presidency, this introductory paper analyses the function as an
   institution as such, even though formally it does not have that status.
   Progressively institutionalised since its modest inception in 1952, it
   has since the 1980s acted as a system of government in its own right,
   which raises questions about the incarnation, rotation, delegation and
   temporality of power. Lastly, this introduction presents the papers that
   make up this thematic issue, which develop a new historical and
   political sociology of the Presidential office, placed in the space of
   the inter-institutional relations and competitions between European
   institutions, and no longer only between Brussels and the capitals.},

Pages = {63-89},
Abstract = {This paper analyzes the institutional predominant design in
   participatory budgeting in Chile. The study makes a contribution by
   filling de gap about the lack of knowledge of the models of
   participatory budgeting in places different from Brazil. The study
   identifies and compares four analytical dimensions in thirteen cases of
   participatory budgeting: the participative process, financial resources,
   legal framework and territoriality. The finding principal is that the
   context in which participative budgetings develop prevents it to
   complement adequately with the institutions of local representative
   democracy. The principal conclusion is that in Chile complementarity is
   not observed between these participative institutions and those
   representatives institutions to local scale.},

   ``experts{''} for those of the deliberators. However, the format and
   informational constraints faced by participants in deliberative forums
   are no worse, and are in many ways better, than those faced by ordinary
   citizens. The real problem with deliberative polls is that if they were
   to become popular, it would be tempting for interest groups and partisan
   elites to create polls in which the constraints and briefing materials
   subtly tilted the participants in a desired direction. Public criticism
   of biased deliberative polls would, in turn, invite biased criticism of
   unbiased polls. In short, ``policing{''} the quality of deliberative
   polls could recreate the very pathologies of real-world democratic
   discourse that the polls are designed to rectify. However, this problem
   is not insurmountable, because the participants themselves can police
   the proceedings by questioning the veracity and balance of the briefing
   materials.},

   and sociopolitical participation, by the application of purely
   qualitative techniques (focus groups and in-depth interviews). The
   results of the analysis of the speeches used in the discussion groups
   are the following: a) people feel more at ease in a main role, but only
   when they want it; b) in spite of the negative perception of politicians
   and the social elite, people accept that they play an major role in
   complex societies and in normal situations, but they want to be given
   living space when they ask for it; c) their implicit participation model
   is compared to something isolated, but decisive (vote and
   demonstration), and d) people are suspicious of anything implying a
   long-term commitment and a dedication larger than that which they are
   willing to take on.},

Title = {Why Did the Polls Overestimate Liberal Democrat Support? Sources of
   Polling Error in the 2010 British General Election},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ELECTIONS PUBLIC OPINION AND PARTIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {21},
Number = {2},
Pages = {179-209},
Abstract = {Pollsters once again found themselves in the firing line in the
   aftermath of the 2010 British general election. Many critics noted that
   nearly all pollsters in 2010 expected a substantial surge for the
   Liberal Democrats that did not materialize. Basing conclusions regarding
   the relative merits of pollsters or benefits of methodological design
   features on inspection of just the final poll from each pollster is
   inherently problematic, because each poll is subject to sampling error.
   This paper uses a state-space model of polls from across the course of
   the 2010 election campaign which allows us to assess the extent to which
   particular pollsters systematically over-or under-estimate each main
   party's share of the vote, while allowing for both the usual margins of
   error for each poll and changes in public opinion from day-to-day. Thus,
   we can assess the evidence for systematic differences between pollsters'
   results according to the use of particular methodologies, and estimate
   how much of the discrepancy between the final polls and the election
   outcome is due to methodological differences that are associated with
   systematic error in the polls. We find robust evidence of an
   over-estimation in Liberal Democrat support, but do not find evidence to
   support the hypothesis that the polls erred due to a late swing away
   from the party, nor that any of the methodological choices made by
   pollsters were significantly associated with this over-estimation.},

Abstract = {This article deals with the definition of the war and the armed conflict
   in contemporary international law, which includes the prohibition of the
   use or threat of armed force in international relations. Since 1945 the
   use of armed force by states does not meet criteria typical for wars in
   the past and there is no development in redefining of the war. Today ` s
   international law uses the term armed conflict for situations of armed
   violence in the world and is based on the division of the armed
   conflicts in two categories: international armed conflicts and
   non-international armed conflicts. Further, the article pays attention
   on some actual problems arising from this division.},

Abstract = {This paper advocates the introduction of the concept of intelligence in
   the Romanian language, in order to fill the current methodological gap.
   The need for a new concept emerged in the activity of Romanian
   intelligence services over a decade ago, when, intelligence{''} started
   to be used in parallel with, information{''} in external and internal
   missions. Our approach is focused on three dimensions, which we consider
   fundamental for our demarche: formulating a definition of intelligence,
   establishing its position in relation with other key-concepts from the
   cognitive field: data, information, intelligence and knowledge and
   underlining the differences between the four and finally making a brief
   presentation of the intelligence types, both in the military and
   intelligence field, and its extension to the business and academic
   sector in the last two or three decades.},

Journal = {AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {46},
Number = {1},
Pages = {87-103},
Abstract = {Multiculturalism has been criticised for emphasising cultural
   recognition over resource redistribution for minority cultural and
   ethnic groups. Moreover, critics argue that cultural diversity fails to
   provide enough common ground upon which to sustain civic nationalism.
   This paper examines the development of multiculturalist and
   biculturalist policies in Australia and New Zealand, and argues that
   these have in fact been justified in terms of a negotiated balance
   between two civic values: the value of diverse cultural expression, and
   social justice understood in egalitarian terms. The tension between
   these values has shaped the debate around multiculturalism in both
   cases. Both the social justice and value of cultural diversity arguments
   are deployed to reinforce conceptions of national identity in Australia
   and New Zealand.},

   Organization's General Agreement on Trade-inServices- the article
   demonstrates how an expanded focus on discourse can help research better
   understand: (1) the self-driving momentum within networks through which
   those actors involved experience a reconstituted identity and affinity
   to one another; (2) the role played by earlier moments of collective
   action in providing both an infrastructure of pre-existing relations and
   politicization from which the network may draw upon; (3) the often
   porous character of campaign activity where there is rarely one but, in
   fact, many overlapping networks at play as part of a much wider
   discursive process; and (4) the role abstract signifiers such as `
   global'-as in ` Global Campaign for...'-play in framing the network
   despite an often uneven geographic distribution to campaign activity and
   power within the network.},

Abstract = {Only recently, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) celebrated
   fifty years since the territory gained independence from Belgium. But
   the truth be told, Congo is not yet free. In more ways than are easily
   fathomable, the country continues to be buffeted by various
   reincarnations of greed and chaos - some externally driven, others
   internally motivated. This paper begins with a historical
   contextualisation of the conflicts in the DRC, before proceeding to take
   stock of the organisation's balance sheet thus far as it grapples with
   imminent peacekeeping, peacebuilding and post-conflict reconstruction
   challenges in the country. Successes achieved by the United Nations
   Organisation Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC)
   (now MONUSCO, the UN Organisation Stabilisation Mission in the DRC) are
   then pitted against setbacks in this regard. Finally, a prognosis of the
   UN's future role in the territory is built on the template of the
   political, social and economic realities prevalent in the territory.
   Within the present dispensation in the Congo, how can the UN play a more
   effective role in disarming the country's conflicts, while arming its
   capacity for lasting peace and security? In what ways can the broader
   international community muster its leverage more robustly in stemming
   the troubling tide of `conflict resource hunting' in the Congo? How can
   we look backward in order to see forward, or, in other words, what
   lessons can we draw from Hammarskjold's leadership in the first Congo
   war, and apply in current attempts towards the pacification of the
   Congo?},

Abstract = {Most observers hold a positive view of China's reform since 1978 but are
   critical of the policies of the era of Mao Zedong, ignoring the
   inseparable connections between the two. This article argues that the
   post-Mao era reform represents both continuity and discontinuity with
   the immediate past, and a complex mingling of Mao's legacy with new
   initiatives. The origins of many reform policies, as well as their
   accomplishments, could be traced back to the Mao era. They were often
   conditioned by, benefited from, or were built upon the outcomes of Mao's
   policies. These included the decisions to normalize China's relations
   with the United States and develop friendship with Third World
   countries, efforts to decentralize economic power and industrialize
   China without urbanization, and the move to defeat ``capitalist
   roaders{''} but call Deng Xiaoping back to office. Overall, the turn
   toward capitalism of China has proven Mao's foresight, validated his
   concerns, and may be evidence of the lasting utility of Maoism.},

Abstract = {This empirical study shows that trade unions in China do not play a
   significant role in affecting industrial labor income. Inactive trade
   unions, moreover, contribute to the deterioration of income inequality
   because of the existence of administrative monopoly power. China's dual
   market structure (i.e., the coexistence of an administrative monopoly
   sector and nonadministrative monopoly sector), as well as the trade
   unions' administrativization and bureaucratization, are main reasons
   that trade unions do not effectively improve China's income distribution
   problem. Thus, in order to optimize the structure of income
   distribution, trade unions in China should start a reform of
   de-administrativization, reconstruction of the function of workers'
   rights protection, and strengthening the independence of the grassroots
   trade union organizations.},

Abstract = {Since taking office in April 2010, the government under Viktor Orban has
   been restructuring Hungary's political system. It is moving away from
   the principles of a liberal constitutional state. In the name of
   ``majority democracy{''}, the government has weakened the separation of
   powers, centralized the state, and expanded the prime minister's powers.
   The root causes of this change lie in the Hungary's political and social
   structural deficiencies. An illiberal democracy has now come into being.
   There is a risk that this will turn into a hybrid regime in which
   elements of democracy merge with elements of authoritarian rule. This
   would set a precedent in the European Union.},

Volume = {30},

Pages = {865-871},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This research note presents a median voter data set that allows for
   comparison across time and across countries. The data set updates and
   extends the widely used statistics originally developed by Kim and
   Fording (1998, 2003). The median voter data introduced in this research
   note also correct for stochastic error in the Comparative Manifestos
   Project using work by Benoit et al. (2009) and include estimates of
   measurement error. The methodology consists of linking party positions
   with electoral outcomes to arrive at revealed voter preferences. This
   data set provides insight into the median voter in over 50 democracies.
   For established democracies the time series typically starts around
   1950. The United States time series begins in 1920 and includes the 2008
   election. Descriptive graphs illustrate major trends in voter
   preferences. The median voter data set is made available online. (C)

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Periods of split-party control and narrow margin politics encourage
   criticism of the separated system, accompanied by proposals for reform
   and change. The U. S. Senate is notably exposed under these conditions
   for the very reasons it was created. This essay revisits that rationale,
   concentrating on its institutional role as a second chamber and its
   operational style of individualism. Attention is directed first to the
   marginally democratic status of the body, then to the chamber's
   individualist roots as nurtured by the three classes formed for
   staggering senatorial selection. Working within its own political and
   electoral rhythms, the Senate operates as an elite society of singles.
   Functioning on independent meridians, this exceptional second chamber
   resists reform and challenges prophecy, very much as intended. Like it
   or not, it is there.},

Abstract = {This article attempts to answer why some countries experience the
   recurrence of civil war and others do not. One of the most significant
   differences between civil war onset and its recurrence is that the
   latter has once experienced termination of civil war, while the former
   has not. To find the cause of recurrence, this article examines how
   different war termination types influence the duration of post-civil war
   peace. Duration analysis of the civil wars between 1944 and 1999 shows
   that military victory, supported by peacekeeping operations or
   power-sharing arrangements, leads to the most durable peace in a
   post-civil war country. Contrary to the accepted wisdom, negotiated
   peace settlement, even when supported by peacekeeping operations or
   power-sharing arrangements, is not positively related to post-conflict
   peace.},

Abstract = {Dating back to Harry S. Truman, a number of presidents and prominent
   political leaders have tried, in some way or another, to reduce the
   reliance on nuclear weapons in U.S. foreign policy. Throughout the
   years, such attempts have prompted countless international debates and
   spawned a cottage industry of security research related to the eventual
   elimination of nuclear arms. However, aside from the occasional foray,
   this research paradigm generally overlooks the domestic political
   obstacles that policy makers should expect to encounter if national
   security policy continues down the path toward nuclear zero. In pursuit
   of this goal, this article empirically examines public attitudes
   concerning the continued pursuit of nuclear abolition. In doing so, we
   highlight the beliefs and perceptions that inform public preferences
   concerning the importance assigned to retaining nuclear weapons today.},

Abstract = {In the decade since Partners and Rivals: Representation in U. S.
   Delegations (2000) was published, Congress has experienced increased
   levels of party polarization. Congressional scholars have since
   concluded that this polarization trend has dramatically changed the
   context for deliberation, competition, and cooperation in the U. S.
   Senate. However, scholars have not explored the ties between increased
   polarization and representation within Senate delegations. In this
   article, we evaluate whether the dynamic of cooperation and competition
   among same-state Senators still exists along the lines identified in
   Partners and Rivals, or whether it has become merely a folkway of the
   past. We find that same-state Senators still construct distinct
   legislative portfolios designed to garner public attention and support,
   and that this still reflects a commitment to representation in the
   Senate.},

Abstract = {How and how well do different parties manage similar environmental
   changes? How do organizations shape parties' adaptation to change? In
   1996 New Zealand replaced its Single Member Plurality (SMP) electoral
   system with a Mixed Member Proportional (MMP) system. MMP added an
   overriding proportional tier to national elections and compelled the
   major incumbent parties, Labour and National, to undertake new tasks:
   the creation of national lists of candidates and the construction of
   nationwide campaigns for the `party vote'. This paper compares how
   Labour and National organized candidate selection in response to MMP. It
   demonstrates how and why Labour possessed organizational capacities to
   meet these challenges that National lacked before the advent of MMP and
   for several years after it.},

Abstract = {How do American Indian tribal governments relate to nearby local
   governments? Do insights gleaned from these cases illuminate the
   constraints and opportunities that marginalized groups face within any
   system of federalism? What circumstances of marginalized governments
   help or hinder their effectiveness? Although some Native American tribes
   have transformed their fortunes with highly profitable casinos, most
   continue to face stark disadvantages. Some tribal governments, despite
   limited opportunities prevail locally by cultivating policy and
   political expertise. This analysis demonstrates that such expertise can
   be developed, even when resources are scarce.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},

Volume = {3},

Abstract = {The famous dictum that `war makes states' has received renewed interest
   with the experience of state failure and state collapse in many parts of
   the Developing World. Historical studies have shown that the activity of
   war-making was an essential ingredient of the process of state-making in
   early modern Europe. The history of state-making in the Arab Middle East
   shows that rentier states defy the `war makes states' theory. This
   article compares four states from the Arab world, two having been
   exposed to the experience of war-making (Iraq and Jordan) and two not
   (the United Arab Emirates and Tunisia). The comparison of these four
   states shows that rentierism serves as an obstacle to the formation of
   legitimate and institutionalized states. However, the availability of
   external rents also allows state institutions and patronage channels to
   continue providing general welfare. Thus, rentierism produces a twin
   phenomenon of state weakness and life support for potentially failed
   states. It is only when war-making is employed in rentier states as a
   strategy of state-making that states fail and break.},

Abstract = {Research suggests that the costs of international conflict (e.g.
   casualties) alter public opinion, executive approval and policy
   positions of elected officials. However, do casualties affect voting in
   terms of aggregate outcomes and individual vote choices? This article
   examines how casualties from interstate conflicts affect voter
   behaviour, specifically incumbent vote share. Using the investment model
   of commitment to model individual vote choice, it is argued that
   increases in the costs of conflict (i.e., more casualties) can increase
   the probability that voters will support the incumbent, increasing
   incumbent vote share. This model is tested with both cross-national
   aggregate data from twenty-three countries and individual-level British
   survey data. The results support the argument.},

Abstract = {Bernadette Menu, Dependence, organization of work : the pharaonic Egypt
   The organization of work in the early period of Egyptian Antiquity met
   ideological, political, economic and social needs. Agricultural labor,
   building of impressive monuments and production of prestigious objects
   brought about full employment. The wealth obtained allowed relatively
   high wages for workers. Applying the principle of a pyramidal hierarchy
   ensured the management of labor according to sophisticated means of
   relevance, which precluded any need to resort to slavery.},

Abstract = {Alain Morice, Immigration and illegality: foreigners' informal
   activities
   The informal/shadow economy is frequently praised as an alternative
   solution for the development in Third World cities. However in rich
   countries, it is viewed with more suspicion and, in the context of a
   growing xenophobia, is generally associated with uncontrolled
   immigration. Consequently a stigmatisation of foreigners can be
   observed, especially of those undocumented. Such hostile an opinion
   relies on misunderstandings regarding the real functioning of the
   informal networks, underpined by logics of solidarity as well as other
   creative aspects, through mechanisms involving dependence, submission
   and exploitation.},

Abstract = {The List Pim Fortuyn (LPF) is a key example of a family of new
   right-wing parties that, according to many observers, have had a strong
   effect on European party systems. This article studies the effect of the
   entry of the LPF into the Dutch Parliament on the parliamentary party
   system. The article looks at two aspects of the party system: first, did
   the LPF affect the issue agenda of the legislature? And second, has the
   LPF been able to create a new significant line of conflict in the
   legislature, as Kriesi and Frey and Pellikaan et al observed for the
   electoral arena? Or, as Van der Brug and Bale have proposed, is the
   Dutch party system after Fortuyn essentially one-dimensional? The study
   looks at new, behavioral, data from the Dutch legislature: parliamentary
   voting behavior and the sponsorship of motions, to answer these
   questions. It employs Poole's Open Classification method to understand
   the patterns underlying voting behavior. Acta Politico (2011) 46,

   include communication with, and mobilization of, voters. I further argue
   that this subunit power should be manifested in the parliamentary
   behavior and status of MPs: those from districts where the local party
   organization is strong are more likely (1) to behave independently in
   parliament and break party unity and (2) to hold leadership positions in
   parliamentary committees. I find support for these propositions in the
   analysis of 12 legislatures from four postcommunist democracies-Czech
   Republic, Estonia, Hungary, and Poland. The results remain robust
   against various alternative explanations.},

   unforeseen effects in a region rife with unresolved disputes and few
   mature working relationships. The result of a breakdown in relations
   would almost certainly cause economic disruption and possibly lead to
   wider global conflict. In more ways than one, then, the Indo-Pacific

Volume = {4},

Abstract = {This study probes the domestic determinants and empirical relevance of
   government preference for European Union (EU) implementation. The main
   contention is that governments' preference for implementation is defined
   in the context of broader contestation over European integration.
   Political parties that mediate this contestation represent competing
   social preferences for implementation and reflect these preferences in
   the implementation practices of national governments that they
   constitute. Using a unique dataset of individual infringement actions,
   the paper then explores the impact of government preference on the
   resolution of member states' disputes with the European Commission over
   implementing EU rules. The key finding is that government preference as
   shaped in domestic political conflicts and party politics significantly
   determines EU implementation and, as a result, the effectiveness of EU
   rules.},

Abstract = {On the basis of extensive new empirical evidence, this article offers an
   assessment of how post-devolution Wales has determined the strategies
   employed in attempts to engage with, and influence, EU policy-making
   processes. The primary focus of the article is on domestic political
   capacity construction, rather than specifically about the impact of
   European integration on devolved politics (although the two are closely
   intertwined). What does the involvement of Wales in the European Union
   tell us about the nature of devolved government in Wales, and, more
   broadly, the management of the United Kingdom's European policy
   post-devolution? Addressing broader concerns with multi-level
   governance, the article proposes a framework based on political capacity
   building as a novel way for capturing how regional authorities seek to
   negotiate a position for themselves between the competing pressures of
   centralisation and decentralisation. British Politics (2011) 6, 379-396.

Title = {Is Consociational Theory the Answer to Global Conflict? From the
   Netherlands to Northern Ireland and Iraq},
Journal = {POLITICAL STUDIES REVIEW},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {9},
Number = {3},
Pages = {309-322},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Neo-conservatives and liberal interventionists subscribe to the
   idealistic belief that external powers can successfully re-engineer
   states into Western capitalist democracies. Consociationalism is a
   prominent or even dominant theory for managing conflict in
   `ethnonationally divided societies'. The consociational model is based
   on the Dutch experience of managing `plural conflict' from 1917 to 1967.
   This article argues that consociationalism has become increasingly
   vague, ambiguous and even contradictory as the theory has been stretched
   in an attempt to claim relevance to both the Northern Ireland and Iraq
   conflicts. Although this has eroded the coherence of the consociational
   theory this is more than compensated for by the flexibility this gives
   consociationalists in marketing their concept as all things to all
   people. By contrast post-structuralist radical democrats are critical of
   the reductionism of consociational theorising and emphasise the limits
   of human reason to grasp adequately the complexity of diverse conflict
   situations.

Title = {Allocation of Fishing Harvest Rights in Iceland and Norway - the
   Development since 1990},

Year = {2011},
Volume = {7},
Number = {2},
Pages = {263-282},
Month = {FAL},
Abstract = {Unlike most western countries, marine fisheries in Iceland and Norway is
   still of some national significance. For more than two decades now, the
   two countries have managed their fisheries with complicated quota
   systems. The main rules of these two systems are explained in the
   article. However, the main purpose of the article is to describe how
   harvest rights in the two countries have been allocated since 1990.
   In both countries the principle of grandfathering the harvest rights has
   prevailed, i.e., the initial allocation has protected the professional
   interest of those that have already participated in the fisheries.
   Despite this, rules on the matter have not been engraved in stone since
   they have been dynamic and contingent on various amendments by the
   legislature and government.
   Basic rules on allocation have been stipulated in acts in Iceland, while
   in Norway they have mostly been based on regulations. Since harvest
   rights are transferable in Iceland, this, in principle, should make the
   harvest rights better protected than in Norway. However, when the matter
   is scrutinized, it becomes clear that the Icelandic parliament has in
   fact reallocated harvest rights on a recurrent basis.
   In Norway, rules on allocation of harvest rights have been relatively
   stable. This can be partly explained by the fact that the most important
   stakeholders in the Norwegian fisheries have in practice had important
   say on how the harvest rights have been allocated.},

   Spanish-language radio represents an attractive venue for testing

   nonpartisan Spanish-language radio advertisements on Latino voter
   turnout in the 2006 congressional elections. The experiment,
   encompassing 206 congressional districts, indicates that nonpartisan

Abstract = {This paper assesses the extent to which party systems are nationalized
   in four federations. In doing so, the research addresses two questions.
   First, is dual accountability operational across decentralized
   countries, or do sub-national voters turn to national cues as a means to
   economize in a complex information environment? By bringing a
   cross-national dataset to bear on this question, we are able to provide
   insight into where and why dual accountability might operate. Second,
   what explains variation in the extent to which party systems are
   nationalized across countries and time? We build on previous literature
   to suggest a number of factors likely to impact the extent of
   nationalization. We examine those factors in the context of
   provincial-level elections in Argentina, Canada, Germany and the United
   States. Using national and sub-national economic data, we find little
   evidence of dual accountability in any of our countries. We find that
   economic performance matters little for regional electoral outcomes, and
   where it does, sub-national outcomes reflect national rather than
   sub-national conditions. More important are the roles of partisan
   relations across levels of government and election timing. Sub-national
   co-partisans of the nationally governing party lose votes, particularly
   as the time from the most recent national election grows. The strength
   of these effects varies across our cases in predictable ways.},

Abstract = {Existing theories of turnout model individuals' decisions to vote as a
   function of the utility they would gain from their favored party's
   election, the costs of voting, and the intrinsic benefits associated
   with democratic participation. This project shows that such utility
   calculations are conditional on electoral rules. In electoral systems
   with low incentives for strategic behavior, the traditional model of
   voter turnout is accurate. However, in plurality systems, in which there
   are stronger incentives for individuals to abandon their true
   preferences, less importance is placed on the utility associated with
   the possible success of favored parties.},

   the AK Party, have been eliminated from ``Kurdish question politics.{''}
   This essay will demonstrate that the support for the Kurdish party is
   gradually acquiring a territorial dimension. Thus, this essay argues
   that the notion of democratic autonomy proposed today for the whole of
   Turkey by the Kurdish party may over time give way to the political
   objective of ``autonomy for Kurdistan{''} or even ``federal
   Kurdistan.{''} It is also argued that the same trend may foster a
   political agenda of ``Kurds to Kurdistan{''} to take hold in Turkish
   politics.},

   succeeded in telling the people the truth. Later, only a few recorded
   broadcasts escaped destruction by Stalin's thugs. Journalist Lev S.

Abstract = {This paper examines the desirability and constitutionality of using
   sampling techniques in conducting the United States census. The census
   is one of the most controversial political events each decade. Most
   people would be surprised to learn that the census was a hotly debated
   topic at the Constitutional Convention. In spite of the fact that a
   census is typically considered more accurate than a sample, this paper
   argues that using sampling techniques, for the allocation of legislative
   seats, would produce a more accurate count of inhabitants in America.
   Furthermore, the paper addresses the constitutional issues surrounding
   the use of sampling.},

Journal = {FORUM-A JOURNAL OF APPLIED RESEARCH IN CONTEMPORARY POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Legislators like Michele Bachmann and Alan Grayson become nationally
   infamous for their provocative behavior, yet there is little scholarly
   attention to such infamy. This paper examines the predictors of
   congressional infamy, along with its electoral consequences. First,
   infamy is measured through the frequency with which internet users
   conduct searches of legislators' names, paired with epithets attacking
   their intelligence or sanity. Then, ideological extremism and party
   leadership positions are shown to be the best statistical predictors.
   The electoral consequences of infamy follow: infamous legislators raise
   more money than their lower-profile colleagues, but their infamy also
   helps their challengers to raise money. In the case of House
   Republicans, there appears to be an additional and direct negative
   effect of infamy on vote shares. The fundraising effect is larger in
   Senate elections, but there is no evidence of direct electoral cost for
   infamous senatorial candidates.},

   the central concept of consociation as it has evolved in recent

   the stages by which this concept moved to the centre of the political
   agenda in Northern Ireland, resting on contributions by policy-makers,
   academics, journalists and others. It reviews the difficult history of
   efforts to translate this principle into practice, contrasting the
   failed attempt to promote this formula in 1973 with the much more
   successful experiment in 1998. Using the classical literature on
   consociation, an effort is made to explain the difference between these
   outcomes, a difference with implications for Northern Irelands future

   protocol improves on the artificiality that is commonly present in lab

   with field experiments. We exemplify this design by means of a study on

Abstract = {There is broad agreement that the most important transformation
   undergone by democratic politics since the second half of the twentieth
   century has been the diffusion of the means of mass-communication
   (television in particular). Teledemocracy especially has changed
   democratic politics in a specific way: the leaders rather than the
   parties now stand at the centre of the electoral and political process.
   This article does not aim to go over the relationship between media and
   politics; that has already been done. Instead, it focuses on how to deal
   with a situation in which media and politics overlap.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {73},
Number = {3},
Pages = {899-914},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Several normative political theorists argue for racially descriptive
   representation, or for blacks to represent blacks. I contend that if
   theorists believe that blacks deserve additional measures to improve
   their substantive political representation, then they should prioritize
   the creation of racial constituencies independently of whether such
   constituencies elect black representatives. Prioritizing racial
   constituency circumvents essentialism within descriptive representation
   and better reflects the role of electoral authorization and
   accountability in generating trust between representatives and
   constituents. As a result, descriptive representation becomes one of
   several criteria (along with other identity markers, ideological
   proximity, and general competence and trustworthiness) to be applied by
   a racial constituency in selecting a preferable representative.
   Ultimately, prioritizing racial constituency allows normative theorists
   to affirm, without philosophical contradiction, the, existence of black
   districts that elect nonblack representatives; contain black ideological
   minorities; exhibit diverse political interests; reflect shifting
   electoral constituencies; and elect representatives with divergent
   representational styles.},

Abstract = {The quality of law is ultimately shaped by the scrutiny it receives in
   Parliament. But the tidal wave of often hastily prepared, deficient
   legislation that the UK Parliament has been asked to scrutinise over the
   last decade and more has severely stretched the capacity of
   parliamentarians to perform their constitutional function effectively.
   There is little incentive for the executive to address this situation
   and restrain its almost untrammelled power of legislative initiative,
   and therefore Parliament needs to assert its right to receive adequately
   drafted legislation and the time to scrutinise it thoroughly. To this
   end, Parliament should establish a Legislative Standards Committee to
   act as a gatekeeper against insufficiently prepared legislation, and a
   range of other reforms to improve the scrutiny of bills once they pass
   that test.},

Title = {Strategic campaigning, closeness, and voter mobilization in US
   Presidential elections},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {30},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {344-352},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The scholarly literature on voter mobilization is ambivalent regarding
   the effects of closeness on turnout. Economic analyses of turnout (i.e.
   the classic calculus of voting) contend that as elections become closer,
   voters perceive their participation as more valuable because there is a
   greater chance that they will cast the deciding vote. Other work argues
   that voters do not take closeness into account because the probability
   that their vote uniquely changes the outcome of an election is quite
   small even in close elections. Still, this second perspective maintains
   that closeness may increase turnout because elites distribute campaign
   resources to places where election results could be affected by
   mobilizing additional supporters. While the latter perspective is
   theoretically well-developed, empirical support' for the notion that
   elite activity (rather than citizen perceptions) connects closeness and
   turnout is limited. Using improved measures of closeness and campaign
   activities, we test for citizen perception and elite mobilization
   effects on turnout in the context of U.S. Presidential elections.
   Results show that while closeness has no direct effect on turnout,
   elites indeed target campaign activities on close states and the
   asymmetric distribution of resources across states results in higher
   turnout in battleground states. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Election forecasting has experienced considerable growth as a subfield
   within political science. Research work on United Kingdom elections has
   been cutting edge here. The recent 2010 general election afforded the
   opportunity for a trial of different forecasting methodologies. These
   efforts are showcased in this volume, and include standard, and
   not-so-standard, statistical models. Overall, these models perform well,
   foreseeing the unprecedented outcome of a ``hung parliament{''}, as most
   pollsters and pundits did not. Moreover, they achieved this accuracy
   with forecasts well in advance of the election itself. (C) 2010

Abstract = {This article analyses the content and processes of reforms in the
   university sector in Denmark. It reveals radical reforms combining
   governance reforms, research policy reforms and educational policy
   reforms anchored in New Public Management ideas. The reforms introduce
   values that are alien to prevailing university values. They change
   decision-making processes and may have problematic constitutive effects
   on academic practice. The challenge to political science lies in the
   difficulty of documenting accountability, while still meeting the demand
   for economic value.},

Abstract = {Sachs and Warner (1995) found a negative relationship between natural
   resources and economic growth, concluding that natural resources are a
   curse. This explanation for poor economic growth is now widely accepted.
   We provide an alternative econometric framework for evaluating the
   resource curse. We focus on resource rents and rent-seeking behaviour,
   arguing that rent seeking affects corruption and that, in turn, impacts
   well-being. Our measure of well-being is the Human Development Index,
   although we find similar results for per capita GDP. While resource
   abundance does not directly impact economic development, we find that
   natural resources are associated with rent seeking that negatively
   affects well-being, with results robust to various model specifications
   and sensitivity analyses.},

Abstract = {Conflicts, liberty and peace do not coexist easily. Through most of
   history, civil peace was maintained by the threat of force. Contemporary
   ideologues of authoritarian regimes maintain that political conflicts
   inevitably result in violence, and the founders of modern representative
   institutions in the West have shared this view. Yet we now know that
   political institutions can cope with conflicts, that conflicts can be
   structured, regulated and contained, and that purely procedural rules
   can be effective in processing conflicts. Most importantly, we have come
   to realise that choosing governments through competitive elections is
   the only way to foster political freedom in divided societies.
   Competitive elections support social peace by enabling political forces
   to think in inter-temporal terms. In turn, civil peace is maintained
   between elections when when opposition groups expect to be reasonably
   successful within the halls of representative institutions.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},

Abstract = {For decades, scholars of political culture have held that mass political
   attitudes have a profound impact on the process of democratization. In
   studying this impact, an increasing number of political scientists have
   recently theorized that the level of democratization a political system
   reaches depends on the extent to which its political institutions meet
   citizen demand for democracy. In testing such theoretical models of
   democratic demand and supply, however, many political scientists have
   mistakenly equated democratic demand with citizen preference for
   democracy over its alternatives. In this study, we first argue that
   popular demand for democracy is not the same thing as democratic regime
   preference or support. Instead, demand for democracy arises from
   dissatisfaction with democracy-in-practice. By analyzing the fourth wave
   of the World Values Survey, we then demonstrate that the critical
   orientations of democrats promote democratic development more powerfully
   than do the two attitudes - democratic regime support and
   self-expression values - that prior public opinion research has
   identified as the forces driving democratization.},

Abstract = {The European Union (EU) is assumed to suffer from a democratic deficit.
   It is often posited that in the EU there is only a weak and indirect
   connection between public preferences and policy change. This article
   investigates empirically whether any relationship exists between public
   support for European integration and EU policy output (1973-2008). Using
   a new indicator of policy output - the volume of important legislation
   produced in a semester - I discover a surprising relationship between
   public support and legislative production. Employing vector
   autoregression (VAR), I demonstrate that public EU support
   Granger-causes legislative output but not vice versa, and that the
   relationship is strong up to the middle of the 1990s but non-existent
   afterwards. The effect is robust to the inclusion of indicators of the
   state of the economy and government preferences. In addition, I discover
   that the average level of EU support in the Council of Ministers follows
   unemployment levels with a four-year delay.},

Abstract = {Syria became the latest Middle Eastern country to join the chain of
   protests sweeping across the Middle East. The protests have since spread
   to several other cities with varying frequency and numbers, and the
   violent handling of the protests by the Syrian regime has created a
   protest movement, which has brought forth an array of demands from
   political reform to the fall of the regime. Opposition in different
   forms has always existed in Syria and among the Syrian diaspora.
   However, legal restrictions on social and political activities and the
   long-lasting atmosphere of fear, perpetrated by the Ba'ath Party and
   pervasive intelligence services, have so far limited the opposition's
   organizational capabilities. Despite difficulties and restrictions, the
   Syrian opposition is in the making. This paper presents a brief analysis
   of the opposition in Syria, surveys the opposition's fight for survival
   under the Ba'ath regime, and assesses its current strength and
   weaknesses.},

Abstract = {In coalition government, the relationship between parties and ministers
   is one of double delegation: from the party to the minister and from the
   coalition of parties to the individual minister. On the basis of
   principal-agent theory, I argue that a coalition agreement is a tool
   used by coalition parties to reduce agency loss when delegating to
   ministers. In six governments in Belgium, Italy and The Netherlands, I
   show that: a majority of the pledges were transferred into cabinet
   decisions, a majority of cabinet decisions were effectively constrained
   by the coalition agreement and that one-third of cabinet decisions had
   been precisely defined beforehand in the document. Interestingly, the
   length of the coalition agreement, the entry of party leaders to
   government and the number of ministers participating in the negotiations
   do not seem to have had a significant influence on the above two
   measurements..},

Abstract = {The intensity of Polish border trade with Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine
   depends on the general economic situation, bilateral relations, and
   respective domestic politics. An analysis of border traffic from 1994 to
   2009 shows that Poland's participation in the Schengen visa regime and
   high fees have led to a structural decline in border traffic. The result
   is ambiguous: activity in the border areas is dying out.},

Abstract = {Yvon Quiniou, Is morality an ``anti-nature{''}?
   The idea that morality is hostile of nature comes from Nietzsche who
   made scathing accusations as he saw it as a delusion born out of a weak
   life, damaging it ant attempting to use the concept of ethics as a
   substitute for morality. However it is possible ant even necessary to
   save the morality thanks to Darwin who thought it was a truly natural
   human ability tightly related to history. If we understand it in the
   light of Kant and clearly differentiate it from a moralistic
   misinterpretation, we see that although it obliges us to refrain in
   ourselves what opposes us to others, it serves Universality and fosters
   all the natural human potentialities of any human being- such as
   communism for example requires it. It even commands us to protect
   nature, not arbitraily on an ethic preference for it but because man is
   dependent on it and is the highest priority of morality.},

Abstract = {A cyberweapon can be as dangerous as any weapon. Fortunately, recent
   technology now provides some tools for cyberweapons control. Digital
   forensics can be done on computers seized during or after hostilities.
   Cyberweapons differ significantly from other software, especially during
   development, and recent advances in summarizing the contents of storage
   media can locate possible cyberweapons quickly. Use of cyberweapons can
   be distinguished in the usual malicious Internet traffic by being aimed
   at targets associated with political, social, and cultural issues that
   are often known in advance, and those targets can then be monitored.
   Cyberweapons are relatively unreliable compared to other kinds of
   weapons because they are susceptible to flaws in software; therefore,
   cyberweapons require considerable testing, preferably against live
   targets. Thus, international ``cyberarms agreements{''} could provide
   for forensics on cyberweapons and usage monitoring. Agreements also
   encourage more responsible cyberweapons use by stipulating attribution
   and reversibility. The authors discuss the kinds of international
   agreements that are desirable, and examine the recent interest of the
   U.S. government in such agreements.},

Abstract = {Surveys are sometimes used to assess preferences towards policy issues
   that are remote from experience and that have never been publicly
   discussed. How do these preferences of isolated survey respondents
   compare with preferences expressed by voters who have access to advice
   from competing political parties? I address this question by conducting
   a field experiment with a sample of the general public in which I
   experimentally control the subjects' access to the actual positions of
   competing parties and interest groups on specific novel policy
   propositions. Access to party positions decreased approval of the
   proposed environmental policy among right-wing voters by over fifty
   percent, and this effect was similar for different educational groups.
   When voters had access to party positions, their policy preferences were
   more consistent with their general political orientation. I conclude by
   discussing implications of these results for the debate about voter
   competence and for preference elicitation using surveys.},

Abstract = {This article explores the impact of globalization on China's
   environmental activism by analyzing the development of Chinese
   environmental activism and assessing its links with the transnational
   environmental movement. It uses the case of Beijing to examine the
   characteristics, evolution, organizational development, and
   environmental identity of a green community. Two influential campaigns
   are presented and compared to illustrate the different movement
   repertoires employed, which are related to the extent that Chinese
   environmentalists are involved in the transnational environmental
   movement. The article concludes that Chinese environmental activists
   have been actively interacting with the transnational environmental
   movement, and this has influenced the identification of their issues of
   concern and the development of their strategies. However, Chinese
   involvement in the transnational environmental movement is still
   limited, owing to China's political conditions as well as the movement's
   early stage of development.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to deploy, from a gender perspective in junction with
   memory and discursive analysis, the complex edges that are interwoven in
   the practices of women's activism in the subversive armed groups. The
   hypothesis that is intended to make is that ``Fabiola{''} emerges as a
   junior female subject, whose militancy in an irregular armed
   organization, questioned the integrity of the nation-State of Chile
   proposed. Her public confession ``as the only gunwoman{''} in the
   Pinochet attack, raises the problem of the discursive formation of
   identity and invites us to ``read in reverse{''} building State and the
   history of the attack.},

   United States},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {30},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {210-222},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Central to traditionalist and revisionist perspectives of
   individual-level party identification is a debate about the stability of
   party identification. We revisit the debate about the dynamic properties
   and processes underlying party identification. We present a conceptual
   framework that defines heterogeneity and state dependence as endpoints
   of a continuum underlying partisan stability, which is important in
   understanding an individual's capacity for updating partisanship. Using
   panel data from the 1992-1996 National Election Study, we estimate
   dynamic, random effects multinomial logit models of party identification
   that distinguish between heterogeneity and ``true state dependence.{''}
   In accord with traditionalist perspectives, our evidence suggests that
   in general, minimal state dependence underlies party identification;
   party identification is strongly stationary. However, we find that age
   enhances the magnitude of state dependence, which provides some support
   for revisionist theories. Overall, our work showcases how explaining
   individual-level dynamics expands our knowledge of partisan stability.

Journal = {PERSPECTIVES ON POLITICS},

Volume = {9},

Pages = {7-23},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {There is no integrated regime governing efforts to limit the extent of
   climate change. Instead, there is a regime complex: a loosely-coupled
   set of specific regimes. We describe the regime complex for climate
   change and seek to explain it, using interest-based, functional, and
   organizational arguments. This institutional form is likely to persist;
   efforts to build a comprehensive regime are unlikely to succeed, but
   experiments abound with narrower institutions focused on particular
   aspects of the climate change problem. Building on this analysis, we
   argue that a climate change regime complex, if it meets specified
   criteria, has advantages over any politically feasible comprehensive
   regime. Adaptability and flexibility are particularly important in a
   setting-such as climate change policy-in which the most demanding
   international commitments are interdependent yet governments vary widely
   in their interest and ability to implement them. Yet in view of the
   serious political constraints, both domestic and international, there is
   little reason for optimism that the climate regime complex that is
   emerging will lead to reductions in emissions rapid enough to meet
   widely discussed goals, such as stopping global warming at two degrees
   above pre-industrial levels.},

Abstract = {This article aims to compare the arbitration agreement of the OHADA
   (Note 1) legal system to that of the People's Republic of China. In the
   Chinese legal system the parties to a contract are required to have an
   arbitration agreement written before the occurrence of any incident in
   the execution of their contract. The parties must specify in advance, in
   the said agreement, the chosen arbitration institution for potential
   disputes. In the OHADA legal system, the parties are free to decide
   before or during execution of the contract of an arbitration agreement.
   They may also decide whether in case of a dispute, they would want to
   refer to an institutional arbitration or an ad hoc arbitration.
   According to the chosen legal system the consequences are different.},

   the characteristics of intergovernmental decision-making},
Journal = {EUROPEAN UNION POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Pages = {65-86},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This article analyses the dimensionality and nature of political
   conflict in the European Union Council of Ministers between 1998 and
   2007. By comparing policy platforms of member state governments,
   multidimensional scaling techniques are employed to make inferences
   about the dimensionality of the Council's political space. The
   dimensions are interpreted performing 1250 multiple regression analyses.
   The results largely corroborate the assumption that cleavages are
   structured along geographically defined clusters of states. After
   Eastern enlargement (2004), a North-South divide was replaced by an
   East-West cleavage. The analysis moreover suggests that there are two
   stable conflict dimensions within the Council's political space. The
   first is an integration dimension that represents the support for
   deepening European Union integration and the transfer of sovereignty to
   a supranational level. The second is a `policy' dimension, manifested
   predominantly in disputes over redistributive policies.},

Journal = {OSTEUROPA},

Volume = {61},

Pages = {179+},
Month = {FEB-MAR},
Abstract = {For years, the northeast passage has been discussed as a new route for
   commercial shipping between Europe and Asia. Voyages between north
   European and north Pacific ports could thus become clearly shorter.
   However, despite the decrease in summer ice cover in the north polar
   sea, navigation remains difficult. In its central sector, the northern
   sea route, which is controlled by Russia, voyages are subject to
   approval, ice-breaker escorts obligatory. Together with high insurance
   costs, this drives up transport expenses. Despite tremendous savings in
   fuel and time, it depends on each individual case whether the northern
   route is in fact less expensive than the route through the Suez Canal.},

Abstract = {Russia's Northwest is rich in mineral resources. Mining therefore plays
   a considerable socioeconomic role, especially on the Kola Peninsula. The
   geology of the camp sites and the geochemistry of the ores impede
   removal. Therefore, international mining companies are barely
   represented in the region, and the vertically integrated Russian
   corporate enterprises in the primary industry face numerous problems. On
   the basis of its significance for the entire northwest, however, mining
   can be certain of the state's attention.},

Journal = {GERMAN POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {20},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {This article examines the role of small parties in the German party
   system. It thus attempts to make a contribution to a largely
   under-researched topic in the existing literature. The goal is to
   determine the influence and ultimately the pivotal role of small parties
   over time both federally and in each Land (1949-2010). For that purpose
   we develop a five-point `opportunity structure' scale. During the heyday
   of West Germany's two-and-a-half-party system (from the early 1960s to
   the early 1980s) the FDP was not just the main small party but the
   pivotal kingmaker at least federally, deciding which of the major
   parties (CDU/CSU or SPD) would be in government. Since then the Greens
   and later the PDS/die Linke have also become durable small parties and
   play an important role in the government formation process. The analysis
   shows that based on our measure the Greens have at least equalled if not
   surpassed the FDP as the country's most influential small party since
   they emerged on the political scene in the early 1980s.},

Title = {Political Violence: Suicide Operations},
Booktitle = {HIZBULLAH'S IDENTITY CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2011},
Pages = {87-112},
Abstract = {After the nearly complete Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon in May 2000,
   Hizbullah had not committed a single martyrdom operation although it
   engaged, on many occasions, the Israeli soldiers in Shib'a and kidnapped
   three soldiers on 7 October 2000 and two on 12 July 2006. Contrary to
   what has been rumored, the party did not conduct martyrdom operations in
   the `Second Lebanon War' or the July 2006 War since Hizbullah had the
   required arsenal to face the invading IDF and was able to inflict heavy
   casualties, killing more than 100 soldiers. In fact, Hizbullah's last
   martyrdom operation was conducted in 1999.
   The basic question of this chapter is to study how religious, political,
   and national discourse is used to justify martyrdom for Islamic
   movements, in particular the Lebanese Hizbullah. (In other words, this
   chapter is about how nationalist and political discourses intermingle
   with a religious discourse on martyrdom, and how Hizbullah, an
   organization perceived as religious/fundamentalist, is relying, in
   addition to religious discourse, on nationalist and political discourses
   in its representation of martyrdom). My main concern is to analyze how
   the religious authorities of Hizbullah deal with this question, and how
   this discourse changes overtime. Thus, I endeavor to expose Hizbullah's
   religious-political discourse and analyze fatwas (religious edits) and
   speeches dealing with the issue of martyrdom. I contest the commonly
   held view that regards martyrdom as a specifically Shi'ite phenomenon,
   arguing that, in addition to Sunni Palestinians, Lebanese nationalists,
   from all religious denominations, have also carried out such operations.
   I would like to debunk a few myths too, for instance the one regarding
   the social background of suicide bombers. I endeavor to rupture
   stereotypes and challenge the master narrative on the Islamic movements'
   constituency being ``made up of poor desperate people who commit suicide
   so that they can enjoy the virgins in Paradise.{''} The problematic is
   that although martyrdom has become the trademark of radical Islamic
   groups, it was not solely carried out by them. I purport that the icon
   that both parties, secularists and Islamists, embraced is that martyrdom
   operations were conducted in order to uphold the honor, pride, and
   dignity of the `nation' ('izzat wa karamat al-umma). Thus, I argue that
   martyrdom operations - whether carried out by Islamic movements or
   resistance movements - are altruistic, self-sacrificial operations
   conveyed in the form of symbolic capital (honor and dignity).},

   Development Community relationship},
Journal = {AFRICAN JOURNAL ON CONFLICT RESOLUTION},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Pages = {129-152},
Abstract = {With ever increasing urgency, the United Nations (UN) has worked to
   develop the budding security relationship between itself and regional
   economic communities (RECs) in Africa, especially the African Union
   (AU), the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), and the
   Southern African Development Community (SADC). In conflict resolution
   efforts in Southern Africa, this relationship has sometimes featured
   competition and tension, with more than one organisation vying for the
   lead, or in other cases, trying to pass the blame for failures. Since
   the UN's early peace mission in the Congo under Dag Hammarskjold,
   achieving peace and stability in Africa has been a monumental task. This
   article explores whether new regional partnerships can help facilitate
   this goal in Southern Africa and whether the current principles of
   cooperation between the UN and regional organisations are sufficient for
   the task at hand. This article takes lessons from the conflict
   resolution efforts in Madagascar, Zimbabwe, and the Democratic Republic
   of the Congo (DRC) to illustrate recent examples of cooperation and/or
   competition as they are unfolding in the present, with an emphasis on
   analysing the institutional relationship between the UN, AU and SADC in
   Southern Africa. This article concludes that there are still major
   limitations on the successful regionalisation of conflict management
   efforts in Southern Africa and that the UN and its partner organisations
   need to clarify and improve their working relationship to improve their
   chances of facilitating successful peacemaking.},

Abstract = {Taking the growing use of deportation by many states, including the UK
   and the USA, as its point of departure, this article examines the
   implications of deportation for how citizenship is understood and
   conceptualised in liberal states. We follow scholars such as Walters
   (2002, Citizenship studies, 6 (2), 265-292) and Nicholas De Genova
   (2010, The deportation regime: sovereignty, space and freedom of
   movement. Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 33-65) in seeing
   deportation as a practice that is `constitutive of citizenship', one
   that reaffirms the formal and normative boundaries of membership in an
   international system of nominally independent states. However, we draw
   on the UK to show that, as a particularly definitive and symbolically
   resonant way of dividing citizens from (putative) strangers, deportation
   is liable to generate conflicts amongst citizens and between citizens
   and the state over the question of who is part of the normative
   community of members. Such conflict is, we show, a key and everyday
   feature of the many local anti-deportation campaigns that currently
   operate in support of individuals and families facing expulsion in
   liberal states. Although often used by governmental elites as a way to
   reaffirm the shared significance of citizenship, deportation, we
   suggest, may serve to highlight just how divided and confused modern
   societies are in how they conceptualise both who is a member and who has
   the right to judge who belongs.},

Abstract = {This article explores the relationship between civil society and
   community resilience in coastal communities in Brazil, Canada, Chile and
   Cuba. In understanding the role of social capital in community
   development, we do not feel sufficient attention has been paid to the
   subtle microdynamics of civil network structure. Using social network
   analysis, we explore the link between community cohesion and resilience.
   Attention is given to conflicting interests that characterize these
   communities and how they manifest themselves in civic participation and
   factional affiliations. We find that organizational diversity is a
   necessary condition for community vitality, but organizations can become
   captive to factional interests. The critical factors for resilience are
   associated with a benign side of factions (a plurality of inclusive
   ties) and the presence of keystone bridging agents. Each offers hidden
   mechanisms for neutralizing the effects of fragmentation by providing a
   cohesive capability which remains latent until crises call for
   collective action.},

   partnered with some community organizations in the areas we studied. In
   addition to the large number of community members who helped us with our
   study, we would like to thank the following people for their
   contributions to various stages of the project: Maria do Rosario
   Andrade, Marfisa Cyneiros de Barros, Dr Cathy Conrad, Janet Larkman,
   Beatriz Larrondo, Juliana Andrade Leitao, Gelda Lhamas, Elisa Pacheco,
   Sandra Sandoval, Paula Soto, and Cyntia Tscha. An earlier draft of this
   article was presented under the title `The Micro-dynamics of Civil
   Society in Community Resilience and Vulnerability. A comparative study
   of coastal communities in Eastern Canada, Cuba, North-East Brazil and
   Southern Chile' at the MARE Conference `People and the Sea V: Living
   with Uncertainty and Adapting to Change', Centre for Maritime Research,
   University of Amsterdam, 9-11 July 2009. We would like to thank the
   participants at the conference and Drs Russell Westhaver and Diane
   Crocker for helpful comments. Three anonymous reviewers have also
   provided much needed encouragement and valuable suggestions for
   revision.},

Abstract = {India's disarmament policy has often been regarded as long on rhetoric
   and short on delivery. But, argues Rajesh Basrur, its approach to arms
   stability and reduction has been consistent, maintaining that
   non-proliferation and universal disarmament are mutually dependent.
   India has developed a minimalist nuclear posture that offers deterrence
   stability at low numbers, and could be a model for other nuclear powers
   seeking to reduce their arsenal.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the inclusion and regulation of social rights in the
   Statutes of Autonomy of second generation, the main features of the
   intense academic debate on this issue and the controversial doctrine
   established by the Constitutional Court Judgments 247/2007, on the
   Statute of the Comunidad Valenciana, and 31/2010, on the Statute of
   Catalonia. From a general conceptual framework, the author highlights
   the arguments that support the legitimacy of their establishment and
   their relation to fundamental rights, the respect for constitutional
   limits, their authentic character of subjective rights in terms of
   structure and regulatory function and, ultimately, the central role
   given to them by the ``estatuyente{''} legislator in a new statutory
   model which wants to be supported by the establishment of direct links
   with citizens.},

Abstract = {This article is a functional analysis of the Committee of the Regions
   (CoR) of the European Union (EU). Whereas what little has been written
   of the CoR tends to downplay its significance, relegating it to a
   `merely' advisory role, this article contends that it has assumed and
   performs meaningful advisory and representational functions. The article
   also places the CoR fully in the context of the EU's commitment to the
   principle of subsidiarity and within the debate over the EU's
   `democratic deficit'. Basing the analysis on CoR and Commission
   documents, its performance of advisory, representational and symbolic
   roles are evaluated adapting Christiansen's functional categories. While
   the CoR is not a co-equal of the Commission or Council it has
   established for itself a presence in the constellation of EU bodies.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the viability of Benford's Law in the forensic
   study of the detection of electoral frauds. According to this law, the
   initial digits of a set of numbers follow a logarithmic distribution as
   long as the data has not been disturbed. Implementation of this law in
   socioeconomic data-or in other types of data-depends on the presence of
   a two-fold randomized process: events of a distribution, and probability
   distributions selected from a reduced group. Through agent-based models,
   it is demonstrated that this law does not offer a robust test to
   distinguish between clean elections and elections that have been
   manipulated. In the model-in-question, partisan preferences are modified
   by means of social transmission and the parameters are calibrated with
   data from the Mexican 2006 elections.},

   a serious impact. The Ministry of Defence must overcome its chronic
   failure to prioritise and be more realistic in its specifications - and
   the government must bring the SDSR up to date with post- Libya foreign

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the political economy of the creeping militarization
   of U.S. foreign policy. The core argument is that in integrating the
   ``3D{''} approach-defense, development, and diplomacy-policymakers have
   assigned responsibilities to military personnel which go beyond their
   comparative advantage, requiring them to become social engineers tasked
   with constructing entire societies. Evidence from The U.S. Army
   Stability Operations Field Manual is presented to illustrate the wide
   scope of responsibilities assigned to the U.S. military. The tools of
   political economy are used to analyze some of the implications.},

Abstract = {Nationalist rallies and interethnic clashes in December 2010 on Moscow's
   Manezh Square and in other Russian cities led to an increased level of
   public discussion about the need to improve interethnic relations in the
   country and to combat xenophobia. Despite an expansion of official
   rhetoric and the introduction of various new initiatives, however,
   contradictory policies and ambiguous political messages run the risk of
   leaving ethnic tensions to simmer without addressing their root causes,
   and may even aggravate them. Improving security for all of Russia's
   ethnic groups will require more consistent, concrete actions and will
   depend on Russia's ability to address sources of broader social
   discontent.},

Journal = {NATIONAL IDENTITIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Pages = {67-88},
Abstract = {This article questions the official recognition of emigre architect Mies
   van der Rohe as the canonic figure shaping the International Style as
   the quintessential American mode of architectural expression. The
   article examines how historians, critics and curators placed the work of
   Mies in the American historiography of the modern movement by
   interpreting his work in light of modernist paradigms that prevailed in
   the United States from the early 1930s to the years following the Second
   World War. It is argued that Mies's work provided for scholars of the
   emerging First World a fertile ground to figure the universal
   transnational merits of modern architecture as a particular expression
   of the American nation, spirit and cherished values of freedom,
   individualism and pragmatic, puritan rigor. Dwelling on concepts such as
   `liberal democracy', `American Exeptionalism' and `the patrimony of a
   modernist past', the article examines how the Miesian canon and the
   image it offered for postwar `America' was entangled in intertwined
   architectural and national histories.},

   populist style with a neo-liberal agenda to win the support of social
   sectors that are among the most damaged by neo-liberal policies. The
   article claims that in countries where a populist movement succeeded in
   the past to include previously excluded social groups, a populist
   habitus develops that explains the support given by those same groups to
   leaders who emerge from those populist movements, even when they pursue
   neo-liberal policies. The paper compares Israel's Binyamin Netanyahu and
   Argentina's Carlos Menem to support this claim.},

Title = {Decision-making and Contested Heritage in Northern Ireland: The Former
   Maze Prison/Long Kesh},
Journal = {IRISH POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {26},
Number = {3},
Pages = {383-401},
Abstract = {The former Maze Prison/Long Kesh in Lisburn, near Belfast, is one of the
   primary sites associated with the `The Troubles' in Northern Ireland.
   Controversy about the site's future makes it clear that the
   redevelopment of contested heritage cannot be divorced from the policy
   process of a negotiated settlement between opposed communities and
   parties. However, research indicates that, despite the stated
   `inclusive' intent of the Maze/Long Kesh redevelopment, decision-making
   about the site is often viewed as removed from stakeholder interests and
   input. Instead, many see plans for, as well as ongoing arguments about,
   the site redevelopment as determined by party politics, as well as
   parochial interests pitting those based in Lisburn against others in
   Belfast. Thus, community-level and other stakeholder interests are often
   perceived to be ignored. Findings are informed by in-depth interviews
   with representatives from two loyalist and three republican ex-prisoner
   groups, each representing different paramilitary factions, as well as a
   loyalist cultural organisation, a cross-community victims'/survivors'
   group and a community relations charity. The material is balanced by
   further interviews with senior civil servants and politicians from both
   nationalist and unionist parties.},

Abstract = {Based on the second wave of the Citizen Political Ambition Panel Study,
   we provide the first thorough analysis of how gender affects women and
   men's efficacy to run for office. Our findings reveal that, despite
   comparable credentials, backgrounds, and experiences, accomplished women
   are substantially less likely than similarly situated men to perceive
   themselves as qualified to seek office. Importantly, women and men rely
   on the same factors when evaluating themselves as candidates, but women
   are less likely than men to believe they meet these criteria. Not only
   are women more likely than men to doubt that they have skills and traits
   necessary for electoral politics, but they are also more likely to doubt
   their abilities to engage in campaign mechanics. These findings are
   critical because the perceptual differences we uncover account for much
   of the gender gap in potential candidates' self-efficacy and ultimately
   hinder women's prospects for political equality.},

Number = {1},
Pages = {47-61},
Abstract = {This article reviews the content, assumptions and implications of the
   principle of the social distribution of power within Montesquieu's
   general theory of the separation of powers. In challenging a tradition
   that has been devoted to the principle of the juridical distribution of
   executive, legislative and judicial functions, and at the same time
   denouncing the anachronism of the principle of social distribution, I
   first sustain that this principle is independent of the class model to
   which it is applied by Montesquieu. Secondly, I maintain that juridical
   distribution depends on social distribution in order to avoid the abuse
   of power and to safeguard public freedom. Finally, I hold that the
   principle of social distribution refers to the essentially political
   dimension of Montesquieu's theory of power.},

   I present a reanalysis of the results found in Groseclose and Milyo

   positions of media outlets are not stable over time. Using the same data
   but analyzed over different periods of time, I find a different
   conclusion than the previous article. I examine four-year rolling time
   periods and find that the data produce different parameter estimates in
   the early- to mid-1990s as compared to after 2000, with all analyzed
   outlets appearing more moderate or conservative in later time periods.
   My results indicate that the estimated positions are sensitive
   observations in the data and the time period of observation of the
   outlet.},

Abstract = {This article represents the final output of the IGA project:
   ``Energetika a evropsky system obchodovani s emisemi{''} ({''}Energy
   industry and the European system of emission trading{''}). Similarly to
   the two previous articles, it concerns one of the primary challenges of
   the European Union - global, economically and environmentally
   sustainable growth that is nowadays jeopardised by climate change caused
   by increasing concentration of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere.
   Nevertheless, the article itself is conceived to be more general in
   order to fulfil the primary goal of the project, i.e. to present expert
   estimation of costs and determine main economic impacts of the reduction
   commitment under the conditions of the Czech economy, and indicate its
   possible influence on the on-going liberalisation of the energy market.
   The article builds both on the most important liberalisation trends and
   on the model outputs of the two previous articles. The authors'
   objective in this article is to provide qualified basic argumentation
   concerning mentioned conclusions and thus contribute to actual, very
   intensive and open discussion on this topic.},

Title = {PROVIDING NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL DEFENCE AND SECURITY UNDER THE
   IMPACT OF GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS},
Journal = {POLITICKE VEDY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {14},
Number = {4},
Pages = {130-143},
Abstract = {Since the end of the Cold War and the bipolar division of the world into
   two antagonistic pacts - Warsaw Pact and North Atlantic Pact, the global
   security situation has noticeably changed. The significant changes in
   the global security environment have brought, besides a lot of
   positives, also a number of deformations, which have gradually started
   to assume the form of various asymmetric security threats. Occurring
   against the background of globalisation and ongoing global financial
   crisis, the emergence of new military and non-military threats is
   directly linked to the growth of requirements for national defence and
   security. As a result, national defence security, independence,
   sovereignty, combined with the protection of citizens' lives and
   property, belong to the basic roles which every state still needs to
   fulfil. For this reason, the author of this article deals with new
   security threats and changes in global security environment, analyses
   the trends in the area of financial support of national and
   international defence and security under the negative circumstances of
   the global financial crisis, and simultaneously, points out that budget
   reductions of NATO defence ministries may result in the weakening of the
   defence capabilities of the entire Alliance, thus making the entire
   society more vulnerable.},

Abstract = {The Doha round of multilateral trade negotiations, if completed, will
   become the longest round in the history of multilateral trade
   negotiations. Since 2011 it is possible to identify efforts to
   revitalise negotiations, whereby actual situation differs from the one
   in 2008, when negotiations collapsed for the last time. Current
   agricultural prices may help facilitate compromise in the area of the
   agricultural negotiations; on the other hand the European Union and the
   United States require a compromise in the area of sectoral negotiations
   as a condition sine qua non conclusion of the negotiations. Above
   average unilateral trade liberalisation of developing countries in these
   sectors justifies demands of the European Union and the United States
   for a specific approach in this area for ambitious outcomes of the
   negotiations. The article describes contemporary state of negotiations
   with emphasis on the positions of the European Union.},
