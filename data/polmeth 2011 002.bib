Abstract = {The article points out significant methodological difficulties that
   modern social sciences face referring to the categories of the sacred
   and the charismatic. According to the author, the reason for such
   problems lies in the refusal to take into account transcendental
   dimension of the sacred, in the a priori belief that the latter is
   immanent in the social, in the treatment of the phenomenon of the
   charismatic solely as a type of symbolic capital, which contradicts the
   initial meaning of the terms and is hardly consistent with the sum of
   empirical observations on the cooperation between the sacred and the
   social (especially, the sacred and the political). S. Kaspe finds a
   solution to this paradox of ``non-divine charisma{''} in Shils'
   sociology showing that its reanimation might provide a key towards
   understanding a lot of acute political challenges.},

Abstract = {With the advancement of information and communication technology,
   virtual teams are becoming more popular as geographical constraints in
   collaboration have become a non-issue. Features of the technology and
   characteristics of the group influence interaction processes and
   outcomes. Two elements are the focus of this paper. The first is
   anonymity, which has been made feasible by technology. The other
   concerns gender. Gender is an important research target, and its role in
   groupwork must not be overlooked. Both elements have aroused much
   interest across multiple research fields. The existing literature shows
   their potential in influencing team collaboration processes,
   satisfaction, and performance. In this paper, the authors present a
   process-based interpretation of virtual team collaboration,
   incorporating the anonymity of technology and the gender difference of
   team members. Using a multiple case study approach, the paper identifies
   a key set of process variables that shape team performance. The study
   also examines the interdependencies among the processes. Task-related
   activity that occurred during team discussion was affected by gender
   anonymity, and this influenced group performance and members'
   satisfaction toward the collaboration process. Group dynamics, including
   member awareness, leader emergence, and member's conformity, are salient
   process variables that affect the virtual team performance as well.},

Abstract = {This article examines the sociological dimension of the
   gerontological-geriatric concept of frailty. This concept is rooted in a
   biopsychosocial model of ageing. In addition to socio-structural
   factors, also micro-social behaviour patterns and implications of the
   frailty concept for society are discussed. Studies, which are referenced
   in this article, provide strong empirical evidence for the impact of
   social factors on processes of becoming frail. Frailty does not only
   imply physiological changes, but is closely connected to appropriate
   subjective coping mechanisms (role-making). However, the frailty concept
   still lacks an exhaustive socio-theoretical foundation.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ELECTIONS PUBLIC OPINION AND PARTIES},

Abstract = {Does a candidate's pathway to parliament affect subsequent legislative
   roles and behavior? Party candidate nomination processes in Canada are
   very decentralized, with responsibility for candidate selection
   allocated to the local constituency associations. However, candidates
   may also secure a nomination by being ``parachuted{''} into a
   constituency: appointed by the party leader as the candidate who will
   stand for the party in the general election. This practice is most
   common in the Liberal Party of Canada, and as such we study this party's
   candidates in the six most recent elections (between 1993 and 2008) in
   order to explore both (a) the characteristics of parachuted and locally
   nominated MPs; and (b) the legislative consequences of parachuting
   candidates into constituencies. We find that party leaders are using the
   power of appointment to recruit both star candidates and women into the
   House of Commons, but that appointed candidates from each of these
   groups serve very different roles in Parliament. We find a strong link
   between nomination method and subsequent legislative roles and
   activities: parachuted candidates are much more likely to serve in
   high-profile legislative positions while locally nominated candidates
   are more likely to engage in low-profile legislative activities. The
   process by which candidates come to stand for election, we argue,
   directly affects the nature of representation by Members of Parliament
   in the legislature, and has implications for the study of candidate
   nomination and legislative roles in parties in other democracies.},

Abstract = {Research on the EU has expanded considerably in recent years. Studies
   have moved from examining the power of the various EU institutions
   across time to focusing on the internal activities and organisation of
   these institutions. The current piece makes a critical assessment of the
   existing literature on the EU institutions and considers which future
   steps need to be taken to move the literature forward. It argues that
   the articles in this volume move the literature further by examining
   internal institutional changes in the EU bodies in the light of the
   broader inter-institutional relationships between them. Moreover, it
   recommends that future research on the EU institutions expand these
   insights even further by extending the scope of the studies to embed
   them in a comprehensive understanding of the broader political system of
   the EU as a whole.},

Abstract = {Beyond the prophetic discourse on the Internet virtues to promote the
   emergence of a European public sphere, the Web gives rise to various
   investments to promote Europe, ranging from institutions to
   ``ordinary{''} citizens. Our case study, Cafebabel. com, highlights the
   ambiguities of a paradoxical position between an approach based on the
   stated willingness to encourage the expression of European citizens, and
   a proximity to informational sources, combined with a relative
   dependence of institutional resources which determine its existence and
   survival. The study of enunciative situations shows the difficulties in
   producing the standards of a legitimate, but non institutional, speech
   about Europe.},

Journal = {OSTERREICHISCHE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR POLITIKWISSENSCHAFT},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {40},

Pages = {283+},
Abstract = {The first of the eleven women resistance camps took place in Hunsrueck
   (FRG) since 1983, where amazing broad coalitions of feminists against
   militarism and men's violence formed. These early camps give an example
   for the coalition work that is necessary to form such coalitions (f.e.
   development of proceedings to manage conflicts as part of institutional
   arrangements) and this work can be illustrated as a contingent social
   process for alliances. It turns out that political camping is more than
   a means to an end for protest on the ground, since cohabitation at the
   camps proves to have functioned as a motor of these coalitions. This
   shows the structural significance of the camp as a political laboratory,
   as a utopian forum, as a territorial based, temporary, reflexive form of
   organisation, mobilisation, participation, action and protest, also but
   especially for broad political alliances. The early women resistance
   camps in Hunsrueck are a camp with specific (e.g. feminist)
   characteristics and criteria that can not or not be adequately described
   with current approaches of coalition theories.},

Abstract = {This text analyses Truth Commissions as a political mechanism engaging
   with two main questions: one, the central role of testimonies in
   providing both ethical and political legitimacy to truth commissions and
   information regarding the violation of human rights; two, the work of
   professionals from law and the social sciences in providing scientific
   legitimacy and in their position as `privileged' witnesses of the
   truth-telling process. Throughout the analysis of a specific case - the
   Peruvian Truth and Reconciliation Commission-I discuss the possibilities
   of scientific knowledge to produce a more complete understanding of
   ``the violence{''} and the need to question certain interpretative
   assumptions regarding the political agency of certain populations, in
   this case, of the Andean rural communities.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on a new and growing trend in the United States:
   multiracial (or mixed race) identification. Multiracial
   self-identification forces us to consider that the norms of racial
   identification are shifting in which Americans perceive greater
   individual agency in how they choose to racially identify compared to
   the choices offered in the past. Given this, is the willingness to
   identify as multiracial a proxy for changing political attitudes about
   American race relations? Using a unique data set that includes multiple
   measures of racial identification, this article examines the
   individual-level determinants that predict who is willing to
   self-identify as multiracial and the political consequences of this
   identity. This research demonstrates the complexity of racial
   identification today as well as the need to reconsider how race is
   measured in public opinion surveys. Most importantly, the data
   demonstrate that those who self-identify as multiracial hold different
   racial attitudes than those who do not.},

Journal = {IRISH POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {26},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {579-592},
Abstract = {This article investigates how issues of political responsibility connect
   to the combatant/civilian distinction in armed conflict. It does so by
   looking at an attempted moral justification of terrorism in a democracy
   by a just war theorist. The attempt was by Igor Primoratz, who claims
   that civilians who actively support injustice do not merit immunity from
   targeting. Primoratz suggests amending the principle of civilian
   immunity to permit targeting of civilians who are culpable for an unjust
   war. This article argues that culpability plays no role in the
   justification of targeting combatants and cannot be used to justify the
   targeting of civilians. Combatants may be targeted in war because of a
   convention-dependent permission that they may be treated as instruments.
   Civilians may not be targeted in war because no such
   convention-dependent permission exists (and there are no benefits to
   creating such a convention). Nor can the justification of self-defence
   be used to justify the targeting of civilians in armed conflict because
   there is a threshold of culpability to be met before self-defence is
   permitted, and the citizens of a democracy do not meet that minimum
   standard.},

Abstract = {A key reason for pessimism with respect to greenhouse gas emissions
   reduction relates to the `motivation problem', whereby those who could
   make the biggest difference prima facie have the least incentive to act
   because they are most able to adapt: how can we motivate such people
   (and thereby everyone else) to accept, indeed to initiate, the changes
   to their lifestyles that are required for effective emissions
   reductions? This paper offers an account inspired by Rawls of the good
   of membership of `intergenerational cooperative union' to achieve
   justice that provides a solution to the motivation problem.},

Abstract = {This paper (1) translates theoretical notions of optimal security
   allocations into concrete policy recommendations and (2) compares these
   recommendations with actual transport security policy and transport
   security allocations in Norway. I argue that when protecting against
   mass-casualty attacks, priority should be given to potential targets
   that would suffer high casualties and that have a high number of foreign
   travelers, low employee density, many hiding places, many entry/exit
   points, high passenger anonymity, and high system fragility. Interviews
   with Norwegian transport authorities suggest that budget constraints and
   international commitments, rather than concerns for efficiency at the
   aggregate (national) level, determine the authorities' allocation of
   security resources.},

Journal = {POLITOLOGICKY CASOPIS-CZECH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Abstract = {The authors of this contribution give a detailed account of the
   territorial and participatory aspects of the reform of Slovene local
   self-government and analyse its effects on the further development of
   local democracy. Special emphasis is given to studying the fragmentation
   of Slovene municipalities and to the issue of regionalisation, since
   tendencies towards the establishment of a two-tier form of local
   self-government have been present in the Slovene politico-administrative
   space for a long time. The scope of access to, or the right of all
   citizens to participate in decision-making on local public matters is
   another important aspect of studying the degree of democracy at the
   local level. The authors demonstrate this in the light of the expansion
   of the right in political participation by members of the Italian and
   Hungarian national communities and by members of the ethnic Roma
   community, as well as through the analysis of the actual political
   participation of all groups in the population, whilst not omitting to
   mention the development of civil-society participation, which is
   becoming ever more apparent at the local level.},

Abstract = {The implementation of public consultation proceedings, required by the
   European Water Framework Directive (WFD 2000/60/EC), could renew the
   water regimes in Europe, according principles of transparency,
   accountability and efficiency. We assume these consultation proceedings
   could empower citizens within the water policy making and assessment,
   and could weaken corporatist and statist management, which are
   responsible for deficient implementation of the previous environmental
   laws. The investigation led to two periods of consultation, in the
   Adour-Garonne water catchment in 2005 and 2008. Firstly the
   investigation allows to observe the steps of construction and
   justification of the new features for public consultation. Secondly the
   analysis focuses on effects of consultation on water policy.},

Abstract = {After decades of military rule, Nigeria finally returned to `elected'
   civilian rule in 1999. However, this paper raises critical questions
   about the quality and depth of the resulting democracy in Nigeria by
   examining successive elections in 2003 and 2007. It suggests that since
   the transition elections of 1999, a post-military political elite has
   subverted democracy and has removed electoral power from the Nigerian
   people through a host of devices, including the manipulation of
   electoral processes, political institutions, and security agencies. In
   spite of reports by local monitors and international election observers
   regarding the flawed nature of both post-1999 elections, the response of
   the international community has ranged between symbolic and feeble
   protests to an ambivalent stand, to open tolerance of such `elected
   dictatorships'. In conclusion, the paper sums up the factors behind the
   crisis of electoral democracy in Nigeria, its implications, and the
   prospects of Nigerians effectively organizing to win back the right to
   choose their political representatives and leaders.},

Year = {2011},

Abstract = {The collision between climate science and climate policy was strikingly
   manifested during the Bush-Cheney Administration. Based on both the
   documentary record and direct observation, this chapter reviews multiple
   means by which the Administration controlled the flow of climate science
   communication from federal scientists and research programs when
   Administration officials saw a need to conform science communication
   with Administration politics. Government secrecy imposed via information
   control was evident, for example, in the editing of climate program
   reports; the suppression of official reference to an existing major
   climate impacts assessment; selective application of control over
   contacts between government scientists and the media; alteration of
   congressional testimony; shutting down of government Web sites;
   ``stealth'' release of reports to minimize public attention; and
   concealing a Supreme Court-mandated scientifically based draft document
   that would have triggered regulation of greenhouse gases to protect
   public welfare. With these political interventions, the response from
   the ranks of federal career science managers and research scientists
   varied, ranging from open criticism, anonymous leaks, and whistleblowing
   to silence, self-censorship, and active complicity.},

Journal = {POLITOLOGICKY CASOPIS-CZECH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Pages = {274-299},
Abstract = {This article seeks to identify functional and systemic shortcomings of
   the Register of Interest Representatives (the Register) and contrasts
   them with the Commission's own evaluation of the Register's functioning.
   Special attention is accorded to the analysis of financial data
   published by interest groups in the Register. The article builds on
   original empirical research in which quantifiable data from 1063
   registered interest groups were evaluated. The analysis of the financial
   data is complemented by the results of a questionnaire given to the
   registered interest groups. The questionnaire was addressed to almost
   one third (324) of interests registered at the end of February 2009; the
   return rate achieved 22.84 \%. The research suggests that the methods
   for calculating financial amounts are inadequate. This situation is
   exacerbated by a passive control system of truthfulness and completeness
   of registered data, as well as by a weak voluntarily motivation to
   register and by the lack of a sanctions policy. These factors diminish
   the credibility of the data in the Register. Consequently, the level of
   transparency with regard to the financial aspects of lobbying is, to a
   great extent, limited.},

Abstract = {The starting point of the author's analysis is the assertion of the
   steadiness of the Stalin power system and of the pro-Soviet orientations
   - in respect of values and of behavior - in contemporary Russia, which
   the author polemically determines as Soviet post-Communist Russia. The
   main topics of analysis are: stages of evolution of the Communist regime
   (1917 - 1991); the historic and cultural preconditions of its ripening,
   and particularities of its formation and subsequent transformation into
   the post-Soviet regime.},

Abstract = {Since 2008 the language of economic crisis has dominated American
   political discourse. In this article it is argued that within the
   context of the current economic crisis, there has been a shift from
   market-talk that displaces human agency to an active naming and
   production of blameworthy subjects. This, it is suggested, serves a
   political and ideological function by focusing attention on individuals
   and groups and away from a confrontation with the normative and systemic
   violence of capitalism itself. By attending to the multiple corollary
   discourses of responsibility through which the economic crisis is framed
   this article interrogates the ways in which responsibility renders
   political moments intelligible through ascriptions of blame and
   accountability that both structure how economic crisis is perceived and
   delimit possible responses to economic events. It is suggested that in
   order to respond effectively to normative problems, systemic violence,
   and structural injustice we must first deconstruct the economic
   discourse that shuttles between a market-centered model of
   responsibility and an agent-centered blame model of responsibility, both
   of which serve to sustain the sanctity of the market.},

Journal = {OSTERREICHISCHE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR POLITIKWISSENSCHAFT},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {40},
Number = {4},
Pages = {401+},
Abstract = {This paper discusses how online genome-wide DNA tests that are marketed
   direct-to-consumer (DTC) have become policy challenges in many European
   and North American countries despite the small number of people who have
   taken such tests world-wide. It is argued that interpretive approaches
   are uniquely placed to help us understand the deeper challenge to the
   very categories underpinning the delivery of medical care that online
   personal genomics (PG) services seem to pose. For example, these online
   tests symbolise the part-reversal of the hierarchy between those
   traditionally been seen as `experts' and `lay people', and the blurring
   of the boundaries between the medical and the non-medical. Ultimately,
   the employment of an interpretive approach, which focuses on how actors
   use and challenge labels, classifications, and categories, shows that
   the controversy over DTC genome tests concerns the question of who
   should be allowed to make authoritative predictions about other people's
   lives a core statement about the distribution of power. It is a
   redistribution of power in this respect that seems to necessitate policy
   change in the field of PG.},

   discussion is provided. I argue that the present categories of the

Abstract = {This article looks at Russian national identity through the prism of
   Western theories of nationalism, and finds that Russia is something of a
   special case. The Russian Federation does not have a clear and
   consistent narrative of what is the national identity which unites its
   citizens. A concept based on ethnic Russian (Russkii) identity could
   alienate the one in five of the population who are not ethnic Russians.
   Efforts in the 1990s to create a purely `civic' national identity, based
   on individual rights. were unsuccessful. The legacy of Soviet times.
   where loyalty to the state was separate from ethnic identity. continues
   to shape the Russian state's approach to the nationality question.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to further our understanding of how social structure
   affects the onset of civil war. Existing studies to date have been
   inconclusive, focusing only on single-cleavage characteristics of social
   structure, such as ethnic or religious fractionalization. This study
   argues that models that do not take into account the relationship
   between cleavages (or cleavage structure) are biased and thus reach
   faulty conclusions. With the focus on the cleavages of ethnicity and
   religion, the effects of two characteristics of cleavage structure on
   civil war onset (cross-cuttingness and cross-fragmentation) are defined
   and tested. A new index of ethno-religious cross-cuttingness (ERC),
   derived from national public opinion surveys, reveals that ERC is a
   significant determinant of civil war onset when interacted with ethnic
   fractionalization.},

Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {33},
Number = {1},
Pages = {45-58},
Abstract = {The concept of panopticism has given traction to an understanding of
   technology as an agent for control of the masses both collectively and
   as individuals. The authors argue this conceptualization fails to
   capture a critical new aspect of technological advances. In particular,
   the individual's control over her environment has become the driving
   force in information technology. The Internet allows the individual to
   control virtually all content received or delivered. Through these
   technology venues, the individual also now has the capacity to
   communicate with the masses at will. The individual is now an operative
   in the surveillance society so political and social elites are at risk
   of disclosure of aberrant behavior through instantaneous disclosure by
   any random witness. Accordingly, technology has created an evolution in
   societal power relationships. The authors construe this as
   ``Ego-Panopticism.{''} The ego-panoptic construct they identify has two
   related but discrete dimensions. First, the individual has a greater
   capacity to keep the powerful in check through individual-level
   surveillance of society. Second, the individual is more capable of
   constructing the world that exists around her. State and society have an
   increased susceptibility to control by or influence fromthe individual
   while there is also a simultaneous limitation on the ability of state
   and society to force the individual to conform. Through emerging
   technology, individuals have partially usurped the surveillance society
   and redefined the spatialization, coercive discourse, and totality of
   experience of the panopticon.},

Abstract = {Divergent responses to the sinking of the ROKS Cheonan and the shelling
   of Yeonpyeong Island in 2010 have raised tensions in Northeast Asia.
   China's enabling response appeared to write North Korea a blank cheque
   for further provocations; but Beijing has in fact been constrained by
   fear of destabilisation of the Kim regime. The incidents have prompted a
   reappraisal of bilateral relations within the region - in particular,
   the South Korea-US alliance - and revealed the continuing importance of
   the Sino-US relationship in Korean peninsular security affairs.},

Abstract = {In the context of a transition from a republican to a democratic form of
   government in the United States on 2009, can we think perhaps in an
   alternative agenda towards the Andes and the Caribbean?
   We believe that the U.S. military, economic and commercial hegemony in
   Latin America is not being questioned. While there are important new
   changes in the internal domestic agendas that are expressed in the
   demands of social sectors in the United States for new economic and
   social agendas and the need for a profound transformation in
   international relations, foreign policies in Latin American oriented
   towards hemispheric security and free trade agendas are maintained. In
   this paper we will show how these two major foreign policy components
   are combined under the Republican and Democratic administrations since
   the 1950s to the 1990s. In the context of the confrontation for the
   presidential election of the United States (2008) the main political
   forces contributes to the legitimacy of these two agendas, in the Andes
   and the Caribbean, strengthening ties with Colombia, Mexico and Panama
   as a strategy of containment of the so-called progressive governments.},

   Democracies: A Framework for Analysis},
Journal = {REGIONAL AND FEDERAL STUDIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {21},
Number = {4-5, SI},
Pages = {427-446},
Abstract = {While existing research on the `nationalities question' has focused
   predominantly on the institutionalization of the territorial cleavage or
   the structural factors that drive the process of constitutional change,
   scant attention has been paid to evaluating the influence of regional
   nationalist parties that voice demands for recognition and self-rule.
   This article develops a two-stage framework for analysis that focuses on
   the different avenues through which regional nationalist parties set the
   agenda and on the process of political bargaining between partisan
   actors that produce constitutional change. The framework emphasizes the
   significance of the electoral conjuncture, a political system's
   institutional arrangements and the ideology of partisan actors in
   determining the power relationship between regional nationalist and
   mainstream parties in different arenas, as well as in conditioning the
   likelihood of constitutional change. While anecdotal evidence from West
   European states is produced to illustrate the argument, the framework
   can be exported fruitfully elsewhere.},

Abstract = {By the Treaty of Trianon, Hungary in 1920 lost two-thirds of its
   territory and 3.2 million ethnic Hungarians to neighbouring states. In
   the interwar period, this was a trauma for Hungarians and produced a
   resonating case for revisionism and irredentism. Under socialism, the
   subject was taboo. Since the collapse of communism, the issue of
   Hungarians living abroad has grown in importance. Today, extreme
   right-wing circles in Hungary have made a cult of Trianon. It is
   supposed to serve nationalist mobilization. But greater-Hungarian
   nationalism and calls for a revision of Trianon do not have
   majority-appeal. Serious historical enlightenment is required.},

Journal = {POLITICAL RESEARCH QUARTERLY},

Volume = {64},
Number = {4},
Pages = {723-735},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This article examines two seemingly opposed modes of place-making, urban
   sprawl and historic preservation, and their relationship to memory. The
   author contends that urban sprawl creates a landscape of either willful
   or accidental amnesia, where the powers of place are neutralized by
   ignoring them or removing them from history. Historic preservation,
   however, can have equally depoliticizing effects by conjuring up
   peculiar, selective, or even wholly imaginary pasts. Despite their
   apparent opposition, both practices often work against a meaningful
   understanding of the relationship between identity, memory, and place.
   Rather than accept the false choice between amnesia and nostalgia, the
   author advocates for an ethos of what Walter Benjamin calls

Abstract = {The news product we view each day is formed through negotiations and
   relationships between members of the press and elected and governmental
   officials. This negotiation of newsworthiness is inherently a bargaining
   process. Yet since the process is often hidden and sometimes implicit,
   it is near impossible for researchers to precisely observe and
   empirically model how the political news product is created. In this
   article, I propose a series of bargaining models to gain understanding
   of the negotiation of newsworthiness between the news media and the
   government. I establish that even though the government and politicians
   often have advantages in creating the news, informational control can be
   mitigated by increasing news outlets' resources within a dense political
   news environment. The results provide a formal rationale for when we
   should and should not expect accountability reporting.},

Abstract = {Although many scholars agree that social interactions within traditional
   social groups build social capital, there is less consensus on the
   benefits of virtual interactions for political engagement. Our research
   examines how interpersonal social group activity and virtual activity
   contribute to two dimensions of social capital: citizen norms and
   political involvement. We rely on data collected in the 2005 Citizenship
   Involvement in Democracy survey conducted by the Center for Democracy
   and Civil Society at Georgetown University. This survey provides unique
   detail on participation in both social groups and virtual interactions.
   Our findings suggest that social group activity and virtual interactions
   both foster many of the same positive aspects of social capital.},

Abstract = {As the resolution of urban problems is scaled up to the regional level,
   understanding the different approaches to regional governance is
   becoming increasingly important. We define regional governance as
   constituted by: a vertical relationship between state government and its
   constituent local governments; and a set of horizontal relationships
   between local governments, with their respective civic sectors and with
   their regional institutions. Four highly fragmented regions (Boston,
   Minneapolis, Pittsburgh, and St. Louis) were found to have three
   different structures of regional governance. We have classified those
   structures as fully integrated, state centric, and mixed model. As
   taxonomists, it is our intention to advance the analytics of the field
   in away that allows for more rigorous research at the macro level to
   complement the research at the micro level.},

Abstract = {Feudal law in Hungary emerged from compromises that bridged the
   country's political and confessional divisions. With the transition to a

   the 19th century. The preamble of Hungary's new constitution combines
   suppression of the communist dictatorship with an authoritarian
   definition of a national conservative view of history that invokes the
   unity of the Hungarian nation at home and abroad.},

Pages = {1500-1526},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This study measures support for the basic rights, liberties, and
   practices associated with polyarchy in 12 Latin American democracies.
   Specifically, it identifies five profiles of support for polyarchy's
   core values and norms-public contestation, inclusive participation,
   limits on executive authority, and institutional checks and balances.
   Although citizens who fit the polyarch profile accept all of polyarchy's
   principles, those who fit one of the four mixed support profiles (power
   constrainer, power checker, power delegator, power restrainer) accept
   only some of them while rejecting other core democratic principles.
   Long-run factors emphasized by modernization and cultural theories
   (e.g., education, wealth, political engagement) are closely associated
   with the polyarch support profile. However, short-range performance
   factors (e.g., economic perceptions; crime, discrimination, and
   corruption victimization; voting for losing presidential candidates;
   presidential approval) may better explain why citizens fit one
   particular mixed profile over another and particularly explain
   willingness to delegate authority to the executive at the expense of
   other institutions.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to give an account of a methodological link
   between drama and political theory. This account is drawn primarily from
   the early philosophical work of Deleuze. Following Deleuze, we will
   refer to it as `the method of dramatization'. We will argue that
   dramatization is a method aimed at determining the quality of political
   concepts by `bringing them to life', in the way that dramatic
   performances bring to life the characters and themes of a play-script.
   We demonstrate that this can be specified in relation to the development
   of this method in Deleuze's early philosophical work as a practical,
   critical and artistic method and, in relation to the ontological
   assumptions he articulated and defended in Difference and Repetition, as
   a process of intensification of the Idea of the political. By way of
   example, we discuss how the dramatization of the concept of ideology
   functions in Deleuze and Guattari's Anti-Oedipus and A Thousand
   Plateaus. We conclude with some lines of inquiry that could be pursued
   by political theorists looking to investigate further the dramatic
   nature of method in political theory. Contemporary Political Theory (201

Abstract = {Persuaded by the critique of cultural essentialism, many critics believe
   that there is no defensible way of identifying distinct cultures, or of
   distinguishing cultural loss from cultural change, that is compatible
   with the normative agenda of multiculturalism. This article challenges
   this widely shared belief by developing a concept of culture that can
   withstand the critique of essentialism and support the positive claims
   of multiculturalists. Culture, in the view developed here, is what
   people share when they have shared subjection to a common formative
   context. A division of the world, or of particular societies, into
   distinct cultures is a recognition that distinct processes of
   socialization operate on different groups of people. Because culture in
   this view is the precipitate of a common social lineage, the view is
   called the ``social lineage account{''} of culture.},

Abstract = {Media freedom strongly inhibits corruption and promotes good governance,
   but what leads to media freedom? Do economic development and higher
   advertising revenues tend to make media outlets independent of political
   groups' influence? Using data on nineteenth-century American newspapers,
   I show that places with higher advertising revenues were likelier to
   have newspapers that were independent of political parties. Similar
   results hold when local advertising rates are instrumented by
   regulations on outdoor advertising and newspaper distribution. In
   addition, newly created newspapers were more likely to enter the market
   as independents in places with higher advertising rates. I also exploit
   the precise timing of major changes in advertising rates to identify how
   advertising revenues affected the entry of new newspapers. Finally, I
   demonstrate that economic development, and concomitant higher
   advertising revenue, is not the only reason that an independent press
   expands; political factors also played a role.},

Abstract = {How can people who lack access to effective government institutions
   establish property rights and facilitate exchange? The illegal narcotics
   trade in Los Angeles has flourished despite its inability to rely on
   state-based formal institutions of governance. An alternative system of
   governance has emerged from an unexpected source-behind bars. The
   Mexican Mafia prison gang can extort drug dealers on the street because
   they wield substantial control over inmates in the county jail system
   and because drug dealers anticipate future incarceration. The gang's
   ability to extract resources creates incentives for them to provide
   governance institutions that mitigate market failures among Hispanic
   drug-dealing street gangs, including enforcing deals, protecting
   property rights, and adjudicating disputes. Evidence collected from
   federal indictments and other legal documents related to the Mexican
   Mafia prison gang and numerous street gangs supports this claim.},

Abstract = {If no-confidence motions are primarily motivated by bringing down
   governments, why do only approximately 5\% of no-confidence motions in
   advanced parliamentary democracies from 1960 result in the termination
   of government? In this project the author addresses this puzzle by
   developing a formal model of the electoral benefits of no-confidence
   motions and tests these hypotheses with the use of an original data set.
   No-confidence motions represent highly visible opportunities for
   opposition parties to highlight their strength or ability compared to
   the government in the hopes of improving their vote shares. The author
   finds support for the signal-based theory on a sample of 20 advanced
   parliamentary democracies from 1960 to 2008. Although no-confidence
   motions result in decreases for the government parties, the opposition
   parties that propose the motion experience boosts in vote share. This
   relationship is even stronger when the proposing party is an alternative
   governing possibility-illustrated by the conditioning impacts of the
   number of parliamentary parties and the opposition party's ideological
   extremism. This provides an explanation as to why opposition parties
   would continue to challenge the government even though the motions are
   likely to fail.},

Abstract = {This article disaggregates coalitions of third-party mediators and
   examines their effectiveness in interventions. First, it is argued that
   there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between the size of a
   mediating coalition and mediation effectiveness. Secondly, mediators
   sharing a history of conflict and distrust will transfer their past
   relationships to a mediation attempt, making it less effective.
   Consequently, states sharing friendly and co-operative ties with each
   other are more successful in managing conflicts. Finally, a coalition of
   mediators that is largely democratic should be more effective due to a
   shared culture of peaceful conflict resolution, inclusivity and
   increased communication flows. The empirical analysis using data from
   the Issues Correlates of War Project for 1965-2000 largely provides
   support for the theory.},

Abstract = {Scholars often recommend the implementation of participatory governance
   institutions to promote pro-poor policy outcomes. Incorporating civil
   society organizations into decision making should lead to increasing
   government responsiveness and accountability in addressing key social
   problems. Few scholars, however, have systematically tested this
   proposition across contexts. An assessment of the impact of municipal
   housing councils on the adoption of social housing programs in Brazil
   indicates that housing councils are associated with an increase in
   social housing program adoption across municipalities, regardless of
   whether a strong civil society is in place. This suggests that the act
   of incorporation into decision making is more important than the
   strength of civil society for producing pro-poor policy outcomes.},

Abstract = {Publication in scholarly journals is a key to scholarly success.
   However, previous studies have shown that across many disciplines,
   including political science, women publish significantly less than men
   and prefer to use qualitative methodology. In this article, we explore
   the accuracy of these trends by examining a decade's worth (2000-09) of
   women's publications in four top political science journals (the
   American Political Science Review, the American Journal of Political
   Science, the Journal of Politics, and PS: Political Science and
   Politics). Using a systematic content analysis, we determine the gender
   ratio of the authors, funding sources, methods, and the ratio of
   qualitative and quantitative studies. We find that while women publish
   less than men in each of these venues, their publication rates resemble
   their representation in the field.},

Abstract = {Russia's political leadership tries to control its political rivals,
   civil society organisations, the mass media, and the justice system. It
   suppresses social and structural differentiation and thus blocks
   modernisation. Nationalism finds encouragement. Anti-liberal attitudes
   remain widespread. In society, conservatism and political apathy are
   rampant. Political spin has assumed the function of ideology. It helps
   the ruling elite secure its hold on power. And it makes the population
   distrustful and reduces demands on cultural and intellectual
   cohabitation. Russia faces the risk of gradually entering a permanent
   crisis in which social tensions alternately increase and decrease. The
   Kremlin is being forced to follow a course between tightening and
   loosening state controls over society and the economy. But the
   foundation of the regime remains untouched: the concentration of all
   instruments of control in the hands of a small, dubious group.},

Abstract = {How effectively do democratic institutions provide public goods? Despite
   the incentives an elected leader has to free ride or impose majority
   tyranny, our experiment demonstrates that electoral delegation results
   in full provision of the public good. Analysis of the experimental data
   suggests that the result is primarily due to electoral selection: groups
   elect prosocial leaders and replace those who do not implement full
   contribution outcomes. However, we also observe outcomes in which a
   minimum winning coalition exploits the contributions of the remaining
   players. A second experiment demonstrates that when electoral delegation
   must be endogenously implemented, individuals voluntarily cede authority
   to an elected agent only when preplay communication is permitted. Our
   combined results demonstrate that democratic delegation helps groups
   overcome the free-rider problem and generally leads to outcomes that are
   often both efficient and equitable.},

Abstract = {This paper applies the theory of memetic engineering to a cyberterrorist
   group: Anonymous. Anonymous was created on the Internet and is a
   decentralized community that has no leaders. Memetic engineering, a
   theoretical concept developed by Richard Dawkins (1976), posits that
   memes (units of cultural transmission) are diffused through cultural
   channels (e.g., traditional media, social networking sites, etc.) to
   infect minds that, in turn, will replicate those memes themselves.
   Memetic engineering is about memetic replication. Memes can be anything
   from smiley faces to evil ideas. Members of Anonymous operate in
   (online) disguise and have been known to transmit terrorist memes
   through online channels such as imageboards, chatrooms, and even YouTube
   videos.},

Abstract = {The changes in Turkey's political landscape over the past decade have
   been quite dramatic. In this study, we present a quantitative analysis
   of the 2011 national elections based on clustering techniques and we
   compare our results with those of the previous elections in 1999, 2002,
   and 2009. Our results suggest, once again, that Turkish citizens turn
   out to vote consistently since the 1950s. We also investigate
   significant changes in voting trends of different regions and provinces.
   We conclude with a future-based qualitative outlook to indicate what the
   results could be if certain electoral changes are made, such as the law
   for political parties, a different national threshold for parties to be
   represented and elected to Parliament, and an eventual new constitution.},

   that this association arises because education causes participation, it
   could also arise because education proxies for the factors that lead to
   political engagement: the kinds of people who participate in politics
   may be the kinds of people who tend to stay in school. To test for a
   causal effect of education, we exploit the rise in education levels
   among males induced by the Vietnam draft. We find little reliable
   evidence that education induced by the draft significantly increases
   participation rates.},

Abstract = {Do state curricular standards and examinations constrain the behavior of
   public school teachers? More specifically, do they interfere with
   teachers'responsiveness to local district preferences? We explore these
   questions in the highly contested arena of instruction in evolutionary
   biology. Drawing upon an original national survey of high school biology
   teachers, we find that their classroom practices conform to community
   preferences. This responsiveness occurs largely through a process of
   assortative employment. However, we show that teachers are less
   responsive to public opinion when state curricular standards are
   supported by high-stakes testing. We therefore offer a general model of
   how policy implementation can be influenced by local community sentiment
   and, more generally, how the architecture of public policy can attenuate
   responsiveness to local public opinion.},

Abstract = {The Republic of Turkey is now only 12 years away from celebrating its
   100th anniversary. On the journey that started with 50,000 dollars worth
   of exports in 1923, we are aiming to attain a value of 500 billion
   dollars by 2023, when Turkey is expected to become one of the 10 largest
   economies in the world with 25,000 dollars of income per capita. Turkey
   is positioned well against the possible volatilities in other regions.
   It has the potential to turn threats into opportunities through the
   private sector's increased adoptive capabilities and the effective use
   of trade policy tools. Furthermore, structural reforms are planned and
   carried out boldly and decisively through programs and projects, such as
   GITES. With its government and private sector working hand in hand, we
   strongly believe that Turkey in 2023 will be a locus of attraction for
   trade and investment in the world.},

   some principles of classic Leninism through a critic re-reading of the
   communist experiences of the XX century and the consequent consciousness
   of the communist no-self-sufficiency. After this, the leaders of the
   party could throw out the new strategy of an horizontal link to social
   movements. The relationship between Prc and social movements seem to go
   on without particular problems until the participation of Prc to the
   center-left govern in a moderate coalition. This paper intend to analyse
   the dynamics of this relationship by using, on one hand, the data from a
   survey carried out during the last four European Social Forum regarding
   the attitude of Italian movement activists on their relationship with
   traditional political institutions; on the other hand, we will analyse
   the interior debate of the Refoundation Communist Party by using
   documents published in occasion of the 7th National Congress with
   particular regard to the articles published on the party's newspaper
   ``Liberazione{''} for the tribune of the Congress. All the documents
   will be analysed with a specific computer program for content analysis.},

   case for how small states can buffer from within but fails to grasp
   their need for external shelter to cope with risk. In a financialised
   world economy, small states need economic and political shelter in order
   to prevent risk from spiralling out of control and they need support in

Abstract = {This paper discusses the CHP within the paradigm of party
   individualization and the ``political firm.{''} In what ways has the CHP
   made a break from its past? In what ways has it maintained historical
   continuity? Just how new is the ``New CHP?{''} In this paper, the
   subject will be studied in terms of two dimensions: election campaigns
   and the discourse of the CHP on the one hand, and the organization and
   leadership on the other. This paper starts from the hypothesis that the
   CHP has transformed into a catch-all cartel party. To test this
   hypothesis the article first provides a short overview of what the CHP
   has been up to for the past year and a half. The developments which the
   party had lived through brought to the fore the claims of a ``New
   CHP{''} and its ``changing ideological axis.{''} Moreover, the article
   discusses the CHP's dilemmas as a cartel party which attempts to appeal
   to every voter segment and its ideological status.},

Journal = {CONTEMPORARY POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {10},
Number = {3},
Pages = {313-331},

Abstract = {This article argues that for purposes of hermeneutics, in relation to
   texts in the history of political thought, it is fruitful to make a
   conceptual distinction between the idea of a `reading', an
   `interpretation' and an `appropriation' of a text. The article relates
   these ideas to two basic approaches to hermeneutic understanding, that
   of Quentin Skinner, on the one hand, and that associated with the
   philosophy of poststructuralism on the other. It is argued that once the
   above conceptual distinctions have been made it can be demonstrated that
   these two approaches to hermeneutic understanding are not necessarily
   incompatible with one another. It is also argued that Skinner came to
   appreciate that this is the case in the later 1980s, and that this
   constituted a significant revision of the methodological position views
   which Skinner had advocated before that time, from the late 1960s
   onwards. Contemporary Political Theory (2011) 10, 313-331.

Journal = {JAPANESE JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {12},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {This paper will examine the various ways in which the regional imaginary
   has been conceptualized and developed in maritime Southeast Asia,
   primarily focussing on Indonesia. Utilizing the recent debate on the
   notion of a `Postcolonial International Relations,' this paper examines
   the role of imperialism and the colonial experience on the development
   of Indonesian `ideas' of region and regionalism. This paper is
   structured into four sections. First of all, it explores the link
   between postcolonial theory and regionalism studies. Second, it takes
   into account early ideas of regionalism in the post-independence era.
   This includes President Sukarno's `neutralist' foreign policy
   culminating in Indonesia's hosting of the Bandung Conference as well as
   President Suharto's endorsement of ASEAN. The third and final section
   examines Indonesia's foreign policy orientation and practices in the
   post-authoritarian period, particularly under President Susilo Bambang
   Yudhoyono. With its embrace of democracy in the post-New Order era, the
   concluding discussion suggests that Indonesia appears to be increasingly
   prepared to expand its regional engagement concentrically beyond the
   immediate Southeast Asian region. The question of the `imperial' role of
   the US - which has its own foreign policy ambitions in the region - is
   instrumental in this regard, and can be usefully understood from a
   postcolonial framework.},

Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},

Number = {3},

Abstract = {This response to Andrew Rehfeld's ``Representation Rethought{''}
   (American Political Science Review 2009) takes up his criticisms of my
   ``Rethinking Representation{''} (American Political Science Review 2003)
   to advance a more relational and systematic approach to representation.
   To this end, it suggests replacing the ``trustee{''} concept of
   representation with a ``selection model{''} based on the selection and
   replacement of ``gyroscopic{''} representatives who are both relatively
   self-reliant in judgment and relatively nonresponsive to sanctions. It
   explores as well the interaction between representatives' (and
   constituents') perceptions of reality and their normative views of what
   the representative ought to represent. Building from the concept of
   surrogate representation and other features of legislative
   representation, it argues for investigating, both normatively and
   empirically, not only the characteristics of individual representatives
   emphasized by Rehfeld's analysis but also the representative constituent
   relationship and the larger representative system, including both
   elected and nonelected representatives, inside and outside the
   legislature.},

Abstract = {The paper takes the Foucauldian conception of liberalism to think the
   education in the beginning of the XIX century in La Nueva Granada. It
   shows the connection that exists between the liberal government and the
   Lancastrian educational method, as a particularly visible moment of the
   immanence among the actual form of the power and the school as a form of
   education. The paper develops the following idea: should the epidemical
   expansion of the Lancastrian method be assumed from local
   interpretations? Or, on the contrary, should it be read from the
   concomitant expansion of the liberal forms of power? The intention is to
   show that while the educational practice helped to distinguish a
   disciplinary Western society; it is also possible, from the point of
   view of the constant libertys production that the liberal power requires
   in order to rule the population, to retake the actual form of power to
   explain educational and academic processes.},

Abstract = {Elections are inherently about selecting good candidates for public
   office and sanctioning incumbents for past performance. Yet, in the low
   salience context of `second-order elections' to the European Parliament,
   empirical evidence suggests that voters sanction first-order national
   incumbents. However, no previous study has examined whether voters also
   use these elections to select good candidates. This article draws on a
   unique dataset on the political experience of party representatives in
   eighty-five national elections to the European Parliament to evaluate
   the extent to which voters prefer candidates with more political
   experience. The results show that selection considerations do matter.
   Parties that choose experienced top candidates are rewarded by voters.
   This effect is greatest when European elections are held in the middle
   of the national electoral cycle.},

Abstract = {Theories of inter-group threat hold that local concentrations of
   immigrants produce resource competition and anti-immigrant attitudes.
   Variants of these theories are commonly applied to Britain and the
   United States. Yet the empirical tests have been inconsistent. This
   paper analyses geo-coded surveys from both countries to identify when
   residents' attitudes are influenced by living near immigrant
   communities. Pew surveys from the United States and the 2005 British
   Election Study illustrate how local contextual effects hinge on national
   politics. Contextual effects appear primarily when immigration is a
   nationally salient issue, which explains why past research has not
   always found a threat. Seemingly local disputes have national catalysts.
   The paper also demonstrates how panel data can reduce selection biases
   that plague research on local contextual effects.},

Abstract = {Francoise Hurstel, Abortion among teenagers, a failure of contraception?
   The major approach to this research about the demand for abortion among
   the women under 18, is the hypothesis of a sexual information and
   prevention, that-as they are designed at present-are based upon
   ``misunderstandings{''}: something is not heard and then not taken into
   account in what is at stake for a teenager in her relationship to sex
   and motherhood. These ``misunderstandings{''} express themselves with
   ambivalences towards contraception and abortion and can be identified at
   three different levels: the young ladies, the people who take care of
   them and the politicians. Can we (and how can we) overcome these
   ambivalences?},

Volume = {73},

Pages = {633-645},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The consensus among scholars has long held that educational advancement
   causes greater political participation. Recent research, however, argues
   that previous empirical analyses of this relationship cannot be used to
   draw causal inferences. This recent work strongly suggests that
   selection mechanisms confound previous results, and it employs
   propensity score matching to argue that education has no effect. In this
   article I show how propensity score matching, as recently applied to
   this question, introduces bias by creating poorly matched treatment and
   control groups. I analyze the same data, realigning the treatment with
   theories of political participation, and I use genetic matching to
   create balanced treatment and control groups. I then subject the results
   to a variety of tests, providing a stronger foundation for causal
   inference. The estimates provide consistent evidence that, contrary to
   recent results, educational advancement increases political
   participation.},

Volume = {3},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This article examines the origins of Southeast Asia as a region,
   including the extent to which regularized interstate relations existed
   throughout the region prior to World War II. In addition, the article
   examines the origins of Southeast Asia's recognition as a region
   together with notions of cultural homogeneity and identity. At one
   level, these interdependent variables are relevant to the analysis
   because much of the scholarly literature has utilized some combination
   of the three-together with notions of geographical propinquity,
   interdependence, and a capacity to refract the power of the
   international system-as a basis to substantiate the claim that a region
   exists, whether that be Southeast Asia or elsewhere. However, notions of
   culture and identity are also important because they represent a natural
   outcome of long-term interaction and interdependence. Consequently, the
   article finds that the origin of Southeast Asia, as a distinct region,
   most significantly stemmed from the strategic dynamics of the Second
   World War. Moreover, the contemporary nature of Southeast Asia's
   construction as a region has been a consequence of the region's
   cultural, ethnic, and religious diversity; an associated absence of a
   regional identity; and a lack of regionwide and regularized interstate
   relations until independence from colonialism.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates how constituency size affects spatial
   competition in a two-party system with a new entrant. When the
   electorate is small, two-party systems are stable only if the following
   conditions hold: the candidates are neither too certain nor too
   uncertain about voters' preferences; competition is sufficiently costly;
   and the candidates have binding policy commitments. Moreover, whenever
   equilibrium exists in small constituencies, the two parties are
   considerably polarized. In contrast, when the electorate is large,
   two-party equilibrium obtains under a much wider set of conditions and
   exhibits low polarization. The Downsian prediction of two-party
   convergence and the Duvergerian prediction of plurality rule leading to
   a two-party system are more robust in larger electorates.},

Abstract = {Each election year, colleges and universities across the nation witness
   a plethora of on-campus voter registration activities. The results of
   these drives are most often assessed by tallying the number of voter
   registration cards collected. Little has been done, however, to more
   carefully investigate these results. As a first attempt to examine
   postdrive results more thoroughly, we ask two questions. First, do
   students who register through an on-campus voter registration drive
   actually make it to the voting booth? Second, does providing basic
   information about the voting process increase turnout among students who
   register through an on-campus voter registration drive? In this study,
   we investigate the overall turnout rate of students registering to vote
   in the 2008 presidential election through on-campus registration drives
   by validating votes through the office of the county voting registrar.
   We then compare the turnout rate of students who registered through the
   on-campus drives with the turnout rate of similar young people
   nationwide. Finally, we investigate whether the provision of information
   through certain avenues boosts turnout. Our findings show that students
   who registered through an on-campus voter registration drive turned out
   to vote at a higher rate than similar young people nationwide.
   Additionally, we found small but important effects of information
   provision through different formats.},

Abstract = {How can we understand the confrontation with fear in works of political
   philosophy? Plato wrote ironically, but also took profound risks in his
   writing, labeling contemporaneous statesmen as squabbling fools. Hobbes
   deftly skirted the line past which one was declared an atheist or a
   heretic. Both thinkers knew fear and, at least at certain times,
   confronted it openly. Leo Strauss, however, gives us a different story,
   arguing that the political philosopher will encrypt his or her true
   thinking under an exoteric facade. What is the consequence of Strauss'
   confrontation with fear? In this essay I argue that Strauss reveals the
   existence of secrets without revealing the content of those secrets. He
   creates rules of secrecy for philosophic writing, and then, by revealing
   them, Strauss bothers those rules. This is, for Lacan, the essence of
   perversion. Acta Politica (2011) 46, 239-260. doi: 10.1057/ap.2010.25},

Abstract = {Spatial diagrams of politics could and should be iconic for political
   science in much the same way as supply-and-demand curves are in
   economics. Many fundamental problems of political science can be
   connected with them, and many different concepts-such as ideological
   constraint, cross-pressures, framing, agenda-setting, political
   competition, voting systems, and party systems, to name just a few-can
   be illuminated through spatial diagrams. Spatial diagrams raise
   questions and provide insights. They suggest political maneuvers,
   possible realignments, and political problems. They provide us with
   revealing images that aid memory and facilitate analysis. They are a
   powerful way to think about politics, and we could not do better than to
   feature them in our textbooks, to use them in our research, and to
   exhibit them as our brand-as our distinctive way of thinking about how
   the world works},

Abstract = {Since 2002, the Turkish electoral environment and the party system have
   been undergoing a significant transformation. The Justice and
   Development Party (Adalet ve Kalkinma Partisi, AKP) has continued to
   increase its electoral support for a third time in a row. The declining
   volatility and fractionalization in the election results together with
   the expanding geographical base of AKP electoral support may be taken as
   signs of the emergence of a dominant party system in Turkey. This
   article offers a descriptive account of the election results and links
   those results to the literature on the dominant party system. A
   discussion on the implications of this new development for the evolution
   of Turkish party system, Turkish political landscape and future
   elections concludes the article.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the influence of alternative voting technologies on
   electoral outcomes in multi-party systems. Using data from a field
   experiment conducted during the 2005 legislative election in Argentina,
   we examine the role of information effects associated with alternative
   voting devices on the support for the competing parties. We find that
   differences in the type of information displayed and how it was
   presented across devices favored some parties to the detriment of
   others. The impact of voting technologies was found to be larger than in
   two-party systems, and could lead to changes in election results. We
   conclude that authorities in countries moving to adopt new voting
   systems should carefully take the potential partisan advantages induced
   by different technologies into account when evaluating their
   implementation.},

Abstract = {This paper addresses the role of ticket-splitting in decreasing the
   accuracy of recalled previous voting. It suggests that ticket-splitting
   makes recalling vote choice a more difficult task and thus increases
   recall error. Using data from three German panel surveys conducted from
   1998 to 2008, the paper demonstrates that ticket-splitting increases
   recall error by a considerable margin, even after controlling for
   behavioral and attitudinal predictors. This finding suggests that recall
   accuracy is not a stable voter characteristic. It also lends credence to
   the notion that the increase in ticket-splitting in recent German
   elections decreased the accuracy of recalled previous voting. Finally,
   the evidence suggests that electoral systems affect the validity of
   survey answers concerning previous vote choice. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {This article systematically compares the efficiency of federal, state,
   and local civil rights agencies in enforcing national fair housing
   policy over time, with special attention to the South. State and local
   agencies processed Fair Housing Act complaints more efficiently than the
   U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), southern
   agencies outperformed HUD, and the probability that a racial
   discrimination complaint resulted in a favorable outcome for the alleged
   victim was the same for complaints originating within and outside the
   South. These findings suggest that the fair housing enforcement model
   may provide useful concepts for sharing power in other policy areas in
   the American federal system.},

Journal = {FRENCH POLITICS},

Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {21-49},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This article examines citizenship theory in the light of three cases of
   political action of women of migrant (Maghrebi) origins. We argue that
   Engin Isin's concept of `acts of citizenship' (2008) allows a new
   perspective on the ways in which these women asserted themselves as
   citizens, that moves beyond the `new citizenship' repertoire provided by
   the mouvement beur of the 1980s. We argue that some dimensions of these
   activities can be conceived of as `acts of citizenship': deeds that
   rupture social-historical patterns as well as everyday routines.
   Notably, these women seek a path independent of traditional political
   movements; while rooted in their localities, at the same time they take
   into account their transnational consciousness, negotiate patriarchal
   practices and renegotiate the exclusions of French republican
   citizenship. However, the challenges of the interplay between `acts'
   that challenge existing patterns and activity which reproduces existing
   relations of domination need to be more fully considered. We explore the
   limits to the notion of rupture and the ways in which `acts' are
   co-opted and (unintentionally) reproduce existing relations of
   domination. By exploring the problematic of rupture/reproduction, we
   build on the concept of `acts of citizenship' to provide a way in which
   the vibrant politics in-between rupture and reproduction can be grasped
   and new forms of citizenship made visible.},

Abstract = {This article argues that to call Hume a conservative is a shorthand
   label that is at least insecure and at most a distortion. It is not
   claimed that the label is fanciful or without justification but the
   argument does serve to raise questions as to its accuracy once it is
   subject to further inspection and, consequently, to doubt its aptness or
   utility in capturing what is a key characteristic of Hume's
   sociopolitical thought. This argument is constituted as follows. After
   some preliminary refinement of the topic, part I, in order to establish
   that the paper is not attacking a `straw-man', identifies, by using
   Oakeshott as a benchmark, those aspects of Hume's thought that most
   securely underwrite attributing the conservative label. Part II
   constructs an argument to render the conservative label insecure, by
   drawing attention to the case for Hume as a liberal. Part III outlines
   the grounds for the further claim that when Hume's commitment to
   `science' and his polemics against superstition, and other `chimerical'
   practices and principles, are taken on board then the stronger case that
   the label is a distortion can be judged to have substance.},

Abstract = {Departmental select committees are now the principal mechanism through
   which the House of Commons holds the executive to account. Ten years ago
   the Hansard Societys Commission on Parliamentary Scrutiny (the Newton
   Commission) recommended a series of reforms to select committees
   including the introduction of core tasks. A decade on, however, many new
   demands have since been placed on committees, public expectation of them
   has been heightened, and yet resources are finite and will come under
   increasing pressure in the future as a result of budget cuts. As
   recommended at the end of the last Parliament by the Commons Liaison
   Committee, the time has therefore come to review the core tasks and the
   role and operation of select committees. This article outlines issues
   that such a review should explore in order to ensure further development
   of systematic departmental scrutiny and to make the most effective use
   of committee time and resources. It argues that select committees
   themselves need to be more accountable to MPs and the public and to be
   more self-critical about what they do and how they do it.},

Abstract = {This essay defends the Populists against charges that they espoused an
   irrationally conspiratorial view of American history. Focusing on
   monetary policy, and the free silver issue in particular, I argue that
   the Populists correctly suspected that bankers conspired to demonetize
   silver and demonstrate that William Ralston, president of The Bank of
   California, secretly bribed Treasury Department bureaucrats and used
   Western congressmen to pass the Coinage Act of 1873. Ralston's
   involvement in silver's demonetization has important ramifications for
   our understanding of the free silver movement. Some of the congressmen
   who helped Ralston demonetize silver paradoxically went on to lead the
   free silver movement, blaming Eastern financiers for the measure they
   helped pass, and created organizations such as the American Bimetallic
   League and the American Bimetallic Party, organizations that popularized
   the ideas subsequently adopted by the Populists and William Jennings
   Bryan. As some leaders of the free silver movement were deeply involved
   in silver's demonetization, this period exhibited levels of duplicity
   that have been unrecognized until now.},

Abstract = {The bilateral relationship between China and Myanmar is important and
   intricate despite being asymmetrical in China's favour. Whereas most
   observers regard the relationship as being heavily weighted in China's
   favour, Myanmar does have a fair amount of latitude within the
   relationship that is informed by historical, economic, and strategic
   considerations. The nationalism and xenophobia present in the attitudes
   of elite from the Myanmar military junta is both recognized and
   understood by China that is keen to have a stable peripheral
   environment. There are also important security issues such as the ethnic
   armies that currently have a ceasefire arrangement with the junta along
   the border areas that need to be resolved in a coordinated fashion to
   prevent negative spillage into China. In light of such special
   idiosyncratic and terrain considerations, Myanmar wields relative
   independence within this asymmetrical relationship.},

Title = {Where Do Distrusting Voters Turn if There is No Viable Exit or Voice
   Option? The Impact of Political Trust on Electoral Behaviour in the
   Belgian Regional Elections of June 2009},
Journal = {GOVERNMENT AND OPPOSITION},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {46},

Pages = {245-273},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {It has been suggested that political distrust is associated with lower
   levels of voter turnout and increased votes for challenger or populist
   parties. We investigate the relationship between political (dis)trust
   and electoral behaviour using the 2009 Belgian Election Study. Belgium
   presents an interesting case because compulsory voting (with an
   accompanying turnout rate of 90.4 per cent) compels distrusting voters
   to participate in elections. Nevertheless, distrusting voters are
   significantly more inclined to cast a blank or invalid vote. Second,
   distrust is positively associated with a preference for extreme right
   (Vlaams Belang) and populist (Lijst Dedecker) parties. Third, in party
   systems where there is no supply of viable challengers (i.e. the
   French-speaking region of Belgium), the effect of political trust on
   party preference is limited. We conclude that electoral effects of
   political distrust are determined by the electoral and party system and
   the supply of electoral protest.},

Abstract = {Recent years have seen a number of studies on the determinants of
   educational spending. Almost all of the existing work emphasizes the
   importance of left-wing governments as a motor of expansion because such
   expansion allegedly ensures both redistribution and the facilitation of
   a supply-side economy. The existing literature thereby corroborates the
   power resource theory. Against this common wisdom the article presents
   an argument building on the varieties of capitalism approach. It is
   argued that education is a poor instrument for redistribution because
   access is universal and high-income groups have a tendency to use
   education even more than low-income groups. Instead, we argue that
   deindustrialization is the main driver of educational spending because
   deindustrialization constitutes one of the most salient threats to
   workers in modern societies. As deindustrialization rises workers risk
   ending up with redundant skills, especially in countries where the
   average skills specificity is high, that is, coordinated market
   economies. The expectations find empirical support in a time-series
   cross-section regression analysis of 18 Western countries in the years
   1980-2000.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This article explores the conceptual commitments underlying Luxemburg's
   repudiation of the discourse of disappointment which had overtaken the
   European socialist movement during the FirstWorldWar. My analysis
   brushes against the grain of the traditional interpretation of
   Luxemburg's admonitions `to be cheerful despite everything and anything'
   as arising from her allegiance to a Marxist philosophy of history which
   decrees that socialism must inevitably prevail and so refuses to give
   way to disappointment or despair. The philosophy of history which
   Luxemburg absorbed from Marx, notably through the Eighteenth Brumaire,
   prophesies the ultimate victory of socialism but ordains that the actual
   events and experiences through which this victory is prepared will
   consist in catastrophes rather than conquests. In Luxemburg, I suggest,
   we can see more clearly how the experience of failure could make the
   realization of socialism more rather than less certain, and in terms
   that refer more directly to the inner situation of the socialist
   activist than the abstract assurances on which Marx relied: failure
   occasions the opportunity for deeper learning but, more importantly, it
   is in the experience of failure that the commitment on which the
   realization of socialism depends is tested and, in Luxemburg's hands at
   least, forged.},

Abstract = {We study vote buying by competing interest groups in a variety of
   electoral and contractual settings. While increasing the size of a
   voting body reduces its buyability in the absence of competition, we
   show that larger voting bodies may be more buyable than smaller voting
   bodies when interest groups compete. In contrast, imposing the secret
   ballot is an effective way to fight vote buying in the presence of
   competition, but much less so in its absence. Regardless of competition,
   the option to contract on both votes and outcomes is worthless, as it
   does not affect buyability compared to contracting only on votes. The
   option to contract on votes and vote shares, on the other hand, is
   extremely valuable: it allows the first mover to effectively nullify
   competition and obtain its preferred policy at almost the monopoly cost.},

Abstract = {Has European integration affected national electoral politics beyond the
   margins? Experts describe its main impact as empowerment of radical
   voices. Mainstream parties avoid European Union (EU) issues that divide
   their left- or right-based organizations; extreme parties attack the EU
   and the center's silence. But EU issues also generate important dynamics
   inside mainstream parties. The authors theorize cross-cutting EU issues
   as an example of a general model of cross-issue interference. Two
   mechanisms of interference alter party strategizing. When electoral
   victories have strengthened leaders, cross-cutting issues produce
   muffling of more recently emerged issues. Divided parties cling to
   left-right issues and suppress fights over integration. But interference
   also runs the other way. When leadership is weak, muffling fails and
   challengers aggravate dissent. Internal fights on newer (EU) issues
   affect the selection of leadership on older (left-right) issues,
   generating displacement from electorally competitive positions. The
   authors document these mechanisms and their generality with mixed
   methods: pan-European panel analysis and interview-based accounts.},

Abstract = {This study examines the role of the media in sustaining regime stability
   in an authoritarian context. The article engages the recent work on
   authoritarian resilience in comparative politics but goes beyond the
   standard focus on elections to other important institutions, such as the
   media and courts, that are used by authoritarian leaders to bolster
   legitimacy. The authors find that the Chinese media contribute to regime
   legitimacy and effective rule by propagandizing citizens' experiences in
   the legal system. However, unlike the ``mouthpieces{''} of earlier
   communist regimes, the marketized Chinese media provide more convincing
   and sophisticated messages that continue to accord with state censorship
   demands while satisfying readers' interest in real-life stories and
   problems. The ``positive propaganda{''} and the relative uniformity of
   information sources because of state censorship lead aggrieved citizens
   to the law as a realm for dispute resolution and rights protection.
   Statistical analysis of a randomly sampled survey conducted in four
   Chinese cities in 2005 demonstrates that exposure to media reporting
   about labor-law-related issues successfully promotes the image of a
   proworker bias in the law among citizens, thus encouraging them to
   participate in the legal system. The state is able to achieve its
   political goal because of the lack of conflicting sources of information
   and the lack of previous experience with the reformed legal system among
   citizens.},

Abstract = {In A Theory of Justice, John Rawls describes self-respect as ``perhaps
   the most important{''} social primary good, and self-respect figures
   prominently in 82, the critical section where he distills his
   justification for the most controversial aspect of his conception of
   justice, the lexical priority of liberty. As such, his account of
   self-respect has drawn considerable attention, especially from critics,
   who argue that self-respect is not a sufficiently compelling interest to
   justify the precedence of liberty. Yet, while much of the existing
   research has focused on the justificatory function of self-respect, it
   has mostly neglected the fact that Rawls invokes self-respect for
   another purpose in 82: his argument for stability, in which he claims
   that his conception of justice will instill in individuals a desire to
   act from a sense of justice. Thus, even if Rawls's account of
   self-respect is insufficient to justify his conception of justice, it
   nonetheless plays a crucial role in Theory insofar as it addresses the
   in oral psychology necessary for reinforcing the justice motive, a
   matter of central importance for maintaining stability in a liberal
   democratic society.},

Abstract = {Immigrant students in Denmark on average perform worse in lower
   secondary school than native Danish students. Part of the effect may not
   stem from the immigrant students themselves, but from the student
   composition at the school. From a policy perspective, the latter aspect
   is quite interesting since it is more feasible to change student
   composition in schools than the socioeconomic status of the individual
   students. This article describes theoretically the circumstances under
   which total student achievement can be increased by reallocating certain
   groups of students. Empirical analyses of Danish register data of more
   than 40,000 students suggest that the gain in total student achievement
   by reallocating immigrant students is minor. The educational outcome of
   immigrant students can however, ceteris paribus, be increased, at
   minimal expense to the majority of native Danish students' educational
   outcome, by limiting the share of immigrant students at grade level at
   any one school to less than 50 percent. The policy implications of this
   finding are discussed.},

Abstract = {Changes in district boundaries in small magnitude electoral systems can
   have substantive consequences for representation. In the U.S., each
   decennial redistricting cycle infuses House districts with a large
   number of new voters, changing personal representation for many
   citizens. What effect does the influx of these new voters exert on
   member behavior? By assessing the extent of this change in
   constituencies in conjunction with member voting behavior on roll calls,
   we can determine if significant changes to a congressional district
   impact post-redistricting legislative behavior. Using panel data
   estimators and various measures of legislator behavior, we show evidence
   that supports this claim. Our findings have notable implications for
   debates over representation and electoral accountability in legislative
   assemblies. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Artisanal and Small-Scale Mining (ASM) is a global economic phenomenon
   that is widespread especially in developing countries. It provides
   livelihoods for millions of people, yet is often primarily associated
   with environmental and social problems. A key obstacle to reforming this
   sector is the fact that most ASM takes place in the informal sector,
   outside legal regimes. This paper discusses creation and reform of legal
   regimes governing ASM from the perspective of property rights theory.
   The particularly relevant law and economics-justification of property
   rights is revisited in detail and the strengths and weaknesses of this
   theory are highlighted in the context of development. The application of
   other theoretical justifications of property law provides further
   valuable insights into how the formalization of the sector could be
   approached.},

Journal = {COMPARATIVE EUROPEAN POLITICS},

Volume = {9},

Abstract = {Following the seminal work of Pierson (1994), a general consensus has
   emerged that left-wing governments are no longer able to expand social
   protection. If anything, the strongest partisan effect seems to be
   right-wing governments curtailing social protection, while left-wing
   governments merely secure the status quo. The article presents a new
   argument on `negotiated expansion', suggesting that left-wing
   governments remain the motor behind the expansion of social spending,
   but that their success depends on labor market corporatism. Corporatism
   allows for negotiation with and the socialization of the employers who
   are enjoying an increasingly strong bargaining position vis-a-vis the
   left-wing due to increasing globalization. In countries with extensive
   corporatism, left-wing governments thus continue to increase social

Abstract = {It is believed in some quarters that the transatlantic relationship has
   never endured a more trying decade than the last, and yet the `Obama
   effect' seems to have resurrected it from beyond the `tipping point'.
   Can we conclude then that the crisis was not as damaging as feared? Or
   are we erroneously subscribing to inflated expectations of America's
   ability to change in the age of Obama? Without a reliable measure of
   what constitutes an exceedingly good or bad period in the relationship,
   any narrative that tells us we have ventured into the extreme seems
   inconclusive. America and Europe need each other, and contrary to
   far-reaching theories of demise or rebirth, this vital relationship will
   evolve not on the fringes but instead in moderation and into something
   more complete.},

Abstract = {Time choices are a neglected aspect of the bicameral bargaining
   literature, even though they may both affect the efficiency of
   decision-making and have broader democratic implications. An analytical
   framework is developed to explain when early conclusion occurs in the
   legislative process. Testing the main implications of this model on the
   co-decision procedure of the European Union, the results offer a more
   positive view of early agreements in this system than the existing
   literature. The findings show that these deals are unlikely to occur
   when the European Parliament is represented by agents with biased views
   of the overall legislature. The conventional wisdom that the character
   of the negotiated files plays a role in explaining whether legislative
   files are concluded early is also rejected. Instead, bargaining
   uncertainty and the impatience of the co-legislators matter.},

Abstract = {Has the Obama administration opened a new era in the Middle East? The
   article argues that intentions and reality are still divergent. This is
   explained by several factors. Specific political contingencies in the
   region, the way in which the region's issues are interrelated and the
   domestic structure of US foreign policymaking, have all contributed to
   generate a situation of deadlock. The Obama administration and the
   reformers in the region, needs the active pressure of other
   international actors, starting with the EU, especially now that the
   latter and the US Middle East policies are significantly converging. The
   Middle East might be the site for testing a new transatlantic
   relationship.},

Abstract = {The Arctic has become a political issue. The countries bordering on the
   Arctic Sea are striving to expand their rights of use in terms of space
   and content. Expanded continental shelves, complicated sea boundaries,
   shipping and research rights, and environmental obligations are
   determined, in the interest of the international community, according to
   the rules of the United Nations' Convention on the Law of the Sea of
   1982. The mechanism for a peaceful resolution exists. The countries that
   do not border on the Arctic - including the countries of the European
   Union as well as the International Seabed Authority must defend their
   rights and obligations in the Arctic Ocean vis-a-vis the regionalisation
   efforts of the countries that do border on the Arctic Sea.},

Abstract = {Russia's Arctic policy is often interpreted in geopolitical categories.
   But an energy-driven competition over resources is not taking place in
   the far north. The greater part of the oil and gas suspected in the
   Arctic is in territories that Russia indisputably has the sole right to
   develop. Therefore, what is being observed is more of a beauty contest
   in which international oil firms are competing to participate in the
   most attractive extraction projects. The Shtokman field could serve as a
   model. However, various developments on the international oil and gas
   markets are threatening this project.},

Year = {2011},
Volume = {9},

Abstract = {In the late 2000s, the European Union (EU) undertook a significant
   reform of the framework for insurance regulation and supervision through
   the Solvency II directive, which substantially updated prudential rules
   and supervisory practices. This article addresses the question of what
   has driven the reform of the framework for insurance regulation and
   supervision in the EU. It is argued that the politics of the Solvency II
   directive was characterised by a strong alliance between the Commission
   and the United Kingdom, backed up by the large member states, some old
   member states and industry, particularly large companies and
   transnational groups. The United Kingdom was, however, the pace setter,
   whose influence was underpinned by the size of its insurance market; the
   expertise and effective coordination of national policymakers, and a
   state-of-the-art domestic regulatory model. Comparative European

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CIVIL SOCIETY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {7},

Pages = {157-178},
Abstract = {Scholars argue that we cannot see civil society organizations (CSOs) as
   legitimate players in policy if we have no clear ways to define them and
   if we lack information explaining their functions. Thus, scholars and
   practitioners alike have encouraged the `mapping' of civil society.
   Mapping civil society consists of gathering and collating information on
   CSOs and often making it publicly available. There is little scholarship
   about such mapping efforts implemented by government. This article
   compares new mapping efforts in two countries-i.e., registries of CSOs
   created by governments in Ecuador and Colombia. The article examines the
   intentions of civil society mapping by government, identifying three key
   goals: to collect data, to regulate, and to foster collaboration. It
   discusses the differences across civil society mappings by government
   and in comparison with other mapping projects. The article argues that
   registries are increasingly positioned as a link between government and
   civil society not only to collect data for transparency but also to
   implement regulatory measures and to foster various degrees of
   collaboration. Thus, greater research attention to civil society
   mappings by government and their possible implications on civil society
   development and civil society/state relations is needed.},

Title = {The Different Trajectories of Italian Electoral Reforms},
Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {34},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {644-663},
Abstract = {Italy is the only established democracy where two major electoral
   reforms took place inthe last 20 years (respectively in 1993 and 2005).
   Adopting Renwick's approach, which distinguishes between elite majority
   imposed and elite-mass interaction reforms, the article analyses
   electoral reforms in Italy in the post-World War II period. By examining
   the long-term importance of electoral rules in Italian politics, it
   argues that PR played a uniquely fundamental role in shaping both the
   so-called Italian `First Republic' and the still unfulfilled transition
   towards a reformed political system. By focusing on the main
   determinants which brought about the two most recent reforms, it becomes
   apparent that, in the last two decades, the ever-changing party system
   format contributes to the cyclical salience of electoral reform as a
   possible means of accomplishing the never-ending transition towards a
   more stable political settlement.},

Abstract = {Within the last decade there has emerged a discourse around biopower
   that is characterized by two conceptual moves in particular: the
   mobilization of, and placing central importance on, the concept of
   ``affect''; and the jettison of the concept of mediation. These two
   moves are often represented as sharing a mutual cause-and-effect
   relationship in the historical narrative of late capitalism: affect
   emerges as a significant mechanism of social organization in late
   capitalism when and because the process of mediation has become a
   redundancy, and is no longer considered an adequate rendering of the
   modality of that social formation. I argue that the mutual
   cause-and-effect relationship between affect and mediation could
   alternatively be called a dialectical relationship. I demonstrate that
   affect and mediation are not oppositional concepts, but can be
   understood as two different but interrelated effects of a single
   historical process.},

Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {23},
Number = {4},
Pages = {421-448},
Abstract = {An individual's beliefs can be seen as rationally related to one another
   in a kind of web. These beliefs, however, may not form a single,
   seamless web. There may exist smaller, largely self-contained webs with
   few or no rational relations to the larger web. Such ``webs of faith{''}
   make it possible for reasonable deliberators to persist in a

Abstract = {This article considers two different, yet related, theoretical
   approaches that could be employed to ground the anarchist critique of
   MarxistLeninist revolutionary practice, and thus of the state in
   general: the State-Primacy Theory and the Quadruplex Theory. The State-
   Primacy Theory appears to be consistent with several of Bakunin's claims
   about the state. However, the Quadruplex Theory might, in fact, turn out
   to be no less consistent with Bakunin's claims than the State- Primacy
   Theory. In addition, the Quadruplex Theory seems no less capable of
   supporting the anarchist critique of Marxism-Leninism than the State-
   Primacy Theory. The article concludes by considering two possible
   refinements that might be made to the Quadruplex Theory.},

Abstract = {Established as `primitive populations' during the colonial period, legal
   citizenship was imposed upon French Guyana Amerindians during
   departementalisation; this citizenship was conceived within the French
   model of citizenship and the Nation and recognises the individual but
   ignores group membership. For some years, the growth of a national
   feeling in Guyana has been changing the relationship to France and the
   State, but local politicians implement the same representation of
   citizenship. How, in order to think about their place in the world, do
   Amerindians today try to link three citizenship-building processes they
   have been progressively taking for themselves: `legal' citizenship,
   `autochthonous' citizenship, and `cultural' citizenship?},

Abstract = {Local governments are claiming a more active role in the development of
   their territories, and also consequently within the international system

   being considered as political actors of development, and therefore its
   inclusion in the creation of development agendas, beyond the framework
   of the traditional interstate relations of international cooperation. In
   this context, the main objective of this paper is to discuss the
   challenges of coordination in the Spanish cooperation field between
   decentralized and central governments, from the perspective of the
   problems and possible solutions generated by actors from the Technical
   Cooperation Offices, with special attention to the case of Argentina and
   Uruguay as example of middle-income countries.},

Abstract = {Discussing the topics and assumptions in When China Rules the World,
   this paper argues for three points. Firstly, there are three modernity
   modes: the Western modernity represented by European countries and the
   US and depending on colonization, the autonomous modernity related with
   the former USSR and China, and the dependent modernity of East Asian
   tigers characterized by joining the Western industrial division and
   offering laboring force. Secondly, the hotly-debated Chinese model is
   actually the combination if not culmination of the East Asian modernity.
   It will not be sustainable due to a series of economic and political
   problems and needs to be transformed. Thirdly, the world is currently on
   the eve of fundamental change. The decline of the world hegemony may
   reshape the way of human development and modernization in last 100
   years. A state of `equilibrium' must be reached, by means of a global
   socialism having divorced Stalinism.},

   Representation on Public Tolerance of Minorities},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ELECTIONS PUBLIC OPINION AND PARTIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {21},
Number = {3},
Pages = {313-331},
Abstract = {The presence of radical right-wing populist (RRP) parties presents a
   challenge to liberal democracies, which are inclined to allow the
   representation of parties that reject their principles of diversity and
   inclusiveness. Addressing this concern, we use the World Values Survey
   and other data sources to demonstrate that the representation of RRP
   parties in parliament, in fact, has no discernible effect on individual
   levels of intolerance. The antioutgroup messages of RRP parties are
   mitigated by the tolerance-boosting effect of the information diversity
   present in the multiparty systems that allow for their representation.
   In addition, even those predisposed to be intolerant of outgroups are
   unaffected by the representation of such parties, as the attitudes of
   these individuals are least likely to be shaped by new information. Bans
   on political parties that espouse intolerance, often considered or
   implemented by modern democracies, are unlikely to achieve their desired
   effect.},

Abstract = {For more than 150 years, feminists have debated the comparative merits
   of capitalism and socialism for women's emancipation. This article
   explores the transition in Cuba as President Raul Castro experiments
   with market liberalization to shed light on that debate. Toward that
   end, it considers the many gender equity policies developed in Cuba
   since 1959 as well as the factors that contribute to women's unfinished
   ``revolution within the revolution.{''} The article then turns to
   assessing the gendered economic and political effects of market
   liberalization in Cuba, 1990-2004, and socialist Nicaragua, 1985-1990,
   and argues that further market liberalization in socialist Cuba will
   threaten gender equity by its effects on an array of social domains,
   including healthcare, education, transportation, consumption, and
   others.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to bring together the two realms of spy-story (fiction)
   and Security Studies (reality) along the time of the Cold War and after
   the implosion of the Soviet Union. It is conceived in terms of an
   intellectual exercise in which fictional narrative and academic research
   are put together in order to test their respective ``representations{''}
   of reality. It debates the problem that is still into the protocol of
   work of the intelligence community - an old paradigm of
   ``certification{''} and interpretation of reality is imposed, framing a
   dynamic and global world into the fragile limits of blind schemes, which
   unfortunately are reflected in the result of a bureaucratic mind.},

Year = {2011},
Volume = {64},
Number = {1},
Pages = {45-60},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In France, more than other mature democracies, the election rules
   undergo reform. Our concern is how these reforms influence mass
   electoral behaviour, namely voter turnout. We gather an extended
   national data set on the abstention rate, across the republics of
   France, and subject it to an interrupted time-series analysis. Two sets
   of hypotheses are explored: structural and tactical. The structural
   findings-on constitutional shifts, suffrage extension, ballot rounds,
   election type-are largely null. However, the tactical hypotheses are
   strongly supported. Ruling parties are shown to alter the election
   rules, in order to enhance their presidential power at the ballot box.
   In particular, the reforms surrounding the elections of 1962, 1981, 1988
   and 2002 each, systematically, increased abstention in legislative
   election contests. This reduced turnout can be seen as a reasonable
   response of voters to the `presidentialisation' of these National
   Assembly elections, rendering them second order. To the extent that
   future legislative elections are decoupled from presidential ones, the
   expectation would be a rise in their voter turnout.},

Abstract = {In the official statistics of the European Union, poverty still is being
   measured on the basis of the national relative poverty rates. However,
   it is highly questionable whether this definition is applicable to
   policy recommendations concerning the adjustment of living conditions in
   Europe. Based on the European Quality of Life Survey of 2003 and 2007,
   this article investigates the living conditions of the bottom-third of
   the income distribution. It can be shown that there is now considerably
   more social cohesion between the EU member states since the enlargement
   in 2004. However, polarization within the societies, particularly
   between the upper and the bottom echelons, also has increased.},

Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {34},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {48-70},
Abstract = {Who provides the European Union with information? This article examines
   patterns of participation in the large expert group system under the
   European Commission. It explores competing propositions about the
   character of the Commission's information system, and tests four
   hypotheses about what affects participation in the EU expert group
   system. The authors distinguish between three kinds of information
   providers: scientists, societal actors and government officials. The
   empirical section of the paper builds upon an analysis of a data set
   covering all of the Commission expert groups (N=1237). Although
   scientists, and interest groups, industries and NGOs are prevalent
   information providers for the Commission, the authors show that the
   informational foundation is strongly biased towards officials from
   national administrations. They argue that these distinct patterns of
   participation are significantly affected by inter-institutional and
   environmental conditions that the Commission Directorate Generals
   operate under. Access of experts increases the ability of the Commission
   to anticipate reactions to its proposals and initiatives and hence it
   impinges on the inter-institutional dynamic of the EU.},

   Benin},
Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Pages = {75-92},
Abstract = {This paper takes up the notion of citizenship and ethnicity as forms of
   belonging in the context of globalisation. The discussion draws on a
   case study focusing on a Fulfuldephone servile group from Northern Benin
   called the Gando. Since pre-colonial times, their servile status
   ascribed by birth has been an argument for placing them at the margins
   of their society and excluding them from political participation. While
   still claiming their belonging to the nation-state of Benin and the
   Fulbe's culture, the Gando have progressively built a new social
   identity that is showing to be a new ethnic group. In the context of the
   decentralisation reform implemented in 2002-2003, the Gando have taken
   the opportunity to access local power; they conquered municipal power in
   the 2003 and 2008 local elections. In doing so they opened the gates to
   a full citizenship that in the context of today's Benin means a
   clientelistic citizenship. Contrary to recent literature focused on the
   simultaneous emergence of belonging dynamics and violent conflicts in
   the context of recent globalisation in developing countries, the author
   argues that belonging dynamics do not necessarily imply violent
   conflicts and exclusion dynamics.},

Abstract = {This article reports the responses of New Zealand local government
   councillors concerning their preferences for, and experiences of,
   council officer employment; and the values councillors perceive that
   council officers adopt in their dealings with councillors. This study
   received responses from slightly fewer than one hundred councillors in
   New Zealand local government out of 247 and therefore, the results
   presented here should be viewed as indicative only because of the small
   sample. Nevertheless the survey found that 54 per cent to 77 per cent
   would prefer to have influence over council officer employment, with
   council officers displaying deference to the authority of councillors.
   Councillors prefer to have frank and fearless advice but they prefer not
   to be under pressure from council officers to accept that advice. This
   ensures that they obtain the type of support they need to carry out the
   tasks and responsibilities that have been conferred on local
   authorities; and they - the councillors rather than council officers
   remain in control of the council affairs.},

Title = {EU-UN partnership in military conflict management: Whither the African
   Union security infrastructure?},
Journal = {AFRICAN JOURNAL ON CONFLICT RESOLUTION},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Pages = {153-171},
Abstract = {This article problematises the nascent relationship between the United
   Nations (UN) and the European Union (EU) in African conflict management.
   Constructing the EU as a security actor, including its validation
   through the UN, is not a process solely based on the normative claims
   inherent in the EU as a sui generis actor, but more importantly such
   claims are grounded in the EU as offering greater capacity and
   efficiency in African conflict management. In light of this argument,
   many studies have analysed this relationship in terms of inputs and
   outputs in field missions undertaken under this framework. While the
   EU-UN relationship can be viewed a priori as a process driven by
   `African needs and requirements' as an end security consumer, the
   development of the EU-UN relationship poses inherent risks to the
   African Union (AU) slogan of `African problems, African solutions' or
   `African solutions to African problems'.
   In light of the above-mentioned, the EU-UN question is surprisingly

Journal = {POLITICKE VEDY},

Volume = {14},
Number = {4},
Pages = {51-66},
Abstract = {The aim of this contribution is to introduce relations between Russia
   and NATO after the collapse of the Soviet Union. With the creation of an
   independent Russian state and the demise of the Warsaw Pact as a
   military-political organisation of the communist states it became
   necessary to define relations between NATO and Russia on a new,
   qualitatively higher level, so as it would reflect changes in the
   political and security map of the world that took place after 1991. The
   need for a new arrangement of mutual relations resulted also from the
   fact that Russia as the USSR successor state remained not only global,
   but particularly also regional security actor, which could not be
   possibly (or desirably) excluded from the processes in Euro-Atlantic
   security space. During the 1990s of the 20th Century relations between
   Russia and NATO were very significantly affected by issues related to
   NATO's enlargement towards Central and Eastern Europe, to which Russia
   has voiced a strong disapproval. After 9/11, in the context of the
   global war against terrorism, a new perspective and dimension of mutual
   political and military relations has been opened. Its intensity,
   however, fluctuated due to the influence of number of various events
   (such as the war in Iraq in 2003 or the Russian-Georgian conflict in
   August 2008).},

Abstract = {This article explores the meaning of patriotism in the lives of United

   a social force, particularly in times of perceived crisis. Identifying
   two principal patriotic styles-{''}deferential{''} and
   ``inquisitive{''}-it is argued that the distribution of these styles
   reflects relational social and political structures of claim making in a
   democracy, interconnected to individuals' desire to belong to something
   greater than themselves, and especially to be recognized by others as
   belonging. In other words, different patriotic styles reflect the
   relative difficulty or ease individuals and groups experience in
   establishing and affirming their belonging and social worth, and
   translating this citizenship into effective political participation. The
   article explores how these patriotic styles relate to the functioning of
   the democratic state in times of crisis, and how patriotic attachments
   serve or do not serve the interests of citizens.},

Abstract = {We analyze a simple dynamic model of the interaction between terrorists
   and authorities. Our primary aim is to study optimal counterterrorism
   and its consequences when large terrorist attacks lead to a temporary
   increase in terrorist recruitment. First, we show that an increase in
   counterterrorism makes it more likely that terrorist cells plan small
   rather than large attacks and therefore may increase the probability of
   a successful attack. Analyzing optimal counterterrorism we see that the
   recruitment effect makes authorities increase the level of
   counterterrorism after large attacks. Therefore, in periods following
   large attacks a new attack is more likely to be small compared to other
   periods. Finally, we analyze the long-run consequences of the
   recruitment effect. We show that it leads to more counterterrorism, more
   small attacks, and a higher sum of terrorism damage and counterterrorism
   costs. On the other hand, it leads to fewer large attacks and less
   damage.},

Title = {Incumbents without a Campaign Finance Advantage: Competition and Money
   in Chile's Congressional Elections},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS IN LATIN AMERICA},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {3},
Number = {3},
Pages = {3-33},
Abstract = {Research from various countries has shown that incumbents in legislative
   elections raise and spend more money when they face a tougher contest. A
   statistical analysis of Chilean candidates' campaign finance disclosures
   shows the opposite: an inverse relationship between incumbent spending
   and electoral competitiveness. This occurs because Chile's deputies are
   relatively limited in their influence over policy and pork and because
   the congressional electoral system makes most competitive contests
   relevant only to the intra-coalitional balance of power. This account
   implies that political finance is as much a function of political
   systems and the supply of contributions as it is candidates' demand for
   funds, and motivates several hypotheses about campaign finance in Chile.
   Among others, the analysis confirms that incumbents and challengers
   compete on a level playing field, spending similar amounts of campaign
   finance. The paper also illustrates that incumbents and challengers fare
   equally well in Chile's ``secret{''} donation system.},

Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {18},
Number = {1},
Pages = {135-159},
Abstract = {The democratization literature commonly claims that democratic
   transitions require an independent civil society. However this view,
   which builds upon Tocqueville, reifies boundaries between state and
   society. It also over-predicts the likelihood that independent civil
   society organizations will engage in confrontation with the government.
   Drawing upon Hegel, I develop a two-dimensional model of civil society
   that clusters organizations according to goal orientation and autonomy.
   This illustrates how high levels of autonomy combined with goals that
   extend beyond an internal constituency are linked to democratization. I
   then examine Nigeria's civil society during the era of democratization
   between 1985 and 1998, and identify important changes in the political
   opportunity structure. I attribute changes in autonomy and goal
   orientation of organizations to three factors: transnational organizing,
   coalition building, and victimization. My findings question the
   assumption that autonomous organizations will challenge the state.
   Future research could explore links between the state mobilization
   during the 1990s and one-party dominance today.},

Abstract = {Should party leadership candidates communicate their policy positions to
   the party's electorate? And should they do so when their own ideal
   position is outside their party's mainstream? This article presents
   evidence from a field experiment into the communication of controversial
   policy positions through direct mail. Working with a front-running
   campaign during the race for the leadership of the Liberal Party of
   Canada, we randomly assigned a subset of convention delegates to receive
   a direct mail treatment featuring policy messages outside the mainstream
   of the party. Using a survey instrument, we measured the effects of this
   treatment on delegates' ratings and preference ordering of leadership
   candidates. The effects of the direct mail were principally negative;
   receiving the mail reduced the probability of the candidate being
   supported.},

Abstract = {In developing countries, banks are simply not present where the majority
   of poor people live and work. This imposes burdensome access costs on
   customers who need to travel to distant branches, so the majority of the
   population opts out from the formal banking system. Banking services can
   be offered through everyday stores that exist in every community and by
   new technology, particularly mobile communications networks. Banking
   regulations, however, impede such possibilities in many developing

Journal = {PEACE ECONOMICS PEACE SCIENCE AND PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Rural-urban divides have characterized recent violent insurgencies
   around the world, but there are important differences in dynamics:
   sometimes rural insurgents target cities and sometimes not; sometimes
   the combat frontier is blurry, other times neat. This paper attempts to
   construct a simple model of the rural-urban relationship in conflict to
   understand when predators will attempt to prey on cities, versus when
   they remain in the hinterlands. It takes Krugman's (1991) core-periphery
   model as a starting point, in which there are just two regions, A and B
   (perhaps rural and urban), and two sectors. However, the model is
   modified such that the sectors are not ``manufacturing{''} and ``
   agriculture,{''} but rather production and predation, after Hirshleifer
   (1991), which can both occur in either or both regions. It finds that at
   middling levels of predation and/ or high transportation costs, rural
   predatory actors will target cities. At high levels of predation and/or
   low transportation costs, however, multiple stable equilibria may arise,
   creating disincentives for rural predatory actors to target cities.},

Title = {Thinking citizenship and its constitutive subject: interrogating the
   2004 Irish citizenship referendum debate},
Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},

Volume = {15},

Pages = {161-180},
Abstract = {This article considers a referendum which was held in the Republic of
   Ireland in 2004 involving a proposal to qualify the existing universal
   constitutional entitlement to birthright citizenship. Existing analysis
   of this referendum reflects dominant trends in citizenship scholarship.
   It does so by framing the issue in terms of two opposing perspectives -
   one particularistic (exclusive) and one universalistic (inclusive) - and
   positing the question of the `politics' of citizenship as a trade-off
   between these diverging models. This article argues, however, that Rob
   (R.B.J.) Walker's notion of the constituent subject of (sovereign)
   politics challenges this dualistic framework as the necessary starting
   point for discussions about citizenship. It does so by problematizing
   the premise upon which it is based which is the taken-for-granted
   autonomous existence of persons (individuals) who are understood to be
   connected to, but ultimately separate from, `the state.' This article
   concludes with reflections on what an alternative framework for
   exploring citizenship (based specifically on a historicization of
   subjectivity in relation to sovereignty) might look like. It suggests
   that this provides us with a different starting point to the prevalent
   form of a timeless dialectic of inclusion and exclusion, particularism
   and universalism, polis and cosmopolis currently determined by the
   boundaries of the Irish state.},

Abstract = {In the author's opinion, the transformation of contemporary Russia's
   political system was going on under the conditions of the spread of
   political corruption, which preconditioned the state of crisis of all
   spheres of life both of society and of the state. A complex of measures
   is proposed in order to overcome the situation. The core of this complex
   of measures is supposed to be constituted by professional lustration of
   the state machinery, like the one carried out after the unification of
   the Germany.},

Abstract = {Power is a contested concept, and no one definition suits all purposes.
   Many analysts of international relations and foreign policy have
   confused power defined in relational and resource terms. They often use
   simple command definitions of behavioral power, and neglect the second
   and third faces of power. In terms of resources, they often have ignored
   ideational aspects of power resources to accommodate simplified
   neorealist structural models. This article surveys the usefulness of
   different definitions and conceptions of power and illustrates how they
   can produce relatively rich or truncated foreign policy analyses.},

Title = {Revalorizing the Political: Towards a New Intellectual Agenda for
   African Civil Society Discourse},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CIVIL SOCIETY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {7},
Number = {4},
Pages = {427-442},
Abstract = {Who needs civil society? What is civil society useful for? While the
   foregoing and similar dilemmas dominated the early civil society
   literature on sub-Saharan Africa, this was soon followed by a steady
   shift to the analysis of non-governmental organizations. The shift
   foreshadowed the recent methodological approach to civil society
   research which emphasizes `measuring' and `surveying' civil society. In
   this essay, I contend that this approach, to the extent that it seems to
   totalize civil society as component voluntary associations that can be
   measured, deepens the crisis of understanding which it aspires to
   transcend. Yet, although I critique-and reject-this approach, I argue
   nonetheless that it ought to be seen as an opportunity to reinstate a
   more theoretically robust and politically driven imagination of civil
   society, one that problematizes, not just civil society organizations
   that are, ultimately, only an aspect of civil society, but the civil
   domain as a whole. While conceding that `measuring' civil society has
   its own merits, I insist that it comes with a real danger of, first,
   reducing civil society to organizations, especially organizations that
   can be measured; and second, distracting students of African societies
   from the politicality that underpins much of the continent's
   socio-economic woes.},

Title = {Political Parties and `the Immigration Issue': Issue Ownership in
   Swedish Parliamentary Elections 1991-2010},
Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {34},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1070-1091},
Abstract = {Why is `the immigration issue' rarely polemical for the Swedish
   mainstream when it divides parties across Europe? Several factors
   suggest fertile ground for conflict, yet parties hesitate to capitalise
   on anti-immigration cues. Based on interviews with Swedish MPs, the
   article discusses two interlinked issues. First, immigration
   crystallises conflicting ideological streams: market liberalism vs.
   value conservatism (for the centre-right) and international solidarity
   vs. welfare state/labour market protectionism (for the centre-left), and
   stressing the `wrong' stream detracts attention from parties' core
   competencies. Second, since competition, when present, revolves around
   issue ownership, parties that are less trusted on immigration will
   divert attention to areas of higher competence. Whether immigration
   becomes politicised is not necessarily dependent on electoral grievances
   or a radical right presence but on parties' ability to handle and
   negotiate these conflicting streams and issue priorities. An
   appreciation of the party politics of immigration is thus central to
   understanding when, and why, immigration becomes an `issue'.},

Abstract = {Both civil society organizations (CSOs) and political parties are
   expected to be vital actors in democratic societies, yet the ideal
   relationship between the two types of groups has not been fully
   explored. This article analyses how the interaction between CSOs and
   political parties has affected democratic consolidation in contemporary
   Turkey. Through personal interviews with leaders of both types of
   groups, the study finds that traditional power relations have shifted to
   include a greater number of political actors. Islamists, who were
   previously peripheral in politics, have joined the traditionally
   dominant secular nationalists at the `centre' of political power.
   However, instead of increased pluralism, the study finds Turkish society
   now polarized along secularist/Islamist lines, both in political parties
   and among CSOs. While restrictions against non-governmental
   organizations have been lifted in recent years and the number of groups
   has grown, most are still viewed as `arms' of political parties, lacking
   an independent voice and political power. These findings suggest that
   the civil society sector in Turkey is underdeveloped and unable to
   contribute positively to the democratization process.},

Abstract = {This article examines the response of civil society organizations to the
   xenophobic violence of May 2008 in Cape Town. It explores the nature of
   the response and lessons learned about the state of progressive civil
   society in the city. It articulates a paradox. It is difficult to
   imagine what would have happened to people displaced by the violence
   without the mobilization of resources by civil society through its
   humanitarian response and advocacy work; yet the response revealed what
   appear to be significant weaknesses in sections of civil society in Cape
   Town. The article contextualizes the substantive discussion with a brief
   exploration of Cape Town, its experiences of migration, and the state
   and civil society in the city. The main part of the article examines the
   nature of the response of civil society to the May 2008 xenophobic
   violence and what it revealed about the state of civil society.},

   strained by the ``betrayal{''} of Poland at Yalta in 1945. Presidents
   and candidates for elected office try to instrumentalise the Polish
   community as voters. Conversely, the Polish diaspora (Polonia) uses its
   weight to influence U.S. policy for example, on Solidarity or NATO
   accession. Faced with a loss of importance and increasing assimilation,
   Polonia has to develop a new agenda.},

Title = {The Barriers to Electoral System Reform: A Synthesis of Alternative
   Approaches},
Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {34},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {478-494},
Abstract = {The article suggests that a research framework that focuses on the
   barriers to reform would promote the analysis of both the successes and
   the failures of electoral initiatives. This framework asks what keeps
   the electoral system stable over time. The article investigates what
   stops reform, rather than why there is a desire to reform. The barriers
   framework synthesises two of the main approaches used in explaining
   electoral reform, institutionalism and rational choice; it is useful
   because it can explain both the success and the failure of reform
   initiatives, and even those cases of non-reform. Seven barriers are
   listed that reformers must overcome when trying to promote electoral
   reform; the article then examines the ways reformers can pass each
   barrier; assesses the relative strength of the various barriers; and
   suggests ways to advance the study of electoral reform by using the
   proposed barriers approach.},

Title = {Institutionalizing the pro-democracy movements: the case of Zambia's
   Movement for Multiparty Democracy},
Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {18},
Number = {5, SI},
Pages = {1106-1124},
Abstract = {In this contribution the challenges of political opposition is addressed
   through a focus on the problems of institutionalizing parties and party
   systems in sub-Saharan Africa. Challenges of party institutionalization
   in a context of political and economic liberalization, where external
   international donors have become an active part of these political
   processes, are illustrated through a case study of Zambia. Zambia is
   chosen as a case because it in many ways presents a `best-case scenario'
   for democratic consolidation in sub-Saharan Africa. The political
   transition in 1991 saw a new party coming to power as the Movement for
   Multiparty Democracy (MMD) won the parliamentary elections with a large
   majority-over the former one-party rule of the United Independence Party
   (UNIP). The electoral success of Zambia's pro-democracy movement was in
   part explained by its ties to civil society, most notably, the Zambian
   Congress of Trade Unions. The contribution will show that the combined
   effects of political and economic liberalization, and the political role
   played by external financial actors in these processes, have hindered
   the institutionalization of political parties in Zambia. The limited
   institutionalization, witnessed by weak ties to civil society, a limited
   membership and shallow organizational structures, provides a partial
   explanation for the executive dominance that has characterized Zambian
   politics after the 1991 democratic transitions.},

Abstract = {A nation's endowment with human capital is an important source of
   economic prosperity, yet education systems as well as the amount of
   public spending differ both between and within industrialised countries.
   Traditional approaches in comparative political economy explain
   education spending from a perspective in which leftist parties favour
   human capital formation. In contrast, recent approaches claim that -
   with regard to public financing of higher education in stratified
   education systems - the basic assumptions of partisan theory rather lead
   to the opposite hypothesis. In such systems, a pattern of reverse
   redistribution emerges, under which electoral incentives let right-wing
   parties favour increases in higher education budgets. This article tests
   both claims within the decentralised German education system. Its
   encompassing empirical strategy provides clear support for the latter
   hypothesis in the 16 German states between 1992 and 2003. The results
   imply that the partisan composition of government and preferences for
   redistribution continue to matter.},

Abstract = {During the modern conflict in Northern Ireland, the paramilitaries
   played an important role in shaping communal identities. The loyalist
   Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) and the Ulster Defence Association (UDA)
   enjoyed significant support in the Protestant community and should be
   understood as one expression of Protestant insecurity. This article
   considers the nature of this manifestation of Protestant fear during the
   formative years after the formation of the UDA in 1971 and up to the end
   of Andy Tyrie's leadership of the organisation in 1988. It argues that
   the evidence uncovered by an examination of paramilitary literature, as
   well as that of the loyalist political parties which were affiliated
   with the UVF and UDA, reveals a complex persona that cannot be
   understood as entirely violent and exclusive. Instead, after outlining
   evidence for moderation, it explores what this evidence can reveal about
   the emergence of political thinking within parts of the UVF and UDA, and
   concludes that the literature demonstrates how politics was restricted
   by the primacy of a historical consciousness and the prevalence of
   sectarianism in the loyalist community, the hardening effect of
   republican violence, and the lack of a political niche.},

Pages = {1272-1283},
Abstract = {The measurement of populism - particularly over time and space - has
   received only scarce attention. In this research note two different ways
   to measure populism are compared: a classical content analysis and a
   computer-based content analysis. An analysis of political parties in the
   United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany and Italy demonstrates that
   both methods can be used to measure populism across countries and over
   time. Recommendations are presented on how to combine these methods in
   future comparative research on populism.},

Abstract = {This study uses data from the Australian, British, Canadian, New
   Zealand, and US election studies (21 studies in total) to examine the
   effect of political information on the vote calculus across time and
   countries. In doing so, two core questions are addressed. First, do
   differences in political information affect how individuals arrive at
   their vote choice? The expectation is that there will be a positive
   relationship between information level and the number and difficulty of
   factors considered in the vote calculus. Secondly, this study tests the
   hypothesis that the magnitude of information effects in the decision
   process will be a function of the complexity of the electoral context.
   The findings support both hypotheses. Factors incorporated into the
   decision process differ across information groups, but only when the
   electoral context is relatively complex.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to analyse the conditions under which
   referendum campaigns have an impact on voting choices. Based on a model
   of opinion formation that integrates both campaign effects and partisan
   effects, we argue that campaign effects vary according to the context of
   the popular vote (size and type of conflict among the party elite and
   intensity and direction of the referendum campaign). We test our
   hypotheses with two-step estimations for hierarchical models on data
   covering 25 popular votes on foreign, European and immigration policy in
   Switzerland. Our results show strong campaign effects and they suggest
   that their strength and nature are indeed highly conditional on the
   context of the vote: the type of party coalition pre-structures the
   patterns of individual voting choices, campaign effects are higher when
   the campaign is highly intense and they are more symmetric when it is
   balanced.},

Abstract = {The financial crisis provides us with an opportunity to rethink the
   neoliberal form of capitalism. From a Keynesian standpoint,
   neoliberalism manifests the power of the unproductive class of rentiers
   to effect an income redistribution so as to gain profits at the level of
   circulation. The emphasis in our analysis will shift from the sphere of
   circulation to that of production, a reminder of Marx's basic thesis
   that capitalist production is a process of generating surplus value. The
   work of Michal Kalecki, which is useful for its exposure of the
   limitations of the Keynesian problematic, formulates a dilemma that
   partially hints at this theoretical orientation. The essential point is
   that, failing to understand capital, Keynesians are incapable of
   understanding the essence of neoliberalism, which is particularly well
   suited for enforcing capital's aggressive exploitation strategies toward
   labor.},

Abstract = {In the remote regions of Afghanistan, the use of community defence
   forces to supplement the stabilisation effort has had mixed results.
   Effective local governance is a key prerequisite for successful
   community defence, but the weakness or absence of local institutions,
   and the lack of support from central government, has often meant
   training teams must spend time and resources building the appropriate
   framework from scratch. It is this link between security and governance,
   however, that makes community defence a possible model for the future.},

Abstract = {In Federalist 10 James Madison drew a functional distinction between
   ``parties{''} (advocates for factional interests) and ``judgment{''}
   (decision-making for the public good) and warned of the corrupting
   effect of combining both functions in a ``single body of men.{''} This
   paper argues that one way of overcoming ``Madisonian corruption{''}
   would be by restricting political parties to an advocacy role, reserving
   the judgment function to an allotted (randomly-selected) microcosm of
   the whole citizenry, who would determine the outcome of parliamentary
   debates by secret ballot-a division of labour suggested by James
   Fishkin's experiments in deliberative polling. The paper then defends
   this radical constitutional proposal against Bernard Manin's (1997)
   claim that an allotted microcosm could not possibly fulfil the
   ``consent{''} requirement of Natural Right theory. Not only does the
   proposal challenge Manin's thesis, but a 28th Amendment implementing it
   would finally reconcile the competing visions that have bedevilled
   representative democracy since the Constitutional Convention of 1787.},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The linkage between what parties promise during election campaigns and
   what governments deliver afterward is central to democratic theory.
   Research on this linkage concludes that there is a higher level of
   congruence between campaign promises and government actions than
   suggested by the conventional wisdom. This study is the first to
   describe and explain citizens' evaluations of the fulfillment of
   election pledges in a way that is comparable with political scientists'
   evaluations. The explanation of variation in citizens' evaluations
   combines an objective factor, namely actual policy performance, and
   subjective factors, namely party identification, information resources,
   trust in political parties, and personal experience. The explanation is
   tested with panel data containing a unique set of questions on public
   opinion in Ireland. Actual policy performance is the most important
   factor affecting citizens' evaluations. However, subjective factors
   often cause citizens' evaluations to be more negative than actual policy
   performance suggests they should be.},

Abstract = {The judicial left, initiated in the early 1970s, is often a priori seen,

   who, while beginning the mourning of their youth ideals, penetrate into
   the professional world. The creation of the SAF, in 1973, forces to
   break with this uniform point of view. This article is interested in the
   first two generations of the SAF: the communist founders and the lawyers
   of extreme left subscribing in the second half of the 1970s. Having
   brought to light the tensions between these generations of cause lawyers
   in the memberships and/or the diverse partisan orientations, the article
   shows how the daily coexistence in the profession and in the union in
   phase of establishment contributes to limit the intergenerational
   tensions. It puts making it relief the weight of the sociability and the
   professional constraints daily as the institutional politics in the
   dynamics of the intergenerational relations within a union.},

Abstract = {In spite of the enormous amount of attention devoted to the process of
   European integration, the study of protest actions that take the
   European Union as their target is only incipient and suffers from a lack
   of up-to-date systematic information. This research note presents new
   data on protests in the member states which, directly or indirectly,
   targeted the Union between 1992 and 2007. These data show that the
   increase in protest mobilisation anticipated by previous scholars has
   not taken place and that the advances in formal European integration
   have not been matched by any corresponding increase in protests
   targeting the EU.},

Abstract = {From the moment that their enormous destructive capacity was first shown
   to the world, nuclear weapons are universally considered as the most
   cruel weapons that exist. Nevertheless, several countries developed
   nuclear weapons since then. At the same time, much international efforts
   have been put into stopping the spread of nuclear weapons and,
   eventually, reaching complete nuclear disarmament. Looking in
   retrospective, how successful have these efforts been in the last 65
   years? After a concise comparison between forecasts and outcomes of the
   nuclear proliferation process, this article analyses a variety of
   non-proliferation efforts, and also compares them to the accomplishments
   in the field of chemical and biological weapons.},

Abstract = {The profound impact that Frank Wright's 1987 book Northern Ireland: A
   Comparative Analysis has had on the study of deeply divided societies
   has only become clear over the long run. Despite (or perhaps because of)
   its complexity of structure, the book succeeds in offering comparative
   insights into how systems of inter-communal violence can first develop
   and then become self-sustaining. As an Englishman settled in Northern
   Ireland, Wright was highly sensitised to the condescension typically
   shown by liberal metropolitans towards the inhabitants of `ethnic
   frontiers'. Wright's principled refusal to see political stability in
   terms of moral essentialism lends his work both insight and continued
   relevance today.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ELECTIONS PUBLIC OPINION AND PARTIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {21},
Number = {4},
Pages = {497-521},
Abstract = {When applying the proximity model in electoral studies, scholars face
   the challenge of estimating voter-candidate proximity when voters'
   responses to issues/policies in a multidimensional policy space are
   correlated. In this article, we contend that voters' correlated
   evaluations can be captured by the structure of a non-orthogonal policy
   space. After orthogonalizing such a space using the Gram-Schmidt
   process, we can improve our estimation of the spatial distance between
   voters and candidates. Moreover, our study suggests that in
   multidimensional space neither the city-block nor the Euclidean distance
   is ideal for estimating proximity. We propose to use a generalized
   parametric Minkowski model and our analysis demonstrates that the most
   appropriate distance metric for a particular study is an empirical issue
   that hinges on the particular structure of a dataset.},

Abstract = {This article considers whether an imperial paradigm is useful in aiding
   our understanding of the European Union (EU) and US today. It argues
   that empires are key units in today's world, imposing considerable
   constraints on formally sovereign states, and that this cannot but
   change the nature of International Relations. The article compares some
   of the distinctive characteristics of the EU and US, and considers
   whether their structural features and imperial behaviours generate
   cooperation or conflict. It concludes that their competition for
   supremacy in Europe is potentially conflict-prone. The US treats Europe
   as one of its vital peripheries and this is at odds with the EU's own
   imperial ambitions.},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Policy positioning has received a great deal of attention from scholars
   of British politics. While numerous studies emphasize the positions
   taken by the Labour and Conservative parties, and how the positions of
   these parties have shaped citizens' electoral behavior, few studies
   explore policy positioning at the candidate-level. We conduct the first
   quantitative study that examines the relative policy positions of
   British candidates during a general election. Building on findings from
   the study of American elections, we argue that two factors explain
   variation in candidate positioning in Britain: constituency-level
   electoral competition and a disparity in candidate quality. Using data
   from the 2001 British Representation Study, we find evidence that both
   factors are associated with a decrease in the policy contrast between
   candidates. Our findings suggest that, despite the differences in party
   control, similar factors affect candidate positioning in both Great
   Britain and the United States. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {The idea that democracy is contagious, that democracy diffuses across
   the world map, is now well established among policy makers and political
   scientists alike. The few theoretical explanations of this phenomenon
   focus exclusively on political elites. This article presents a
   theoretical model and accompanying computer simulation that explains the
   diffusion of democracy based on the dynamics of public opinion and mass
   revolutions. On the basis of the literature on preference falsification,
   cascading revolutions, and the social judgment theory, an agent-based
   simulation is developed and analyzed. The results demonstrate that the
   diffusion of attitudes, in combination with a cascading model of
   revolutions, is indeed a possible theoretical explanation of the spatial
   clustering of democracy.},

Abstract = {Proponents of constitutional patriotism advocate the promotion of a
   political national identity. Whether a national identity founded on
   common political values is viable, however, remains a matter of dispute.
   The Swiss nation is one of the few empirical cases cited by those who
   argue that a political national identity can be a sufficient guarantor
   of institutional stability and social coherence; indeed, Switzerland is
   widely regarded as a prototype of the political nation. The aim of our
   analysis is to empirically test this claim. In doing so, we rely on
   classical typologies of national identity. We propose to use a more
   finely graded typology than the usual dichotomies, however - one which
   allows for combined types - and to focus on individual perceptions of
   national identity at the mass- and elite-levels. The empirical analysis
   of whether the Swiss nation can correctly be classified as a political
   nation draws on data from mass and MP surveys. Our conclusion is that
   the Swiss imagine their nation in both political and cultural terms, and
   the essence of their cultural identity is Swiss linguistic pluralism and
   regional diversity.},

Abstract = {Britain and Germany have been experiencing significant changes in the
   nature of work and welfare since the 1990s. Although important
   differences have remained, there have been compelling indications of a
   dual transformation of welfare constituted not only by a far-reaching
   retrenchment in unemployment insurance but also by a remarkable
   expansion in family policy. These developments have their functional
   underpinnings in accelerating deindustrialization with a declining
   proportion of the male workforce with specific skills as well as in
   service sector growth and rising female labor market participation
   characterized by an increase in general skills. As the aggregate effect
   of economic fluctuations in industrial production has diminished over
   time, the relative incidence of work disruptions that have arisen from
   maternity and child-rearing has increased substantially. This dual
   transformation in welfare and employment patterns suggests that the
   process of deindustrialization has initiated significant path
   adjustments unanticipated in the existing comparative political economy
   literature.},

Abstract = {Political discussion matters for a wide array of political phenomena
   such as attitude formation, electoral choice, other forms of
   participation, levels of political expertise, and tolerance. Thus far,
   research on the underpinnings of political discussion has focused on
   political, social, and contextual forces. We expand upon this existing
   research by examining how individual personality traits influence
   patterns of political discussion. Drawing on data from two surveys we
   investigate how personality traits influence the context in which
   citizens discuss politics, the nature of the relationship between
   individuals and their discussion partners, and the influence discussion
   partners have on respondents' views. We find a number of personality
   effects and our results highlight the importance of accounting for
   individual predispositions in the study of political discussion.},

Journal = {BRITISH POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {6},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {The House of Lords has acted as if it has greater legitimacy since the
   reforms of 1999 that removed most of the hereditary peers. Until 2010,
   the governing party Labour had only a minority in the House, but since
   the formation of the coalition after that year's general election the
   Conservatives and Liberal Democrats combined have had a majority among
   those peers who take a party whip. Whether they can get their
   legislation through the House, therefore, depends on whether large
   numbers of crossbench peers vote against the government. In general,
   their turnout is low. It increased during the latter stages of debates
   on the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Bill, 2010, but
   crossbenchers rarely voted in sufficient numbers with Labour to defeat
   the government and when they did, they were unwilling to sustain their
   opposition when the House of Commons declined to accept their
   amendments. This raises issues regarding the future role of the House
   during the 2010-2015 Parliament, and, in particular, whether it should
   become a largely elected chamber as proposed in a recent White Paper and
   draft legislation. British Politics (2011) 6, 430-452.

   not only more positive about the European Union (EU) level, but also
   more negative about domestic performance (even though frames about such
   a performance were not provided). The opposite is found for negative
   frames. Further, the negative bias assumption implies that zero-sum
   adjustments are best triggered by negative blame frames rather than by
   positive `credit' frames. Finally, in contrast to standard blame
   avoidance assumptions, the experiment mimics the realistic situation in
   which the opposition attacks integration and the government defends it.
   This reverses the prototypical blame avoidance situation and opens the
   way for unintended effects. Governments may paint EU-induced conditions
   in rosy colours, reflecting negatively on its domestic performance.
   Conversely, the opposition runs the risk of being too gloomy about
   integration for its own good, as negative EU welfare frames reflect
   positively on domestic performance.},

Abstract = {This study examines voter turnout in the American states in U.S.
   presidential and House elections from 1920 through 2008. A model
   predicts turnout as the sum of the national campaign context, state
   autonomy, and electoral continuity. The national campaign context
   encompasses conditions that prompt turnout to shift similarly across
   states. State autonomy involves state-specific factors that prompt
   turnout to vary across states. Electoral continuity involves people
   voting in successive elections, regardless of other influences. Testing
   the model finds that national campaign context effects have increased,
   but they vary by year, election type, and region and have been mixed
   since the 1970s.},

Abstract = {Debates about the role of money in politics are commonplace. Although
   some critics point to the potentially negative impact spending has in
   elections, most recent scholarly evidence indicates that spending may
   actually promote greater participation in the political process.
   However, most of this research has uncovered this relationship in races
   for more visible offices; few studies have focused on whether the same
   linkage is present in low-information elections. For a variety of
   reasons, it is not altogether certain whether this relationship would
   exist for such offices. To test this proposition, we examine the impact
   of campaign spending on voter rolloff in 172 contested races for
   intermediate appellate courts (IAC) between 2000 and 2008. In contrast
   to other types of elections, combined candidate spending in these races
   had no effect on ballot rolloff.},

Abstract = {The article provides basic information on the course of life and
   theoretical work of contemporary French political thinker Claude Lefort
   (1924-2010). Particular emphasis is put on the contents and importance
   of Lefort's theoretical trilogy on Stalinist totalitarianism, which
   consists of the following books: Elements of a Critique of Bureaucracy
   (1971), One Man Too Many. Reflections on ``The Gulag Archipelago{''}
   (1976), and Democratic Invention (1981). These works contain an original
   and profound understanding of such a type of order as a modern social
   formation. Such research shows that true insight into the political and
   into democracy is possible only on the basis of thorough investigation
   and understanding of totalitarianism.},

Abstract = {Existing scholarship has characterized the severity of and mechanisms
   behind the problem of conflict contagion but not how to address it.
   Although studies of peacekeeping have demonstrated that it can prevent
   conflict recurrence, we know little about whether international actors
   can also help prevent conflict from spreading. Using event history
   analysis that incorporates information from neighboring observations,
   the empirical findings indicate that the expected risk of armed conflict
   increases by over 70\% when peacekeepers are not deployed to a recent
   neighboring conflict but does not significantly rise when neighboring
   peacekeepers are deployed. One of the key means by which peacekeeping
   helps contain conflict is through addressing problems related to
   transnational movement of and support for insurgencies, thereby
   specifically preventing intrastate conflict from increasing the
   propensity for new intrastate conflict nearby. Moreover, both lighter
   and more substantial peacekeeping deployments can prevent conflict
   diffusion.},

Abstract = {This article develops a model of public responsiveness to social policy
   in the United States, focusing in particular on the public's ability to
   distinguish between direct and indirect government spending as means of
   financing social benefits. We argue that public opinion should be
   responsive to changes in both direct (appropriations) and indirect (tax
   expenditures encouraging the private provision of social goals)
   spending. Further, the public should respond to changes in direct and
   indirect spending in distinct ways consistent with the divergent
   resource and interpretive effects of the two types of spending. We find
   that while public opinion is not responsive to the total amount of
   federal social spending, it is attentive to changes in direct and
   indirect spending, considered as separate concepts. The results show
   that the electorate treats changes in the relative allocation of
   government spending as representing important shifts in the ideological
   direction of public policy.},

Abstract = {Mass media produce various communicational products in the form of
   messages coded in the symbolic language of writing, sound or image,
   which they distribute through the open public space for unknown users.
   Unlike the traditional theories, which directed their attention above
   all to the social effects of media products, the systemic theory
   inquires into the very process of their production, deeming that
   precisely the latter is the real reality of mass media: the factual
   operations which are performed systemically, through application of the
   binary code of information/non-information, and according to the
   internal rules of its structure. The real reality, however, is
   inaccessible to the observer. Consequently, he can gain knowledge of it
   only in such a way as to construct from the forms in which it appears to
   him an observed reality as his own perception thereof. The systemic
   theory suggests that its construction of mass media reality is most
   congruous with their real reality. Keeping in mind that each observer
   performs his construction of reality of the thing observed in accordance
   with his own knowledge and understanding, the author asks himself: where
   is the evidence of the trustworthiness of such constructions?},

Abstract = {The seemingly wide opening for liberal domestic policy innovation by the
   U.S. federal government in the early-to-mid-1930s gave way to a much
   more limited agenda in the late 1930s and 1940s. The latter years saw
   the consolidation and gradual extension of several key programs (e.g.,
   Social Security and Keynesian macroeconomic management), but also the
   frustration of liberal hopes for an expansive ``cradle-to-grave{''}
   welfare state marked by strong national unions, national health
   insurance, and full employment policies. Drawing upon rarely used early
   public opinion polls, we explore the dynamics of public opinion
   regarding New Deal liberalism during this pivotal era. We argue that a
   broadly based reaction against labor unions created a difficult backdrop
   for liberal programmatic advances. We find that this anti-labor reaction
   was especially virulent in the South but divided even Northern
   Democrats, thus creating an effective wedge issue for Republicans and
   their Southern conservative allies. More generally, we find that the
   mass public favored most of the specific programs created by the New
   Deal, but was hardly clamoring for major expansions of the national
   government's role in the late 1930s and 1940s. These findings illuminate
   the role played by the South in constraining New Deal liberalism while
   also highlighting the tenuousness of the liberal majority in the North.},

Abstract = {The authors test a model of strategic vote choice in which the decision
   to support or not to support a candidate depends on the benefit
   associated with the election of a given candidate and the candidate's
   perceived viability. They test the model with data collected in a series
   of experiments in which the participants voted in eight successive
   elections, four in one round and four in two rounds. Results show that
   the same model applies to both voting systems, although the impact of
   perceived viability is slightly weaker in two-round elections. The

Abstract = {This article tests two models of extremism versus moderation in
   presidential policy stances, a party activist theory and a congressional
   context theory. The party activist theory argues that, due to the
   electoral and nomination reforms of the mid-1970s, party activists
   became increasingly important and powerful in their parties. As
   activists tend to be more policy extreme than rank-and-file voters, and
   grew more extreme over the past several decades, this theory predicts
   presidents will also be more policy extreme in the postreform than the
   prereform era. The congressional context theory focuses on divided
   government and polarization. It argues that policy-minded presidents
   must moderate their policy positions during divided government because
   they need support from the opposition party. However, polarization
   erects barriers and disincentives for presidential moderation,
   offsetting the moderating tendencies of divided government. Using data
   on presidential policy positions from the 1950s through the early 2000s,
   I test both theories, finding support for the congressional context but
   not the party activist theory.},

Title = {Populist Communication and Publicity: An Empirical Study of Contextual
   Differences in Switzerland},

Volume = {17},

Abstract = {This study analyzes the context-dependency of populist communication and
   asks whether there are variations in populist communication for
   representatives of different kinds of parties. In contrast to previous
   research on European populism, which mostly considers only the
   right-wing, this study includes the entire scope of political parties;
   thus allowing for the possibility of the diffusion of populism in
   contemporary politics. The empirical contribution is a multilevel
   analysis of speeches in non-public and public forums (closed
   parliamentary committees, open parliamentary floors, and the talk show
   `Arena') on immigration and asylum amendments in Switzerland. A
   so-called populist party, the Swiss People's Party, played a significant
   role in drafting the legislation. Analysis reveals that a) different
   public settings influence populist communication differently; b) a
   non-populist party, the Christian-democrats, employs more populist
   communication on average than any other party and its populism is
   employed more consistently across contexts than that of the Swiss
   People's Party; c) but when speaking in media forms, the Swiss People's
   Party employs substantially more populist communication than any other
   party. Thus, the type of public forum does not uniformly contribute to
   higher levels of populist communication, but rather the effect of forum
   type varies substantially by party.},

Abstract = {The authors examine the administrative procedures acts (APAs) of
   separation of powers and parliamentary systems. They examine sixteen
   national APAs (thirteen parliamentary and three presidential) and
   forty-eight APAs from the U.S. states that have institutional structures
   analogous to the presidential systems. They identify a very stark
   difference between the parliamentary and presidential APAs. While all of
   the presidential system APAs place constraints on both adjudicative and
   rulemaking activities, only two of the parliamentary APAs make any
   reference to rulemaking at all. The authors present an institutional
   explanation for this observation based on recent work on veto players
   and delegated discretion to administrative agents. They argue that the
   presence of partisan veto players discourages focus on rulemaking in
   APAs.},

Title = {Reinventing the block vote? Trade unions and the 2010 Labour party
   leadership election},
Journal = {BRITISH POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {6},
Number = {3},
Pages = {317-344},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Labour's electoral college chose Ed Miliband as the party's new leader
   on the basis of votes that were influenced by trade union activities.
   Some trade unions made a number of decisive interventions in the 2010
   leadership election contest: they coordinated their nominations,
   canvassed intensely for their nominees (channelling considerable
   resources into their campaigns), and distributed ballots with strong
   recommendations in the same package as the voting slips. Such was the
   closeness of the election that, we argue, these interventions determined
   the result. This conclusion is all the more surprising since
   commentators and academics alike had maintained that the introduction of
   `one member, one vote' had fundamentally reduced the role of trade
   unions in Labour party politics. In contrast, our opinion is that having
   been apparently deprived of control by the introduction of one member
   one vote, trade union elites developed a strategy to mould the outcome
   of the Labour leadership contest and so reassert their traditional
   influence over the party. Such was the extent of the role played by the
   trade unions that, we believe, the normative legitimacy of the electoral
   process by which Ed Miliband was elected can be called into question
   although the rules of the contest were not broken. British Politics

Title = {A Framework for Analyzing Information Flows in Public Policy
   Decision-making: A Move towards Building Sustainable Policy Instruments},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS AND LAW},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {4},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to explain a framework that focuses on
   information flows as a means of understanding public policy
   decision-making, with a specific emphasis on information relating to
   sustainable development. The goal of this framework is to further aid in
   identifying and explaining the extent to which sustainability goals are
   being implemented in public policy decisions. The suggestion is that by
   focusing on the information flows directly related to sustainable
   information, instances can be isolated where specific pieces of
   information are not making their way to final decision-making processes,
   or alternatively, where new information interferes with sustainable
   information becoming part of the final decision-making process. This
   paper begins with an overview of the theoretical framework in the first
   part, and then gives an overview of how the framework can be applied to
   sustainability information. It concludes by suggesting the use of the
   framework can offer substantial insight into questions of sustainable
   policy development. While the approach described offers the potential to
   better understand organizational decision-making dynamics, the true
   value of the framework will lie in its future use to both predict and
   assess the relationship between sustainable outcomes and related
   decision-making processes.},

Abstract = {What is the relationship between electoral institutions and the internal
   organization of legislatures? Existing research on the U. S. Congress
   suggests that electoral incentives shaped by the candidate-centered
   nature of congressional elections explain the emergence of strong
   committees in that legislature. Exploring the issue from a comparative
   perspective, it is argued that the impact of ballot structure on
   committee system structure is dependent on how legislators cultivate
   personal votes. Committees will be stronger when legislators supply
   fiscal legislative particularism (pork), but weaker when legislators
   cultivate support by delivering extra-legislative constituency service.
   Statistical analysis, combining original data on committee design in 39
   democratic legislatures with measures of ballot structure and mechanism
   to cultivate a personal vote (MCPV), confirms the expectation.},

Abstract = {Taking as a point of departure the definition of sexile used by critics

   American undergraduate students, this essay studies exile of sexual
   minorities in Cuba and Puerto Rico. This study focuses on masculine
   sexile, and studies how Luis Rafael Sanchez, Reinaldo Arenas, and Manuel
   Ramos Otero depict the traditional definition of sexile to explore how
   this notion can be transformed when we add the new meaning used by
   younger generations of undergraduates. The essay concludes by reflecting
   on the advantages and disadvantages of proposing sexile as a poetic for
   Caribbean eroticism that ultimately redefines collective identity
   discourses in the Caribbean.},

Abstract = {As a rising power, China has become actively involved in regional
   bilateral/multilateral arrangements in the post-Cold War, especially
   post-crisis (199798 financial crises) era, and this has attracted much
   attention from within and outside East Asia. Diverse understandings of
   China's regional ambition have appeared, especially since the launch of
   the China-ASEAN free trade agreement (FTA). Aiming at deciphering the
   ideas behind China's regional thinking, this paper argues that China's
   perspective on regionalism is a broadened economic regionalism, which is
   basically economic-centered, because economic performance is vital both
   to its long-term strategic target and to its internal social stability.
   This economic regionalism will last for some time because China will be
   a developing country at least in the mid-term, which means China will
   have to focus more on its economic performance. In practice, China will
   engage bilaterally or multilaterally with others through its FTA
   strategy. Thus, China cannot be a main contributor to East Asian
   integration as expected, owing to the inward-looking nature of its
   economic regionalism. Also, the institutional integration of East Asia
   needs the effort of all the players in the region.},

Title = {Jacques Ranciere and the problem of pure politics},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {10},
Number = {3},
Pages = {303-326},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Over the past decade, Jacques Ranciere's writings have increasingly
   provoked and inspired political theorists who wish to avoid both the
   abstraction of so-called normative theories and the philosophical
   platitudes of so-called postmodernism. Ranciere offers a new and unique
   definition of politics, la politique, as that which opposes, thwarts and
   interrupts what Ranciere calls the police order, la police - a term that
   encapsulates most of what we normally think of as politics (the actions
   of bureaucracies, parliaments, and courts). Interpreters have been
   tempted to read Ranciere as proffering a formally pure conception of
   politics, wherein politics is ultimately separate from and in utter
   opposition to all police orders. Here I provide a different account of
   Rancie're's thinking of politics: for Ranciere politics goes on within
   police orders and for this reason he strongly rejects the very idea of a
   pure politics. Politics is precisely that which could never be pure;
   politics is an act of impurity, a process that resists purification. In
   carefully delineating the politique-police relation I show that the
   terms of Ranciere's political writings are multiple and multiplied.
   Ranciere consistently undermines any effort to render politics pure, and
   therein lies his potential contribution to contemporary political
   theory.},

Abstract = {In many Western European states, an increasing number of autonomist
   parties are taking part in government at state and regional levels. To
   date, however, scholars have paid little attention to the repercussions
   of government incumbency for these actors. This article aims to take a
   first step towards redressing this oversight. Based on an extensive
   literature examining political parties in government, we formulate
   hypotheses about how autonomist parties will approach, behave within and
   be affected by government office. We test these hypotheses by examining
   the participation of autonomist parties in regional and state
   governments in Western Europe since 1945. The findings demonstrate that
   the difficult decisions autonomist parties must make when entering
   government, the subsequent dilemmas and challenges that must be resolved
   once the threshold of government has been crossed, and the consequences
   of government incumbency, are similar to those faced by any political
   party in government. However, the fact that autonomist parties operate
   within a multi-level political context can render these challenges more
   complex than is the case for political parties operating (mainly or
   exclusively) at a single territorial level, usually that of the state.
   The article concludes by identifying key factors that affect the success
   of autonomist parties in government.},

Journal = {POLITY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {43},
Number = {3},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Many scholars use ``civil society{''} to denote a realm of peaceful
   social organization independent from and often antagonistic to the
   state. The mass demonstrations that peacefully brought down Eastern
   European governments in the late 1980s legitimized this understanding.
   At the some time, however, governments were falling in less developed
   countries, and the social groups that emerged were decidedly uncivil. In
   these places competing groups preyed upon each other, which sometimes
   led to protracted civil wars. The view of civil society as spontaneously
   self-organized harmony cannot deal with these Third World cases. To
   better understand such developments this article proposes an alternative
   view of civil society, inspired in part by the writings of Kant, in
   which social harmony emerges after the state reduces violence and
   constrains predation by organized groups. The case of Somalia
   illustrates the usefulness of this alternative vision. Polity (2011)

Abstract = {Does partisan conflict damage citizens' perceptions of Congress? If so,
   why has polarization increased in Congress since the 1970s? To address
   these questions, we unpack the ``electoral connection{''} by exploring
   the mass public's attitudes toward partisan conflict via two survey
   experiments in which we manipulated characteristics of members and
   Congress. We find that party conflict reduces confidence in Congress
   among citizens across the partisan spectrum. However, there exists
   heterogeneity by strength of party identification with respect to
   evaluations of members. Independents and weak partisans are more
   supportive of members who espouse a bipartisan image, whereas strong
   partisans are less supportive. People with strong attachments to a
   political party disavow conflict in the aggregate but approve of
   individual members behaving in a partisan manner. This pattern helps us
   understand why members in safely partisan districts engage in partisan
   conflict even though partisanship damages the collective reputation of
   the institution.},

Abstract = {In a recent study, Kam and Palmer (2008) employ propensity score
   matching to assess whether college attendance causes participation after
   reducing selection bias due to pre-adult factors. After matching the
   authors find no correlation, upending a major pillar in political
   science. However, we argue that this study has serious flaws and should
   not be the basis for rejecting the traditional view of an ``education
   effect{''} on participation. We match on 766,642 propensity scores and
   use genetic matching to recover better matches with lower covariate
   imbalances. We consistently find positive effects as covariate balance
   improves, though no matching approach yields unbiased results. We
   demonstrate that selection is a serious concern in studying the
   participatory effects of college attendance and that balance in the
   covariates and robustness to sensitivity diagnostics should be the
   ultimate guide for conducting matching analyses.},

Abstract = {Venezuelan educational policy has undergone profound changes, manifested
   in the Magna Carta of 1999. It is important to highlight the State's
   objectives, redefining its ethical-political dimension as an aspect
   closely linked with participatory and protagonist democracy; civic
   education is the instrument for social transformation, where subjects of
   participation become involved and are accountable. Its transformation
   turns toward the consolidation of active, participative citizenship.
   This paper aims to analyze whether civic education is being deployed in
   current educational policy, employing a descriptive analytical method
   and using a documentary review of the Constitution of the Bolivarian
   Republic of Venezuela 1999 and the Simon Bolivar National Project
   2007-2013. Among the most relevant results of the study, it was found
   that the Venezuelan constitutional order lays the foundation for civic
   education as an indissoluble link for effective citizen participation
   contemplated in the National Simon Bolivar Project. Nevertheless, it is
   imbued with and directed by a strong ideological bias, pointing toward
   revolutionary consciousness based on a new socialist ethic. The
   interdependence between education and training for the full exercise of
   citizenship is recognized.},

Abstract = {Annick Houel, Crimes of passion and gender inequalities
   An analysis of crime news, unanimously scorned but largely read,
   provides a caricatural but illuminating image of the social
   representations of families and couples. Our analyses points out the
   hierarchy that exists between the sexes and shows how representations
   endure in modern French society and that pervade the criminal court
   despite legal changes. We specifically explore the bias of psychiatric
   experts which support rulings that differentiate according to the sex of
   the perpetrator.},

Abstract = {The idea of `public reason' has recently been associated with Rousseau's
   views on the formation of a general will. Advocates of this idea in the
   Kantian tradition tend to emphasize reflective acts of rational
   deliberation which, I suggest, are more suited to written than to spoken
   language. Rousseau's accounts of the role of spoken language as a means
   of expressing human needs and the role of pity in the development of a
   moral form of reasoning, which allows one properly to take into account
   the interests of others, show that he cannot be so easily interpreted as
   an advocate of the idea of public reason. This is because his views on
   the importance of spoken language in democratic politics and the
   essential part played by the sentiment of pity in the development of
   moral reasoning imply the legitimacy of modes of expression in the
   formation of a general will that are not, in any obvious sense,
   compatible with the demands of public reason.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the variables that affect the award of tenure
   in political science departments in the United States. We examined two
   dependent variables: (1) whether a department has denied tenure in the
   past five years, and (2) whether a positive departmental tenure
   recommendation has been reversed by higher college or university
   authorities during the same period of time. Five clusters of independent
   variables were evaluated: (1) college/university and departmental
   characteristics, (2) the procedures employed to evaluate tenure cases,
   (3) the instruments used to assess teaching, (4) service expectations,
   and (5) research and publication standards. We found that the most
   important factors affecting departmental decisions to deny tenure were
   whether teaching and substantive publications were treated as equally
   valuable qualifications, the number of articles a candidate published,
   and the candidate's level of commitment to advising. Interestingly,
   reversal decisions by higher authorities were not strongly affected by
   any of the variables in the analysis.},

Abstract = {In Democracy in America, Alexis de Tocqueville predicted that America's
   love of equality would lead it to centralize administrative power. In
   The Old Regime and the Revolution, Tocqueville argues that
   centralization of administrative power began prior to the French
   Revolution-a revolution largely aimed at instituting equality. In fact,
   he argues that centralization led to greater equality in France and was
   therefore a major cause of the Revolution itself This apparent
   contradiction is resolved, and the logics of the two books are made
   coherent, if equality and centralization constitute a circular causal
   relationship. Whether the point of departure is equality (America) or
   centralization (France), the other ultimately follows. This circular
   relationship exemplifies Tocquevillian ``equilibrium analysis,{''} as
   each phenomenon reinforces the other to stabilize democratic society.
   Yet such equilibrium was anathema to Tocqueville, who through his
   writings sought to protect the political freedom he called ``this first
   of my passions.{''}},

Abstract = {Rachel Silvera, Inequalities of the wages: a new three dimensional movie
   When entering the job market, and during the carrier, discriminations of
   women are playing a prominent part. Segregation at work is not a fact
   outside the job market, but the consequence of those stereotypes. In may
   and july 2010, two juridical decisions have supported the argument of
   women in a case of wage discrimination. The inequalities of wages are
   not a fatality. There are ways like juridical action, which should be
   collectively promoted, in particular by the trade-unions, but also by
   the directions of Human resources.},

Abstract = {Public space and language, an indissoluble bond, seems to be united if
   they want to be considered to study democracy. Philosophy, from Platon
   to Marx, doesn't think in restoring political activity only by doing
   philosophy, projecting in history and in a praxis and separate logic
   from action, which comes of degradation of politics. From this point of
   view, this paper is about the agonistic field of political philosophy in
   France, which crystallizes, explicitly or implicitly in this reference
   to Hannah Arendt and his rejection of the label of philosopher.},

Abstract = {The nation-state has recently come under attack as an institution
   incompatible with liberal democracy, or under ridicule as being a faked
   representation of a virtual invention, the nation. This study shows the
   historical reality and durability of the nationstate as adapted to a
   modern perception of the nation and to the profoundly changed conditions
   in which it functions. It shows the transformation of the romantic
   ideology of nationalism of the early nineteenth century to a mere
   principle of political organization, according to which the nation-state
   combines the cultural identity and the democratic will of a people. It
   shows also the resulting changes in the understanding of national
   identity and belonging for the individual. This study also examines some
   of the rival theories offered in this connection, such as the preference
   for the so-called civic nationality over an ethnic one and also the
   strong case for multiculturalism often voiced. The conclusions from
   these examinations are that the democratic nation-state with a cultural
   identity of its own, with equal citizenship for all and extensive
   recognition of the cultural rights of minorities, has legitimately
   survived into a new era of globalization, of increasingly mixed
   populations, of cultures crossing borders and of increased international
   intervention. As an example of the problems faced by relatively new
   nation-states, an epilogue presents the case of Israel which
   demonstrates the centrality and complexity of the minorities' problem in
   the process of shaping a modern and normal nation-state.},

   the social mechanisms involved in the establishment of the European
   Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). Contrary to commonly accepted
   theories used to explain institutional change, it argues that the
   establishment of the EMU has not simply been the product of historical
   paths, the rational choices of actors, or social construction of new
   economic ideas and preferences, but also it has been the product of
   self-fulfilling prophecies that have facilitated and accelerated the
   process of institutional change. This article also discusses the role of
   context-bounded rationality, embodied institutions, reflexivity, and
   double contingency.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the institutionalisation of public and civic forms
   of deliberation within the Scottish Parliament. The analysis focuses on
   the committee system of the Parliament and is constructed around a
   unique database, created by the authors, which records the nature of all
   deliberative instances involving parliamentary committees and members of
   the public/stake-holding groups between 1999 and 2009. Findings emerge
   from the data that are of relevance to two main audiences. First, those
   with a concern for the abstractions of deliberative theory are provided
   with much needed empirical evidence about the institutionalisation of
   deliberative processes within a national legislature. And second, those
   with a concern for legislative studies and devolved politics are
   provided with a novel evaluation of deliberation that feeds into wider
   debates about the principles of the Scottish Parliament. Our findings
   show that the committees of the Scottish Parliament have been relatively
   successful in institutionalising a deliberative system comprised of a
   range of discursive spheres of varying complexity. However, this
   optimism must be tempered by the observation that this is a system in
   decline. British Politics (2011) 6, 155-186. doi:10.1057/bp.2011.3},

Abstract = {In the last few years, virtual libraries have taken off in the field of
   Spanish education and culture, and so the driving forces which have been
   adopted, both at the national and EU level, should be recognised. From
   foundations to mercantile societies, institutions and entities which
   offer online libraries are continually on the increase. From the point
   of view strictly of tax, and focussing on VAT, it is clear that in most
   cases, these services are offered totally altruistically. However, in
   other cases, it is clear that offering the service free is precisely
   what acts as the principle way of obtaining economic resources
   advertising, scientific and technical assistance, report writing, etc.;
   in some cases a fee is simply required directly from the user. In this
   study, looking at the particular instances described, we analyse the
   application of VAT to the different forms of offering online library
   services.},

Abstract = {The state is a specific form of government, distinguished from others by
   its impersonal character and the recognition on the part of the office
   holders that they represent the will of the people. This form of
   government is an implication of nationalism. Thus, every state is a
   nation-state. Since nationalism is the cultural framework of modernity
   in all its expressions, every state is also a modern state. The future
   of the nation-state depends on the future of nationalism. The recent
   globalization of nationalism into the formidable civilizations of
   South-East Asia has opened a new era for the latter. Therefore, the
   future of the nation-state at present looks brighter than ever.},

Abstract = {Why do citizens in postauthoritarian African democracies trust
   government-owned broadcast media more than they trust private
   broadcasters, given the public media's lack of independence and history
   of state propaganda? Analysis of Afrobarometer data from sixteen
   countries indicates that low political sophistication, illiberal
   attitudes, and support for incumbents are all associated with greater
   relative trust in government media. Citizens also prefer public
   broadcasters in polities with greater press freedom and lower
   corruption. These results suggest that private media need more
   democratic and critical citizens, rather than higher quality reporting
   and greater press freedom, to compete with the state media for influence

Abstract = {In the last few years, international anti-corruption activities and
   campaigns have become increasingly prominent in Western efforts to
   promote political reform and `good governance'. Since 1990s, proponents
   of governance reforms i.e. the donors linked political corruption to the
   explanation of developmental failure, thereby identifying the arguments
   for democratization and `good governance' with those for liberalization.
   Governance reform has been a recent trend for Bangladeshi Government to
   take anti-corruption measures and to operate Anti-Corruption Commission
   (ACC), which has been considered as a distinct national agency charged
   with combating corruption. The donors have all promoted the
   establishment of such ACC in Bangladesh, claiming that it can form an
   integral part of a country's ``national integrity system.{''} However,
   the experiences of Bangladeshi anti-corruption measures and the role of
   ACC are mixed. The question remains whether the anti-corruption
   commission represents a genuine commitment on the part of Bangladeshi
   government in its anti-corruption strategy, or whether it is merely a
   facade, established to simply placate the international donors. This
   paper explores the way in which corruption has been understood in the
   `governance' agenda and the efforts that have been made to control it by
   improving institutional performance and policing for greater
   transparency and accountability particularly through ACC in Bangladesh.},

Abstract = {The author retraces the steps that brought Pazanin to the practical
   philosophy which he went on to constantly advocate and elaborate. He got
   the key stimulus from Hannah Arendt and her work Vita activa. The latter
   is based on an analysis of three forms of life - theoretical, practical
   and poietic. Pazanin establishes very studiously a connection between
   activity (practice) and political life, and he shows that neither
   scientific-technical insights nor pure philosophical speculation can be
   substitutes for practice. In the author's judgement, credit belongs to
   Pazanin for pointing out the distinctiveness of practical political
   activity. On the other hand, he deems that it is not enough to be
   satisfied with mere rehabilitation of Aristotle. Instead, in view of the
   situation in the modern world, it is also necessary to construct the
   concept of the political. Pazanin did not perceive this endeavour, in
   the strict sense, as part of his task.},

Abstract = {This article shows the political importance of the clergy in the
   parishes of Popayan during the early stage of the Republic. This was due
   to the role of the clerics as great shapers of subjectivities. That is
   why the State turned them into its agents for exercising social control
   and achieving adherence to the republican regime, particularly in
   territories where allegiances to monarchy and King Fernando VII were
   still alive. This position allowed them to play an important role in the
   everyday life of the villages, a key factor to understand the local
   politics in the first half of the 19th century.},

Abstract = {This article introduces the `Positions and Salience in European Union
   Politics' dataset. The dataset comprises positional and salience
   estimates of more than 250 parties and governments in the European Union
   (EU). These estimates, which all come with measures of uncertainty,
   pertain to 10 important EU policy domains as well as a European
   integration and a left-right scale. The dataset exploits statistics from
   hand-coded European party manifestos provided by the `Euromanifestos'
   project and uses simulation to correct stochastic error. The manifestos
   are scaled using a technique for count data that employs principles from
   psychophysics. For most European domestic parties and major European
   Parliament groups, the estimates range from 1979 to 2004, while for
   member state governments time-series between 1998 and 2007 are
   available. The dataset may be of use to scholars interested in European
   integration, Europeanization, compliance research or EU legislative
   decision-making.},

Journal = {PERSPECTIVES ON POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {9},

Abstract = {Mechanical metaphors have colonized the social sciences, including the
   study of democratization processes. But they may provide a misleading
   framework for monitoring ongoing ``self-equilibrating{''} social
   processes with no natural ``end state{''} such as democratization. I
   propose that modern biology can be consulted as an alternative source of
   analogical reasoning, offering a more flexible and appropriate stock of
   metaphors that can enliven analogical accounts of processes of
   democratization. The shift towards modeling democracy as a living
   practice permanently directed towards self-preservation and propagation
   provides a clearer rationale for comparative studies, focussing on the
   relative ``quality{''} of democracy in different contexts. I begin with
   a brief sketch of the historical instability and current contestability
   of most democratization processes; I then examine the morphology of
   complex political concepts and propose alternative biological analogies
   to replace the currently prevalent physicalist imagery.},

Abstract = {Traditionally, Polish society seems to be characterized by paradoxes and
   contradictions. Time and again, unexpected upturns follow periods of
   apathy. Even today, many observers lament a ``social vacuum{''}. Poles
   vacillate between indifference and over-conformity to post-Fordist
   market mechanisms. Nonetheless, there are also positive developments:
   the education level of young Poles is rising steadily, and in many
   places, new forms of social and political participation have come into
   existence.},

Title = {Does It Take Democrats to Democratize? Lessons From Islamic and Secular
   Elite Values in Turkey},
Journal = {COMPARATIVE POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {44},

Abstract = {Do political-Islamic elites need to be democrats for participation in
   democracy, how do their values compare to secular elites', and how do
   their values change through participation and affect democratization
   itself? A comparative-systematic content analysis of three
   Islamic-conservative and two pro-secular Turkish newspapers over nine
   years shows that, overall, political-Islamic elites adopt democratic
   political values. Furthermore, they began to view that
   liberal-democratic rights and freedoms serve their interests. However,
   value democratization, and, thus, moderation and democratization, is not
   a linear and inexorable process automatically resulting from
   participation or socioeconomic development. It occurs through ruptures
   such as conflicts with secular actors, and interdependently through the
   interactions of secular and religious actors. Hence, religious actors'
   adoption of more democracy may paradoxically make some secular actors
   less democratic. The consolidation of pluralistic democracy requires the
   emergence of both religious and secular democrats by resolving complex
   problems of commitment, and of clashes in areas like social pluralism
   where Islamic values are less open to change.},

Abstract = {The majority of Ph.D. programs in political science in the United States
   provide some kind of teaching training for graduate students, which
   ranges from assisting other instructors to designing and teaching new
   courses. In most cases, departments make an effort to guide these
   students in their new role as instructors; however, first-time teachers
   whose first language is not English do not usually receive any special
   guidance on how to successfully address the challenge of communicating
   effectively with their students-an all-too-real problem for many foreign
   instructors. This article provides some basic tips for improving the
   communication process that develops in the classroom, and is
   particularly tailored for individuals whose first language is not
   English and who are about to take the first steps of their teaching
   careers.},

Abstract = {People often make choices that go against their own best interests. In
   the controversial bestseller Nudge, Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein
   argue that people can benefit from simple ``nudges{''} to improve their
   decision-making. In an upper-level undergraduate course on political
   decision-making, I created a series of assignments around Nudge. In the
   project, students designed their own ``nudges{''} to solve a variety of
   political and social problems. Students gave this assignment rave
   reviews, not only for the course content they learned, but also for what
   they discovered about their connections to society and its problems. In
   this article, I describe the assignment and report students' evaluations
   of it. This assignment could be tailored to any course on political
   behavior, public policy, or public administration.},

Abstract = {This study develops a dynamic model of the rivalry process, explicitly
   connecting the conflicts that form rivalries. The model demonstrates how
   these conflicts combine to form an especially conflict-prone
   relationship. Using numerical simulations of the model, I deduce and
   test a hypothesis connecting dyadic conflict and rivalry termination.
   High-concentration conflicts increase the probability of rivalry
   termination by causing a sharp and sustained drop in public support for
   future military action. Dyadic conflict between rivals can bring peace,
   under the right circumstances. The article concludes with a discussion
   of the model's implications for policymakers seeking to limit
   international violence.},

Abstract = {This article addresses the significance of television fiction in the
   public communication process on the basis of a comparative analysis of
   the television dramas A Very British Coup and The Amazing Mrs Pritchard.
   The narratives converge in their depiction of unconventional characters
   becoming Prime Ministers after achieving major electoral victories.
   Furthermore, both texts locate their characters within both political
   and personal crises, in the context of which they confront the dilemma
   of resignation. The article discusses the differences between the two
   narratives in terms of political ideology, reflects upon their
   portrayals of the institutional field of politics, as well as their
   depiction of gender and the division between the public and the private.
   It argues that both articulate conceptual understandings of the
   political and in their different ways touch upon the core concept of
   popular sovereignty.},

Abstract = {Ever since the ``thaw{''}, the treatment of Stalin and Stalinism has
   been an indicator of contemporary politics. ``Anti-Stalinists{''} call
   for freedom and reforms, ``Stalinists{''} for order and a strong state.
   The Putin regime's history policy fits this model. Falling back on
   Stalin and the Soviet Union's victory in the Second World War is
   supposed to legitimise Putin's authoritarian rule. Anti-democratic
   politics are accompanied by a mythical idealisation of the totalitarian
   past. But this national-Stalinist spirit is threatening to turn on its
   creators. To ward off this threat, President Dmitrii Medvedev and Prime
   Minister Vladimir Putin, for reasons concerning domestic and foreign
   policy, are now positioning themselves as ``anti-Stalinists.{''} Soviet
   history is once again the setting in the battle over the country's
   future.},

Abstract = {How do individual agents enact the institutions that govern collective
   behavior in a social situation? How do individuals come to share
   self-enforcing expectations about collective behavior, so that societal
   rules and constraints have an effect on individual choice? Conventional
   accounts, such as contract and evolutionary theories or the analysis of
   conventions and social conflict, cannot explain the origins of social
   institutions because they do not address the origins of shared and
   self-enforcing expectations about collective behavior in a social
   situation. I analyze two separate stages of institutionalization. First,
   agents must imagine collective intentionality, so that an `imagined
   institution' entailing a symbolic representation of collective behavior
   becomes common knowledge. Second, they must `enact' it through shared
   and self-enforcing expectations on the path of play. In my model, the
   agents are goal-oriented, so the process is strategic throughout.},

Abstract = {This article attempts to show that Heidegger's phenomenology may shed
   light on political phenomena. It pursues this project by arguing that
   Heidegger's phenomenology is an appropriation of Aristotle's practical
   philosophy and his conceptualization of phronesis. I argue that, in
   Being and Time, Heidegger's `circumspection', which is a capacity for
   making sense of practical situations, is a translation of phronesis.
   Heidegger argues, though, that the sight of circumspection is
   foreshortened by the rules and norms of `the one'. In division 2,
   `conscience' becomes a sharpening of the vision of phronesis, which sees
   through the one. I then defend Heidegger's appropriation of phronesis
   and argue that Heidegger's concept of conscience, which takes up a
   critical stance toward plurality, may actually be a proper vision of
   practical wisdom under modern conditions. I substantiate this claim by
   turning to an unlikely source to bolster Heidegger's reading of
   phronesis and the modern public, Hannah Arendt.},

Journal = {INSIGHT TURKEY},

Volume = {13},
Number = {2},
Pages = {93-106},
Month = {SPR},
Abstract = {One might discern five stages of American foreign policy involvement
   with the Kurds. The first brief stage followed World War I and American
   president Woodrow Wilson's famous Fourteen Points, the twelfth of which
   held out the possibility of Kurdish independence. The second stage
   occurred during the time of American support for Mulla Mustafa Barzani's
   revolt in Iraq during the early 1970s, and ended when U.S. and Iranian
   aid for this revolt were terminated in 1975 after a deal with Saddam
   Hussein was reached. The third stage began with the Gulf War in 1991 and
   led to the creation of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) for the
   ``good{''} Kurds in northern Iraq. The fourth stage began with the
   second American war against Saddam Hussein in 2003, which led to what
   might be called the stage of a de facto U.S.-KRG alliance, and continues
   today. The fifth or PKK stage overlaps with the third and fourth stages
   and concerns U.S. support for its NATO ally Turkey against the ``bad{''}
   Kurds of the PKK.},

Abstract = {There has been surprisingly little literature differentiating between
   different kinds of ethnic parties. Most works tend to treat all ethnic
   parties as if they are basically the same. Although, to be sure, there
   have been some notable works attempting to differentiate types of ethnic
   parties, they tend to emphasize the territorial or political demands
   made by ethnic parties to distinguish the different types rather than
   the parties' organizational identity. In this article, rather than
   examine what they demand, we distinguish them by their organizational
   identities, or how they present themselves to an electorate - in
   particular via the names they adopt. We argue that parties portraying
   themselves as representative of a particular group and including that
   group in the party's name are different from parties that portray
   themselves in non-ethnic ways (by not including the group in its name).
   In particular, the latter not only attract different kinds of
   supporters, but are more likely to bring their supporters into greater
   acceptance of democracy, and hence more likely to promote democratic
   consolidation than parties that portray themselves more exclusively.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on the economic and political dimensions of the
   relations between deindustrialization, gentrification and the new middle
   class in Turkey. The urban and political correspondences of the
   increasing intra class segmentation are discussed through the processes
   of deindustrialization and gentrification. Gentrification, which became
   a current issue in urban centers since 1990, created a new economic
   search in urban spaces that were emptied and regressed after
   deindustrialization. The current increase in economic value in city
   centers gave way to a class based evacuation and created an
   ``exclusive{''} perspective, which is directed against the working class
   history in the cities and in general to the states of poverty. As a
   result, the disfavor of the working classes and a ``vicious{''} new
   middle class discourse made the urban imagination of the urban elites,
   which only aim to increase their economic wealth, dominant in public.},

Journal = {POLITICAL BEHAVIOR},

Volume = {33},
Number = {1},
Pages = {95-111},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In a recent contribution to Political Behavior (30:455-467),
   Panagopoulos, using aggregate turnout data, shows that individuals
   living under compulsory voting rules are most likely to go to the polls
   when penalties for abstaining are both strict and routinely enforced. In
   this project, I expand on the work of Panagopoulos by simultaneously
   examining both election-level and individual-level factors. I use a
   broad sample of 36 countries, some with compulsory voting and some with
   voluntary rules, which provides a more detailed understanding of the
   correlates of turnout. Results indicate that the presence and severity
   of compulsory rules do indeed affect turnout, while personally held
   characteristics, including age, education, income, and political
   efficacy remain critical to an individual's turnout decision calculus.},

Volume = {73},

Abstract = {We add to the literature that examines the relationship between
   candidate valence and policy strategies by arguing that candidates
   intrinsically value both the policies and the personal character of the
   winning candidate. In making this argument, we distinguish between two
   dimensions of candidate valence: strategic valence refers to factors
   such as name recognition, fundraising ability, and campaigning skills,
   while character valence is composed of qualities that voters and
   candidates intrinsically value in office holders, including integrity,
   competence, and diligence. Our model considers challengers who value
   both the policies and the character-based valence of the incumbent and
   assumes that the incumbent's policy position is fixed by prior
   commitments. Under these conditions, we show that challengers who are
   superior to the incumbent in their character-based valence have
   incentives to moderate their policy positions. We report empirical tests
   of this good-government result of our model, using data on the 2006
   congressional elections.},

Abstract = {While there is considerable information about the knowledge (or lack
   thereof) and views, informed or not, of U.S. citizens, and there are
   many studies that correlate levels of education with foreign policy
   views, this study was intended to fill a number of gaps in the
   literature by connecting knowledge of international affairs and sources
   of that knowledge with views on foreign policy. In 2008, we undertook a
   study of the foreign policy views of undergraduates at Michigan State
   University (MSU) as part of an innovative undergraduate honors college
   research seminar. Information about the sources of students' knowledge
   about international affairs is correlated with knowledge of past and
   contemporary international affairs and the foreign policy views they
   hold. Attention was also paid to a number of demographic
   characteristics, some of which proved to be statistically significant.
   The article also includes the insights and limitations of this
   particular study, as well as reflections on the research experience.},

Journal = {POLITICA Y GOBIERNO},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {18},
Number = {2},
Pages = {265-295},
Abstract = {This article offers a comparative examination of the quality of Latin
   American democracies through the use of an aggregate indicator generated
   by factorial analysis. The data reflect very notable differences among
   the countries, but also indicate a degree of stability in the level of
   democratic quality during the 2000-2008 period. The regression analysis
   performed indicates democratic experience as the main explanatory factor
   for such differences-a finding that coincides with recent studies-. But
   this is not to say that the issue is framed in terms of institutional
   determinism or path dependence. The analysis also reveals some points of
   discrepancy with the theses offered in the literature, especially in
   connection with the explanatory ability of social capital -not verified
   here.},

Title = {Choices in Context: How Case-Level Factors Influence the Magnitude of
   Ideological Voting on the U.S. Supreme Court},

Abstract = {Most scholarship on Supreme Court decision making assumes that justices'
   ideological preferences exhibit a uniform impact on their choices across
   a variety of situations. I develop a theoretical framework positing the
   importance of case-level context in shaping the magnitude of ideological
   voting on the Court. I hypothesize how issue-related factors influence
   this magnitude. I test the hypotheses using a multilevel modeling
   framework on data from the 1953-2004 terms. The results provide support
   for several of the hypotheses; issue salience, issue attention, the
   authority for the decision (statutory interpretation versus
   constitutionality of federal or state laws), intercourt conflict, the
   presence of a lower court dissent, and mandatory versus discretionary
   jurisdiction all significantly influence ideological voting. Overall,
   the article adds significant qualifications to extant theories of
   judicial decision making by showing how ideological voting on the Court
   is shaped by the varying situations that confront the justices from case
   to case.},

   better known today for his somewhat controversial role overseeing Indian
   partition and independence. Throughout, it was chiefly his political

Pages = {103-135},
Abstract = {There are nearly half a million elected officials in American local
   governments, and the timing of local elections varies enormously even
   within the same state. Some local elections are held simultaneously with
   major federal and state races, while others are held at times when no
   higher level elections coincide. We analyze the effect of election
   timing by exploiting a 1980s change in the California Election Code,
   which allowed school districts to change their elections from off-cycle
   to on-cycle. Because we are able to observe very large within-district
   changes in voter turnout resulting from changes in election timing, we
   are able to isolate the effect of turnout on policy outcomes, including
   teacher salaries and student achievement tests. Our analysis
   demonstrates that while election timing produces dramatic changes in
   voter turnout, resulting changes in public policy are modest in size and
   not robust statistically.},

Title = {Kapitalfetisch: `The religion of everyday life'},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL CRITICAL THOUGHT},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {1},
Number = {4},
Pages = {416-426},
Abstract = {The importance of the idea of fetishism in Marx's work hardly needs to
   be argued, especially in light of the famous passage in Capital
   concerning commodities. However, the extent of Marx's engagement with
   fetishism has rarely been explored in full. In order to re-examine this
   question, the paper is divided into two parts. The first sets Marx's
   discussion in Capital within the context of his lifelong interest in
   fetishism, from his earliest encounter with the idea in the work of
   Charles de Brosses (in the early 1840s), through his religious and
   economic transformations of the idea, to his late interest in its
   anthropological dimensions in the Ethnological Notebooks from the early
   1880s. Included in this discussion is the most famous and well-known
   treatment of commodity fetishism in the first volume of Capital. The
   second part explores the permutations of fetishism beyond this initial -
   and what will turn out to be a very preliminary - moment in Capital,
   focusing on his extension of the term to the whole of capitalism. In the
   extant section of the third draft of Capital and then in the third
   volume of that work, Marx first expands the idea of fetishism to include
   of the many-fold dimensions of capitalism, which `stand on their hind
   legs vis-a-vis the worker and confront him as capital'. Then he begins a
   process of distillation, gradually working towards the pure essence of M
   - M', interest- bearing capital. Here he coins a new word,
   Kapitalfetisch, capital-fetish. Thus, at the heart of capitalism is what
   may be called the `religion of everyday life (diese Religion des
   Alltagslebens)'.},

Abstract = {This article assesses Brazil's relations to South-American countries in
   the period comprising Fernando Henrique Cardoso (1995-2002) and Lula da
   Silva's (2003-2010) terms. Brazilian foreign policy principles during
   both presidencies will be studied, and similarities and differences
   identified through the gaze of Brazil's main foreign policy makers and
   policy analysts at that time. It is possible to point at a convergence
   of interests between diplomats and certain Brazilian business sectors,
   specially construction companies which operate in South America. The
   logics of the Initiative for the Integration of Regional Infrastructure
   in South America (IIRSA), proposed by Brazil in 2000 at the first
   meeting in history of South-American presidents, shows the proximity of
   interests between the diplomacy and Brazilian businessmen. At the end of
   the article we will offer some final reflections on the successes and
   the limitations of Fernando Henrique Cardoso and Lula's foreign policies
   vis a vis South-American countries.},

Title = {Electoral Systems and the Contest for Relative Group Status in
   Post-Conflict Societies: The Case of the 2009 Election in South Africa},
Journal = {POLITIKON},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {38},
Number = {2},
Pages = {211-229},
Abstract = {Empirical support appears to be growing for the claimed effectiveness of
   proportional electoral systems in contributing to lasting peace in
   post-conflict societies. We raise two objections against this claim.
   Firstly, we argue that the theoretical rationale for this causal effect,
   as presented in consociational theory, is inadequate, in lacking a
   psychological mechanism for moderation. We argue that the capacity of
   constitutional arrangements to deliver parity of esteem amongst
   competing political groups should be added as a criterion for evaluating
   the effectiveness of constitutional rules in maintaining political
   stability. Secondly, we challenge the empirical claim that South Africa
   should be considered as an example which supports the argument for
   Party-list Proportional Representation (PR) as a conflict-regulating
   rule. Using data from the 2009 general election in South Africa to
   illustrate the nature of the engagement between ruling and opposition
   parties, we find that despite the entrenchment of the proportional
   electoral system, there is a disparity of esteem in political
   relationships. This necessitates a reconsideration of the purported
   value of PR as a conflict-regulating constitutional device.},

Title = {The Party Faithful: Partisan Images, Candidate Religion, and the
   Electoral Impact of Party Identification},

Abstract = {We argue that the factors shaping the impact of partisanship on vote
   choice-{''}partisan voting{''}-depend on the nature of party
   identification. Because party identification is partly based on images
   of the social group characteristics of the parties, the social profiles
   of political candidates should affect levels of partisan voting. A
   candidate's religious affiliation enables a test of this hypothesis.
   Using survey experiments which vary a hypothetical candidate's religious
   affiliation, we find strong evidence that candidates' religions can
   affect partisan voting. Identifying a candidate as an evangelical (a
   group viewed as Republican) increases Republican support for, and
   Democratic opposition to, the candidate, while identifying the candidate
   as a Catholic (a group lacking a clear partisan profile) has no bearing
   on partisan voting. Importantly, the conditional effect of candidate
   religion on partisan voting requires the group to have a salient
   partisan image and holds with controls for respondents' own religious
   affiliations and ideologies.},

Abstract = {The growth of world trade and the opening from new markets for certain
   economic goods and services have assumed that the current demand and

   of international power. In this scenario emerging countries, mostly
   Asian, whose strength is manifested by an increased consumption of
   primary energy. This situation, characterized by strong competition in
   access and consumption of energy and in which lies a dialectic of power,
   is no stranger to the vast differences in the distribution of
   development indicators in industrialized and emerging countries, nor to
   socioeconomic inequalities whose origin is based on an unequal
   distribution and utilization of resources, in this case energy.},

Title = {The Statute after the Decision},
Journal = {TEORIA Y REALIDAD CONSTITUCIONAL},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {27},
Pages = {291-314},
Abstract = {This article deals with the legal grounds sustaining the Decision of
   Spain's Constitutional Court (STC 31/2010, June 28) concerning the new
   Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia. In particular it focuses on the Court
   arguments on the nature and function of the statutes of autonomy, that
   is, on the limits of the content of the Statute. This is a crucial
   question for different reasons. Firstly, because the statutes of
   autonomy have an important role in the construction of the Spanish
   system of decentralization; secondly, because they are the feature that
   differentiates Spain's decentralized system from others. And thirdly,
   because such question grounded the very same appeal of
   unconstitutionality filed against the Catalonia's Statute and, as a
   consequence, is the central part of the Court's decision. The article is
   divided into three sections and some conclusions. First of all, the
   article explains the legal position of the parties involved in the
   process leading to the decision and shows how much these positions
   reflect different conceptions concerning the characteristics of the
   Statute of Autonomy. Secondly, it analyses the Court's legal reasoning
   in relation to the above-mentioned question: the potential contents of
   the statutes of autonomy are determined by the constitutional nature and
   functions of the statutes, from which some limits on the content can be
   derived. Thirdly, the article examines how the Court applies this latter
   criterion to judge some of the challenged sections. In this sense, the
   Court, in its decision, maintained the contents of challenged sections
   without declaring them unconstitutional. This is achieved by using the
   technique called ``interpretative decision{''} but in an irregular way.
   The conclusion highlights that the legal grounds of the Court's decision
   on the nature and position of the statutes of autonomy have drastically
   reduced their constitutional function, marginalizing those
   characteristics that give them their distinctiveness as a law, and which
   in turn have also led to a reduction of the role the statutes of
   autonomy play in the configuration of the Spain's system of
   decentralization.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the emergence of the Reseau Education Sans
   Frontieres (RESF) in France, a movement that emerged in response to fear
   about the deportation of immigrant children who were pupils in French
   schools. Mobilising ethical concerns about children's welfare, the
   movement has been able to create public debate about the French State's
   moral responsibility to protect these children of `sans-papiers'. Based
   on qualitative research, this article analyses the membership of RESF
   and its modes of action to show how this mobilisation has taken place,
   stressing the importance of `everyday interactions' in this
   mobilisation, and the use of new frames of moral injustice concerning
   children's welfare.},

Abstract = {After 2010 General Elections, the coalition government formed by
   conservatives and liberals decided to hold a referendum on May 5, 2011
   on reforming the current electoral system. For this, the Parliamentary
   Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011 made provision for the
   introduction of the Alternative Vote for the House of Commons, in case
   the referendum result was positive, but also includes other changes of
   great significance. Although 68\% of voters in the referendum rejected
   changing the present single-member plurality system, the experience was
   an important precedent for future initiatives, which probably will soon
   emerge. This overview begins by reviewing the evolution of the British
   electoral system to the present, and then analyzes the development of
   the referendum process, its background and political connotations.},

Abstract = {This article reflects upon the possibility to observe contentious
   activities in an authoritarian context. Based on eleven months of
   fieldwork in Cuba, it is organized in three parts. First, I argue that
   an ethnographic research method allows to go beyond approaches which
   tend to oppose authoritarian states and contentious movements, though a
   specific effort at reflexivity is needed in order not to reify the
   constraint imposed by the context. Secondly, I choose to focus on
   original sites of observation - the way contentious actors appropriate
   space and dramatize their public actions - because they offer relevant
   clues to analyze the meaning and effects of non discursive modes of
   action in a context which criminalizes discursive dissent. Eventually, I
   propose to understand the way contentious groups' activities become
   politicized, rather than to study the politicization of those groups.},

Title = {The Problem of Coordination in Politics: What Critics of Neoliberalism
   Might Draw from its Advocates},
Journal = {POLITY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {43},
Number = {1},
Pages = {36-57},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {As critics of neoliberalism highlight the significance of market
   failure, contemporary political science tends to refrain from explicitly
   addressing evaluative questions about the relationship between politics
   and markets. This article explores how political analysis, even where
   deeply critical of neoliberalism, might draw from the work of
   ``Austrian{''} theorists who inspired the emergence of neoliberal ideas.
   Friedrich A. Hayek, in particular, emphasizes the profound
   epistemological challenges that complexity poses for the political
   sphere. How, he asks, can it address complex choices and trade-offs
   involved in formulating and achieving policy objectives? How can the
   political sphere achieve coordination in a way that is sufficiently
   decentralized to capture the locally situated forms of knowledge and
   values dispersed across society? An analytical focus exploring these
   questions can help achieve a balanced assessment of the strengths and
   weaknesses of political and market processes in a way that complements
   and enriches widely used post-positivist approaches in political
   science. Polity (2011) 43, 36-57. doi:10.1057/pol.2010.22; published

   more tangible social relations linked to politico-economic interests and
   historical conditions. This article proceeds in two parts. First, it
   outlines the many intellectual and epistemological commonalities that
   exist between CTS and cultural criminology. It then takes a more
   critical turn by offering up a series of examples drawn from cultural
   criminology that could be useful in making the `critical' in CTS less
   ambiguous.},

Abstract = {Adapting Granovetter's idea of the `strength of weak ties' (1973), this
   article argues that capitalist, liberal democratic nation-states
   ('liberal societies') distribute both power and processes of
   legitimation widely across society. Against the view that such societies
   are only weakly legitimate, relying primarily on ideological hegemony, I
   argue that they enjoy real, but highly systemically diffused legitimacy.
   To advance this argument I consider some of the inherent problems in
   studying legitimacy in liberal contexts, and offer a preliminary outline
   of a cultural analysis of liberal legitimacy, exploring how legitimation
   processes are embedded in state-economy relations, civil society
   structures, public-private distinctions, and competition as a ubiquitous
   social form. In this way I aim to encourage a more sociocultural, and
   less state-centric understanding of power and its legitimation in
   liberal society.},

Title = {Should Irish Emigrants have Votes? External Voting in Ireland},
Journal = {IRISH POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {26},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {545-561},
Abstract = {Ireland is one of the few countries in Europe not to offer some form of
   suffrage to its citizens who live abroad permanently. By contrast, it
   has been a front-runner in the trend towards providing more liberal
   voting regimes for resident non-citizens, as since 1963 it has allowed
   all residents for the previous 6 months to vote and stand in local
   elections. This paper considers the normative case for and against
   external voting, the current comparative context of its increasing
   provision among European countries and the range of ways in which voting
   rights abroad combine with the extensibility of citizenship by descent
   abroad. Addressing the Irish case, it argues that there is no basis for
   a general right to vote for external citizens, but that, none the less,
   persisting connections and the rate of return migration give some reason
   to grant votes to first-generation emigrants, if differently weighted
   from those of resident citizens.},

Abstract = {During the past two decades, various attempts have been made to
   implement changes in the Belgian electoral system. While most of these
   attempts met with failure, some minor changes were successful. This
   article considers three cases in depth: demands for the abolition of
   compulsory voting; the ongoing discussion about splitting the Brussels
   electoral district according to linguistic lines; and the introduction
   of an electoral threshold. It demonstrates that legal barriers and veto
   players are instrumental in explaining the odds that attempts at
   electoral reform will be successful. Belgium's consociational system
   does indeed impose the use of supermajorities for some reforms and the
   in-built obligation of power-sharing grants veto power to major but also
   to smaller political parties in every language group. The case studies
   also demonstrate that political parties often fail to estimate in a
   reliable manner the consequences of reform.},

Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},

Pages = {289-305},
Abstract = {The `traditional' conception of toleration, understood as the putting up
   with beliefs and practices by those who disapprove of them, has come
   under increasing attack in recent years for being negative,
   condescending and judgemental. Instead, its critics argue for a more
   positive, affirmative conception, perhaps best captured by Anna
   Elisabetta Galeotti's idea of `toleration as recognition'. In this
   article, without denying that it is not always the most appropriate form
   of response to differences, I defend the traditional conception of
   toleration against its critics. Two principal arguments are advanced in
   defence of it: the first articulates its role as part of a viable and
   realistic political theory of modus vivendi, while the second argues
   that it is only the traditional conception of toleration that makes
   possible the mutual accommodation of some values that are genuinely
   antithetical and hostlie to each other. Thus, there remains an important
   place for the traditional conception of toleration in both political
   theory and practice.},

   traditions and customs for national self-consciousness in modern world?

Abstract = {How do the organizational features of rebel groups participating in
   civil wars affect the likelihood of the resumption of conflict after a
   civil war has ended? As many scholars have noted, peace duration is a
   function of the extent to which rebel groups stick to the deal. However,
   occasionally a rebel group fractures, and the conflict resumes as a
   result. Using a combination of existing data on civil conflicts and
   characteristics of the settlement agreement, along with original data on
   the characteristics of the insurgent organizations implementing the
   agreement, we test the effect of the organizational features of the
   rebel group on the duration of the peace settlements that occurred after
   the end of the cold war until 2009.},

Abstract = {In spite of large electoral changes since the 1990s, party composition
   of government changes less and established parties stay longer in office
   than others regardless their electoral fortunes. This development is
   conducive to incongruence between the parties represented in parliament
   and those in government. It is argued that office-seeking behaviour
   tends to become more prominent, resulting in dominant (strongest
   parliamentary party) and `central' parties show a prolonged incumbency.
   If dominance and centrality occur simultaneously a `pivot party'
   emerges. This type of party is indeed characterized by prolonged
   incumbency of government that is often considered as political
   stability. This development is analysed for 16 West European democracies
   (before and after 1990). I contend that a representative bias has
   emerged that could signify a change in the representative quality of
   representative government in Western Europe. Stable government, when
   based upon less correspondence between party representation in
   parliament and party representation in government, may have come at a
   price for overall representative of democracy. Acta Politica (2011) 46,

Abstract = {This article analyzes the importance of system-level features, such as
   political and economic development, and individual-level factors for the
   support of liberal democracy. Using multilevel modeling, the study
   explicitly distinguishes between the role of subjective evaluations at
   the individual level and objective facts at the system level. The
   findings obtained using a sample of 36 countries indicate that objective
   economic performance is the most important system-level factor for
   system support. Improvements in the degree of democracy do not affect
   public support. Individual subjective perception is predominant for
   determining specific support. Contrary to previous studies, there is no
   evidence that the liberal-democratic society reaches a degree of
   acceptance that immunizes it from economic developments. Nor is there
   evidence that citizens of non-democratic regime types will urge for
   democratic change when the regime performs well in economic terms.},

   Evolutionary Cycles of Autochthonous Development},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2011},
Number = {6},
Pages = {33+},
Abstract = {The author seeks to enlarge the temporal, spatial and
   structural-evolutionary context, within which problems of
   conceptualization of Russian development prove to be accessible to
   solution. These efforts are to a large extent motivated by the author's
   dissatisfaction with the cognitive potential of the model of the
   ``reforms-counter-reforms cycles{''} as applied to the study of
   evolutionary cycles of development. Proposed in the article is a
   different, partly alternative, partly additive model of politico-state
   development of Rus-Moskovia-Russia - a model describing this development
   as an evolutional sequence of the so-called ``spurt{''} and
   ``relaxation{''} cycles alternating in Russian history. ``The durable
   20th century{''} of the Russian history (according to the author's
   dating: 1881 - 2025) is conceptualized as a period of a concluding
   ``spurt{''} within the change of the multi-centuries' paradigm of
   development.},

Journal = {BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES OF TERRORISM AND POLITICAL AGGRESSION},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {3},
Number = {3},
Pages = {176-197},
Abstract = {This article introduces evolutionary psychology to a general readership,
   with the purpose of applying evolutionary psychology to suicide
   terrorism. Some of the key concepts related to evolutionary psychology
   are discussed, as well as several misconceptions associated with this
   approach to psychology. We argue that one of the primary, but
   insufficient, motivating factors for suicide terrorism is strong
   religious belief. Evolutionary psychological theories related to
   religious belief, and supporting empirical work, are described, laying a
   foundation for examining suicide terrorism. Several promising directions
   for future research on suicide terrorism from an evolutionary
   psychological perspective are highlighted, particularly within the
   theoretical framework of kin selection, and the implications of applying
   evolutionary psychology to suicide terrorism are discussed.},

Abstract = {Studies on terrorism have traditionally focused on non-state actors who
   direct violence against liberal states. These studies also tend to focus
   on political motivations and, therefore, have neglected the economic
   functions of terrorism. This article challenges the divorce of the
   political and economic spheres by highlighting how states can use
   terrorism to realise interconnected political and economic goals. To
   demonstrate this, we take the case of the paramilitary demobilisation
   process in Colombia and show how it relates to the US-Colombian free
   trade agreement. We argue that the demobilisation process fulfils a dual
   role. First, the process aims to improve the image of the Colombian
   government required to pass the controversial free trade agreement
   through US Congress to protect large amounts of US investment in the
   country. Second, the demobilisation process serves to mask clear
   continuities in paramilitary terror that serve mutually supportive
   political and economic functions for US investment in Colombia.},

Abstract = {Karl Marx ends the first chapter of Capital with a discussion of
   ``commodity fetishism'' or the economic and noneconomic conditions
   necessary for commodity exchange to occur. In today's most popular
   mainstream economics textbook, N. Gregory Mankiw outlines the forms,
   concepts, and methods of ``thinking like an economist,'' including
   positive analysis, a focus on efficiency, and a host of assumptions
   about individual human nature. Comparing the two, we find that the
   ``fetishism of the commodity'' parallels the set of conditions described
   by Mankiw as comprising ``thinking like an economist.'' However, Mankiw
   treats these conditions as natural while Marx understands them to be
   social, historical, and open to change. I argue that numerous
   possibilities are opened up in economics education by destabilizing the
   ``market fetishism'' of mainstream economics and teaching neoclassical
   theory as a social and historical construction rather than a reflection
   of economic reality.},

Title = {When government fails us: trust in post-socialist civil organizations},
Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {18},
Number = {1},
Pages = {160-183},
Abstract = {The research for this article was motivated by a noticeable discrepancy
   between levels of participation and trust in post-socialist civil
   organizations. While civic participation in Central and Eastern Europe
   is almost nonexistent, levels of trust in post-socialist civil
   organizations compare favourably to those in Western Europe. The first
   aim of this article is to understand why citizens place relatively high
   trust in post-socialist civil organizations. The political context,
   within which civil organizations operate, reveals one explanation for
   the high levels of trust in civil organizations: government corruption
   dissuades citizens from relying on state institutions and creates a void
   that is filled by informal networks of association and civil
   organizations. Empirical evidence demonstrates that trust in civil
   organizations focused on socioeconomic and political development is
   higher among citizens who express concern about corruption in their
   country. The second aim of this article is to understand the discrepancy
   between levels of trust and civic participation. A novel interpretation
   of past findings suggests that civil organizations' effectiveness,
   professionalization, transactional capacity and orientation toward
   service provision may garner citizens' trust while parallel neglect of
   grassroots mobilization leaves civil organizations short of capitalizing
   on that trust. Civil organizations' limited focus on interest
   aggregation, mobilization and representation raises doubts as to whether
   observers of civil society in the region should look to these
   organizations as its core component.},

Abstract = {From a humanities course on terrorism that focuses on how terrorist
   ideology and acts are transformed into cultural artefacts, several
   pedagogical-theoretical issues have emerged: the incongruity of viewing
   terrorist violence as art; 9/11 as an ahistorical event; the
   impossibility of defining terrorism; the infiltration (trivialisation?)
   of terrorism into popular culture; subgenres of terrorist works, each
   with its own paradigm; and the iconoclastic potential of many terrorist
   texts and films. These issues have implications for the curricular
   design of terrorism courses and for the role of instructors - in
   academia and in the larger community.},

Journal = {CRITICAL STUDIES ON TERRORISM},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {4},
Number = {3},
Pages = {351-368},
Abstract = {In her treatise on abjection, Julia Kristeva argues that the abject is
   located outside the self, remaining in a state of repulsion that
   threatens to destroy the self. Abject representations are prevalent in
   the way terrorists have been portrayed in the Western news media
   post-September 11, 2001. These images of abjection are problematic, as
   they consolidate the images we have seen in Hollywood films representing
   Arabs. Furthermore, these depictions have eroded the fine line between
   the real and the unreal. This article examines the point at which these
   issues intersect, by analysing individual images vis-a-vis film
   portrayals of the Arab and, ultimately, how the framed images of
   terrorists aired on TV screens have conformed to previously accepted
   notions of the Arab.},

Abstract = {The oil- and gas-rich Niger Delta region, plagued by violence and
   dominated by armed militant gangs, typifies the new face of conflict
   which second generation demobilisation, disarmament and reintegration
   (DDR) approaches are meant to address at the sub-national level.
   Fundamental to the emergence of militant gangs and the militarisation of
   civil society in Nigeria is the federal system of government and its
   attendant political, social and economic imbalances. This article
   advances the argument that the implementation of a detailed DDR
   programme that addresses the governance, ethnic politics, resource
   control, revenue distribution and national integration issues at the
   root of the tensions in the troubled oil- and gas-rich region will yield
   a greater peace dividend for all stakeholders in contrast to the current
   amnesty programme of the Nigerian government. This programme has been
   fraught with setbacks and mistrust from its client group (the
   militants). In so doing, DDR at the sub-national level in the Niger
   Delta would serve as a tool to achieve peace and long-term stability in
   the nation not only by removing the tools of violence - weapons and
   ammunition - from the militants and the civilian population but also by
   removing the sources of violence as reflected in socio-economic and
   political inequality within the Nigerian state.},

Abstract = {Globally, the mix of private-and public-sector involvement in health
   care delivery is a focus of political concern. This concern in Canada
   takes place within the parameters of the federal Canada Health Act.
   Private for-profit activities in the health care sector in Canadian
   provinces have moderately shrunk the definition of `necessary medical
   and hospital services' that must be provided by the public
   administration system under the federal Canada Health Act. In this
   article, we argue that the development of new technologies,
   pharmaceutical innovations, competing (non-health) demands on the
   federal dollar, and an aging population together create an environment
   where pressures for economic and political sustainability have led to
   some erosion of necessary health services in the provinces. Such
   pressures have, in turn, led to the growth of private commercial-sector
   health services. Within Canada's federal system, provincial negotiation
   of the role of commercial health care organizations has developed in
   different ways in Ontario and Quebec. Such sub-national developments are
   a significant focus for comparative health policy analysis.},

Abstract = {The literature on teaching and learning heralds the benefits of
   discussion for student learner outcomes, especially its ability to
   improve students' critical thinking skills. Yet, few studies compare the
   effects of different types of face-to-face discussions on learners.
   Using student surveys, we analyze the benefits of small-group and
   large-class discussions in an upper-level political theory course. We
   also analyze whether the same types of students are likely to
   participate and reap the benefits of both types of discussions. We find
   that, overall, participation is higher in small-group discussions, as
   are students' perceptions of learner outcomes. We also find a more equal
   participation of students of different ethnic backgrounds in small-group
   discussions; similarly, previous academic achievements have less
   influence on discussion participation in small groups.},

Title = {Japan's Foreign Aid Policy to Angola and Mozambique},
Journal = {POLITIKON},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {38},
Number = {2},
Pages = {315-342},
Abstract = {This article compares Japan's aid policies to Angola and Mozambique
   since 1950. It argues that East-West rivalry prevented Japan from
   providing aid to them, particularly after 1975. The post-Cold War period
   enabled Japan to assist the countries' transitions from war to peace as
   part of a peacebuilding approach originating in Japan's traditional
   development cooperation in Asia. As recipient countries of Japanese aid,
   they are contrasting examples of sub-Saharan Africa reform ownership and
   explain why Mozambique is a priority nation to Japan in development
   terms while Angola, until recently, was not. The article affirms that
   Japanese decision-making with regard to Angola and Mozambique reflects
   both international pressures and domestic interests influenced by
   international factors and domestic changes. It concludes that the
   TICAD's development approach, which emphasizes the applicability of the
   Asian experiences in Africa, peacebuilding, and human security as a
   component of Japanese foreign policy, has boosted Japan's `soft-power'
   role in the international system.},

   orientation and civil liberties support},
Journal = {CRITICAL STUDIES ON TERRORISM},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {4},
Number = {2},
Pages = {219-237},
Abstract = {This article analyses Norwegian citizens' attitudes towards the use of
   strong prevention measures in the fight against terrorism. Norwegians
   stand out as being relatively supportive of such measures, despite
   having been relatively shielded from serious terrorism. Nevertheless,
   they are generally more critical towards keeping people in custody
   without trial. This analysis shows that trust, political orientation and
   civil liberties support have significant explanatory value, also when
   the effects of gender, age, education and occupational status are
   controlled for. However, trust turns out to be a complicated indicator;
   whereas high scores on social trust predict more sceptical attitudes, a
   strong belief in personal abilities and in the political system fosters
   attitudes that are less sceptical. The article concludes that the
   combination of low threat, limited previous experience and high levels
   of trust creates a favourable environment for preventive policies, and
   recommends a further exploration of these dimensions in different
   contexts.},

Pages = {355-372},
Abstract = {This commentary deals with the question of what typical patterns are
   characteristic of the political and administrative response to the `risk
   of terror'. The key assumption is that the `new' transnational terrorism
   is not only in itself a risk that is difficult to calculate but is
   furthermore perceived as enforcing those catastrophic risks which
   generally exist in modern high-tech societies. This combination of risk
   and `risk enforcement' explains why in such societies terrorism could
   have such a big impact which shapes the ways of reaction described here.
   As a conclusion, the article advocates to add a political conflict
   perspective to the dominant, primarily technocratic risk perspective.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {16},
Number = {2},
Pages = {195-219},
Abstract = {Wrongdoing in politics has an important rhetorical dimension. Unlike
   rhetoric directed at idealized political ends, it has by and large been
   neglected. This article begins to correct that neglect by constructing
   an outline for a political rhetoric of wrongdoing based on a significant
   exemplar: moral equivalence. Moral equivalence arguments play an
   important role in disputes about wrongdoing. In common with `lesser
   evil' arguments and arguments about moral `double standards', they
   appeal to the idea that particular wrongs are open to moral evaluation
   through the exercise of comparison. At the level of public speech and
   communication, comparative wrongdoing is articulated via discursive
   strategies which are best interpreted through the lens of a rhetorical
   perspective on political theory. Some implications for the development
   of a rhetorical conception of political theory in general are considered
   as a postscript.},

Abstract = {While public-private partnerships (PPPs) have lately come to be seen as
   an attractive vehicle to deliver public services, in academic circles,
   opinions remain divided about their impacts and performance. While the
   proponents strongly justify PPPs by citing a range of benefits,
   including enhanced efficiency, cost savings, risk transfer, and value
   for money, the critics tend to dismiss such assertions and label PPPs as
   risky and wasteful ventures that eventually lead to much higher costs.
   Thus, PPPs have been the source of an intense debate and controversy.
   This article is a contribution to this debate. Based on a review of two
   leading PPP projects in Australia, it argues that although PPPs may help
   achieve some short-term objectives, their overall performance falls
   short of expectations and declared objectives. The article shows that
   the benefits of PPPs are often exaggerated, that the projected risk
   transfer is incomplete or unrealistic given the long term nature of
   projects, and that the contract documents governing the relationships
   between parties are unable to capture all risks and uncertainties.
   Finally, it argues that there is a need to augment capacity and skills
   on both sides, and to undertake a far more careful and considered
   assessment of the costs, benefits and risks of PPPs.},

Abstract = {The EU enlargement process is a vital part of European integration.
   Previous research into EU enlargement aimed especially at the process
   itself or at the appoaches of member states or EU institutions towards
   enlargement. We focus on political parties and their positions towards
   future enlargement of the EU. Comparing the opinions of the CDU and CSU
   on EU enlargement, we try to find out whether these two parties can be,
   at a European level, considered as one homogeneous actor and whether the
   CDU and CSU's declaratory opinions are consistent with the parties' MEP
   voting. Analysis thus deals both with the programme documents and
   statements of relevant politicians and with roll call votes in the
   European parliament.},

Volume = {20},
Number = {2},
Pages = {227-242},
Abstract = {The German grand coalition's track record with regard to managing the
   financial crisis is mixed. The government has spent enormous amounts of
   money to prevent a breakdown of the banking system and to cushion the
   effects of the recession. It was at least partially successful as these
   programmes indeed prevented collapses of banks as well as bank runs,
   kept unemployment relatively low and somewhat mitigated the recession.
   Nonetheless, at least some of the crisis policies lacked coherence,
   particularly with regard to the bank rescue packages. The reason is that
   even in the face of a systemic banking crisis and a GDP decline of 5 per
   cent, programmatic differences between the coalition partners have not
   disappeared and became manifest in government policies.},

   The authors examine SG influence during the Court's agenda-setting
   stage. They find, first, that justices follow SG recommendations even
   when they are completely opposed to them and, second, that law exerts a
   strong independent influence. Justices are significantly less likely to
   follow SG recommendations that contravene important legal factors.},

Abstract = {According to numerous politicians, reforming the welfare state in aging
   societies has become increasingly necessary in spite of the growing
   influence of advocacy groups that have made reforms more difficult to
   realize. Studying the preferences of seniors' organizations is therefore
   crucial to comprehending future welfare state policies. In this paper, I
   will examine recurrent variables that researchers working on seniors'
   organizations study in order to explain the type of framing or political
   discourse that these organizations use. Using FARES/VASOS, the largest
   seniors' organization in Switzerland, as a case study, I will show how
   common explanations (especially the ones that refer to the importance of
   the context or of the political opportunities structure), if they work,
   can also be seen as too incomplete or limited. We will see that focusing
   on how leaders are selected, their activism, and their reasons for
   involvement provides interesting data to help us understand the goals
   and political battles of this organization.},

Abstract = {The link between ethnic heterogeneity and public support for welfare
   policy is debated. The thesis of a negative relationship is supported by
   much American research. Historically the race issue has blocked a number
   of American welfare schemes; across the United States ethnically
   heterogeneous states have less generous benefits, and citizens having
   negative attitudes towards blacks often oppose welfare. The research
   question is: To what extent will increased ethnic heterogeneity in
   European countries establish the same mechanisms? Three theoretical
   positions are discussed: the position that the American experience is
   unique; the position that it is generalisable; and a middle position of
   it being contingent on institutional settings. The latter position
   predicts that the American experience can be avoided, especially in
   social democratic welfare regimes where the ethnicity issue has not been
   politicised. Empirically the article is based on survey data from the
   United Kingdom, Sweden and Denmark, in which a number of American items
   were directly replicated. Despite indications of American uniqueness and
   welfare-regime effects, the findings support the position that the
   in-group/out-group mechanisms found in the United States are being
   replicated in Europe.},

Abstract = {In debates about promoting civic and political engagement in America,
   political scientists are often skeptical about the role of nonprofit
   organizations offering health and social services in the US because they
   are constrained by the tax code and grant agreements. However, I argue
   that by focusing on what I term socialmovement-borne nonprofits, we can
   see how these organizations may engage (marginalized) communities and
   participate in political activities. To illustrate, I consider the
   California Prostitutes Education Project (CAL-PEP) and the St. James
   Infirmary (SJI), two San Francisco Bay-area nonprofits created by
   prostitute-rights activists that offer HIV/AIDS and other health
   services to sex workers. Drawing on multi-method qualitative research on
   CAL-PEP and the SJI, I argue that social movement-borne nonprofits
   engage in political activities through a process of radical
   institutionalization, whereby they incorporate and advance activist
   goals within their organizational practices. I theorize the properties
   of radical institutionalization as ``oppositional implementation,{''}
   ``community engagement,{''} and `` claims-making activities.{''} My hope
   is that scholars will test for and further define these properties in
   order to broaden understandings of nonprofits' evolving role in civic
   and political life, and in processes of social change.},

Title = {Roll call votes as a ``currency of individual accountability{''} -
   Evidence from the German Lander},
Journal = {ZEITSCHRIFT FUR VERGLEICHENDE POLITIKWISSENSCHAFT},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {5},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Roll call votes maintain a position between collective and individual
   representation since they are used as `currency of individual
   accountability'. The study at hand examines the manner in which parties
   use this currency strategically when competing for votes. By requesting
   roll call votes, (usually the opposing) party groups draw the public's
   attention to individual voting behavior in order to promote their own
   candidates as representatives of the constituencies' interests or to
   submit competing candidates to the pressure of opposing interests of the
   constituencies. The greater the emphasis of the electoral system on
   individual candidates, the more frequent party groups use these means.
   According to an analysis covering 115 legislative periods of the German
   state parliaments since 1967, electoral systems' incentives are
   correlated with the frequency of roll call votes. In addition, 80\% of
   the roll call votes are requested by the opposition. Qualitative
   evidence based on interviews and plenary protocols underlines the
   importance of roll call votes as a `currency of individual
   accountability'.},

Abstract = {A perennial question for students of democracy is the extent to which
   government policies align with voter preferences. This is often studied
   by comparing median voter opinion on a left-right scale with the cabinet
   weighted mean, that is, the mean left-right position of cabinet parties,
   weighted by their legislative sizes. Government positions may also be
   estimated from their declarations, however. In a recent investigation,
   McDonald and Budge found that declared government policy better accords
   with the voter median than with the cabinet weighted mean, a finding
   they interpreted as consistent with their hypothesis that actual
   government policy tends to reflect a ``median mandate.{''} This
   investigation retests the McDonald-Budge model using a time-series
   cross-section methodology and an expanded data set. It finds no support
   for a median mandate interpretation but strong evidence that declared
   government positions respond to the positions of cabinet parties and,
   where present, external support parties. It also reveals a tendency for
   declared positions to be shifted to the right of the cabinet mean, a
   tendency that increases with the length of time that has elapsed since
   the last election (particularly for left-wing governments). This
   evidence that the policies governments set out to implement are
   systematically ``right shifted{''} bears major consequences for our
   understanding of representative democracy.},

Title = {Human rights do not make global democracy},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {10},
Number = {4},
Pages = {463-481},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {On most accounts of global democracy, human rights are ascribed a
   central function. Still, their conceptual role in global democracy is
   often unclear. Two recent attempts to remedy this deficiency have been
   made by James Bohman and Michael Goodhart. What is interesting about
   their proposals is that they make the case that under the present
   circumstances of politics, global democracy is best conceptualized in
   terms of human rights. Although the article is sympathetic to this
   `human rights approach', it defends the thesis that human rights are not
   enough for global democracy. It argues that insofar as we hold on to the
   general idea of democracy as a normative ideal of self-determination
   (self-rule) that is, of people determining their own lives and ruling
   over themselves, the concept of democracy accommodates two necessary
   conditions, namely, political bindingness and political equality.
   Further, it argues that neither Bohman's nor Goodhart's accounts
   fulfills these conditions and that one explanation for this could be
   traced to a lack of clarity concerning the distinction between democracy
   as normative ideal and democracy as decision method or rules (for
   example, institutions, laws and norms) for regulating social
   interactions. This ambiguity has implications for both Goodhart and
   Bohman. In Goodhart's work it manifests itself as a vagueness concerning
   the difference between political agency and democratic agency; in
   Bohman's work it becomes unclear whether he contributes a normative
   democratic theory or a theory of democratization. Although this article
   develops both a conceptual and a normative argument against their
   proposals, the aim is not to find fault with them but to point to
   questions that are in need of further elaboration to make them more
   convincing. Contemporary Political Theory (2011) 10, 463-481.

Abstract = {Even when the stakes of party-building are high, political parties often
   find their members divided over a key policy position. In
   post-Reconstruction America, the hot-button issue of excluding Chinese
   immigrant workers strengthened Democratic cohesion while splitting the
   `party of Lincoln'. Previous research has not completely investigated
   the role of party competition and cohesiveness in paving the way for
   passage of the Chinese exclusion laws. In this investigation of the
   legislative politics of banning the Chinese from 1879 to 1882, it is
   found that cross-pressured members sometimes facilitate party
   transformation. The evidence demonstrates that partisan responses to
   potential wedge issues are a previously unnoticed source of explanation
   of eventual party position changes.},

Abstract = {Class is an important concept in studying the political economy of
   indigeneity. This paper looks at the role of women shopkeepers in Sediq
   and Truku indigenous communities in Taiwan from a perspective of Marxian
   class analysis. By creating and controlling social and political space
   in their shops, they become key players in local political struggles
   that reinforce a bipolar class structure composed of a small elite class
   and a vast lumpenproletariat. In some cases, they may even be able to
   launch themselves or family members into positions of political power.
   This phenomenon is an integral part of the capitalist system that
   expropriates indigenous land, labour and natural resources. In fact, the
   creation of new elites in previously egalitarian societies makes such
   expropriation possible in the first place.},

Abstract = {While the president's relationship to Congress has been carefully
   studied, the broader executive branch has received far less attention in
   that context. Scholars rely on assumptions about the relationship
   between the president and cabinet departments that remain untested. We
   construct the first statistical portrait of executive branch ideology by
   estimating ideal points for members of Congress, presidents, and the
   heads of cabinet-level departments between 1991 and 2004 in a Bayesian
   framework. We empirically assess claims about the composition of the
   president's administrative team and the influence of institutions on the
   ideology of principal executive decision makers. We also test an
   important claim regarding the trade-off between ideological congruence
   and budgetary authority to demonstrate the utility of our estimates for
   other scholars. Our analysis reveals a new picture of the executive
   branch as ideologically diverse, casting into doubt some essential
   assumptions in a substantial body of work on the separation of powers.},

Abstract = {Large literatures in political theory and political economy argue that
   private property regimes help support liberal electoral regimes by
   constraining majoritarian politics, lowering the stakes of elections,
   and protecting ``fundamental{''} or minority rights. This article probes
   implications of this argument for elections in sub-Saharan Africa, a
   mostly rural continent where only about 2\% to 10\% of all rural
   property (by country) is held under private title. Do Africa's rural
   property regimes shape electoral dynamics and, if so, which ones, and
   how? This article examines the case of Kenya, focusing on 1991-1992
   electoral dynamics in rural zones in which the state itself has
   exercised direct prerogative over land allocation. We show that in these
   zones, politicians manipulated land rights to mobilize supporters and
   punish opponents. They did so in ways that contributed directly to
   widespread land-related violence at election time. References to other
   African cases help generalize and set scope conditions on the argument.},

Abstract = {Previous analysis finds that people respond differently to
   ``financial{''} (e.g., tax evasion) and ``moral{''} (e.g., sexual
   misconduct) political scandals. However, experimental and observational
   studies tend to reach different conclusions about which type of scandal
   induces a stronger negative reaction from the public. We use an
   experiment embedded in a national survey to examine the possibility that
   these divergent findings can, in part, be explained by a failure to
   consider the effects of abuses of power. Consistent with previous
   experimental work, we find that people respond more negatively to
   financial scandals than to moral scandals when they do not involve
   abuses of power. However, abuses of power substantially affect responses
   to both types of scandals. We also find that moral and financial
   scandals affect personal and job evaluations of a politician
   differently. These findings support our contention that to understand
   public responses to scandal, it is crucial to consider the relationship
   between the scandalous behavior and the official's formal
   responsibilities.},

Abstract = {The British Conservative party during 1997-2005 appeared to support the
   view that parties react to defeat by energizing their core vote base.
   Using a series of spatial and salience-based definitions of the core
   vote, combined with elite interviews with William Hague, lain Duncan
   Smith and Michael Howard, the three Conservative leaders between 1997
   and 2005, empirical evidence in support and also refutation of the core
   vote critique is evaluated here. The analyses suggest that Conservative
   issue strategies between 1997 and 2005 were chosen on grounds of spatial
   proximity and public perceptions of issue ownership, and that an appeal
   to Conservative voters was consistent with a broader appeal. The
   implications of this evidence are important for conceptualizing and
   applying party base explanations in Britain and beyond.},

Abstract = {Olivier Grenouilleau, ``Utility{''} of slavery. Comparative prospects
   Slavery is compared here with six other modes of human exploitation:
   community constraints, forced labour, clientele, indentured labour,
   peonage, wage-earning. It is a question of measuring so its relative
   ``utility{''} for elites having been in situation to take advantage of
   it. As a result, slavery seems to be a mixed system, on one side more
   polymorphous than systems like community constraints or indentured
   labour, but, on the other hand, less flexible than wage-earning; even if
   convergences appear to be able to come out with the last one.},

Abstract = {Post-Soviet Central Asian states' political systems characterized with a
   high level of authoritarian rule, corruption and nepotism. Kyrgyzstan,
   by mid 2010, reformed her political structure and accepted parliamentary
   system as the first country in her region. Since prevalence and the
   future of presidents' power in the region involve back-room negotiations
   amongst the existing elite from various sectors and regions we need to
   ask ourselves who constitute the elite and what is the basis for their
   political power? This article aims at exploring the dynamics of
   political power base by contrasting the two contexts: Kyrgyz
   Parliamentarian and Uzbek presidential systems.},

Abstract = {Existing research has focused primarily on the extent to which close
   elections affect turnout. While turnout is important, campaigns can also
   serve a social function by cultivating cognitive engagement. This
   article thus focuses on the extent to which close elections stimulate
   cognitive engagement among citizens. Observational data analysis
   suggests that close elections have a positive effect on cognitive
   engagement in senate campaigns. Experimental data analysis suggests that
   when close-election reminders appear in campaign discourse, citizens
   respond with greater cognitive engagement, as measured by a
   cognitive-response task and an information-seeking task. When reminded
   that a race is close, subjects think more about the candidates. They
   also seek more issue-based information, less group-based information,
   and read more about the election. Altogether, the results demonstrate
   that close elections increase citizen engagement.},

Abstract = {Analysis of the state-building process in modern Europe rests upon the
   traditional assumption that monarchs were the central driving force
   behind the consolidation of power in the form of a centralized state.
   However, an alternative state-society account challenges the supposition
   that monarchs were always the centralizing group in early modern
   society. The formation of the modern European state was ultimately
   shaped by the state-building strategies adopted by societal elites who
   possessed certain forms of social power. This alternative understanding
   of the state-building process helps explain the puzzling developments
   surrounding the successful rise of Brandenburg-Prussia and the collapse
   of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth during the early modern period.},

Abstract = {Increase in number of immigrants in Iceland calls for a review on
   structure, manage ment and outcomes of maternity services. Limited
   research exists in Iceland on immigrants' issues in relation to health
   services. Research from abroad show that childbirth experiences of
   foreign women indicate lack of concern for cultural background linked to
   equity issues of administration laws. The purpose of the research was to
   gain insight into immigrants cultural views, customs and perceptions of
   childbirth experiences of maternity services. The aim was to gather
   knowledge for development of culturally competent childbirth care for
   foreign women in Iceland. Cultural competence and servant leadership
   were used for conceptual background in this qualitative research with
   interviews with seven foreign women before and after childbirth in
   Iceland.
   Three themes were identified related to the women's needs, perceptions
   and experience of childbirth services in Iceland: Lack of social
   support, Care providers' manner, communication and trust and Information
   provided and conflicts with the system of care. The themes refer to
   diverse experiences and communication with care providers. Findings
   showed satisfaction with care providers' manner but indicated need for
   improvement in terms of education and information provided, formal
   communication services and support around childbirth. Emphasis should be
   on health literacy and empowering communication with the women.
   Continuous midwifery care and servant leadership seems to be relevant
   and provide potentials to ensure culturally competent maternal-child
   health service. Findings are consistent with prior research and provide
   knowledge for improving maternity services, based on multidisciplinary
   perspectives in health and welfare services.},

Abstract = {NATO, with its array of hard, soft, and smart power assets possesses a
   huge potential for peace, security, and stability. This potential
   assumes additional significance in the context of widening national
   upheavals across many countries in the world, often entailing ethnic,
   sectarian, and tribal conflicts. CHP wants to see NATO as an alliance
   that provides equal benefits to its members. CHP also believes that all
   future interventions by NATO must be firmly based on international law
   and should rest on an explicit mandate from the UN Security Council.
   CHP's supportive views on NATO are in coherence with its outlook on
   Turkey as a member of the Euro- Atlantic family. NATO must remain strong
   and vibrant for the sake of international peace, security, and
   stability.},

Abstract = {This study examines how instrumental and symbolic messages embedded in
   state law shape the practices of ``street-level{''} bureaucrats.
   Specifically, we investigate whether passage of state-level English Only
   laws influences the way English language learners are instructed in
   local public schools. Using data on state English Only laws from 1987 to
   2004 and school-level data from the National Center for Educational
   Statistics, we find that instrumental aspects of English Only laws serve
   to constrain, but not eliminate, schools'use of bilingual instruction,
   while those sending only symbolic messages are less constraining.
   Further, when state laws are vague in scope, adherence to the English
   Only law is dependent on the preferences of local actors, in this case
   Latino ``cultural brokers{''} working in the public school system.},

Abstract = {This article examines the shifting relationship between left-right
   ideology and anti-Americanism in France. Neo-Gaullist episodes such as
   French opposition to the invasion of Iraq in 2003 have only underscored
   the weakness of anti-Americanism on the French right, as this policy was
   least popular among the supporters of the center right UMP, and found
   more support on the left. This article traces the decline of right wing
   anti-Americanism in the French public, and the increasing alignment of
   anti-American attitudes with the left end of the leftright ideological
   dimension. This development is placed in the context of the increasing
   emphasis on neoliberal economic policy on the post-Gaullist right, and
   the use of the United States as a model for neoliberal economic policy.},

Abstract = {Interstate compacts are an increasingly important policy tool available
   to states, one that allows them to tackle regional and national issues.
   What effect does policy activity at the federal level have on state
   participation in interstate compacts? Drawing on theories of functional
   federalism, the authors explore the possibility that a state's response
   to federal activism varies across policy domains. For economic policy
   the authors hypothesize that federal activism causes an increase in
   compact participation, as states attempt to defend themselves against
   federal intrusion. In other policy areas the authors expect that states
   are more likely to enter into compacts during periods of relative
   federal inactivity. Results from a set of event-count models generally
   support these hypotheses. The study findings suggest that states may
   sometimes use interstate compacts as a mechanism to resist federal
   incursion but that this is just one facet of a more complex pattern of
   intergovernmental policy adjustment.},

Abstract = {The aim is to establish the basis to support the relevance of a more
   focused approach of the different viewpoints concerning Political
   History and Political Science as the clues for an interpretation of the
   2009-2010 electoral cycle in Uruguay. The changes in citizenship are
   particularly discussed as a critical factor for the process. The
   following topics are considered from an analytical perspective: (i) the
   importance of some electoral behaviours during the past biennium as part
   of a deep change in the citizenship model; (ii) the presentation of some
   ideas about the explanatory criteria and narrative guidelines regarding
   the behaviour of the Uruguayan electorate during the said period; (iii)
   the identification of some peculiarities and similarities of the
   Uruguayan case in relation to the current political Latin-American
   panorama; (iv) the pointing out of some important challenges that were
   met during the last electoral period in Uruguay facing the coming years.},

Abstract = {The Soviet leadership assessed the victory over Nazi Germany as proof of
   the superiority of its social order. Western researchers saw the reason
   for the Soviet population's readiness to make sacrifices in patriotism
   and a temporary political liberalisation. But even during the state of
   emergency in besieged Leningrad, there was no ``breathing spell{''}.
   Stalinist rule and the mechanisms of political and economic mobilisation
   remained in place. Even political repression continued.},

Abstract = {In the past decade, ASEAN has been the primary driver of East Asian
   regionalism, and Korea has been an active supporter of ASEAN plus Three.
   Korea has explored the idea of an East Asian Community, and has been
   relatively open to notions of Asia-Pacific regionalism. The ROK has
   involved itself comparatively heavily in regional projects as both an
   initiator and a participant, but its notion of `region' has oscillated
   between more and less inclusive forms of regionalism. This article
   examines how competing conceptions of region have influenced Korea's
   pursuit of regional initiatives. By revisiting historical understandings
   of Korea's regional identity, we explore the normative bases and
   material interests which motivate Korean regional initiatives, and
   assess the impact of its proposals.},

Abstract = {Party ideology plays an important role in determining which government
   coalitions form. Research on coalition formation tends to focus on the
   ideological distance between coalition parties. However, the
   distribution of preferences within the coalition, and the legislature,
   also has implications for which government coalition forms - that is, a
   party's willingness to join a coalition depends not only on its
   prospective coalition partners, but also on the alternative coalitions
   it could form. Several hypotheses about the effects of legislative
   polarisation are offered and tested using data on coalition formation in
   17 parliamentary democracies in the postwar period. This article also
   demonstrates how the traditional measure of ideological divisions within
   coalitions fails to capture certain aspects of ideological heterogeneity
   within the cabinet (and the opposition) and how Esteban and Ray's
   polarisation index helps in addressing these deficiencies.},

Abstract = {After being at the periphery for decades, India's proactive engagement
   with East and Southeast Asia has gradually transformed it into an active
   participant in Asian regional organizations and multilateral processes.
   This paper examines early Indian attempts at forging pan-Asian unity and
   assesses the motivations and impact of its Look East Policy. It
   evaluates India's changing role towards regional cooperation in South
   Asia and sub-regional groupings, the impact of domestic politics, and
   discusses how China has influenced Indian perceptions and strategy
   towards Asian regionalism. After a long gap, India is again contributing
   ideas on Asian integration and stresses that the broader East Asian
   integration process should remain open and inclusive.},

Abstract = {The Scottish Parliament was designed to break from the traditional
   Westminster model. Two major changes introduced in the Scottish
   Parliament were the use of the mixed-member proportional (MMP) system to
   elect representatives, and the creation of powerful legislative
   committees. This article links these two areas, by showing that there is
   a difference in the committee strategies of constituency MSPs and list
   MSPs, with list MSPs being more active on legislative committees than
   constituency MSPs. However, not all list MSPs follow the same strategy.
   As candidates are allowed to run for office both as a constituency
   candidate and as a member of the party list, I find that those list MSPs
   who ran for office exclusively on the party list are the most active
   committee members.},

Abstract = {This paper challenges the notion that voting games with purely
   instrumental players cannot account for high turnout (the `turnout
   paradox'). Although it has been known for over 25 years that such games
   can generate high-turnout equilibria, the said equilibria have been
   rejected on the grounds that they are fragile. This paper shows that
   this claim is incorrect because it is based on a computation of pivot
   probabilities that is not consistent with equilibrium analysis. Once the
   relevant computations are corrected, it becomes possible to obtain upper
   bounds on the cost of voting compatible with high-turnout equilibria
   showing that these equilibria are indeed quite robust. This paper
   concludes by extending the model to include continuous outcome
   functions, showing that while they preserve the high-turnout equilibria
   obtained before, they allow for better characterizations of the results.},

Abstract = {Ongoing changes in social structures, orientation, and value systems
   confront us with the growing necessity to address and understand
   transforming patterns of tolerance as well as specific aspects, such as
   social tolerance. Based on hierarchical analyses of the latest World
   Values Survey (2005-08) and national statistics for 28 countries, we
   assess both individual and contextual aspects that influence an
   individual's perception of different social groupings. Using a social
   tolerance index that captures personal attitudes toward these groupings,
   we present an institutional theory of social tolerance. Our results show
   that specific institutional qualities, which reduce status anxiety, such
   as inclusiveness, universality, and fairness, prevail over traditional
   socio-economic, societal, cultural, and democratic explanations.},

Abstract = {In this article I argue that elimination of exploitation at the firm
   level is necessary to eliminate exploitation, but is not sufficient, in
   and of itself, to support class justice. I distinguish exploitation as
   one of several aspects in the more inclusive category of class justice
   developed by George DeMartino. I then demonstrate that when the
   formation and distribution of value at the more complex level of Marx's
   analysis in volume 3 of Capital is considered, workers may collectively
   appropriate surplus value but nonetheless be subject to an unfair
   redistribution of labor time. I use the example of the Mondragon
   cooperatives to illustrate the type of institution needed to address the
   reallocation of labor and the class injustice it entails. I end by
   speculating on how the concept of value needs to be reconsidered when we
   move beyond thinking about market exchange as the primary means by which
   labor is allocated beyond capitalism.},

Abstract = {Karima Messaoudi, We not born Kahina, we will become
   In Algeria, of long dates, some women have the prerogatives that history
   granted to them, as the mythical Kahina. The question of the woman was
   in the focus of the political stakes of this country since the
   independence and constituted an object for numerous academic studies.
   Through an autobiographic narration, this article talks about the
   question of the woman's place. A question that should get our attention
   to see clearer and understand the struggle around this place in the
   patriarchal family.},

Abstract = {Denmark, Norway and Sweden are still among the most corporatist
   democracies in the world. Although corporatism has declined in
   Scandinavia over the last decades, it still exists, albeit at a lower
   level. Based on comparative and longitudinal data, we argue that this is
   a consequence of the disruption of some of the prerequisites to
   corporatist exchange. Neither governments nor the relevant interest
   groups in Scandinavia control what their exchange partner desires to the
   same extent as they did during the heyday of corporatism. Despite the
   involvement of different factors in the three countries, the main
   pattern is the same. Consequently, the character of state-interest group
   relations in Scandinavia is not as distinctive as it used to be.},

Abstract = {Political scientists are increasingly exploring the psychological
   underpinnings of voting behavior using field experimental techniques.
   Research in psychology demonstrates that gratitude expression reinforces
   prosocial behavior. This article reports the results of the three
   randomized field experiments designed to investigate the impact of
   gratitude expression on voter turnout. The experiments were conducted in
   a range of electoral settings, and the results suggest thanking voters
   for voting in a previous election boosts participation levels in
   subsequent elections. Moreover, the gratitude expression effect I
   observe appears to be distinct from social pressure and is robust across
   subgroups of voters, including minorities and women, and both low- and
   high-propensity voters.},

Abstract = {This paper addresses exploitation in the context of commodity production
   by worker-controlled enterprises, arguing that cooperative/collective
   social relations within the firm don't suffice to guarantee absence of
   exploitation. Labor in worker-controlled enterprises is not formally
   subsumed to capital, but this doesn't preclude alternative forms of
   exploitative appropriation, including noncapitalist appropriation and
   other forms of capitalist appropriation beyond the ``capitalist mode of
   production'' and its formal subsumption of labor. Marx noted the
   possibility of ``capitalist exploitation without the capitalist mode of
   production,'' meaning workers empowered to direct their own labor
   process but enmeshed in financial relations allowing a formal but not a
   real capacity to (fully) appropriate their own surplus labor. Analysis
   should not assume that real appropriation follows automatically from the
   power to direct the labor process. Avoidance of exploitation in a
   commodity setting requires an institutional superstructure allowing
   collective determination of and consent to the basic ``rules'' for the
   market sphere.},

Abstract = {Various contemporary studies suggest a gathering structural political
   crisis in Vietnam, asserting that thorough political transformation is
   inevitable and that this may well lead to regime change. This article
   takes issue with such perspectives. Using an alternative approach that
   understands civil society as a particular mode of action and interaction
   and not as a fixed entity, the results of three case studies of the
   potential for shifts in functional areas of governance (legitimate rule,
   security, and welfare) show that civil society action from within the
   state apparatus effects changes in governance. Those processes of change
   were initiated more or less simultaneously from above and below. Such
   possibilities for political change open the way to a far wider
   discussion on the nature of political progress under nondemocratic
   regimes, which invites comparison not only with a range of contemporary
   experiences, but also the political histories of many Western countries.},
