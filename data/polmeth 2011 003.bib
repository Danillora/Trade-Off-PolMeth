Title = {Toward an Alternative Explanation for the Resource Curse: Natural
   Resources, Immigration, and Democratization},
Journal = {COMPARATIVE POLITICAL STUDIES},

Volume = {44},

Abstract = {Why do many resource-rich countries maintain autocratic political
   regimes? The authors' proposed answer focuses on the causal effect of
   labor imports, or immigration. Using the logic offered by Acemoglu and
   Robinson's democratization model, the authors posit that immigration
   makes democratization less likely because it facilitates redistributive
   concessions to appease the population within an autocratic regime. This
   immigration argument applies directly to the political resource curse
   since many resource-rich countries tend to also be labor scarce, leading
   them to import foreign laborers. Consistent with this understanding, the
   authors find a statistically significant negative relationship between
   net immigration per capita and democratization in future periods. Their
   results also show that when controlling for this immigration effect, the
   standard resource curse variables lose significance in a democratization
   model. This latter result suggests that much of the so-called resource
   curse stems not from resource endowments per se but rather from the
   labor imports related to resource production.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the emerging fault lines on the Left in France
   during the 1990s on the issue of neo-liberal globalization, in general,
   and on a proposal to tax financial transactions (Tobin tax) in
   particular. Faced with the new and growing influence of
   anti-globalization activists within the Left, the French Socialist Party
   (PS) initially tried to ignore them. When it could no longer do so, it
   attempted to marginalize them by showing that it was tough on
   neo-liberal globalization and that it could put in place concrete
   policies when it office. The article argues that neo-liberal
   globalization posed a particular challenge for the PS in that it forced
   to party to be seen to be taking a stance on an issue that it
   desperately sought to avoid. In essence, the challenge was for the PS to
   reform and to accept publicly neo-liberalism or to reject neo-liberalism
   and to renew with its radical past. The PS attempted to do both. The
   PS's ambiguous stance contributed to deepen emerging ideological fault
   lines on the Left and, ultimately, played a large part in discrediting
   the party and the government in the eyes of its very own supporters and
   sympathizers.},

Abstract = {Classical economic voting theory has received considerable empirical
   support. Voters reward the incumbent for good times, punish it for bad.
   But the success of this paradigm, which views the economy as strictly a
   valence issue, has crowded out testing of other theoretical dimensions.
   In particular, positional and patrimonial economic voting have hardly
   been examined. The former concerns the different preferences voters have
   on economic policy issues, such as progressive taxation. The latter
   concerns the place of voters in the economic structure itself, not
   merely as members of a social class but as actual property owners.
   Through analysis of a special battery of economic items, from a 2008 US
   presidential election survey, we demonstrate that the economy was
   important to voters in three ways: valence, position, and patrimony.
   Taken together, these dimensions go far as an explanation of vote
   choice, at least with respect to the short-term forces acting on this
   political behavior. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {For solving the existing difficulties in corporate income taxation, the
   European Commission proposed the introduction of measures for
   coordination, solution contested by some Member States but supported by
   most professionals and many organizations representing the interests of
   European employers. Disputes in connection with the introduction of the
   ``Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base{''} are determined by the
   uncertainty regarding its effects. Since corporate income tax has an
   important contribution in forming the central budget revenues, the
   ``Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base{''} is a challenge for Romanian
   public authorities. The Romanian government has not expressed until the
   moment a choice in this respect. In this paper we intend to take stock
   of the main points of view about the implications of introducing the
   common consolidated corporate tax base made by specialists and to
   estimate the effects of the EU formula apportionment on corporate tax
   revenues in Romania. For the particular conditions of 2008 we concluded
   that Romania would register an increase in tax revenue. Accumulating
   that advantage with the other benefits of the common consolidated
   corporate tax base we believe that the Romanian authorities should
   support the actions to coordinate the corporate income tax systems in
   the European Union.},

Volume = {32},

Abstract = {This study asserts that cohesionary - rather than diversionary - motives
   primarily influence the propensity of political leaders to use external
   force in international crises in times of domestic turmoil.
   Specifically, I contend that mass violence leads political leaders to
   engage in cohesionary tactics to achieve and maintain social order in
   their country for political survival. Employing random effects probit
   analyses with International Crisis Behavior (ICB) data for 139 countries
   from 1918 to 2005, I find that increased mass violence is more likely
   than other forms of domestic problems (be it an economic downturn or
   government instability) to instigate the external use of force during
   international crises. I also find that the impact of mass violence on
   the external use of force is contingent on ethno-religious heterogeneity
   and regime type.},

Abstract = {This article analyses coalition survival in eleven post-Communist,
   Central and Eastern European democracies. Survival analysis demonstrates
   that Communist Successor Parties (CSPs) are central to understanding
   government dissolution processes in post-communism. Coalitions spanning
   the `regime divide' between CSPs and parties not affiliated with the
   ancien regime last longer than governments that do not. Regime divide
   governments also are more likely to fall during periods of positive
   economic performance, while other governments fall during periods of
   negative economic performance. The reason lies in parties' incentives to
   prolong their regime divide coalition with the CSP, especially in the
   face of adverse conditions.},

Abstract = {In Poland, a decentralization of the country has taken place. There were
   administrative, political and economic reasons for this. At the moment,
   the further regionalisation of Poland is blocked. Despite enormous
   investments from Brussels and Warsaw, socio-economic disparities among
   the regions have worsened. The emergence of regional identities is
   sometimes met with rejection. However, for the country's development,
   there is no way around strengthening the regions.},

   integrated in the minds of Gdansk's citizens, and Gdansk in the
   conscious of Europe's. Gdansk has applied to be European Cultural
   Capital for 2016. Economic intertwining and financial subsidies are part
   of European integration. On many levels, Gdansk constitutes an integral
   part of Europe. Sometimes, however, Europe also serves to demonstrate

Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {105},
Number = {2},
Pages = {316-336},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Against the current consensus among comparative political economists, we
   argue that inequality matters for redistributive politics in advanced
   capitalist societies, but it is the structure of inequality, not the
   level of inequality, that matters. Our theory posits that middle-income
   voters will be inclined to ally with low-income voters and support
   redistributive policies when the distance between the middle and the
   poor is small relative to the distance between the middle and the rich.
   We test this proposition with data from 15 to 18 advanced democracies
   and find that both redistribution and nonelderly social spending
   increase as the dispersion of earnings in the upper half of the
   distribution increases relative to the dispersion of earnings in the
   lower half of the distribution. In addition, we present survey evidence
   on preferences for redistribution among middle-income voters that is
   consistent with our theory and regression results indicating that left
   parties are more likely to participate in government when the structure
   of inequality is characterized by skew.},

Abstract = {The political `centre' is often discussed in debates about public policy
   and analyses of party strategies and election outcomes. Yet, to date,
   there has been little effort to estimate the political centre outside
   the United States. This article outlines a method of estimating the
   political centre using public opinion data collected for the period
   between 1950 and 2005. It is demonstrated that it is possible to measure
   the centre in Britain, that it moves over time, that it shifts in
   response to government activity and, furthermore, that it has an
   observable association with general election outcomes.},

   The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, negotiated in great secret for

   Parliament by the end of the year. If we do not watch out, ACTA might
   indeed lastingly disturb our relation to the world in all sorts of areas
   (public and digital freedoms, access to medicine and to knowledge, food
   sovereignty, rights for small-and medium-sized companies to innovate,
   you name it). It will also redefine geopolitical relationships to the
   greater profit of a few major states and transnational companies.},

Abstract = {This article compares the U.S. and French-Revolutions in the last third
   of the 18th with independence and revolution in Spanish America at the
   beginning of the 19th century under a particular theoretical
   perspective. Focussing mainly on the initial stages of these
   revolutionary events it will be shown that: a) in all three cases the
   path towards a revolutionary break with the Old Regime was anything but
   predetermined and that b) particularly in the Americas the question of
   the Nation was not settled at all by the revolutionaries. This is one of
   the most important explanations why later onwards Nation -and
   State-building in the Americas, both in Latin America and in
   North-America, became anything but a smooth and linear process.},

Abstract = {It has been suggested that democratizing states are prone to civil wars.
   However, not all democratizing states experience domestic political
   violence. We argue that one of the key factors that ``shelters{''} some
   democratizing states from domestic political violence is the receipt of
   democracy aid. Democratizing states that receive high levels of
   democracy assistance are less likely to experience civil conflict than
   countries that receive little or no external democracy assistance.
   During democratic transitions, the central authority weakens and
   uncertainty about future political commitments and promises among
   domestic groups increases. Democracy aid decreases the risk of conflict
   by reducing commitment problems and uncertainty. Using an instrumental
   variables approach that accounts for potential endogeneity problems in
   aid allocation, we find empirical support for our argument. We conclude
   that there is a potential path to democracy that ameliorates the perils
   of democratization, and democracy assistance programs can play a
   significant positive role in this process.},

Title = {When Ballot Issues Matter: Social Issue Ballot Measures and Their Impact
   on Turnout},
Journal = {POLITICAL BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {33},
Number = {1},
Pages = {3-25},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Evidence for whether direct democracy positively affects turnout is
   mixed, which can be attributed to a theoretical ambiguity about the
   proper way to measure the institution. The most common measure, a count
   of the number of initiatives on the ballot, is incomplete, because it
   unrealistically assumes that all propositions have an equal impact on
   turnout and focuses exclusively on initiatives. These deficiencies are
   addressed by looking at the issue content of all ballot measures. I find
   that the number of social issues on the ballot, because they are highly
   salient, tap into existing social cleavages, help to overcome barriers
   to voting, and fit within a framework of expressive choice, had a
   positive impact on turnout for all midterm and some presidential
   elections since 1992. In contrast to previous findings, however, the
   total number of propositions on the ballot was rarely associated with an
   increase in turnout. I discuss the implications of these findings in the
   conclusion.},

Abstract = {Both interest-group and public-policy scholars accept that groups are
   important to policy formulation and implementation because they hold
   valuable capacities. However, the literature has not dealt with whether,
   and how, groups develop capacities. In this article, we examine the
   question of group capacity development by focusing on the adaption of
   specific groups to evolving policy contexts. Taking the example of
   organic farm policy we look at the impact that divergent policy
   strategies aimed at growing this infant industry sector have had on the
   way related industry groups have evolved in four countries. This
   comparative study supports our argument that policy strategy is one key
   force in shaping the capacities that groups develop over time.},

Abstract = {This paper examines whether particular subjective features are better
   suited than objective feature, to study the ability of the Nordic EU
   member states to have a say within the environmental policy of the EU.
   The Nordic states will be placed within a conceptual framework intended
   to explain states' ability to exercise influence internationally. The
   paper will argue that traditional quantitative measures normally
   defining size of states, such as the population, territorial size, GDP
   and military strength, do not give a clear picture of their influence
   within the EU. The paper argues that subjective features, which are
   concerned with how various domestic and external actors regard the
   Nordic states in environmental matters, have enabled the Nordic states
   to punch above their weight in EU environmental policy-making. Also, it
   is maintained here that features such as Nordic politicians' ambitions
   and prioritizations and their ideas about EU decision-making processes
   may indicate their states' ability to influence within the Union.
   Furthermore, we claim that states' administrative competence and the
   degree of domestic cohesion, combined with the degree to which the state
   maintains an external united front are important indicators of their
   success in the EU.},

Abstract = {Ballot questions often feature obscure and legalistic language that is
   difficult to comprehend. Because the language of ballot questions is
   often unclear, the authors hypothesize that questions with lower
   readability will have higher roll-off because voters will not answer
   questions they do not understand. The authors use an objective measure
   of readability to code readability scores for 1,211 state-level ballot
   questions from 1997 to 2007. Using hierarchical linear regression models
   of state-level data, the authors find that increased complexity leads to
   more roll-off. The authors further analyze some possible influences on
   readability by examining whether it is affected by the question topic.},

Title = {The Politics of Requesting Appointments: Congressional Requests in the

Journal = {POLITICAL RESEARCH QUARTERLY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {64},
Number = {1},
Pages = {31-44},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {There is persistent debate about who most influences the federal
   appointment process, especially whether the executive branch staffs the
   federal bureaucracy with individuals loyal to the White House or relies
   on the process as an accommodation to important political players,
   especially members of Congress. Yet, people still know little about the
   role members of Congress play in the process of shaping the
   prenomination environment. In this article, the authors address this
   debate by using unique archival data from the Dwight Eisenhower and
   Gerald Ford Presidential Libraries to identify which legislators
   contacted the president about a specific nomination or appointment
   request and under what conditions these requests were successful. The
   authors find that legislator resources, Senate membership, and those
   closer ideologically to the president are related both to the number of
   requests made and to the number of successful appointment or nomination
   requests granted. The results suggest that the president relies on
   members of Congress for credible information about staffing
   administrative positions, but they appoint or nominate individuals that
   are in their own interest, not necessarily to accommodate Congress.},

Abstract = {Work ethic, a concept related to favourable values and attitudes towards
   working, is under the effect of social culture. While the cultural
   characteristics of some societies are shaped by the idea that working is
   sufficient and vital for success, this may be just the contrary for some
   others. In the societies in which the belief that hardworking brings the
   success is comparatively weak, it may be highly expected that success
   need some other social institutions, family relationships, luck, a
   divine hand and so on. The individual may also think that however hard
   he works, he can not achieve his goals. In this situation, it can be
   told that work ethic from both social and cultural aspects is low or
   insufficient. So in this context, the work ethic literature and culture
   in our country have been tried to analyse together. This work can be
   regarded as a reference work.},

Abstract = {The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) is a preeminent separatist
   organization fighting for an independent and sovereign Tamil state in
   the northern and eastern regions of Sri Lanka. LTTE women's involvement
   in the leadership and fighting forces of the group has given rise to
   fierce debates about whether the visibility of females in the LTTE
   fighting forces represented the `true' liberation of the Tamil women and
   whether women would enjoy equal rights in the public during the
   post-conflict period. Actually, the Tamil Eelam is the overarching goal
   of the LTTE, and the emancipation of women has always been a secondary
   issue dependent on the liberation struggle. All the existing literature
   illustrates that the LTTE has been unsuccessful in creating the gender
   equality within the movement, and suggests that women have the right to
   achieve their emancipation and empowerment without linking to interests
   of the nationalist and ethnic struggles.},

Abstract = {Elections are now a common feature of countries across regime types, yet
   we know little about what leads people to perceive an election as fair,
   or how the democratic context shapes the ingredients of fairness
   judgments. While the conduct of a process is most important for
   perceptions of fairness in established democracies, ``procedural
   fairness{''} may not travel to non-democracies, where economic outcomes
   occasionally take precedence over procedure. Additionally, individual
   level characteristics, such as political engagement, may also shape how
   people view the fairness of elections. Using original experiments
   conducted in the United States and China, I find procedural
   considerations are most important for fairness judgments, across
   democratic contexts and largely independent of political engagement.},

Abstract = {In the aftermath of a potentially demoralizing 2008 electoral defeat,
   when the Republican Party seemed widely discredited, the emergence of
   the Tea Party provided conservative activists with a new identity funded
   by Republican business elites and reinforced by a network of
   conservative media sources. Untethered from recent GOP baggage and
   policy specifics, the Tea Party energized disgruntled white middle-class
   conservatives and garnered widespread attention, despite stagnant or
   declining favorability ratings among the general public. As participant
   observation and interviews with Massachusetts activists reveal, Tea
   Partiers are not monolithically hostile toward government; they
   distinguish between programs perceived as going to hard-working
   contributors to US society like themselves and ``handouts{''} perceived
   as going to unworthy or freeloading people. During 2010, Tea Party
   activism reshaped many GOP primaries and enhanced voter turnout, but
   achieved a mixed record in the November general election. Activism may
   well continue to influence dynamics in Congress and GOP presidential
   primaries. Even if the Tea Party eventually subsides, it has undercut
   Obama's presidency, revitalized conservatism, and pulled the national
   Republican Party toward the far right.},

Abstract = {The media and public responses to the expenses scandal of 2009
   demonstrated the enduring importance of standards of conduct in British
   public life. This article addresses some basic questions concerning
   citizens' attitudes towards political wrongdoing, including how much
   notice people actually take of politicians' misbehaviour, how much
   importance citizens attach to politicians' integrity and how big a
   problem in politics political misconduct is thought to be. Drawing on
   responses to a representative survey of the British public, this article
   finds that most people do take some notice of scandals, and that most
   people, when forced to choose, prize honesty in their politicians over
   competence. It also finds that these factors influence how big a problem
   certain types of behaviour are perceived to be.},

Title = {The political importance of labelling: terrorism and Turkey's discourse
   on the PKK},
Journal = {CRITICAL STUDIES ON TERRORISM},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {4},
Number = {2},
Pages = {163-180},
Abstract = {Labelling the `other' is one of the most relevant aspects in an armed
   conflict context. Summarising what the opponent is in one single
   expression is a strong rhetorical tool in any belligerent discourse. The
   use of the `terrorist' label assumes a particularly powerful role in
   such a construction. Employing Ole W ae ver's layered discursive
   structure, this article aims to study the discursive practices and
   political consequences associated with the use of such labels. The
   political implications of using the `terrorist' label in regards to the
   Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) in Turkish politics will be analysed as
   an illustrative case study. The period under analysis extends from April
   2007 to January 2008, corresponding to the escalation of a security
   discourse that led to the (brief) Turkish military incursion in northern
   Iraq in the winter of 2007-2008. The political exposure and intense
   usage of the `terrorist' label in this period makes it particularly ripe
   for understanding the political discursive context that shapes Turkey's
   policies towards this protracted conflict. The focus on this period also
   sheds light on the political reasons underlying the intractability of
   this conflict.},

Journal = {REGIONAL AND FEDERAL STUDIES},

Volume = {21},
Number = {4-5, SI},
Pages = {447-477},
Abstract = {Studies of constitutional reforms so far have equated formal
   ratification with a successful reform. The paper goes beyond this narrow
   focus by adding substantive success as a second dimension based on two
   indicators: degree of agenda fulfilment and degree to which the reform
   contributes to solve the constitutional problem. Analysing territorial
   reforms in unitary or federal states, we distinguish two types of
   problems-group and efficiency problems. The comparative analysis of
   formal and substantive success demonstrates that first, reforms can be
   at least partly successful in terms of substance, although they may have
   failed formally; second, fulfilling the reform agenda seems to be a
   necessary but not a sufficient condition for solving the constitutional
   problem at stake; third, cases with group problems score higher on both
   indicators, thus being more successful than cases with efficiency
   problems. Furthermore, the characteristics of the two most successful
   cases suggest that opportunities for participation, open dialogue and
   consensus building play an important role in explaining the results.},

Title = {Measuring Legislative Input on Presidential Agendas (Argentina,
   1999-2007)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS IN LATIN AMERICA},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {3},
Number = {3},
Pages = {127-150},
Abstract = {Presidential agenda success is usually accounted for through measures of
   interbranch cooperation, such as bill approval rates, participation
   rates, and roll-call data of support from presidential initiatives.
   These measures do not provide an accurate picture of presidential agenda
   success because they cannot capture the ability of presidents or
   Congress to shape the substance of legislation. To overcome this
   limitation, this paper proposes a combination of two measures of
   influence on legislative outcomes: the Legislative Input Score for
   partisan involvement in lawmaking, and the Barrett and Eshbaugh-Soha
   Scale for legislative substance. To illustrate the potential of these
   measures, it puts them to work in analyzing the ability of presidents to
   control the substance of their proposed legislation in Argentina between
   1999 and 2007. Preliminary results show that when agenda success is
   measured with these scores, presidents can consistently shape
   legislative substance regardless of popularity, coalition size, and
   honeymoon periods.},

Journal = {REGIONAL AND FEDERAL STUDIES},

Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Pages = {35-54},
Abstract = {The focus of this article is centralized types of federations that have
   been neglected both in the economic literature on federalism and in
   comparative federal studies. The starting point is that countries with
   centralized institutional solutions are subject to encroaching behaviour
   by the central government and are threatened with shifting further
   towards `overcentralization'. `Over-centralization' reduces federal
   member states to pure `agents' of central government. By comparing four
   federal countries subject to centralization trends (Australia, Austria,
   Germany and Switzerland) and combinations of causal factors, an attempt
   is made to ascertain why some federations are locked in
   `over-centralized' institutional solutions while others are able to ward
   off such an outcome.},

Abstract = {The influence of state architecture on gender policy and politics is an
   emergent strand of feminist research. This paper contributes to this
   research by undertaking a detailed case study of one specific gender
   policy area domestic violence policy - in old federation Australia.
   Drawing on the experiences of the past decade, it confirms earlier
   research findings that demonstrate that under certain conditions,
   federal structures can influence the development of gender policy in
   positive ways, such as providing opportunities for `venue shopping' and
   policy innovation. The paper engages, too, with recent research on
   Australian federalism and challenges the consensus about the centralised
   nature of the Australian federal system by demonstrating that in the
   area of gender policy, states and territories are more than just the
   implementation arms of the Commonwealth government. Sub-national
   governments continue to play an important and autonomous role in policy
   relating to women and therefore remain central sites for advancing
   gender equality.},

Title = {All the shades of red: examining the radical left's Euroscepticism},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {17},
Number = {3},
Pages = {299-320},
Abstract = {This paper seeks to apply the relevance of Euroscepticism literature to
   the study of radical left party outlooks on European integration and by
   doing so: (1) outlines general patterns of opposition to European
   integration, by 11 radical left parties that are housed in the European
   United Left/Nordic Green Left group of the European Parliament, in the
   1990s and beyond; (2) assesses the congruence between the outlooks of
   these parties or the lack thereof; and (3) illuminates the factors
   conditioning these outlooks by addressing the ideology-strategy debate.
   To this end, the paper employs two, widely referenced and historically
   relevant, analytical frameworks of party-based Euroscepticism (by Paul
   Taggart and Aleks Szczerbiak, and by Petr Kopecky and Cas Mudde), and
   applies them to the radical left as a whole and its various sub-sets, as
   identified by the literature so far. The analysis leads to the following
   three findings. First, a moderating approach can be observed on average,
   thus leading to an increase in overall congruence. Second, congruence
   increases slightly, as we move towards a more specific typology but
   overall no systematic congruence is to be found in the radical left as a
   whole or most of its sub-sets, in the period examined. Third, while
   ideology carries causal weight, strategy appears more prominent as a
   conditioning factor of outlooks.},

Abstract = {Even after the Lisbon Treaty, the rotating Presidency of the Council is
   still considered as a political opportunity to be seized by member
   states as a tool to prove their level of European integration in terms
   of administrative capacity and efficiency. As a result, the member state
   concerned by this exercise often makes a demonstrative effort at both
   national and international levels. With a view to better preparing for
   Presidency, member states often choose to implement targeted training
   programs, and sometimes a 3-months to one-year intensive training
   program. The main objective of these programs is usually to strengthen
   the administrative capacity of the officials in charge of European
   affairs by transferring know-how and good practices. Another overall
   purpose of these programs is to bring to the foreground a common
   administrative culture. The complexity of the missions incumbent upon
   the member state exercising the presidency, justifies this effort in
   training and transfer of expertise. It also makes the use of this
   ``Presidency momentum{''} as an instrument of legitimization in relation
   to national and European public opinion.},

Abstract = {Comparative studies of electoral institutions have marginalized or
   ignored a fundamental characteristic of electoral systems called
   malapportionment. This paper presents a brief introduction to the issue
   of malapportionment from the theoretical (and comparative) perspective
   suggested earlier by Samuels and Snyder and then applies it - along with
   the issue of the value of a vote - to the Municipal Council of the
   Capital City of Prague electoral system, especially in the context of
   the October 2010 elections and previous changes to the electoral system.
   The analysis of malapportionment and the value of a vote shows that the
   new electoral rules present some problems with respect to the ``one
   vote, one value{''} principle but, on the other hand, that these rules
   conform with, and are comparable to electoral systems used worldwide.
   This conclusion supports the Czech Constitutional Court's decision not
   to annul the 2010 Municipal Council elections.},

Volume = {23},
Number = {1-2, SI},
Pages = {1-27},
Abstract = {In the wake of the financial crisis of 2008, many economists have blamed
   economics for having failed to warn us. Paul Krugman, for example, in a
   well-known New York Times Magazine article, suggests that Classical
   economists were blinded by the beauty of mathematics, and that Keynesian
   economics is the path of the future. This paper argues that the
   evolution of economic thinking is much more nuanced than Krugman
   portrays it, and that instead of embracing what has become known as
   Keynesian economics, macroeconomists should rather re-embrace the
   broader Classical economic tradition, of which Keynes was an important
   part.},

Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {15},
Number = {8, SI},
Pages = {993-1009},
Abstract = {What happens to notions of national belonging in the US when non-citizen
   immigrants claim the right to vote at the local level for school boards
   and city councils? Is this a fundamental challenge to US citizenship
   norms, or an extension of the force of liberal discipline onto new
   citizen-subjects-in-formation? While academic literature has focused on
   historical, legal and normative ethical arguments about non-citizen
   voting, this article focuses on the vernaculars of citizenship
   discourses advocates and opponents invoke in order to win over local and
   state officials to their cause and how they both integrate and challenge
   official responses to their claims. Such attention to particularities is
   necessary to appreciate the ways in which citizenship practice is
   contingent on local political culture and history but also potentially
   transformative of larger institutions and discussions over national
   membership. Advocates put into practice arguments from the academic
   literature and borrowed through trans-local exchanges of information
   amongst advocates, tailored to suit local political culture and
   traditions. They simultaneously invoke and undermine notions of scales
   and levels of citizenship that would disaggregate local discourse from
   national politics and policies. Attention to the particular dynamics and
   challenges these actors face in their political work reveals both the
   utility and limitations of political theory for understanding the issue
   of non-citizen voting in the US as a particular example of citizenship
   as practice.},

Pages = {185-203},
Abstract = {The Canadian political career structure has undergone recent and
   dramatic change. The merger of two right of centre political parties and
   the blurring of ideological lines between parties has noticeably
   increased the number of elected officials who switch political parties
   between elections. At the same time, the uneven fortunes of Canada's
   political parties across the country and within provinces has resulted
   in a patch work of career structures. There is no single or dominant
   career pattern in Canada. Instead there is as much movement from Ottawa
   to the provinces as there is from the sub-national level to the federal
   assembly. Given Canada's fractured party system, this arrangement seems
   likely to remain for some time.},

Abstract = {That women exhibit lower levels of political knowledge than men is a
   common and consistent finding in political science research. Recently,
   scholars have begun examining whether the content and structure of
   political knowledge measures contribute to women's perceived knowledge
   deficit. In an attempt to enter the debate on the explanations for
   gender differences in knowledge, I create and test a number of measures
   of gender-relevant political knowledge to determine whether broadening
   our definitions of what constitutes ``knowledge{''} may help us more
   clearly understand the apparent gender gap in political knowledge in the
   United States. The results indicate that expected gender differences
   disappear when respondents are asked about the levels of women's
   representation in the national government.},

Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},

Volume = {34},
Number = {2},
Pages = {346-361},
Abstract = {With its decision on the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty, the German
   Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) has handed over another landmark
   ruling on European integration. The ruling made Germany's ratification
   of the Treaty conditional upon the passage of a new law giving the
   Bundestag greater oversight of European affairs. This and the
   consequences of stronger parliamentary oversight for the German
   government and the way it conducts negotiations at European level have
   been the focus of most early comments on the decision. No less
   important, however, are the ruling's potential repercussions on European
   judicial politics. Coming after a series of highly controversial
   judgments by the European Court of Justice, the FCC's Lisbon decision is
   clearly meant as a warning to Brussels and, above all, Luxembourg. The
   decision could undermine the Court of Justice's authority and encourage
   non-compliance on the part of national courts, thus bringing about a
   constitutional crisis at European level. Alternatively, the decision may
   compel the Court of Justice to reconsider some of the most controversial
   aspects of its activist jurisprudence and to exert more restraint in the
   foreseeable future.},

Pages = {41+},
Abstract = {The crisis of the world economy of the 2000-s has again made topical the
   question of regularity of crisis epochs under capitalism. In the course
   of answering it, the author discloses methodological faults of the
   neoclassical school of economic science, dominant in modern world, and
   advances the methodological approaches, that reveal systemic foundations
   of capitalism. The author analyses the evolution of the world economy in
   the age of globalization, when the processes in the world economy began
   to prevail over the ones in the peoples' economies and when the
   financial sector acquired autonomy and, moreover, domination over the
   real one. These processes, in the author's opinion, have preconditioned
   the inevitability of today's global crisis, which is, thus, naturally
   determined by its character. The author considers the institutional
   nature of our country's capital and depicts on this basis the model of
   the economic and social system that has been formed in post-Soviet
   Russia.},

Abstract = {As a result of the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the bombings in Madrid and
   London, a prevention-focused counter-terrorism approach has developed
   across the European Union. Preventive counter-terrorism is appealing
   because it implies interventions that remove the ability or, better
   still, the motivation of potential terrorists to carry out their lethal
   designs. Member states such as the United Kingdom and the Netherlands
   that primarily have experience in addressing `home-grown' terrorism,
   have developed preventive counter-terrorism measures in response. Even
   though the majority of these laws, regulations and policies recognize
   the importance of the rule of law and human rights, it remains relevant
   to examine whether in theory and in practice particular measures have
   had disproportionate effects on ethnic and religious minorities and
   thereby violate non-discrimination standards.},

Journal = {CONTEMPORARY POLITICS},

Pages = {167-183},
Abstract = {In his 2009 report on the world financial and economic crisis and its
   impact on development, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon expressed
   concerns about a range of direct and indirect impacts on the
   environment. Those concerns included the impact of a slow-down in
   investment in environmentally sustainable technologies, as well as the
   impact of stimulus packages that relied on poorly planned infrastructure
   and resource development. They included worries about whether higher
   levels of unemployment would result in greater and unsustainable use of
   subsistence resources. Against the backdrop of these concerns, this
   article examines the impact of both the 1997 Asian financial crisis and
   the current global financial crisis on environmental sustainability in
   East Asia. It shows that both crises generated similar patterns of
   environmental impact, but that those impacts were at times
   counter-intuitive and ambiguous. Positive impacts were short-lived and
   negative impacts were little affected in the longer term.},

Abstract = {The economic crisis that Spain has been facing since two years ago is
   showing significant effects in the way citizens are dealing with
   consumption. Beyond decreases in the sales, there is a rising anxiety
   about the sustainability of the current consumption patterns as well as
   a concern related to new tendencies towards responsible consumption
   which face new challenges and opportunities. The paper we are presenting
   here is based on an empirical research project whose main goal has been
   to map necessities and consumption practices in Spain, trying to assess
   the impact of the crisis. To do so, our perspective has been to deepen
   into these complexities from the discursive side, in a qualitative
   sociological research whose methodology has been based on focus groups.
   In this work, we will discuss the analysis of the results focusing on
   the relationship between the act of consumption and a certain set of
   imposed limits that, in the pre-crisis moment - and according to the
   focus group participants-, have been surpassed. This has helped to
   develop a peculiar discourse on consumption whose main axis is guilt.},

Journal = {IRISH POLITICAL STUDIES},

Volume = {26},

Pages = {535-544},
Abstract = {Political parties are central to democracy, but according to some
   arguments their capacity to discharge their functions is weakening in
   many countries. Moreover, the institution of the referendum is sometimes
   perceived to pose particular problems for political parties, impinging
   on their centrality in political life and on their internal cohesion.
   Ireland is one of Europe's heaviest users of the referendum, so in that
   light it may be expected that parties in Ireland are weaker than those
   in most other countries. Consideration of the available evidence
   produces a mixed picture, however, with Irish parties conforming to
   expected trends in some respects but not in others.},

   interact with their political environments. This research examines how
   individual-level variations in broad, stable psychological
   characteristics affect individual-level political outcomes. In this
   article, we review recent work that uses the Big Five to predict
   political attitudes and behavior. We also replicate some of these
   analyses using new data to examine the possibility that prior findings
   stem from sampling error or unique political contexts. Finally, we
   discuss several of the challenges faced by scholars who are currently
   pursuing or are interested in pursuing this line of inquiry. These
   challenges include refining theoretical explanations of how the Big Five
   shape political outcomes, addressing important measurement concerns, and
   resolving inconsistencies across studies.},

Abstract = {Opening a new phase in historical institutionalism, Wolfgang Streeck and
   Kathleen Thelen show how a rigid dichotomy between incremental
   adaptation and radical transformation fails to capture important
   transformative processes common to advanced political economies. While
   their research focuses on gradual but radical transformation, the two
   authors leave open the interpretation of what constitutes abrupt, but
   only limited change. This article integrates their framework, defines
   what they call survival and return, and, within this genus, indicates
   two analytically distinct species: replication, where the old logic
   survives due to the redundancy of the new institutional arrangement; and
   reaction, where structural reforms generate demand for the old incentive
   structures, which are ultimately reintroduced. To elucidate the
   concepts, recent Croatian, Hungarian and Polish pension reforms are
   compared and their institutional instability analysed.},

Abstract = {This review critically evaluates the largely consensual view that wars
   naturally and reflexively augment presidential power. After summarizing
   the key arguments advanced by presidency scholars in the aftermath of
   World War H, this article canvasses the existing empirical basis for
   their claims and the theoretical microfoundations upon which they are
   offered. Both appear wanting. Few systematic studies yield unambiguous
   evidence that the adjoining branches of government reliably support
   elements of the president's domestic or foreign policy agendas during
   war that they otherwise would oppose. And no one, to date, has offered a
   clear theory explaining why either Congress or the courts would behave
   in this way. The article therefore calls for continued empirical
   research on the causal effects of war on presidential power, and for
   renewed investments in theories that might account for the ways in which
   war figures into congressional and judicial voting.},

Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {48},
Number = {2},
Pages = {277-293},
Abstract = {Since 1990s, healthcare services have suffered far- reaching changes and
   reforms that have arisen from a global mutation. The most outstanding
   aspect of this global mutation is the emergence of a new techno
   productive model that produces a drastic organizational transformation.
   The most remarkable indicator is the management explosion that generates
   a new project and a new governmentality. The restructuring derived from
   the reforms mentioned above poses difficulties to the public healthcare
   organizations, emerged from the welfare state, due to the
   incompatibility between the new Post- Fordist model and some basic
   elements of the medical professional model. This conflict generates
   organizational processes characterized by opacity and complexity. The
   intensive technological change reinforces the leadership of the
   biomedical industry inside the medical-industrial complex to the
   detriment of the physicians. The confluence of these changes transforms
   the nature of medical practice and erodes his professional autonomy in a
   way that transcends the categories previously stated by the sociology of
   the professions, ``proletarianization{''} and
   ``deprofessionalisation{''}. The increase of the medical-industrial
   complex under the hegemony of the industries is supported on an alleged
   constant growth and generates doubts on its social and economic
   sustainability. The medical institution, powered and guided by the
   technological innovation and transformed into an intensive consumption
   and production field, generates a very decentralized scope and worldview
   with respect to the complex collective health problems that also derive
   from social inequality and social problems in current societies.},

Abstract = {At the end of the 19th century, a Polish community with ethnic identity
   developed in the United States. This identity may have changed
   increasingly after 1918 from ``Polish{''} to ``Polish-American,{''} but
   during the Second World War and the East-West conflict, the Polish
   diaspora (Polonia) remained true to its dual mission: the establishment
   of an independent, free Poland and the preservation of its cultural and
   linguistic heritage. Today, Polonia is well integrated, fragmented, and
   trans-national, its ethnicity largely symbolic. But the potential to be
   the ``third party{''} in Polish-American relations, as was the case
   until recently, is still there.},

Abstract = {Research so far provides evidence that political knowledge tends to
   affect democratic participation. However, political scientists do not
   test whether different types of political knowledge also promote
   different forms of participation. The present paper investigates this
   matter based on the 2008 German General Social Survey (ALLBUS). It is
   shown that different types of knowledge differ in their effect on
   involvement in different kinds of political participation. Thus, a
   reinterpretation of the impact of political knowledge on political
   participation is necessary.},

Journal = {GERMAN POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Pages = {200-222},
Abstract = {The result of the 2009 Bundestag election strengthened the chorus of
   observers diagnosing the demise of the `Volksparteien' (catch-all
   parties). Both German catch-all parties, the Christian Democratic
   CDU/CSU and the Social Democratic SPD, are under enormous pressure,
   which is reflected in standard quantitative data: the catch-all parties
   are losing voters both in absolute numbers and in terms of their share
   of the vote; they are losing party members; and they are losing public
   confidence regarding their perceived ability to solve important
   political and social problems. Apparently, the basic political idea of
   Volksparteien, namely vertically and horizontally to integrate different
   interests, ideas, social groups, opinions and trends, is less and less
   in demand in society. This article discusses the various, partially
   contradictory but mostly complementary, theories that seek to explain
   the downward trend of the Volksparteien. The article shows how the
   catch-all parties are attempting to address these detrimental
   developments in terms of both their organisation and strategies.},

Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1-2, SI},
Pages = {147-168},
Abstract = {Richard A. Posner's two books on the financial crisis focus on possible
   macroeconomic (Keynesian) causes of it, neglecting legal causes that
   would have had only microeconomic effects, yet could have been
   responsible for the crisis. Specifically, Posner accepts too readily the
   conventional wisdom that banks' leverage levels, hence their capital
   cushions, were deregulated; this ignores Basel I, Basel II, and the
   Recourse rule, which internationally and (in the last case) in the
   United States minutely regulated not only leverage levels but the
   composition of banks' assets. These regulations penalized banks for
   making business loans in comparison to mortgage loans, and it further
   penalized them for keeping mortgage loans rather than selling them for
   securitization and then buying back the osenioro tranches of the
   resulting mortgage-backed securities. These regulations may explain the
   overconcentration of mortgage risk in the banks, and thus the financial
   crisis.},

Title = {EU democracy promotion in the neighbourhood: from leverage to
   governance?},
Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {18},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {885-909},
Abstract = {EU external democracy promotion has traditionally been based on
   `linkage', i.e. bottom-up support for democratic forces in third
   countries, and `leverage', i.e. the top-down inducement of political
   elites towards democratic reforms through political conditionality. The
   advent of the European Neighbourhood Policy and new forms of association
   have introduced a new, third model of democracy promotion which rests in
   functional cooperation between administrations. This article
   comparatively defines and explicates these three models of external
   democracy promotion. It argues that while `linkage' has hitherto failed
   to produce tangible outcomes, and the success of `leverage' has
   basically been tied to an EU membership perspective, the `governance'
   model of democracy promotion bears greater potential beyond the circle
   of candidate countries. In contrast to the two traditional models,
   however, the governance approach does not tackle the core institutions
   of the political system as such, but promotes transparency,
   accountability, and participation at the level of state administration.},

Title = {Do Student Learning Styles Translate to Different ``Testing Styles''?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE EDUCATION},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {7},
Number = {4},
Pages = {416-433},
Abstract = {Professors seem to be more aware of different student learning styles
   than ever before and are utilizing various teaching techniques in order
   to appeal to different students in their classes. Unfortunately,
   presenting materials is only one side of the coin, while the other
   side-assessment-has not received the same amount of attention. After
   all, if teachers can agree that students have different methods for
   learning, does it not stand to reason that they have different methods
   of reproducing this knowledge as well? This article makes a case for
   more diverse assessment techniques within the same course, connecting
   our knowledge on individual learning styles to a theory of ``testing
   styles.'' By allowing students to choose between different formats for
   participation, exams, and other assignments, educators acknowledge
   students' individual styles and allow them to show what they really know
   as opposed to how well they take tests. The author's major claims are
   supported by the results of an experimental design that tests the
   connection between learning styles and students' performances in
   different testing formats. The article also includes findings taken from
   a survey on students' experiences with and hopes for different
   assessment techniques.},

Title = {Institutional Trust and Congressional Autonomy in Latin America:
   Expectations, Performance, and Confidence in Peru's Legislature},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS IN LATIN AMERICA},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {3},
Number = {2},
Pages = {73-105},
Abstract = {What role do Latin Americans expect legislatures to play vis-a-vis the
   executive? How do expectations shape political trust in a developing
   democracy like Peru? This article introduces new indicators gauging
   citizens' current perceptions of, and idealized expectations for, the
   institutional independence of their elected assemblies. It uses 2007
   data to test the hypothesis that the gap between the two indicators -
   the ``legislative autonomy gap{''} predicts trust in Congress. Most
   Peruvians claimed to prefer a more autonomous legislature. And citizens
   whose high expectations for institutional independence were adequately
   met were more likely to express confidence in Congress. However, having
   low expectations of congressional autonomy met also enhanced confidence
   in that institution. Trust in Congress proved to be pragmatic too, tied
   to perceptions of strong national economic performance, confidence in
   political parties, approval of congressional leadership, and approval of
   the same president from whom most Peruvians wished Congress would become
   more independent.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL MARKETING},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {10},
Number = {4},
Pages = {328-349},
Abstract = {Studies on elections and voting behavior have generally shown that
   campaigns display only a minimal effect, while predispositions are found
   to play a fundamental role in influencing voters' preferences. This
   paper aims to re-evaluate these findings by analyzing campaign effects
   through a panel survey conducted during the 2006 Italian elections. This
   case study is particularly interesting due to the changes in the
   political and media environment that occurred after the mid-1990s. The
   results substantially confirm that campaign-related variables have a
   weak impact on voting choice, although they had important effects in
   terms of voters' participation and floating voters' orientations.},

Abstract = {In the study of state failure, scholars and practitioners have mostly
   focused on macro-level indicators to determine which state is failed and
   which is not. This focus overlooks crucial local and regional variation
   that has to be taken into account when designing interventions. In this
   article, we develop a new approach to examine state failure on this
   microlevel. Using a unique data-set on Somalia, we identify micro-level
   indicators for state failure. The analysis shows that micro-level data
   are crucial for detecting variation in state failure.},

Year = {2011},
Volume = {46},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {In the lead-up to the Australian federal election in 2010, both major
   political parties represented the `unauthorised' arrival of
   asylum-seekers as a security issue. This article explores the dynamics
   of this resecuritization of asylum in Australia, suggesting the case has
   important implications for both the securitization framework and
   Australia's treatment of asylum-seekers. The relationship between
   securitization and calls for an open debate about asylum-seekers
   challenges the securitization framework's normative claims about
   political debate and deliberation as a progressive development
   illustrative of desecuritization (the removal of issues from the
   security agenda). This case also illustrates that without political
   leadership to engage with the social and cultural context that allows
   the securitization of asylum to resonate with large segments of the
   Australian population, the exploitation of this issue for short-term
   political gain will continue.},

Abstract = {The extent and nature of business financing of parties is an important
   feature of political finance. Britain's transparent and permissive
   regulatory system provides an excellent opportunity to study business
   financing of parties. Business donations have been very important to the
   Conservative party over the last decade, and of only marginal importance
   to Labour. Unlike other Conservative contributors, business donors are
   more likely to contribute when the party is popular. In contrast to the
   previous period of Conservative government, the biggest British
   businesses tended to abstain from political finance under New Labour.
   However, their bias towards the Conservatives is affected by the party's
   popularity and the closeness of an election. Britain shares the
   political importance of business financing of parties and its mixture of
   ideological and pragmatic motivations with other liberal market
   economies. However, in Britain the bias towards the right is much
   stronger and the role of big business more marginal.},

Abstract = {Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez is frequently labeled
   ``charismatic,{''} but this aspect of his leadership has mostly escaped
   direct argument and analysis. The authors offer a measure of charisma
   and a reciprocal account of the relationship between charisma and
   performance evaluations. Data from a national survey of Venezuelans
   confirm that perceptions of Chavez's charisma in 2007 were comparatively
   high. Using three-stage least squares regression analysis the authors
   then document a highly dynamic process, by which poor performance erodes
   perceptions of Chavez's charisma (and favors an opponent) while
   lingering beliefs in that charisma lead some to see better conditions
   than are perceived by those who do not subscribe to the charismatic
   sheen. The argument and analysis sharpen understandings of the nature,
   determinants, and consequences of charisma. The authors suggest that and
   explain why public support for Chavez is likely to recede at a slow,
   protracted pace rather than be abruptly withdrawn.},

Abstract = {The article is focusing on the characteristics of the political regime
   and media system of Croatian republic during the reign of president
   Franjo Tudjman and his political party Croatian Democratic Community
   (Hrvatska demokratska zajednica - HDZ), and also on the characteristics
   of the time afterwards, from 2000 up to the present. The first half of
   the 20 years period (from 1990-2000) is considered to be the era of
   non-consolidated democracy with a semi-presidential system where we can
   just barely talk about independent media. From 2000 on, the second half
   of the analyzed period, the party and political arrangement in Croatia
   changed significantly, bringing also a weighty change to the media
   environment and a transition to democracy in general. Croatia turned
   into a classic parliamentary democracy. International relations also
   normalized after the election of new government in 2000. Nowadays, we
   can consider Croatian republic to be a standard democracy. One of its
   primary foreign policy goals is to enter the European Union.},

Abstract = {Analyzing the public management modernization policy, from 1990 to 2006,
   the article identifies the model which might explain how policies are
   formulated in the country. This model has been identified from evidence
   collected through 37 interviews to key actors of the process, official
   documents, and media analysis. The model diverges from Kingdon and
   IADB'S approaches, which are commonly used to explain the policy
   formulation process in Latin America. The article explains which might
   be the reasons of the divergence.},

Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE PEACE \& SECURITY},

Volume = {23},
Number = {3},
Pages = {369-385},
Abstract = {Private military and security companies have gained political authority
   within the governance of security, but the increasing authority seems
   unmatched by legitimacy. This article analyzes self-legitimation efforts
   by the dominant Western industry. It draws on two different theoretical
   perspectives of legitimacy, organizational legitimacy and democratic
   legitimacy, and argues that four dimensions of legitimacy are relevant
   to these companies. The article finds empirically that there are
   different degrees of deficits in each dimension and discusses the use of
   some corresponding legitimating strategies used by the industry.
   Findings indicate that much effort currently seems concentrated on
   building input legitimacy, while there are also less concerted efforts
   to cultivate both output and moral legitimacy. The article warns that,
   if unchallenged, legitimation campaigns may lead to further accumulation
   of private influence on military and security policies, both nationally
   and internationally.},

   stemming from Europe},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL POWER},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {4},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {355-374},
Abstract = {This article tries to understand the deeply ambivalent role in modern
   global world history of imperialism originating from Europe. It follows
   a long, genealogical narrative, beginning in the inherent structure and
   tensions of empire per se on the European mainland. Nonetheless, there
   was a partially successful attempt at empire in the primarily spiritual
   `imperial' power emanating from Rome, which in due course evoked a
   matching response in religious-ideological opposition of the
   Reformation. The subsequent weakening of the prospects of mainland
   empire encouraged maritime empires in the form of sovereign states,
   while the profound opposition to top-down power per se survived in the
   derivatives of Protestantism, primarily in North America. A compromise
   with that opposition was sketched in Protestant-inspired Lockean
   Liberalism, which saw virtue in territorial expansion in so far as a key
   motif from the start was a sense of autonomous liberation achievable
   through expansion into open territory as the pursuit of God's purpose.
   That grew sharper in North America, as Europeans seeking progress in
   European society envisioned their own freedom from the state in the
   `empty' space granted by the colonializing state itself for colonization
   and enclosure. Colonists' and migrants' aspirations for liberation thus
   found expression in a modern vision of territorial expansion as freedom.
   US's continental expansion in the nineteenth, and more sharply global
   expansion in the twentieth century, reiterated that vision in extending
   an intrusive liberal imperialism. There emerged a US-centered, Western
   oppressive dynamic of liberation, which is still present in the
   dissemination of values individual liberty and into the integration in
   global open space.},

Abstract = {This article presents a preliminary analysis from a case study conducted
   in Northern Ireland. Participant observation and semi-structured
   interviewing were used to learn whether music might serve as a useful
   tool for engaging Northern Irish youth in peacebuilding. Obstacles and
   limitations certainly exist, but the data suggests that music can be
   used to engage youth in peacebuilding in three key ways: (1) music can
   be useful in bringing youth together to share meaning, and as such is an
   alternative way to engage in dialogue for building peace; (2)
   music-making can help youth gain self-esteem and reconsider their view
   of others in a way that can help to destabilize conflict identities; and
   (3) by taking part in musical programs, violence by, against, and
   between youth may be reduced or prevented by changing the way youth
   experience the spaces they inhabit and/or by providing alternative
   activities to rioting.},

Abstract = {The revenue generated from Mongolia's natural resources has the
   potential to transform the Mongolian state and society. Indeed,
   investment in mining has already led to a spate of urban growth in
   Ulaanbaatar and rural development throughout the rest of the country.
   Yet Mongolia's natural resources could also contribute to a `natural
   resource curse' if not properly managed. Effective governance in
   relation to the state's natural resource sector is, therefore,
   essential. This article examines Mongolia's sovereignty in order to
   determine whether or not the state is capable of `good governance' in
   relation to the mining sector.},

Pages = {83-110},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Hegemonic party regimes are non-democratic regimes that (1) rule with
   the aid of a dominant political party and (2) hold multi-party
   elections. Elite coalitions organized under the aegis of a hegemonic
   party are most vulnerable in elections that coincide with poor economic
   performance. A declining economy provides elites with a platform around
   which they can mobilize support to challenge incumbents in elections. As
   a result, the likelihood of defections from hegemonic parties increases
   as income declines. This study's original dataset, which includes 227
   elections for the chief executive in hegemonic party dictatorships from
   1946 to 2004, and its case studies of defections in Zimbabwe under
   ZANU-PF in 2008 and Turkey under the Democratic Party in 1955 provide
   evidence for this proposition.},

Abstract = {The increasing complexity of the urban systems, forces us to consider
   more efficient approaches to urban - regional organization. The concept
   of Urban Biosphere Reserve, offer the possibility to establish mechanism
   for urban and regional planning based on the understating of the
   system's integrality, observing the whole territory as a unit, avoiding
   the division and fragmentation.
   This proposal counts whit the back up of six research teams at different
   Hispano-American cities, locking for exchange experiences about planning
   models, pursuing the sustained development.
   Staring from this proposal, it seeks to build a methodological
   alternative to elaborate Urban and Territorial Regulation Plans for
   metropolitan's areas, which consider the city as a complex
   interrelationship system.},

   on the conflict dynamics in Southern Thailand},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE PEACE \& SECURITY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {23},
Number = {3},
Pages = {387-403},
Abstract = {This paper examines the supply and demand sides of firearms
   proliferation and highlights the negative impacts they have on the
   security of the civilian population and communal relations in the
   conflict-affected region of Southern Thailand. Based on information
   gathered during focus group discussions and in-depth interviews, the
   article argues that firearms proliferation and the creation of civilian
   militias in Southern Thailand have spawned a flourishing gun economy
   that is exacerbating religious and ethnic polarization and communal
   violence. As a result, social ties are breaking down and ethno-religious
   discrimination is intensifying. Without a reduction in the
   militarization of civilians, the conflict in Southern Thailand is likely
   to become deeply entrenched as has happened in other violent conflicts.
   The paper is organized in three sections. The first section examines
   firearms supply in Southern Thailand. The second investigates the way in
   which the supply corresponds with the general demand for firearms.
   Finally, an analysis of the impacts of firearms proliferation and the
   arming of civilians is presented.},

Abstract = {In this paper we analyze the impact of terrorist attacks conducted in
   Israel during the Second Intifada (2000-2006) on the Israeli stock
   market. The impact is assessed by differentiating between attacks in the
   center of Israel (what is termed here the core region) and attacks in
   the periphery (the southern and northern areas of the country). We use
   the event study technique to evaluate the effects of the attacks on
   abnormal returns on the Israeli stock market. Our major finding is that
   a terrorist attack in the center of Israel has a significant negative
   effect on the stock market on the day it happens and a significant
   cumulative negative effect for several days afterward. However, when the
   attack takes place in the periphery, it has a less significant effect
   and no lasting impact after the first day.},

Abstract = {The UK has traditionally described its nuclear weapons stockpile numbers
   in terms of ` less than x weapons'. As more archive material becomes
   available, it is increasingly possible to estimate the number of
   operational weapons during the 1960s and 1970s. However, accounting for
   all UK nuclear weapons in this period is complicated by the separation
   of components, the lack of data on maintenance and assembly, and the
   difficulty of determining whether procurement targets translated into
   operational devices. The difficulty of generating an authoritative
   account suggests that the global disarmament agenda should focus on
   military fissile material, not warheads.},

Abstract = {This article makes a contribution to research on soft or `new'
   governance in EU policy making by examining the recent history of
   telecommunications policy as a case study, a sector hitherto not widely
   recognised for displaying this kind of governance. Training its focus on
   the process leading to the agreement of the latest iteration of the EU's
   Electronic Communications Regulatory Framework, the article finds strong
   evidence that soft governance has been used within hard governance
   legislative frameworks primarily as a tool of political compromise, in
   respect of the classic problem of securing a balance of regulatory power
   distribution between the national and EU level. Soft governance employed
   in this way casts doubt over its ability to achieve openness, common
   purpose, innovativeness and regulatory efficacy.},

Abstract = {This study argues that environmental scarcity is more likely to result
   in civil conflict in countries that experience `ethnic' population
   pressures (i.e. where the size of the largest minority group is close to
   parity with the majority group). I refer to this argument as the
   `parity-threat' approach to the study of scarcity-induced domestic
   conflict. I empirically test my argument by analysing time-series
   cross-section data for the period 1979-2000 using four alternative
   environmental indicators: (1) ecological footprint, (2) biocapacity, (3)
   scarcity of ecological reserves and (4) water scarcity. The results
   demonstrate that environmental scarcity increases the probability of
   civil conflict when conditioned by `ethnic' population pressures.},

Abstract = {The use of instrumental variables regression in political science has
   evolved from an obscure technique to a staple of the political science
   tool kit. Yet the surge of interest in the instrumental variables method
   has led to implementation of uneven quality. After providing a brief
   overview of the method and the assumptions on which it rests, we chart
   the ways in which these assumptions are invoked in practice in political
   science. We review more than 100 articles published in the American
   Journal of Political Science, the American Political Science Review, and
   World Politics over a 24-year span. We discuss in detail two noteworthy
   applications of instrumental variables regression, calling attention to
   the statistical assumptions that each invokes. The concluding section
   proposes reporting standards and provides a checklist for readers to
   consider as they evaluate applications of this method.},

Title = {Institutional Change and Conflict Regulation: The Anglo-Irish Agreement
   (1985) and the Mechanisms of Change in Northern Ireland},
Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {34},
Number = {4},
Pages = {838-858},
Abstract = {This article uses historical institutionalist theory to assess the
   impact of the Anglo-Irish Agreement of 1985 - often seen as the first
   step towards gradualist change in the role of the state in Northern
   Ireland. It uses new data to show how the elites who initiated the
   process conceived of it and to identify the mechanisms producing change.
   The study shows that the mechanisms of institutional change identified
   in comparative studies of industrial policy and welfare state
   development are also to be found in processes of intergovernmental
   ethnic conflict regulation. In turn, it highlights a mechanism of
   institutional change - `wedging' - not discussed in the literature.},

Journal = {POLITIX},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {24},
Number = {93},
Pages = {69+},
Abstract = {The concept of apparatus of sensitization allows to conduct empirical
   enquiries of material supports, combination of objects, public
   performances which the activists display to arouse emotions predisposing
   those who are affected to support their cause. As regards the animal
   cause, historical and ideal types analysis show how the apparatus of
   sensitization can supply very different emotional registers. The first
   one involves a demopedic logic glorifying the enlightening aims of
   educators of the animal cause, the second one implies a logic of
   ``tenderness{''} which carries succourers to remedy the immediate
   suffering of animals deserving affection, the third one support a logic
   of ``unveiling{''} leading vindicators to denounce horrifying activities
   hidden from the public eye. The valorisation of one of these emotional
   registers cannot be exclusively considered as the result of strategic
   calculations. The article examines how the emotions valued by the
   activists are an extension of the sensibilities shaped during their own
   history. It proposes an alternative to the reductive visions of
   militancy and mobilizations which result from the strategic and
   utilitarian presuppositions of the political process model.},

Abstract = {Using as a focal point the controversy over the content of an
   elementary-school level history textbook in Greece, the main argument
   put forth in this article is that the campaign to withdraw this textbook
   was preceded by and further facilitated an ongoing process of
   ideological convergence between forces of the left and the right. It is
   argued that these forces increasingly structure their political
   discourse on the basis of a unified `interpretative frame' and align
   their efforts to politicize cultural, symbolic and educational issues as
   part of a broader project of cultural protectionism. By examining the
   different stages of the mobilization effort, the article documents the
   process of frame emergence and discusses its potential for a more
   profound and lasting ideological transformation in Greece. At a more
   theoretical level, the article also considers the usefulness of the
   concept of `interpretative frames', particularly in its ability to
   address the familiar micro-macro divide in studies of ideology and to
   illuminate the mechanisms of ideological change.},

Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {18},
Number = {3},
Pages = {847-871},
Abstract = {Contributing to a growing literature on democracy beyond the
   nation-state, this article draws on aspects of national democratization
   theory in order to analyse empirical processes of democracy. By
   combining insights from transition theory and the theory of political
   opportunity structures, the article examines the case of the Asian
   Development Bank (ADB). While the ADB for a long time has been described
   as a closed, unresponsive and unaccountable international organization,
   a recent evaluation praised the Bank for its good practices concerning
   transparency, participation and accountability. The article uses the
   analytical framework to highlight the interaction between hard-liners
   and soft-liners within the ADB and explores the role of different
   transnational civil society actors in the processes that seem to have
   strengthened the democratic credentials of the ADB. While finding
   significant divisions within the ADB as well as amongst civil society
   actors targeting the bank, overall the article argues that transnational
   civil society actors, interacting with soft-liners within the ADB, have
   contributed to the implementation of reforms, which in turn create
   political opportunities for further civil society activism. The reform
   processes, however, are best described as processes of liberalization -
   rather than democratization.},

Abstract = {This article explores the effect of political and institutional
   constraints on negotiations that seek to end civil wars. Two aspects of
   negotiations are statistically examined. Greater political constraints
   on the leaders of states appear to have no effect on the likelihood of
   negotiations taking place, but greater political constraints do reduce
   the likelihood of negotiations succeeding. The results of this analysis
   demonstrate that political constraints are a powerful factor driving the
   likelihood of negotiation success. The article concludes with a
   discussion of why political constraints do not produce a similar
   reduction in the likelihood of negotiations.},

Pages = {84-104},
Abstract = {Challenges to post-conflict leadership in African states highlight the
   need for democratic capacity building, with clear participatory
   processes involving communities and the leadership as a necessary
   condition to mitigate new or resurrected conflicts. This article
   explores transformational leadership and how it relates to democratic
   capacity building in Rwanda. We argue that community capacity building
   through grassroots leadership is a necessary and sufficient ingredient
   for the development and sustenance of democracy in post-conflict
   societies. Reconciliation through justice, political reforms including
   decentralisation, and women's empowerment as critical variables in this
   process characterise a transformational agenda to gradually achieve
   stability at the grassroots. Despite dilemmas of justice and democracy,
   transformative leadership in Rwanda continues to evolve at both state
   and grassroots levels through processes based on indigenous knowledge
   and practices like gacaca and ingando to achieve the greater good of
   reconciliation.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses the Canadian federal system. First, it focuses on
   the reasons for the choice of a federal system when the Canadian
   federation was created in 1867, on the main features of that system: the
   asymmetrical nature and the strongly centralized division of powers, and
   on its evolution. Second, it analyses the federal financial relations,
   the intergovernmetal relations and various issues relating to the
   structure and functioning of national institutions. Finally, it pays
   special attention to the changing and problematic relationship between

Journal = {GERMAN POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {20},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {360-375},
Abstract = {Angela Merkel is unique among post-war German chancellors in that she is
   a woman, she is from the former German Democratic Republic, and she is
   the first with a background in the natural sciences. This article
   explores how the intersection of these unique social roles have shaped
   Merkel's foreign policy. It begins with an exploration of the literature
   on women and foreign policy and considers its relevance for
   understanding Merkel's management style, ideology/worldview, and public
   image. Then the article looks specifically at Merkel's foreign policies
   toward Russia and the European Union, focusing on the substance of her
   foreign policy as well as her interactions with other leaders. The
   extent to which the chancellor has helped to bring more women into the
   foreign policy realm is also briefly discussed.},

Journal = {LATIN AMERICAN POLICY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {2},
Number = {2},
Pages = {152-181},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This study advocates for a transformative expansion of collaboration
   between the governments of Mexico and the United States directed at
   enhancing security in the border region. Protecting security on both
   sides of the border should be the top priority of all collaboration
   efforts. With a binational narco-crisis and the border functioning as a
   buffer zone, there is a need to bring new ideas forward in ameliorating
   the externalities produced by the international narcotics and weapons
   trade. The authors argue that there is no ``lesser crime{''} and that
   all illegal activity strengthens organized crime in the end. They
   identify major security problems, prior attempts at remedy, and a
   roadmap to shared work in formulating and implementing prescriptions.
   Advocated here is a need for strong border coordinators in each
   country-based on the border but reaching into the national capitals-that
   will share staff, resources, planning responsibilities, and
   intelligence.},

Abstract = {Despite achieving a 60-seat majority in the 111th Senate, Democrats were
   unable to pass many of their key legislative priorities without support
   from Republicans. The striking inability of Democrats to govern the
   Senate despite a filibuster-proof majority demonstrates key differences
   between the chambers of Congress. Whereas party polarization helps the
   majority party in the House of Representatives to exert more control
   over the legislative process, in the Senate it aids the minority.
   Because Republicans viewed the Senate as their main opportunity for
   hindering the Democratic agenda, the GOP benefitted from their party's
   ideological cohesion and rules favoring obstruction.},

Abstract = {Radical right parties have become effective electoral competitors in
   many parts of Western Europe yet failed to achieve success in others.
   Much recent scholarship seeks to understand variation in radical right
   support. Here, we argue that local social cohesion boosts these parties'
   vote shares. We use Swiss census data at the municipal level to measure
   local cohesion, drawing on indicators of residents' commuting patterns,
   linguistic similarities and home ownership. Regression analysis shows
   that social cohesion is a positive predictor of local level support for
   the Swiss People's Party, but not for any other major party.
   Hierarchical logit models combining aggregate cohesion measures with
   survey data demonstrate this contextual effect on individuals' vote
   choices. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Nowadays many scientists analyze the institutionalization of social
   movements as a sign of political maturity and of advancement toward
   social democratization. Nevertheless the case of the current Latin
   American social movements show the complexity of the unfinished
   processes related to the yearned democratic consolidation. This article
   examines how much the institutionalization has improved the
   democratization of the indigenous movement in the Colombian political
   system. Firstly, this text analyzes the political function of this
   movement in the promotion of a multicultural and pluriethnic nation at
   the Constitutional Assembly and in the Constitution of 1991. Secondly,
   the article contrasts the legal logic behind the implementation of
   indigenous participation with the dynamics of the native communities.
   Finally, the internal reflection of this movement is described, after
   nearly two decades of experience that simultaneously combines the
   upholding of their struggle with their institutionalization.},

Abstract = {Senate majority leaders risk electoral defeat despite advantages of
   incumbency. In 2010, according to conventional wisdom, Harry Reid seemed
   likely to lose re-election, as had his predecessor. Nevertheless, he won
   a decisive victory. This paper seeks to answer the basic question-how
   did Reid escape electoral defeat?-as a means of elucidating the
   conditions under which Senate majority leaders lose re-elections. This
   research can be couched in a broader study of Senate majority leadership
   that understands the role as one that balances the constraints of
   multiple constituencies of state, party, Senate, and president. In these
   terms, and based on the cases of Tom Daschle and Harry Reid, I
   hypothesize that Reid's electoral victory was no surprise in light of
   his state's ideological position and support of President Barack Obama.
   As a rule, a Senate majority leader faces an electoral threat when he
   opposes a president that his state has supported, but gains electoral
   security when he serves a president his state has supported.},

Abstract = {In the present article, we seek to contribute to the historical analysis
   of the implementation of flexible work. To do this, we examine the
   collective agreement that governed the footwear industry in Argentina
   between 1946 and 2005. This allows us to observe the early attempts to
   make more flexible the work in a country that is presented as owning a
   strong and widespread labor law. The analysis of the collective
   agreement allows us to observe the crystallization, in the legal field,
   of the force relations between social classes. In addition, through
   complementary sources such as newspapers, interviews with workers and
   business sources, we can test the relation that exist at every
   historical period between what the law requires and what actually occurs
   in the factories.},

Journal = {POLITICS \& POLICY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {39},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1021-1052},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This article analyzes the performance of local resource allocation in
   Mexico drawing on the concepts of impartiality and responsiveness
   suggested by quality of government theories. Focusing on an important
   poverty-alleviation transfer fund aimed at improving the provision of
   basic infrastructure, it evaluates to what extent the fund's territorial
   distribution has followed a compensatory logic, and whether the current
   management of resources at the local level has improved people's access
   to basic services. Finally, the article investigates the consequences of
   local spending choices on electoral behavior. The evidence suggests
   that, even if the distribution of resources is not entirely sensitive to
   regional poverty conditions, their use by local authorities has in fact
   improved basic service coverage, particularly for people who live in the
   most disadvantaged areas. Local spending choices are, in any case,
   electorally motivated, as voters reward public works investments at the
   ballot box.},

Abstract = {Studies linking election outcomes to economics frequently assume that
   the economy's salience is constant. This study shows that the economy's
   salience systematically fluctuates. The number of voters focused on
   economic issues shifted dramatically throughout the 2008 campaign as the
   recession worsened and this change occurred well before the financial
   markets collapsed in September 2008. However, even during the recession
   substantial numbers of individuals said their vote was based on
   non-economic issues and for these individuals there was no relationship
   between their assessment of the economy and their electoral choice.
   Consistent with extant theories of issue attention, citizens who were
   the hardest hit by the recession and those who had the most anxiety
   about suffering a financial dislocation in the future were most likely
   to consider economic performance electorally important while secure
   voters were less likely to be economic voters. (C) 2011 Published by

Abstract = {The regional geographical entity known as the Middle East and North
   Africa (MENA) has been at the epicenter of global power struggles over
   the course of the last centuries with an ever-increasing intensity.
   While the region has been a popular subject in the literature of
   political science and international relations due to the sheer volume of
   conflicts raging within the parameters of its borders, writings on
   international/ comparative political economy focused on alternate
   regions such as East Asia characterized by a sustainable economic growth
   potential. This study aims to make a critical contribution to the
   political economy literature by conducting a theoretically and
   historically informed analysis on the transformation dynamics in the
   MENA region. To this end, the multi-faceted legacy of colonialism; the
   role of oil as a strategic resource; structural changes in the world
   economy; and divergent politico-economic reform trajectories in the wake
   of economic globalization will be evaluated.},

Abstract = {In countries that have undergone democratic transition from hybrid
   regimes in the last two decades, regime collapse was, as a rule,
   causally linked with turnover in power. Nonetheless, a number of states
   that have democratized during this period saw the end of hybrid regime
   without experiencing such political change. Put differently, whereas
   most of the parties that had been ruling in hybrid regimes lost their
   power when these regimes ceased to exist, some of them remained
   politically dominant notwithstanding democratic changes. And while
   different developmental trajectories of hybrid regimes in the post-Cold
   War period are thoroughly studied, the diverging faiths of their ruling
   parties have largely been neglected. By focusing on the hybrid regimes
   that existed in the 1990s in Croatia, Serbia, and Montenegro, this paper
   puts forward a potential explanation of such political dynamics. It
   argues that the structure of power in these regimes was the key factor
   determining whether an incumbent party would stay in power or not. It
   thereby makes a distinction between regimes whose power is
   `personalized', i.e. structured around a charismatic leader (as were the
   former two), and those in which it is `institutionalized', that is
   derived from a party organization (as was the latter).
   Due to this structural difference, it contends, the Croatian and Serbian
   incumbent parties lost power as the regimes collapsed, whereas the
   Montenegrin ruling party stayed in power despite democratic change. In
   addition, it posits that the levels of stability of three regimes were
   considerably different due to the same reason.},

Abstract = {Public responsiveness to government policy is a crucial component of
   representative democracy, but may be far weaker in federal regimes. This
   article explores the consequences of federalism for public
   responsiveness in one highly federalized policy domain: welfare spending
   in Canada. Results suggest that citizens' preferences for spending at
   the federal level are affected by changes in both federal and provincial
   spending, and to an equal degree; they suggest, in short, that
   federalism poses serious problems where public responsiveness is
   concerned. A concluding section considers the implications of these
   findings for the representation of public opinion in policy in
   federalized states.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the Rousseau/Helvetius controversy (as presented in
   ``Profession de foi du vicarie savoyard{''} and De l'esprit,
   respectively) to find out how it configures a typical Rousseauian
   conception of the individual defined by the affective statute of
   consciousness, irreductible to sensation, which will have a well-known
   continuity throughout Romanticism. In turn, this conception of the
   individual is the condition that makes possible the autobiographical
   texts, Les confessions and Les reveries du promeneur solitaire, in which
   the philosopher is presented as both a saint and a monster, in an
   intertextual discussion with St. Augustine.},

   interferes with complex social analysis and efficacious political

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This article reports on a small group experiment studying how the
   preferences of an individual's social network affect her ability to vote
   for the candidate who will provide her with the greater benefit on both
   valence issues and position issues. The research diverges from
   traditional formal models and experimental studies of social
   communication by expanding the communication network beyond the dyad.
   The results suggest that social communication is a useful information
   shortcut for uninformed independents, but not uninformed partisans.
   Informed individuals incorporate biased social messages into their
   candidate evaluations, which results in higher levels of incorrect
   voting in certain types of networks.},

Abstract = {Allesandro Stanziani, Labour and performance of the ``second serfdom{''}
   in Russia
   This paper focuses on the institutional definition and practises of
   serfdom in Russia between the 17th and the 19th century. It shows that
   peasants' bondage to the land was never fully officialized in Russia;
   several forms of personal dependance and bondage were at hand. From this
   standpoint the author put into evidence the overall perfomances of
   Russian agriculture and economy. The notions of Russia as a feudal
   system or quasi-peripherie of Europe are put under attack.},

Title = {Democracy \& Judicial Controlling in Jordan A Constitutional Study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS AND LAW},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {4},
Number = {2},
Pages = {180-195},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The establishment of the constitutional courts is regarded as the main
   demand for democratic states; the regular courts and high court of
   justice in Jordan have delivered many several decisions that insist on
   the issue of judicial review on the constitutionality of law and
   administrative actions. The present study comprises a number of
   sections. The first section, general notion on democracy and judicial
   controlling in Jordan, is statement of the study problems, purposes and
   significance of the study and the methodology applied by the
   researchers. Democracy under the constitution of Jordan and the main
   features of democracy in this constitution are undertaken in the second
   section.
   The third section aims to acquaint the reader with the structure of the
   judiciary and the national standers pertaining to judicial independence
   and rule of law in Jordan. The fourth section evaluates the judicial
   review under the constitution of Jordan and the national charter, while
   section five examines respectively the role of judiciary in defending
   human rights of Jordanian citizens and the norms of judicial
   independence and rule of law in Jordan. The sixth section highlights the
   issue of constitutional court and the judicial reform in Jordan.
   The subject of judicial review, control of the constitutionality laws
   and types of the constitutional review as well judiciary's attitude
   towards judicial review in Jordan is discussed deeply in the seventh
   section. Finally, section eight, conclusion and recommendation to the
   issue of democracy and judicial controlling in Jordan. This study
   suggests that the violable constitutional court in Jordan should be
   provided by the constitution as it is included in the national charter,
   1992 which requires a new constitutional amendment. The court should be
   completely independent and separated from any type of controlling of
   other courts, either regular or administrative. It also recommends that
   the court should be interlay constituted from experienced, impartial and
   talented judges with long term of service and should exercise equally
   progressive role in intervening power politics and that more precautions
   may be taken for the court.},

Title = {The importance of party ideology: Explaining parliamentarian support for
   political party gender quotas in Eastern Europe},
Journal = {PARTY POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {17},
Number = {5},
Pages = {561-579},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Party gender quotas are rules voluntarily adopted within political party
   structures that aim at securing a set percentage of women to appear on
   candidate lists in elections for political office. Although
   parliamentarian support is critical to the adoption and enforcement of
   party gender quotas, empirical studies of parliamentarian opinion on
   this matter are few, and none are concerned with countries of Eastern
   Europe. In the context of Poland, this study addresses two main
   questions: (a) why do some parliamentarians support party gender quotas?
   And (b) what are the most important reasons? Using survey data on Polish
   parliamentarians, I examine the role of three major determinants of
   variation in party gender quota support: parliamentarian's gender;
   economic and religious political party ideologies; and placement on the
   candidate list. Cross-tabulations reveal that women parliamentarians and
   parliamentarians from parties with economic statist and anti-clerical
   ideologies are more likely to support quotas than are those from
   economic liberal and Catholic traditionalist parties. In addition,
   parliamentarians placed low on the party's electoral list in the
   previous election are more likely to support quotas than those placed at
   the top. Logistic regression analyses including all these determinants
   show that the only statistically significant effects pertain to economic
   and religious party ideologies. Discussion of the theoretical
   implications of party ideology being the most important explanatory
   factor for parliamentarian support of party gender quotas concludes this
   article.},

Abstract = {Despite the recent spread of multi-scale approaches to party system
   classification, the most widely accepted criterion has always been the
   number of parties, often defined in terms of their relative sizes.
   Building on the existing body of qualitative classifications and
   quantitative techniques, this article proposes a method that can be used
   for defining party system types in operational terms, and distinguishing
   among them by a parsimonious criterion. The proposed method is based on
   representing information about seat distributions by party in graphical
   form, segmenting the resulting bounded diagram into regions, and
   identifying these regions as representations of different party system
   types. This makes the graphical representation, dubbed the relative-size
   triangle, instrumental both for building categorical classifications of
   the empirically observed party systems and for visualizing differences
   among them. For illustration, the proposed method is applied to a
   comprehensive set of post-World War II party systems.},

Abstract = {Studies on individual-level voter turnout in the European Parliament
   elections rely solely on self-reported turnout data. At the same time, a
   long tradition in public opinion research examines the impact of
   individual and contextual variables on over-reporting of voter turnout.
   The ultimate goal of these efforts is an assessment of the bias
   introduced when turnout models are estimated from self-reported turnout
   data. In this article, it is proposed that certain characteristics
   related to turnout (and turnout over-reporting), like university
   education or party contact, should also be positively associated with
   political awareness and knowledge. If so, they might contribute to
   respondents' greater ability to distinguish between different salience
   levels, significantly increasing non-voters' propensity to over-report
   turnout in high-salience elections, but not in low-salience ones. This
   hypothesis is tested using data on electoral participation in Sweden,
   comparing patterns of turnout over-reporting in the (high-salience)
   national parliament elections and the (low-salience) European Parliament
   elections. The results of this test, the first one to give an account of
   patterns of over-reporting of turnout in the European Parliament
   elections, largely support the above hypothesis. Finally, the
   consequences of this phenomenon for the validity of inferences made from
   self-reported turnout data are analyzed.},

   no. 37/1993 an authority may, after a notification to a party of a
   decision, correct manifest errors therein, provided that the authority
   notifies the party of the correction without delay and communicates to
   him a fresh copy of the decision. The article addresses what kind of
   errors fall within the ambit of the provision and when the errors are
   considered manifest errors. It is concluded that errors that pertain to
   the formal processing of a case and are obvious from the point of view
   of the party fall within the ambit of the provision. In addition, the
   article shortly addresses other conditions of the provision and some
   issues which may arise in practice, in light of what kind of errors can
   fall within its ambit.},

Abstract = {Non-profit organizations and foundations, a part of the so-called third
   sector, have for a long period of time been an important part of the
   Icelandic welfare system. Despite this there is limited statistical and
   research data on their number and operations. The article includes
   findings from preliminary research on the subject. A theoretical models
   and international classification systems are used in the analysis to
   define their number, functions and operations and relations with the
   government.
   The data is derived from the authors' database on the effects of recent
   economic crisis and historical data on individual non-profits and
   foundations. The findings confirm their extensive function in welfare
   services but a changing role through the 20th. century.
   Nonprofit-government relations have changed accordingly. Based on the
   authors' definition 144 non-profit organizations and foundations were in
   operation in 2009, the former comprising 85\% of the total number. A
   little less than 6 of every 10 were entities with the primary function
   of providing public service, approx. 2 of every 10 were member-oriented
   such as self-help societies and similar ratio campaigning organizations.
   Organizations providing public service have the largest operating
   activities and number of employees. Approx. 2/3 of the entities had one
   or two primary income bases. Most frequently the largest portion of the
   organizations' income was provided by the central government. The
   importance of reliable official data and research on the third sector in
   Icelandic is emphasized.},

Abstract = {Iceland's boom and bust replicate in miniature the causes, development
   and trajectory of the absolutely larger but proportionately smaller
   American boom and bust, except for Iceland's costly lack of a reserve
   currency and its banks' preference not just for speculating in but also
   overpaying for shaky assets. In the aggregate, both the US and Icelandic
   economies sold short-term, passive, and liquid assets to the world,
   consumed part of that borrowing, and reinvested outward in fixed,
   long-term and active investments. The key differences between Icelandic
   and US banks are that Iceland's banks made their titanic gambles without
   the benefit of an international reserve currency. The United States
   survived its catastrophe and continues to have access to global credit
   markets without much penalty because the dollar is the international
   reserve currency. By contrast, Iceland has mortgaged its economy and
   economic independence for decades to bail out banks that had overpaid
   for dodgy assets.},

Abstract = {We test the efficacy of judicial independence in preventing regime
   reversals toward authoritarianism. Using a dataset of judicial
   constraints across 163 different countries from 1960 to 2000, we find
   that established independent judiciaries prevent regime changes toward
   authoritarianism across all types of states. Established courts are also
   capable of thwarting regime collapses in nondemocracies. These results
   provide some of the first large-n evidence confirming the ability of the
   judiciary to maintain regime stability. Unfortunately, however, the
   beneficial effects of court systems seem to take time to develop. The
   evidence indicates that newly formed courts are positively associated
   with regime collapses in both democracies and nondemocracies.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {3},
Number = {2},
Pages = {169-200},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This article investigates the relationships between particular social
   trust, general social trust, and political trust and tests a variety of
   political, social-psychological, and social capital theories of them.
   This sort of research has not been carried out before because until the
   World Values Survey of 2005-07 there has been, to our knowledge, no
   comparative survey that includes measures of particular and other forms
   of trust. The new data challenge a common assumption that particular
   social trust is either harmful or of little importance in modern
   democracies and shows that it has strong, positive associations with
   other forms of trust. However, the relationships are not symmetrical and
   particular social trust seems to be a necessary but not sufficient cause
   of general social trust, and both forms of social trust appear to be
   necessary, but not sufficient conditions for political trust. Strong
   evidence of mutual associations between different forms of trust at both
   the individual micro level and the contextual macro level supports
   theories of rainmaker effects, the importance of political institutions,
   and the significance of social trust for political trust. In more ways
   than one, social trust, not least of a particular type, seems to have an
   important bearing on social and political stability.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses the vision of socialism in the political writings
   of Jesus Enrique Lossada, principle craftsman for reopening the
   University of Zulia in 1946 and prominent Venezuelan intellectual during
   the first half of the twentieth century, found in his writings published
   in 1918 during his early intellectual life. The research combined
   analysis and synthesis operations belonging to the historical method
   along with the linguistic proposal for a semantic-pragmatic approach to
   discourse analysis. This approach showed that, in 1918, young Lossada
   was in essence a socialist identified with utopian socialism and the
   economic approaches of Proudhon.},

Abstract = {The U.S. strategy in the current conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan as
   well as with al-Qaeda has focused predominantly on heavy U.S. military
   involvement (with a high proportion of kinetic operations), while using
   influence components (media, public diplomacy, Civil Affairs (CA),
   Military Information Support Operations (MISO), and Public Affairs
   (PA)), for the most part, in a reactive manner. This paper explores
   influence strategy and theory to identify what the key components of an
   effective influence strategy are, and how to modify these components to
   increase strategic effectiveness. First examined is the relationship of
   influence strategy with grand strategy, then progressed to examining
   several key influence theories as proposed by Cialdini, Ellul,
   Pratkanis, and Aronson, Tugwell, McLuhan, and Reilly. From the review,
   it appears that there are multiple descriptive formulations of the
   components of influence, but no specific formulations on how to develop
   an effective influence strategy using these principles. The principles
   of influence were compared and several hypotheses regarding an effective
   influence strategy proposed to help achieve the desired political
   end-state. The authors plan to test these hypotheses in future research
   using case studies of the Boer War, WWI, WWII, the Cold War, and the
   current conflict of U.S. versus trans-national Jihadi terrorists.},

Abstract = {This article addresses debates on identity and interest representation
   by re-conceptualising descriptive representation. The article revisits
   Pitkin's original work, arguing that descriptive representatives
   actively `stand for' their constituents by making claims about group
   members' needs, circumstances and values. The utility of this
   re-conceptualisation is explored by analysing parliamentarians' speeches
   supporting and opposing sexual health reforms in Argentina. Female
   legislators, particularly those elected under quotas, will portray
   female constituents' reproductive health needs through varied
   ideological prisms and narrative strategies. Reformulating descriptive
   representation as `claim-making' usefully sidesteps debates about
   essentialism, recognises intra-group diversity, and establishes new
   avenues for empirical analysis based on legislators' public speeches and
   statements.},

Abstract = {The author questions whether the National Planning Council, as well as
   the regional councils, are scenarios for the exercise of democracy and
   whether their participation in the construction of development plans is
   an effective strengthening tool, or if they are, instead, a mirage in
   the practice of democracy in Colombia. In the first part several
   versions of democracy are mentioned, from the exposed by Lincoln,
   Tocqueville, Schumpeter, Dahl, Bryce, Boryce and Sartori. Identified in
   each case the key elements to keep as referents and analysis support to
   account, in the second part, which one of these democracies' forms
   describe the modus operandi within the planning councils in the national
   or the territorial level. Also discussed is the role of the planning
   councils, the legitimacy, quality and relevance of the activities of its
   members, as well as the capability to influence in the bill of the
   National Development Plan, by means of interviews of present and former
   members of the National and the district planning councils. The author,
   in addition to responding to questions concerning the subject matter of
   this reflection, let others issues open to the consideration of the
   readers.},

Journal = {STATE POLITICS \& POLICY QUARTERLY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {11},

Abstract = {What led elites in some U.S. states to surrender policy-making power to
   voters between 1898 and 1918, while leaders elsewhere retained only
   representative democracy? The authors argue that progressives behaved as
   strategic politicians by supporting direct democracy when they were
   stymied at achieving their goals in the legislature and were confident
   that the voters who would be empowered by initiatives that agreed with
   progressive policies. They made their delegation of power conditional on
   who would receive it. The presence of these underlying conditions made
   adoption of the citizen initiative likely, the authors posit, while the
   timing of reforms came when insurgent reformers had a strong presence in
   state government, when the results of a galvanizing election sent a
   clear signal, or when the adoption of the initiative in one state
   diffused to its neighbors. Exploring these hypotheses by analyzing a new
   data set, the authors find strong support for their expectations about
   the conditions that created fertile ground for direct democracy.},

   ``nowcasting.{''} We examine our model ``nowcasts,{''} comparing it to
   the classic forecasting strategy of the vote intention poll, across the
   contemporary election period, 2005-2010. As is shown, nowcasting offers
   forecasting advantages that simple polling does not. Most notably, the
   nowcast provides variation that appears much more subject to substantive
   explanation of the electoral cycle, and it provides predictions with a
   three-month lead. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This article addresses the impact of the current neoliberal political
   context for Indigenous governance in Canada. While some observers have
   argued correctly that the neoliberal context provides new opportunities
   or points of entry in the political opportunity structure for
   ``self-government{''} initiatives (Helvin, 2006; Scott, 2006; Slowey,
   2008), I examine to what extent recent decentralizing initiatives,
   generally viewed as ``concessions{''} made by the state to meet the
   demands of Indigenous peoples, must be evaluated as part of a broader
   governmental strategy of neoliberalism. This strategy is not simply
   about meeting the demands of Indigenous peoples but also about meeting
   the requirements of the contemporary governmental shift towards
   ``privatization{''} within liberal democratic states. As such, I argue
   that certain manifestations of Indigenous self-government are vulnerable
   to criticisms launched against practices of privatization, practices
   which include a variety of policies designed to promote a shifting of
   contentious issues out of the public sphere and thereby limiting public
   debate and collective-that is, state-responsibility.},

Abstract = {The study of complex systems is one of the main research objects of the
   so-called `the new complexity sciences'. These sciences aim to
   understand phenomena such as self-organization, emergence, uncertainty,
   non-linear order, and chaos-order dynamic of complex systemic totalities
   in the physical, natural and socio-cultural world. In spite of the
   importance of the knowledge and technologies produced by complexity
   sciences, in the context of different disciplines of contemporary
   sciences, they have not been yet systematically and explicitly
   articulated with the knowledge of social sciences. The goal of this
   paper is to proceed with a socio-historical and epistemological analysis
   of the comparative method in political science and articulate it with
   the developments of complex systems theory. The contribution to which
   this paper aspires is to strengthen an interdisciplinary dialogue
   between complexity sciences and political sciences.},

Abstract = {Almost 400,000 Poles live in Germany. Together with the ``later return

   are well integrated and an integral element of the German population. In
   the Treaty on Neighbourly Relations the German government committed
   itself to maintaining the language and culture of Polish immigrants.
   However, the question how far support of Polish culture should go, is
   open to debate. The German government refuses to recognise the Poles in
   Germany as a minority. Polish organisations in Germany and Polish
   politicians criticise Berlin for not implementing the Treaty on
   Neighbourly Relations.},

Abstract = {Whose interests do major news dailies serve when they report on policy
   debates in Congress? This study compares what members of the U. S. House
   of Representatives say about major policy with what is later reported in
   two news dailies: one liberal (Washington Post) and one conservative
   (Washington Times). The data include one-minute floor speeches by House
   members (168) and published stories-news and editorials-in the print
   media (117). Three high-profile policy initiatives of the 107th Congress
   (2001-2002) anchor the investigation: No Child Left Behind Act (HR 1),
   Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act (HR 1836), and Airport
   Security Act (S. 1447). The evidence shows a discrepancy in the
   perspectives between reporters and officeholders. Where news coverage
   stresses talk of the president and the process, lawmakers stress the
   problem and the stakes for the American people. When the debate breaks
   along party lines, news coverage shows a weak ideological bias that
   favors Democrats.},

Title = {The Text and Context of ``Enough and as Good{''}: John Locke as the
   Foundation of an Environmental Liberalism},
Journal = {POLITY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {43},

Abstract = {Some green theorists have criticized John Locke's theory of property as
   the source of liberalism's failure to address environmental degradation.
   Yet when properly read, Locke's Second Treatise provides a fruitful
   source for constructing an environmentally sensitive and sustainable
   twenty-first-century liberalism. This article contends that Locke's
   economic, political, and social circumstances sensitized him to issues
   of scarcity and the importance of material resources that are critical
   to a twenty-first-century environmental liberalism. His theory of
   property limits individual rights by establishing rules of fair play
   (enough and as good), prohibiting waste (spoilage), and requiring the
   support of the poor (sufficiency). His text particularly the ``enough
   and as good proviso{''}-connects equality fairness, and the common good
   to the natural world. Polity (2011) 43, 210-241.

Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Pages = {40-62},

Abstract = {The article sets out to explore the international legal dimension in
   Jurgen Habermas' latest publications on philosophy of law. It is our
   view that Habermas deals with the examination of just relations beyond
   the nation-state first and foremost from a legal perspective, and that
   the key to a Habermasian reading of international justice is not through
   an application of discoursetheoretical models of communicative or moral
   action as such, but primarily through proper legal institutionalisation
   of the rule of law. In asserting this view, we will look closer at the
   Kantian influence in Habermas' legal construct at the international
   level, and show why this institutional approach is to be sharply
   distinguished from and preferred to any exclusively non-institutional
   approach to international justice.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY},

Volume = {10},

Pages = {177-201},

Abstract = {Tariq Ramadan's recent book, Radical Reform: Islamic Ethics and
   Liberation, boldly proclaims the need for Muslims to completely rethink
   the very meaning of Islamic law, traditionally the preeminent Islamic
   normative discourse and a primary distinguishing feature of Islam from
   other religions, replacing it with a more ecumenical applied ethics. He
   begins the book by rejecting the moderate reformist methods adopted in
   his previous books as insufficient for the `radical reform' of their
   epistemologies and mentalities which he believes contemporary Muslims
   must undertake. It is tempting, therefore, to see this work as a radical
   break with Law. In this article, I offer a different interpretation. On
   my reading, throughout his previous works Ramadan systematically
   advanced and elevated a certain interpretation of Law, based on an
   appropriation of certain concepts taken from mainstream Islamic legal
   theory and crucial to the efforts of all reformist thinkers. It is these
   concepts, which he retains but completely recasts, which mediate his
   move to a post-legal Islamic ethics. I argue that Ramadan's long-term
   project neither merely abandons Islamic law, nor merely reforms it, but
   dissolves the framework of Law through its own devices.},

Abstract = {This article argues that radical right parties can be seen as displaying
   three patterns of opposition towards European integration: rejecting,
   conditional and compromising. These three patterns are identified
   through the careful examination of party attitudes on four different
   aspects related to European integration and the EU. These include the
   idea of a common identity of European peoples, the principle of
   cooperation at a European multilateral level, the EU policy practice and
   the desire to build a future European polity. In light of this
   conceptualization of radical right opposition to European integration,
   the article conducts a qualitative analysis of party literature of 12
   radical right parties from 10 European countries during the latter part
   of the 2000s.},

Abstract = {Recent studies have started to use media data to measure party positions
   and issue salience. The aim of this article is to compare and
   cross-validate this alternative approach with the more commonly used
   party manifestos, expert judgments and mass surveys. To this purpose, we
   present two methods to generate indicators of party positions and issue
   salience from media coverage: the core sentence approach and political
   claims analysis. Our cross-validation shows that with regard to party
   positions, indicators derived from the media converge with traditionally
   used measurements from party manifestos, mass surveys and expert
   judgments, but that salience indicators measure different underlying
   constructs. We conclude with a discussion of specific research questions
   for which media data offer potential advantages over more established
   methods. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {When considering elections in multi-level contexts, scholars have
   typically assumed-in line with second-order election theory-that the way
   voters approach an election depends on their attributions of
   responsibility, that is, on what they see as being at stake in that
   election. This assumption is questionable. The formal position is not
   always clear, and is further blurred by parties and the media. Moreover,
   many voters pay little attention to politics and have little incentive
   to trace constitutional responsibilities. In this paper I use data from
   election studies in two multi-level contexts, Ontario and Scotland, to
   explore the nature and impact of voters' attributions of responsibility.
   The evidence suggests that, when called upon in surveys to do so, many
   voters can confidently and fairly accurately assign issues to different
   levels of government. Yet they do not seem to consider these
   attributions much at elections. There is very little indication that
   issues weighed heavier in the decision-making of those who regarded them
   as the responsibility of that electoral arena. A plausible explanation
   is that most voters sidestep the cognitive demands imposed by
   multi-level elections.},

Abstract = {Language divides are common components of group conflict, a phenomenon
   reflected widely in theories of nationalism. This article evaluates
   measures developed by David Laitin and James Fearon in the minorities at
   risk dataset claiming to quantify language difference and concludes they
   are deeply flawed. The introduction outlines language divides vis-a-vis
   conflict. A theoretical analysis in the second section argues against
   rational choice analyses of language politics; in the third section a
   sociolinguistic matrix shows that these fractional measures represent
   language ancestry but nothing else (morphology, syntax, lexicon,
   orthography, status). Theoretical implications and alternative methods
   are considered in the fourth section followed by a summary conclusion.},

Abstract = {This paper argues that the impact of devolution has been largely
   misperceived in both liberal intergovemmentalist (LI) and multi-level
   governance (MLG) accounts of European Union (EU) politics. To address
   the shortcomings of both LI and MLG, a new data set measuring
   institutionalized regional involvement in the domestic EU policy-shaping
   process in the EU-27 is presented. Analysis shows that the relationship
   between devolution and institutionalized regional involvement is overall
   positive but non-linear, with a strong threshold effect that is best
   captured by a quadratic function. The causal nature of the link between
   devolution and institutionalized regional involvement is ascertained
   through qualitative means using process tracing and Mill's method of
   difference. The article concludes with the necessary updating of MLG and
   LI frameworks to account for the impact of devolution on EU
   policy-shaping.},

Abstract = {This article employs what the author calls ``foundational{''}
   intersectional analysis to investigate the coalitional and rhetorical
   strategies mobilized by Proposition 8, a 2008 ballot initiative in
   California designed to eliminate the right of same-sex marriage. The
   author argues that foundational intersectionality is the only method
   that sufficiently contextualizes the historical legacies constructing
   the political institution of marriage and that this method must
   incorporate the factor of religion, because religion is central to the
   politics of ``moral values.{''} The first part of the article
   differentiates foundational intersectionality from identity
   intersectionality as a framework. The author then sketches how marriage
   is a political institution constructed in the United States through the
   simultaneous interactions of gender, sexuality, race, and religion. The
   second part of the article applies the framework to an empirical
   analysis of four discursive strategies employed by pro- and
   anti-same-sex marriage forces in California in order to ``link their
   fate,{''} or sense of political alliance, to other groups.},

Abstract = {In Frankenstein, a classic of fantasy literature, one finds the promise
   of an ice-free polar sea that holds unimagined riches. In the middle of
   the 19th century, German geographer August Petermann translated the myth
   of this open sea into a precise theory. Petermann's imaginary potential
   was polarising. In popular literature, he was very well received;
   experts reacted with scepticism. The more the scepticism turned into
   open animosity, the more fanatically Petermann pursued his idea. Within
   the German national movement, that idea fell on fertile ground.
   Petermann even succeeded in establishing German polar research.
   Petermann's theory proved to be wrong. Never in his wildest dreams would
   he have dared hope that nature could one day meet him half way.},

Journal = {OSTEUROPA},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {61},
Number = {2-3},
Pages = {163+},
Month = {FEB-MAR},
Abstract = {As a fishing region, the Arctic is at the moment only of regional
   significance. Seen globally, catches barely have any significance, and
   even for the EU fishing industry, the Arctic hardly plays a role. The EU
   is important merely as a trading partner for Arctic fishing countries.
   Despite over-fishing, conflicts over quotas and trade are indeed seldom.
   What kind of effects climate change will have on future catch potentials
   is unclear. Even the available data on current fish stocks is too
   unreliable. The ecological systems are too complex, and the scientific
   data too fragmentary to make prognoses about the economic potential of
   Arctic fishing in the event of a continued decrease in sea ice.},

Abstract = {The agricultural union Unio de Pagesos has established on Catalan soil a
   system designed for the social control and the permanent disposition of
   foreign workers. The State's migration polity is responsible of the
   emergence of such a system, and we can trace its origin in the symbiotic
   relation between the State and the union, whose interests - the social
   control of the foreign worker and the just in time delivery of labor-are
   harmonized in it. In the lodgment a transformation is intended through
   different devices (lodgment regulations, the presence of personnel in
   charge, a visit regime and exit permissions, among others). Its
   particular penitentiary character and its tendency to totalize the
   social life inside, resembles what Erving Goffman called Total
   Institutions. The footprint of this new institution is its liminality,
   characteristic of this space devoted to the concentration of men and
   their transformation.},

Title = {Niger Delta Crisis: The Nexus between Militants' Insurgency and Security
   in West Africa},
Journal = {AFRICAN SECURITY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {4},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {65-80},
Abstract = {Since the oil boom, violence in the Niger Delta has been a growing issue
   for the Nigerian state. Persistent poverty, underdevelopment, and
   environmental degradation have given birth to a region where grievances
   are high. Militancy in the region turned a more destructive corner in
   the early 2000s and in doing so brought considerable disruptions to oil
   production, which accounts for more than 80 percent of government
   revenue. Against this background the study examines the crux of the
   Niger Delta crisis, evaluates the emergent and violent dispositions of
   the armed groups, and reviews the convergence between militancy and
   security in West Africa. It does this by examining the spillover effects
   of militancy across Nigerian borders and into the Gulf of Guinea, the
   impact that the violence has had on regional energy infrastructure
   projects and supply and market dynamics, and the overarching impact on
   Nigeria's effort to contribute to peacekeeping operations and regional
   partnerships. The paper reveals that militant attacks on oil
   installations reduce government income, which would impede Nigeria's
   efforts at maintaining peace in West Africa, and concludes by
   highlighting key factors that need to be addressed for peace to be
   sustainable.},

Abstract = {Is proposed in this paper the social imaginary in which tourism is based
   in the countryside, an area in crisis but appreciated as a space tourist
   set up once supply conditions. Following the rescue of rural values,
   rural life becomes an object of consumption and is forged in the
   imagination of the tourists to create dreams in these
   spaces-destinations. The aim of this study is to examine the importance
   attributed to the idealization of rural areas in the formation of the
   image of the destination. The empirical study applied to the rural
   tourism in Galicia, conducted with a total of 400 self-administered
   questionnaires, has demonstrated that the current idealization of rural
   space in the collective mind influences significantly the perceived
   image of the destination.},

Abstract = {The image of America that Poles have recalls love: We idealise our
   partner, lionise her merits, and turn a blind eye to her negative
   traits. This attitude feeds on the memory that at important moments in
   the 20th century the United States stood by Poland. But even before
   that, news from abroad influenced Polish national identity, aroused
   admiration, and stirred fascination. Only most recently are there
   indications that a pragmatic cost-benefit analysis could take the place
   of the Poles' romantic inclination toward the United States.},

Abstract = {The Swedish case bears out Lewin's contention, in Self-Interest and
   Public Interest in Western Politics, that public spiritedness is much
   more important than is suggested by public-choice theories positing the
   universal dominance of self-interestedness. However, in Sweden we find
   that public spiritedness on the part of the public-as evidenced, for
   example, in sociotropic voting-was cultivated by political institutions,
   policies, and rhetoric that transformed a divided, conflictual society
   into one in which the ``public interest{''} was both coherent and
   desirable. In turn, this cultivation was the result of decisions by
   politicians that were, in the most simplistic sense, self-interested,
   because they secured the politicians' election and re-election. But the
   goal of election and re-election was to create a just society. In short,
   the politicians, too, were public spirited.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to examine how eye-catching pictures of
   ``ourselves{''} and the ``others{''} as ``strangers{''} are constructed
   from the perspective of ``visual sociology{''}. It shall be
   demonstrated, how pictorial symbolization creates meaning, based on
   cultural patterns of constructing ``us{''} and ``them{''}, which are
   mainly referring to the performance of bodies. First, empirical
   observations lead to the question, how cultural diversity is pictured
   without falling into cliches or even racism. In summary, it shall be
   argued with Alfred Schutz that typification in everyday life cannot be
   avoided. The question is rather what kind of pictorial typification can
   be developed that shows the social normality of cultural diversity in
   public spaces. At the moment, the solution to this question is hardly
   satisfactory and, therefore, it opens up new research ground.},

Pages = {231-256},
Abstract = {This study investigated how far the post-apartheid government has
   progressed in creating a better life for all South Africans. Secondary
   data analysis was employed using the 2008 South African Social Attitudes
   Survey (SASAS) of 3321 randomly selected adult respondents. A series of
   general linear models examined the impact of race, gender, age,
   geographic location, education level, living standard measure (LSM),
   satisfaction with basic services, and fear of crime on quality of life
   (QOL) as measured respectively by subjective well-being indicators,
   namely happiness, life-satisfaction and optimism. 1 The main findings
   were that: 1) Those respondents who feared crime less, had higher LSM
   levels, and were satisfied with basic services reported higher levels of
   happiness. 2) Those respondents who had a higher LSM, feared crime less,
   and were more satisfied with the basic services reported higher
   life-satisfaction. 3) Those respondents who were black African with
   lower levels of education, feared crime less, and were most satisfied
   with basic services displayed the most optimism about the future. We
   concluded that government interventions need to focus more on black
   Africans, the least educated, the low LSM group, those living in the
   urban informal areas, and those who fear crime to significantly improve
   South Africans' QOL.},

Abstract = {This article examines the intellectuality's matter of the First Republic
   and the Estado Novo that throughout the process of re-interpretation of
   their ideas has received the qualitative as authoritarian. Reading some
   main essays of the period, it demonstrates that Alberto Torres, Oliveira
   Vianna, Azevedo Amaral had interacted between them and with their
   political moment to forge an interpretation act as a realistic view
   about Brazil. By this way the article points out the context of these
   ideas and the necessities of their times. Finally it presents that
   depending on the perspective which each one might have about the
   authoritarian tradition, it is also possible to read this tradition by
   other distinct perspectives than the historically consolidated as
   authoritarian.},

Abstract = {Experiments provide a simple and engaging framework for familiarizing

   article, I illustrate how experiments can be used in the classroom
   environment by describing a module that was implemented in four high
   school classrooms. The module familiarized students with how the
   scientific method can be applied to political questions and introduced
   them to basic statistical concepts. This specific lesson plan can serve
   as a model for how more complex and rigorous experimental designs can be
   used to actively engage more advanced (college-level) students in the
   process of research design and statistical analysis.},

Journal = {OSTERREICHISCHE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR POLITIKWISSENSCHAFT},
Year = {2011},

Abstract = {The article analyses the reports and opinions of the National Bioethics
   Commissions of the EU-15 regarding human embryonic stem cell research
   (hES). It argues that although the overall structure of these reports
   and opinions is quite homogeneous, dealing with scientific, legal and
   ethical issues, that the ethical debates focus around two different
   lines of argument. The German and Italian National Bioethics Commissions
   discuss the moral and legal status of the embryo only. Whereas the other
   National Bioethics Commissions go beyond the discussion of the moral and
   legal status of the embryo and focus on ethical aspects regarding the
   protection of women undergoing an intervention for the procurement of
   egg cells. The procurement of egg cells for future parenthood is rated
   differently than the procurement of egg cells for research. The article
   furthermore shows how this difference in the ethical debate on human
   embryonic stem cell research has lead to different legal provisions in
   the respective Member States of the European Union. Furthermore, the
   article offers detailed information on the debate in the Austrian
   Bioethics Commission regarding the respective topic.},

Abstract = {This article provides a comparative study of the consequences of the
   Asian and global financial crises for East Asian regionalism. It
   explains how and why the effects of the two crises on regional
   institutions were divergent. The differences derived from the origins of
   the two upheavals, internal versus external to the region, and from the
   depth of their impact on the affected countries. These generated
   contrasting expectations of how regional institutions might respond,
   which led in turn to diverse perceptions on the need for institutional
   change. The Asian financial crisis underscored the need for new
   overlapping arrangements capable of better defending the region against
   future financial instability. The less severe crisis affecting East Asia
   in 2008, in contrast, has led to a more dispersed and nationally driven
   institutional response. The competing proposals have been driven more by
   a perceived shift in the global power distribution than by any renewed
   or reinforced sense of regional vulnerability or common identity.},

Number = {3},
Pages = {481-500},
Abstract = {The most recent cycle of exhumations of Spanish Civil War (1936-1939)
   and Postwar Mass Graves, which started in the year 2000, has affected
   very specially the location, digging and dignification of those mass
   graves originated by the rebel army's rearguard repression during the
   War and, later, in the early Postwar years of Francoism. These diggings
   have inevitably drawn the country's attention to the most uncanny of all
   National Catholic monuments in the country, The Valley of the Fallen,
   inaugurated by Franco in 1959 and which was to become his own mausoleum
   in 1975. In-between 1959 and 1983, more than 30,000 copses from Civil
   War casualties were drawn to the monument's crypts. This paper analyzes
   the contemporary debates in Spain on the nature and possible fate of
   this controversial monument by following some aspects of Fausto Canales'
   life story, a retired engineer who set out to exhume the body of his
   father and six other neighbours from the mass grave in which they had
   been thrown by members of falange (Spanish Fascist Party) in August of
   1936 in the municipality of Aldeaseca (Avila). After realizing that the
   mass grave was empty, they discovered that the bodies had been exhumed
   in 1959 to be transported to the Valley of the Fallen without any
   permission or knowledge from their relatives. Aldeaseca's discovery has
   been crucial in bringing to public life the fact that corpses of
   Republicans, and not only Franco's loyalists, had been brought to El
   Valle in still unknown numbers},

Title = {Embellishing Welfare State Reforms? Political Trust and the Support for
   Welfare State Reforms in Germany},
Journal = {GERMAN POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {20},
Number = {2},
Pages = {273-292},
Abstract = {Even though political trust has been well studied so far in its
   structure, development and conditions, there are hardly any analyses
   dealing with the important question of what political trust - and
   particularly a lack or decline of political trust - implies for the
   citizens' reaction to public policy and policy changes. This article
   will focus on the effects of political trust on the willingness of
   German citizens to accept recent reforms of retirement pension, health
   care and family aid. It aims to highlight the following questions: Does
   political trust of the population encourage the disposition to support
   welfare state reforms? How do the characteristics of different policy
   reforms affect the impact of political trust on support of reform? The
   empirical evidence presented in this paper underpins the role of
   political trust as a valuable resource in attitudes towards reforms.
   Although political trust is not the most important determinant of
   support for welfare state reform and does not play the same role under
   all circumstances, it impacts positively on approval of reforms.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes changes and determinants of environmental actions
   in the Austrian population since 1994/ 95. Two different types of action
   are being considered here. First, private actions, such as no longer
   driving a car and recycling, and, second, public actions such as taking
   part in demonstrations or signing petitions. Using representative survey
   data, a decline in public actions can be reported while private actions
   have remained relatively stable. Further, public actions are being
   influenced strongly by values and attitudes, but to a lesser extent by
   social structural factors. Private actions, on the other hand, are more
   often determined by social structural factors such as age, gender, and
   economic activity.},

Abstract = {Both the US and the European Union (EU) have been analysed as empires.
   In contrast, this article argues that a reconstructed republican theory
   centred on the fear of domination reveals deeper dynamics in both
   entities. Both entities have external spheres of influence. While the US
   is not dependent on this sphere to sustain internal stability, the EU
   is. When the EU enlargement ends and the external sphere is absorbed,
   the EU's stability and legitimacy might be at risk. A possible solution
   lies in the European Neighbourhood Policy. Strengthening it would
   increase the EU's control over its environment and its normative
   aspects.},

Abstract = {The cities, especially in the developing and emerging countries, are
   growing rapidly. With the geographical proximity, the newcomers are
   hoping for an enhancement of their living standard, so that they even
   bear to settle in spaces of enormous risks. It is predicted that climate
   change will intensify these risks through the extension of extreme
   weather conditions and sea level rise. The result: more and more people
   are living in increasingly risky spaces. But how is the actual
   perception of these risks, when even disastrous events did not seem to
   have any influence on the settling of those spaces? Research in Accra/
   Ghana has now shown that the perpetuality of risk exposition lowers the
   notion and remembrance even of extreme events. This makes adaptations to
   risks, especially in relation to climate change, increasingly
   challenging.},

   Second, the relevance of the European strategy for Austria, concerning
   the reporting on poverty as well as the policies combating poverty and
   social exclusion, are being evaluated. The outcome is more than
   moderate. Even though there has been some progress concerning the
   reporting and discourse on poverty in Austria, the European strategy

Title = {African states, global migration, and transformations in citizenship
   politics},
Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {15},
Number = {2},
Pages = {181-203},
Abstract = {Over the past three decades, relations between African emigrants and
   their home-states have been changing from antagonism to attempts to
   embrace and structure emigrant behaviors. This transformation in the
   conception of emigration and citizenship has hardly been interrogated by
   the growing scholarship on African and global migrations. Three of the
   most contentious strategies to extend the frontiers of loyalty of
   otherwise weak African states, namely dual citizenship or dual
   nationality, the right to vote from overseas, and the right to run for
   public office by emigrants from foreign locations are explored. Evidence
   from a wide range of African emigration states suggests that these
   strategies are neither an embrace of the global trend toward
   extra-territorialized states and shared citizenship between those at
   `home' and others outside the state boundaries, nor are they about
   national development or diaspora welfare. Instead, they seem to be
   strategies to tap into emigrant resources to enhance weakened state
   power. The study interrogates the viability and advisability of emigrant
   voting and political participation from foreign locations, stressing
   their tendency to destabilize homeland political power structures,
   undermine the nurturing of effective diaspora mobilization platforms in
   both home and host states, and export homeland political practices to
   diaspora locations.},

Abstract = {This paper uses the exploration of the grounds of a common criticism of
   luck egalitarianism to try and make an argument about both the proper
   subject of theorizing about justice and how to approach that subject. It
   draws a distinction between what it calls basic structure views and a
   priori baseline views, where the former take the institutional aspects
   of political prescriptions seriously and the latter do not. It argues
   that objections to luck egalitarianism on the grounds of its harshness
   can in part be explained by this blindness to relevant features of
   institutions. Further, it may be that luck egalitarianism cannot regard
   its own enactment as just. A related objection to Ronald Dworkin's
   equality of resources, which claims that it cannot pick a particular
   institutional background to set the costs of resources and so is
   radically indeterminate, is also presented. These results, I argue, give
   us good reason to reject all a priori baseline views.},

   very patient discussions of various ideas and material which appear in
   the paper. Hugh Lazenby, Miriam Ronzoni, Patrick Tomlin and Laura
   Valentini all provided similarly extensive comments on the paper, if
   only once. Daniel McDermott also saw and commented on ancestral versions
   of the material presented here and forced me to clarify various claims,
   as did two anonymous referees for CRISPP. Obviously, any mistakes which
   remain are mine rather than theirs. Earlier versions of this paper were
   presented at the University of Oxford's Graduate Political Theory
   Workshop, at the 2008 Brave New World conference at the University of
   Manchester, at the 2008 London Forum in Moral and Political Philosophy,
   and at the Nuffield Workshop, and I would like to thank those audiences

Abstract = {The article compares the postdemocracy with the postsocialism. At first
   the paper analyzes the debate of the postdemocracy and points out an
   analytical model of postdemocracy. Afterwards the paper searches for
   symptoms of the postdemocracy within the case of Russia which appears as
   one possible ideal type of postsocialism. The comparison shows that both
   post-phenomenons are two sides of one global process of transformation.
   However, the case of postsocialism acts as a trendsetter. The
   postsocialist Russia sets an example for the possible developments of
   the postdemocracy.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the relationship between political stability and
   corruption in weakly institutionalized polities - ``weak states{''}. The
   main hypothesis is that there is a U-shaped relationship between
   political stability and corruption. The lower is the level of political
   stability the higher is the level of corruption, due to reduction of
   time horizon of politicians and bureaucrats. Yet the very high level of
   stability in ``weak states{''} also leads to an increase in the level of
   corruption. The idea is that political elites use corruption as a
   mechanism for loyalty providing by rewarding supporters and controlling
   potential challengers, therefore corruption and political stability can
   be mutually reinforcing. The argument is grounded on the theory of
   inefficient institutions and simple game theoretical model of political
   process. The idea of non-linear relationship between political stability
   and corruption confirms with empirical findings from statistical
   analysis of the data from 122 developing countries.},

Abstract = {The United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) charge is to,
   ``Build a safer, more secure, and more resilient America by preventing,
   deterring, neutralizing, or mitigating the effects of deliberate efforts
   by terrorists to destroy, incapacitate, or exploit elements of our
   Nation's CIKR.{''} using an all-hazards approach. The effective
   implementation of this strategy hinges on understanding catastrophes and
   their potential effect on the functioning of infrastructure.
   Unfortunately, there has been no unifying theory of catastrophe to guide
   decision-making, preparedness, or response. In this paper, the authors
   present a framework based on network science and normal accident theory
   that can be used to guide policy decisions for homeland security. They
   show that exceedance probability encompasses operational definitions of
   risk and resilience and provides a unifying policy framework for
   homeland security investments. Such an approach allows one to classify
   hazards as `high' or `low' risk, according to the resiliency exponent,
   and guide investments toward prevention or response. This framework is
   applied to cyber exploits and electric power grid systems to illustrate
   its generality.},

Abstract = {This article examines the rise and consequences of the Computer TakeBack
   Campaign in the USA, and argues that the campaign's achievements can be
   attributed to its active engagement with the economic, political, and
   discursive opportunity structures. First, the campaign changed the
   political opportunity structure and built political legitimacy for
   itself. Second, the campaign took advantage of the economic opportunity
   structure, created the leader/laggard frame, embarrassed its target, and
   utilized forces of market competition to push the Dell Corporation to
   change its policy. Third, the campaign created a favourable discursive
   opportunity structure by mobilizing college students and framing the
   e-waste crisis as a moral issue. Traditional political process theory
   has been criticized for being overly structuralist and for focusing
   solely on political movements. This case study shows that a modified
   understanding of opportunities can enhance the explanatory power of the
   traditional approach.},

Abstract = {This article looks for common sources to explain the systematic
   electoral change produced between regional and general elections in
   Catalonia and Scotland. In both territories, regional voting shows a
   systematic pattern whereby nationalist parties tend to have more success
   in the regional than in the national arena. Looking for differences and
   similarities between the two patterns, we first revise the literature on
   less mobilizing elections and the different answers given to electoral
   change across arenas in different contexts. Secondly, we use particular
   data to compare those who remain loyal to the main parties with those
   who alternate between them depending on the electoral level. Lastly, we
   test whether this electoral change is better explained by the idea that
   regional elections are dependent on, autonomous or different from
   national politics using multivariate analysis. Two main conclusions
   emerge. On the one hand, electoral change is produced by change in the
   salient issues and a change in the main contending parties at each
   level. For those who change their vote, the regional arena is different
   from the national one. On the other hand, the evaluation of contextual
   elements by the party-switchers is related more to autonomous
   considerations of the regional arena than to dependent evaluations of
   the national one.},

Title = {Is the Great Recession Only the Beginning? Economic Contraction in an
   Age of Fossil Fuel Depletion and Ecological Limits to Growth},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {33},
Number = {4},
Pages = {555-575},
Abstract = {The conventional explanation for the ``Great Recession{''} is that a
   pro-business administration advanced deregulatory policies in the
   mortgage industry and broader financial industries, leading to a
   predictable but temporary economic recession. In contrast, peak oil
   analysts find a deeper root cause of the Great Recession. Secure and
   reliable access to cheap fossil fuels is fundamental to our industrial
   and post-industrial world, and the rising costs of fossil fuels due to
   post-peak depletion in the face of escalating demand make difficult the
   realization of economic growth. However, as individuals, companies, and
   lawmakers insist upon continued economic growth, these actors pressure
   lawmakers to endorse riskier and more shortsighted techniques aimed at
   extending domestic and global economic growth a little bit longer. The
   Great Recession can be understood in part as a consequence of US
   consumption of massive quantities of petroleum at a moment in history
   during which global oil production approached and surpassed its peak.},

Abstract = {In this essay, the author presents new research, as well as surveys
   existing interpretations, of the history of pogroms in Ukraine during
   the Holocaust. Focusing on western Ukraine during summer 1941, the
   author determines that across the region Jews were the primary targets
   of attacks, but the politics and dynamic of the mob violence and among
   the occupation forces varied from place to place. Besides the powerful,
   antisemitic charge of Judeo-Bolshevism, the author explores other
   political, social, psychological and ideological causes of the violence.
   She stresses the cross section of society represented among the
   pogromists, and the role of nationalist insurgents and German occupation
   officials. The author traces the relationship between the German-led
   mass shootings and the pogroms, and argues that distinctions made
   between mob violence and genocide usually fail to account for the
   changing interaction of the two phenomena. The overlapping, escalating
   history of the two is especially evident in western Volhynia where,
   unlike in neighbouring Galicia, the number of Jews killed in mass
   shootings exceeded those killed in pogroms. Thus by the end of September
   1941, in the eastern capital of Kiev, there was no large pogrom
   comparable to the `Petliura Days', in L'viv, instead there was Babi Yar.},

Abstract = {This article formulates a deterrence theory of punishment based on
   Lockean premises. Following authors such as Warren Quinn and Daniel
   Farrell, it is claimed that a justification for the right to punish must
   be built upon the recognition of the importance of a right to issue
   retaliatory threats. Contrary to those authors, however, the
   articulation of such recognition is made within a Lockean theory of
   individual rights. This allows us to appreciate the specific role
   deterrence has in a plausible conception of punishment, and thus address
   certain objections that have been formulated recently, especially by
   David Boonin.},

Journal = {POLITISCHE VIERTELJAHRESSCHRIFT},
Year = {2011},

Pages = {399-423},
Abstract = {In recent years, the recognition of the multiple benefits related to
   energy efficiency has become more and more pronounced both at the
   national and the international level. Therefore, governments worldwide
   have adopted miscellaneous energy efficiency policies in order to
   promote the efficient use of energy in all sectors. This study aims at
   analyzing the impact energy efficiency policies have on the electricity
   consumption of private households in international comparison. In this
   context, the study focuses on identifying which policy or combination of
   policies is most effective, using Qualitative Comparative Analysis (in
   the fuzzy set version) as a method suited to answer this kind of
   research question. The results indicate that policies, when applied in
   combination, are sufficient for the reduction of electricity consumption
   in private households, with the impact of institutions in combination
   with norms and standards being the most outstanding. Slow economic
   growth is identified as an important context factor making it more
   likely for electricity savings to occur.},

Abstract = {Evidence for long-term cycles in the parliamentary seat share of the
   major British parties is presented in this article. Spectral analysis of
   data from 1832 to 2005 suggests a cycle period of about twenty-eight
   years, similar to findings in US studies and to cycle-length estimates
   restricted to the post-1950 period in Britain. A four-parameter
   voter-party interaction model developed by Merrill, Grofman and Brunell
   is adapted and applied to Britain. That model depends on tensions
   between parties' policy and office motivations and between voters'
   tendency to sustain the governing party while reacting against
   non-centrist policies. The model operates homeostatically, projects
   patterns consistent with the empirical record and fits the data better
   than models based on economic factors or autoregressive predictions.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to analyze the regulatory changes in the
   international development policy of the Catalonia administration.
   Elements of change are analyzed through the evolution of policy
   instruments and the establishment of the Catalan Agency for Development
   Cooperation to understand significant changes in the policy design. The
   period considered is more than two decades, from 1986, when the first
   budget on aid for development, called Third World Aid, passed by law.
   The main approach relies on the public policy theory of regulation.},

   refugees},
Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {15},
Number = {6-7},
Pages = {679-693},
Abstract = {The current US refugee resettlement system reflects the US government's
   agenda of having refugees acquire quick employment with low state
   welfare dependence and minimal fiscal and cultural disruption to the
   receiving communities. The non-governmental organizations (NGOs)
   assisting refugees hold broader goals for refugees, including feeling a
   sense of belonging in the USA. These goals represent a framing of social
   citizenship rights for refugees, and how NGOs frame social citizenship
   varies depending upon the NGOs contractual relationship with the US
   welfare state. Using data from 57 in-depth interviews, I describe how
   resettlement and assistance NGOs currently frame social citizenship for
   refugees in relation to market citizenship, and how their relationship
   with the federal government shapes this framing. Findings illustrate the
   role of NGOs in creating a discursive space for expanding the social
   citizenship rights of refugees and the ways such framing is highly
   constrained by the definitions of belonging that emerge from market
   citizenship.},

Abstract = {In unitary federal systems one might expect that - despite federal
   structures - citizenship remains more or less `nationalized'. Our fresh
   data (CANS) throw new light on three elements which make up citizenship:
   a political, a social and an identity dimension. We find that in the
   unitary federal systems of Austria and Germany citizens do not choose
   between regional and national citizenship. Instead they develop a
   multi-level-citizenship which they see as the most adequate
   self-definition for their role in unitary federalism.},

Abstract = {The article analyzes paradoxes of regulation system that emerge at the
   juncture of bureaucratic structures. E.Paneyakh shows by the example of
   the Russian criminal procedure that once regulation density passes a
   certain threshold coordinating properties of institutions that regulate
   relations inside departments are at odds with their transaction
   properties. The more influence department rules exert over the system of
   an agent's incentives (limiting the scope of his/her opportunities), the
   more transaction problems between agents from different departments
   functioning within the distinct institutional context they create. This
   problem results in the emergence of informal institutions that reconcile
   interests of these agents, while the density of interdepartmental
   regulations leads to the fact that the object of their activity becomes
   the most easily accessible source of resources that are necessary to
   satisfy sides.},

   Implications},
Journal = {POLITIX},

Volume = {24},
Number = {94},
Pages = {35+},
Abstract = {By what process does a legal distinction that was previously accepted
   (whether based on sex, sexual orientation, nationality, age or marital
   status) become publicly perceived as discriminatory? This question can
   be understood both as a research question within the sociology of social
   movements or the historiography of the struggles for equality; and as a
   question of political tactics where it concerns the strategies that
   would be appropriate to demonstrating the illegitimacy of a particular
   legal distinction. This article examines the articulation of these two
   point of views on the crisis of the justification of legal distinction:
   that of the sociological and historical investigation, and that of
   action. After reviewing the conditions of possibility of a history of
   the contestation of legal distinctions, it analyzes the political
   implications of this historical narrative, focusing particularly on the
   operations of comparison between contemporary demands for equality and
   previous demands, which are now legitimate.},

Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {15},
Number = {2},
Pages = {247-263},
Abstract = {Multiple citizenship has in recent decades moved from an unwanted
   phenomenon in international relations to a fairly common transnational
   status. Multiple citizenship has nevertheless so far been studied mainly
   as a political and juridical status by comparing national legislations.
   Much less notice has been given to actual dual citizens' citizen
   participation and construction of citizens' identities. Only when
   citizenship is studied as these kinds of practices do the hypothetic
   possibilities and problems associated with the status get their meanings
   and contents. This paper concentrates on examining dual citizens'
   identifications to their respective citizenships and how these
   affiliations transfer into possible citizen participation. Results are
   based on extensive analysis of survey (n=335) and interviews (n=48)
   carried out among dual citizens living in Finland. Contents and forms of
   dual citizens' national identification and citizen participation were
   reviewed through ideal types: resident-mononationals,
   expatriate-mononationals, hyphenationals, and shadow-nationals.},

   South Korea in 1988},
Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {18},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1246-1269},
Abstract = {Most theories about electoral system choice are based on the experiences
   of Western European countries, many of which shifted from
   majority/plurality rule to proportional representation (PR) at the turn
   of the twentieth century. This article aims to explain the choice of the
   South Korean legislative electoral system in 1988 as an example of
   electoral institution choices in new democracies, which may be different
   from those in the Western European countries. Through analysing multiple
   steps leading to the choice of a single-member district plurality voting
   system, this article suggests three potentially generalizable findings.
   First, in new democracies, labour parties can only induce old parties to
   shift to a proportional representation system if they have mobilized the
   working class prior to democratization. Secondly, parties in the
   developing world at times face unusual systems that are neither
   majoritarian nor fully PR. Under such unusual systems, party size would
   not be a reliable predictor for the party's preference over electoral
   institutions. Finally, when parties choose a legislative electoral
   institution in a presidential system, parties tend to prefer an
   institution that helps them in the subsequent presidential election even
   though the institution might harm them in the upcoming legislative
   election.},

Abstract = {The debate about archiving and reusing qualitative data is spreading, an
   increasing number of countries launched not only quantitative, but also
   qualitative data archives. This article describes the state of art of
   qualitative data-archiving in Europe and the developments that have
   taken place in this field since the 1990s, exploring some of the most
   essential requirements and problems for successfully establishing a
   national qualitative archive and referring furthermore to the Austrian
   data archive WISDOM as an example. Technical issues, tools and standards
   necessary for proper data documentation, archiving and distribution of
   high-quality data sets as well as the underlying legal conditions and
   the separate steps of the archiving process are being discussed.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the Constitutional Court case on the Preamble of the
   Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia (STC 31/2010). For the Spanish Court,
   the Statute cannot be regarded as an original Constitution derived from
   a constituent power. On the contrary, the Statute is a law derived from
   the Spanish Constitution. From this point of view, we analyze the
   following issues: a) first, the possibility of a constitutional control
   of the preambles of the laws; b) secondly, the question about the
   meaning and scope of the effectiveness of the preamble regarding the
   terms of nation and national reality of Catalonia; c) thirdly, the
   reasoning of the Courts on historical law.},

Abstract = {The involvement of non-state armed organisations (NSAOs) in illegal
   economies is often seen as a sign of the changing nature of contemporary
   armed conflicts. In particular, it is assumed that they no longer care
   about winning over the people's `hearts and minds' and become violent
   and abusive towards the population. This paper challenges these claims
   and shows how, despite their involvement in criminal activities, NSAOs
   in South Bolivar still continued their attempts at developing and
   strengthening a local political base. Moreover, excessive violence
   against civilians was not directly related to the drug economy but aimed
   at achieving political and military ends.},

Volume = {5},

Pages = {38-54},
Abstract = {Do women in municipal politics encounter the same level of media bias as
   women in national politics? Does every type of newspapers exhibit a bias
   against women municipal politicians, if at all? These questions guided a
   study of how three daily and three community newspapers portrayed women
   council candidates during the 2007 Alberta municipal elections. Using
   content and discourse analysis, the study compared how journalists
   reported on female and male candidates' personal traits such as age,
   appearance, family situation, gender, and emotions as well as their
   policy ideas and public utterances. Results from the study indicate that
   while local women politicians do face a subtle sexism, the media
   environment they encounter while campaigning is generally more
   gender-neutral and hospitable to them than the one awaiting women vying
   for elite national office. Thus, women contemplating a bid for council
   should not be concerned that local journalists will obsess about their
   looks or otherwise overtly disadvantage them before prospective voters.},

Abstract = {Following Wendy Brown's theoretical reflections on neoliberal political
   rationality, the article describes some of the impacts this has for
   liberal democracies. The article focuses on a theoretical analysis of
   neoliberal political rationality and what effects this has had on
   democratic institutions such as free elections and the public sphere.
   The change from legislative politics to the rule of law is also put into
   question to understand how changes in institutional power are taking
   place within the political rationality of neoliberalism. Alongside with
   this change of power, the discursive rearticulation of democratic terms
   into neoliberal market rationality is put into question.},

Journal = {POLITIX},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {24},
Number = {96},
Pages = {141+},
Abstract = {Ethnographic observation is a preferred method of enquiry to capture
   informal political discussions, and thus to understand better the
   process of politicization. The results from the field work presented
   here shows that humor is one of the ways informal discussions are
   politicized, in particular in public group contexts, because humor
   lessens the possibility of dissension inherent in political discussions.
   Introducing political content in the form of humor makes it possible for
   the speaker to test implicit political ideas, without taking the risk of
   creating conflict. The failure of a humor event is a trial for the
   participants in the group discussion, but is it less profound and risky
   than a disagreement voiced during a serious confrontation. Studying
   humor events contributes to the renewing and better understanding of how
   politicization operates.},

   Results from an expert survey experiment},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {30},
Number = {4},
Pages = {858-864},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Expert surveys are frequently used in comparative politics to measure
   the ideological locations of political parties. However, it is possible
   that increasing the number of parties to place systematically biases
   results as experts try to fit more actors onto a common space. We test
   this possibility with an experiment embedded in an ``expert{''} survey -
   with graduate students serving as our pool of experts to ensure an
   adequate sample size - by varying the number of parties to be placed in
   the United Kingdom and Germany. We find some tendency for the variance
   of Labor and SPD placements to diminish when more parties are present,
   and for SPD placements to move toward the center given more parties.
   However, we find no consistent evidence that the number of parties
   systematically affects mean or median party placements. Our results
   support the reliability of expert surveys as an indicator of party
   ideology. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Conditional Cash Transfer programs are currently at a crossroads,
   between consolidating minimum safety nets and laying the basis for
   universal social policy. In assessing which direction CCTs will take, it
   is important to analyze their formation. What domestic actors have been
   influential and how have expert-driven international ideas entered the
   domestic policy process? Is the impact related to existing welfare
   regimes? In this article the authors show that in general CCTs are the
   product of top-down and closed policy formation by elite coalitions, in
   which international factors play a central role. Nevertheless, domestic
   factors associated with welfare regimes, in particular the difference
   between state and non-state, informal regimes, account for important
   cross-national variations. If CCTs are to become a stepping-stone to
   universal social policy, closed policy communities have to be opened up.},

Abstract = {How do organized interests respond to their opponents' advocacy
   activities in a policy venue? Utilizing data on amicus curiae filings at
   the U.S. Supreme Court, the author estimates vector error correction and
   vector autoregression models that allow him test whether interests
   respond, in a dynamic sense, to the efforts of the ``other side.{''} The
   author capitalizes on the temporal sequencing of variation in advocacy
   activity to gain leverage on the causal connection between the behaviors
   of opposing sets of interests and provides a richer portrait of the
   dynamics of interest representation in a policy venue. The results
   reveal that organized interests respond positively to the advocacy
   activities of their opponents by exhibiting both short-term
   counteraction and long-term countermobilization, implying that over the
   long run, interest representation at the Court is responsive and perhaps
   balanced.},

Abstract = {Much of the current literature on compulsory voting (CV) examines its
   effects by simulating complete turnout We argue that these studies do
   not capture the full effects of CV, as there is something qualitatively
   different about compulsory voting rules as compared to only increasing
   turnout. Furthermore, CV and turnout have important, yet unexplored,
   interactive effects. To test this argument, we look at governments in 43
   countries over the 1990-2006 period. Nine of these countries have some
   form of CV. We examine the effect of CV on the ideological position and
   range of governments, left party seat share, and the effective number of
   parties. We find that high turnout in the presence of CV laws spreads
   out the distribution of voters and leads to an increase in the effective
   number of parliamentary parties and a larger ideological range of
   governments. These results have important implications for how we study
   CV and its consequences for party strategy. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {The Arab revolution has a long way to go before settling itself and
   establishing a calm and stable climate conducive to democracy in the
   region. Some Western circles envision the creation of a moderately
   Islamic and relatively democratic Sunnite ``belt{''} in the Middle East.
   This approach rests on the assumption that ``moderate Islam{''} is the
   antidote of ``radical Islam{''}, which does not match oriental
   realities. The AKP government in Turkey is aware of the fact that
   ``moderate Islam{''} is an inaccurate concept. However, it pays lip
   service to the advocates of this idea and aspires to the leadership of a
   Sunnite belt. The real antidote against radicalism is for the
   international community to support the aspirations of the Arab peoples,
   rather than attempting to exploit the current political climate.},

Abstract = {Ever since Viktor Orban came to power, Hungarian politics has been like
   a football game in which the captain of one team changes the rules at
   will, appoints the referee, and can even eject opposing players from the
   field. Separation of powers has been abolished, equality before the law
   nullified. Orban writes laws that are crafted with precision for
   individual persons or groups - be it for friend or foe. Using
   intimidation and blackmail, Fidesz is pushing forward a change of elites
   and a redistribution of property. Castigation of scapegoats and
   systematic character assassination have become constitutive elements of
   economic policy.},

Abstract = {Political consumerism is the intentional buying or abstention from
   buying specific products for political, social, or ethical purposes. We
   develop and test hypotheses regarding the individual sources of
   political consumerism in the United States. Analysis of survey data
   shows that similar to voting, education, political interest, and citizen
   duty promote political consumerism. Akin to protest behavior, political
   consumerism is enhanced by political distrust and general discontent. In
   contrast to turnout, political consumerism significantly decreases with
   age. Given the extraelectoral and self-initiated nature of political
   consumerism, citizen initiative and a proclivity for individualized
   forms of activism are significant sources of political consumerism.},

Abstract = {In the mid-1990s, Brazil and Mexico created innovative social policies
   known as Conditional Cash Transfers (CCTs). Since then, CCTs have spread
   to countries throughout Latin America and beyond. While these programs
   reflect a new development norm, their spread is surprising given that
   some emulating countries lack the basic education and health
   infrastructure to support increased demand from beneficiaries. This
   article draws on a policy diffusion framework to explain the spread of
   CCTs. The author contrasts domestic preconditions (political ideology,
   state capacity and human development levels) with international pressure
   (neighborhood effects, professional norm-creation and financial
   inducements by international financial institutions) to explain the
   diffusion of CCTs. In order to elucidate the mechanisms that drive
   diffusion processes, the article draws on mixed methods to uncover
   learning and emulation among actors.},

Title = {Keeping party programmes on track: the transmission of the policy
   agendas of executive speeches to legislative outputs in the United
   Kingdom},
Journal = {EUROPEAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {3},
Number = {3},
Pages = {395-417},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In the United Kingdom, the transmission between policy promises and
   statutes is assumed to be both rapid and efficient because of the
   tradition of party discipline, relative stability of government, absence
   of coalitions, and the limited powers of legislative revision in the
   second chamber. Even in the United Kingdom, the transmission is not
   perfect since legislative priorities and outputs are susceptible to
   changes in public opinion or media coverage, unanticipated events in the
   external world, backbench rebellions, changes in the political parties,
   and the practical constraints of administering policies or programmes.
   This paper investigates the strength of the connection between executive
   priorities and legislative outputs measured by the Speech from the
   Throne and Acts of Parliament from 1911 to 2008. These are categorized
   according to the policy content coding system of the UK Policy Agendas
   Project (www.policyagendas.org.uk). Time series cross-sectional analyses
   show that there is transmission of the policy agenda from the speech to
   acts. However, the relationship differs by party, strengthening over
   time for Conservative governments and declining over time for Labour and
   other governments.},

   approved the law known as the ``Disarmament Statute{''} to strengthen
   control over the guns in circulation in the country. The results came
   immediately: five thousand lives saved during the law's first year in
   effect, meaning a decrease of the homicide rates in Brazil for the first
   time in over a decade. Six years later, Instituto Sou da Paz presents a
   new study evaluating the implementation of the measures established by
   the Disarmament Statute and offering recommendations to the responsible
   governmental instances, intending to guarantee the legislation is fully
   implemented, in hopes further thousands of deaths can be prevented.},

Abstract = {Recent critics have argued that the concept of deliberation guiding much
   democratic theory is an overly rationalized one that undervalues the
   role of emotion in political communication. In this essay, I probe the
   puzzles of political judgment that come into view once we consider
   emotion a morally appropriate element of democratic communication. I
   argue that Aristotle's understanding of reason, emotion, and rhetoric
   directs our attention to ``emotion talk{''} and offers resources for
   illuminating the worldly effects of beliefs about emotion in a context
   of inequality. Reflecting on the effects of how we listen to emotion
   talk can provoke consideration of the citizen ethos we desire.},

Abstract = {Direct influence over communication media is a potent resource during
   electoral campaigns, and politicians have an incentive to gain control
   of the airwaves to advance their careers. In this article, we use data
   on community radio license applications in Brazil to identify both the
   causal effect of incumbency on politicians' ability to control the media
   and the causal effect of media control on their future electoral
   prospects. Using a regression discontinuity design, we compare city
   council candidates who barely won or barely lost an election, showing
   that incumbency more than doubles the probability of an application's
   approval by the Ministry of Communications. Next, using genetic
   matching, we compare candidates who acquired community radio licenses
   before an election to similar politicians who did not, showing that a
   radio station substantially increases one's vote share and probability
   of victory. These findings demonstrate that media control helps entrench
   local political power in Brazil.},

Abstract = {Classic writings on political decision making with respect to war
   traditionally emphasize grand strategies. But such European generated
   theories are often inapplicable in less developed areas of the world,
   and in which nation building remains suspect and incomplete. This
   article emphasizes the difficulty in policy approaches that rest on
   older doctrines of total war and well defined victory or defeat. The new
   21st century ``model{''} often admits only of political indecisions and
   military constraints. All sectors of advanced societies such as the
   United States are thus involved in issues such as traditional customs,
   militant religions, and socioeconomic alignments that limit military
   actions. While issue of war and peace remain intact, and in many
   instances protracted over time, the need for revised practices on the
   ground have become a central need and concern of economically advanced
   nations. This makes for a search of effective and appropriate ways for
   the conduct of humane military actions coupled with democratic civilian
   ambitions. Where such ends are not feasible, then caution should
   prevail.},

Abstract = {Institutional rules that create winners and losers can also compel those
   who anticipate losing to quit that institution. In legislatures, these
   anticipatory exits have implications both for representation and our
   understanding of how seniority systems work. The current project
   constructs a model of anticipatory exit in which legislators who are not
   favoured under the rules leave, thus making room in the seniority queue
   for their more favoured colleagues. Empirical analysis of the US House
   of Representatives supports the model: Legislators most distant from
   their party are about as likely to run for higher office as they are to
   receive institutional power, whereas those most proximate to the party
   virtually never run for higher office and almost certainly receive a
   subcommittee chair.},

Abstract = {Party institutionalisation is a central problem in political science.
   The literature tends to understand it as a syndrome and therefore has
   difficulty explaining variations. This article suggests a new approach
   based on the transaction between a legislative party and its deputies,
   the failure of which is observable in party switching. Three routes to
   institutionalisation are identified by appealing to the vote-seeking,
   office-seeking or policy-seeking motivations of deputies. Poland has had
   a large volume of party switching, along with wide variation in the
   incentives facing differently-motivated deputies. Survival analyses of
   switching in four Polish parliaments find that vote-seeking is the most
   likely route to institutionalisation for Polish parties. Moreover, in
   this article a concrete hypothesis is established for comparative
   testing: legislative parties can survive as long as their popular
   support exceeds 40 per cent of their share in the previous election.},

Abstract = {This article extends the application of the public service motivation
   (PSM) construct from differences between volunteers and employees in the
   public, nonprofit, and private sectors to the phenomenon of political
   activities that occurs during the public policy process. Based upon
   regression analysis performed on a sample of undergraduate students
   enrolled in introductory political science courses at a large public
   university, PSM appears to affect overall levels of political
   participation. Additionally, the rational, normative, and affective
   dimensions of PSM appear to affect specific types of political activity
   in different manners. This article argues that the PSM construct
   provides a way to measure individual-level receptiveness to civic
   motivators, an important purposive incentive that spurs political
   participation.},

Journal = {PARTY POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {17},
Number = {5},
Pages = {655-672},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The study of party unity and its determinants is conceptually confusing,
   with terms such as `party discipline' and `party cohesion' used to
   denote both dependent and independent variables. Moreover, while the
   literature recognizes both anticipated sanctions and homogeneity of
   preferences as pathways to party unity, it ignores possibilities such as
   party loyalty and the division of labour within parliamentary parties.
   The article examines these different pathways to party unity on the
   basis of five waves of interviews with nearly all members of the Lower
   House of the Dutch parliament. The article finds least evidence for
   sanctions as a major determinant of party unity, with the possible
   exception of parties in the governing coalition. Homogeneity, loyalty
   and division of labour all seem to play an important role. Party unity
   might seem over determined, but the more likely explanation offered is
   that it is a case of `different horses for different courses'.},

Abstract = {Distrusting democrats seek accountability and advocate reform in
   established democracies. Do they behave similarly in new democracies?
   Using Americas Barometer survey data, cluster analysis identifies five
   profiles of democratic support in Chile: democrat, delegative,
   fair-weather, illiberal, and autocrat. Chilean distrusting democrats are
   more active in protest politics but less active in electoral politics
   than other Chileans, especially fair-weather democrats. The support
   profiles better predict these behaviors than the classic Linzian and
   Churchillian measures of democratic support. Thus, distrusting democrats
   in Chile only partially emulate their counterparts in established
   democracies, suggesting citizen-led democratic reforms in new
   democracies could be far more challenging.},

Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICS RESEARCH},

Pages = {885-920},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The popularity of congressional caucuses is puzzling, given the
   dominance of political parties and rules that specifically limit
   caucuses' resources. Yet modern caucuses offer legislators the unique
   advantage of complete discretion over their membership decisions, which
   allows legislators to tailor their memberships to their district. As a
   result, caucus membership is an important means of constituency
   representation. Using original data from the 108th Congress, this
   article examines the House caucus system and legislators' membership in
   all 441caucuses. There is strong evidence that legislators' decisions
   about caucus membership reflect their constituents even when controlling
   for party, committee, electoral security, and seniority. Legislators
   from heterogeneous districts belong to numerous caucuses, which allows
   them to represent the multiple interests in their constituency. In
   addition, legislators are more likely to belong to caucuses that address
   specific issues relevant to constituents.},

Abstract = {In the acquisition of listed corporation, the controlling shareholders
   who either hold a certain number of shares, or play a decisive role in
   the transfer of corporation control. Compared with the minority
   shareholders, controlling shareholders often abuse its dominant position
   to harm other stakeholders' interests of the corporation. Imposing the
   fiduciary duties to the controlling shareholders is an important legal
   measure to protect the targeted corporation and the minority
   shareholders' legitimate rights and interests. This paper describes the
   theoretical basis, the specific content and protection mechanisms of
   controlling shareholders' fiduciary duties, so as to provide
   instructions in improving our legislation.},

   of conciliation politic sponsored by union liberal. To rise the
   political stability and coming to parliamentary practice was necessary
   the party system renovation, until then characterized by a politic
   dualism between progresistas and moderados, both of them absorbed in a
   fragmentation and dissolution intense process. Union liberal wasn't able
   to formulate a common and coherent discourse, including different
   proposes about his party condition and what politic project should be
   pursuit, making difficult the reformist strategy and causing dissensions
   in own files at a long time. The union liberal formulation as a new
   party inside party system and moderados and progresistas resistance to
   lose their own identity prevented, finally, the exit of the liberal
   conciliation project.},

Abstract = {Today's global challenges like poverty reduction, climate change and
   disarmament transcend national borders. The scale and impact of these
   problems not only trouble national governments, but also directly affect
   populations at the local level, especially those in urban settings.
   Seeing that over half of today's population resides in cities, this
   research aims at examining concerted attempts of cities and local
   governments in resolving global challenges in major issue-domains.
   Conceptualizing city-to-city co-operations in a networked format, the
   project focuses on providing a typology of an exploding number of
   city-networks that emerged in recent years. By displaying regular
   patterns of network characteristics, the project seeks to systematically
   comprehend the potentials and limits of engaging cities into global
   governance effort in complement to, or in absence of, existing
   state-centric governance instruments.},

Journal = {PARTY POLITICS},

Volume = {17},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {488-504},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This article raises questions about how best to assess the performance
   of radical left parties participating in coalition governments. Drawing
   in part on interviews (see Appendix 1), it covers parties that have
   participated in coalition government (Cyprus, Finland, France, Ireland,
   Italy, Norway), or have acted as `support parties' (Denmark, Sweden), or
   are debating the `pros and cons' of coalition participation
   (Netherlands). It undertakes a comparative analysis of how radical left
   parties themselves evaluate the measure of their achievements and
   failings in coalition government - a critical exercise for such parties
   that can influence their tactical and strategic decisions about future
   government participation, as well as the ability of the parties to
   survive political and electoral setbacks. The approach we adopt is one
   that takes the policy, office and votes triad developed by political
   scientists seriously, but also factors in the principles, political
   outlook and goals of the parties themselves. It concludes that the
   experience of coalition government for radical left parties is far from
   encouraging to date. Their few achievements have to be set against many
   potential pitfalls. Whilst there may be no alternative to government
   participation if these parties wish to be taken seriously as actors, a
   more strategic and cautious approach to coalition formation seems
   advisable in many instances.},

Abstract = {Critics of legislative delegation to the bureaucracy worry that
   delegation undermines the accountability of politicians to voters. This
   article provides microfoundations for such concerns by examining a model
   of electoral agency in which legislators can either determine policy
   directly or delegate policymaking authority to an expert bureaucrat. In
   our model, when deciding whether to delegate, a politician must consider
   not only the policy consequences of his delegation decision but also the
   electoral consequences. We identify conditions under which delegation
   can provide politicians with an element of plausible deniability which
   they lack when they determine policy directly. In some circumstances,
   therefore, voters can be better off when legislators' ability to
   delegate is restricted.},

Abstract = {This article raises addressed the problem of transnational migration
   from the concepts of motion and social action (migration), as well as
   collective action from the position of the actor and social subject
   (migrant). Proposing here that the movement and transnational spaces are
   forming networks, marking new guidelines territorialisation
   transnational. Thus, with these theoretical elements, may arise that the
   migrant is that social actor who has managed to exercise a control over
   their activities, living their historicity and loosened rules and forms
   of reproduction to produce its own cultural model, this was a process
   that produced a change in the structure and functioning of a social
   system leading to the migration process; a series of complex systems,
   resulting in networks in which support to play this migrant system have
   been formed in this process.},

Abstract = {The article analyses the rise and fall of the Counter- guerrilla
   movement (the ``Contra{''}) in Nicaragua. This process is situated in
   the context of the Sandinista Revolution (1979 - 1990) and the programme
   of structural reforms of the Sandinista government. The article traces
   the beginning and expansion of the process of exclusion and alienation
   of certain population segments, particularly with respect to the
   ethnicities of the Atlantic coast and the middle class segments of the
   peasant population in the frontier region with Honduras. It also
   emphasises the role of external forces (the Argentinean army, the CIA)
   on matters of training and financing. Then it analyses the development
   of the social and military campaigns during the armed conflict that
   broke out. It concludes with an analysis of the most important
   consequence: The economic, social and political draining of the
   Sandinista Revolution after the military victory against the Sandinista
   forces, and the electoral defeat in 1990 of the Sandinista movement.},

Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICS RESEARCH},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {39},

Abstract = {Under the acclimation effect view, recent appointees to the Court modify
   their behavior in systematic ways early in their tenure as opposed to
   their later decisional tendencies. Similarly, many studies have examined
   the chief justice's unique behavior. his study blends these two rich
   strands and explores whether chief justices demonstrate an acclimation
   effect, such that their behavior changes systematically through time.
   Using more than a century of Court data, this study examines whether new
   chief justices' concurrence and dissent rates decline and whether they
   write fewer individual opinions gradually. I find that the chief
   justice's position serves to create an incentive structure that is
   uniquely associated with declining rates of specially concurring and
   dissenting votes in certain cases. Also, new chief justices pen fewer
   special concurrences and dissents in some policy areas. My results hence
   imply that the chief justice experiences unique acclimation effects in
   learning to marshal the Court.},

Abstract = {As long as there has been democratic government, skeptics have worried
   that citizens would base their choices and their votes on superficial
   considerations. A series of recent studies seems to validate these
   fears, suggesting that candidates who merely look more capable or
   attractive perform better in elections. In this article, we examine the
   underlying process behind the appearance effect. Specifically, we test
   whether the effect of appearance is more pronounced among those who know
   little about politics but are exposed to visual images of candidates. To
   do so, we combine appearance-based assessments of U. S. Senate and
   gubernatorial candidates with individual-level survey data measuring
   vote intent, political knowledge, and television exposure. Confirming
   long-standing concerns about image and television, we find that
   appealing-looking politicians benefit disproportionately from television
   exposure, primarily among less knowledgeable individuals.},

Abstract = {Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) are an important factor
   in the socio-economic development of transitioning and developing
   countries. Given the importance of ICT in global social and economic
   development, many researchers have examined its development and growth
   strategies from national and governmental policy perspectives. However,
   understanding the consequences of information and communication
   technologies in developing countries is complex and far from certain.
   Given the ambiguity, complexity, and diversity of what constitutes ICT,
   Heeks (2002) suggested the existence of incongruencies between what
   policy makers envision as ICT and the actuality of what is ultimately
   manifested, proposing the ``designactuality gap{''} framework to
   understand this inconsistency. Baqir et al. (2009) extended the
   design-actuality gap framework to show that the dimensions of design
   maybe different than those of the actuality, but did not provide an
   explanation for this gap. In this paper, the authors posit that the gap
   can only be explained based on the law of ``unintended consequence{''}
   (Merton, 1936). This phenomenon can best be seen in developing nations
   where ICT's impact on socio-economic development is exaggerated. The
   authors present the case of the Islamic Republic of Iran and show how
   the law of unintended consequence can explain the major chasm that
   exists between ICT development and the actuality of use.},

Abstract = {The modernisation of Conservative Party employment relations policy
   under David Camerons leadership has been a contested process, but is
   divisible into three broad phases. A modernising trend, 20052008, was
   eclipsed by the resurgence of a more established approach, 20082010,
   highlighting the desirability of deregulation, opposition to European
   Union social and employment legislation, confronting the public sector
   workforce and hostility towards trade unions. The run up to, and
   aftermath of, the 2010 General Election saw modernisation partially
   reasserted. This demonstrates the dynamic nature of Conservative Party
   change under Camerons leadership and the need to recognise the
   trajectory of modernisation.},

Abstract = {In the wake of the Cold War, democracy has gained the status of a
   mantra. Yet there is no consensus about how to conceptualize and measure
   regimes such that meaningful comparisons can be made through time and
   across countries. In this prescriptive article, we argue for a new
   approach to conceptualization and measurement. We first review some of
   the weaknesses among traditional approaches. We then lay out our
   approach, which may be characterized as historical, multidimensional,
   disaggregated, and transparent. We end by reviewing some of the payoffs
   such an approach might bring to the study of democracy.},

Abstract = {The process of establishing a constitution for Europe came to an end
   when voters in France and the Netherlands rejected the proposal.
   Analyzing both media coverage and survey data, this article seeks to
   disentangle the reasons why a majority of voters rejected the European
   Constitution. The authors' findings suggest that the campaign played an
   important role in priming certain attitudes and that vote choices, in
   turn, were driven by specific issue concerns rather than general
   dissatisfaction with the European Union or national governments. These
   findings have implications not only for our understanding of direct
   democracy in Europe but also for the study of campaign effects.},

Abstract = {During his first two years in office, fulfilling prominent campaign
   promises, Barack Obama pushed through legislation attacking the
   recession and its causes, initiated sweeping reforms in the health care
   system, and shifted U. S. forces from Iraq to Afghanistan. His reward
   was to see his Democratic Party suffer a crushing defeat in the 2010
   elections. I examine the contours of opinion regarding Obama before he
   was elected and as they subsequently evolved during his early presidency
   in order to understand where, how, and why the president's legislative
   and policy successes turned into political failures.},

Abstract = {We use our ``PM and Pendulum{''} Model to forecast the outcome of the
   2010 General election. The vote function of the model, aside from a
   cyclical dynamic, relies on approval of the prime minister as the sole
   predictor. We find that PM Approval predicts the vote (and vote
   intention between elections) more accurately than does Government
   Approval. Turning to the forecasting of seats, we examine the accuracy
   of the autoregressive model of the vote-seat translation against the
   uniform-swing model, which is widely used by pollsters and the media.
   Testing the alternatives on election data since 1910, our autoregressive
   vote-seat translation model proves superior to the uniform-swing model.

Abstract = {Religious denominational advocacy groups present opportunities for
   grassroots representation, but it is necessary to understand the
   relationship between members' preferences and the advocacy decisions
   made by the organization. Previous research suggests that organizational
   characteristics and internal and external contexts may affect
   congruence, but this has not been thoroughly analyzed for denominational
   groups. I perform a comparative case study of two related denominational
   groups-the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics and Religious Liberty
   Commission (ERLC) and the Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty
   (BJC)-that are active participants in church-state advocacy but take
   divergent Establishment Clause views. I use survey data to compare the
   members' preferences with the group's position statements and amicus
   brief filings, finding that neither of the organizations mirror its
   members, though the ERLC is more congruent than the BJC. I argue that
   internal politics, external context, group structure, and membership
   characteristics impact the congruence between grassroots members and
   advocacy decisions.},

Abstract = {During divided government, the public tends to attribute credit and
   blame for economic conditions to both the president and Congress.
   However, the `'two presidencies{''} thesis argues that presidents have
   more influence vis-a- vis Congress in shaping foreign policy compared to
   domestic policy, so the public may attribute all foreign policy outcomes
   to the president alone. This suggests that the boost presidents
   typically receive in their overall approval during divided government
   due to sharing the blame for negative economic conditions will not
   extend to their foreign relations approval numbers. We find that
   presidents do enjoy higher overall approval during divided government.
   However, contrary to the two presidencies thesis, presidents also enjoy
   higher foreign relations approval during divided government. We explore
   four potential explanations for this puzzle and point to future research
   questions the puzzle raises.},

Title = {Why voters prefer coalitions: Rationality or norms?},
Journal = {POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {63},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {126-145},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This article asks if voters might prefer coalitions or single-party
   governments for ideological or normative reasons. Of course, they might
   prefer coalition to single-party governments for many reasons, one set
   clustering around the rational preferences of partisans largely in terms
   of expectations of electoral success or failure, and the other around
   the influence of norms or ideology. In terms of `rationality',
   small-party supporters should want their party to have a role in
   government. Large-party supporters should prefer single-party
   government, unless their loyalties are weak, or unless they expect the
   large party they dislike will have the best chance of forming a
   government, and therefore hope that its power might be diluted by having
   to form a coalition. Meanwhile less partisan voters might or might not
   be influenced by norms that favour broadly based, consensual governments
   that command majority as compared to plurality support, that minimize
   parliamentary conflict, and that make it possible for successive
   governments to follow more consistent policies over time. Regardless of
   partisanship, some people might prefer strong governments, particularly
   if their disposition is authoritarian. Ideology might have effects
   independent of partisanship. Norms and preferences for type of
   government might also interact as part of change in a political culture.
   Using data from five elections that have generated coalition and/or
   minority governments in New Zealand, a country previously accustomed to
   single-party rule, this article tests these hypotheses and explores the
   implications of the findings.},

Abstract = {Cohesive government-versus-opposition voting is a robust empirical
   regularity in Westminster democracies. Using new data from the modern
   Scottish Parliament, we show that this pattern cannot be explained by
   similarity of preferences within or between the government and
   opposition ranks. We look at differences in the way that parties operate
   in Westminster and Holyrood, and use roll call records to show that the
   observed behavior is unlikely to be determined by preferences on any
   underlying issue dimension. Using a simple variant of the agenda-setting
   model-in which members of parliament can commit to their voting
   strategies-we show that the procedural rules for reaching collective
   decisions in Westminster systems can explain this phenomenon: in the
   equilibrium, on some bills, members of the opposition vote against the
   government irrespective of the proposal. Such strategic opposition can
   reinforce government cohesiveness and have a moderating effect on policy
   outcomes. We introduce new data from the House of Lords, the Welsh
   Assembly, and the Northern Ireland Assembly to distinguish our claims
   from competing accounts of the data.},

Abstract = {This article represents an early and, largely speculative, attempt to
   make sense of Cameronism as a distinctive political project. Herein, we
   present three separate, but potentially overlapping, narratives that
   could be employed to locate the significance of Cameronism within
   broader trends in British and global party politics. In this respect, we
   view Cameronism as: a continuation of Thatcherism; a development in the
   unfolding of forms of neo-liberal governmentality, linked to the process
   of depoliticisation; and as a movement towards the cartelisation of
   political parties. We conclude the article by arguing that these three
   potential interpretations of Cameronism are compatible with one another
   and, taken in combination, can provide a starting point towards a more
   holistic understanding of the type of politics characteristic of David
   Cameron's leadership of the Conservative party.},

   Attention to Rights: A Response},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {73},
Number = {2},
Pages = {406-409},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Urribarri, Schorpp, Randazzo, and Songer pose an important question in
   the comparative study of courts: why do some high courts devote
   sustained attention to rights while others do not? I have argued that a
   rights-advocacy support structure is a necessary condition, making
   sustained judicial attention to rights possible. Claiming to test this
   thesis, USRS propose and test a different hypothesis, that changes in a
   country's support structure directly cause changes in judicial attention
   to rights. This represents a misunderstanding of the nature of a
   necessary-condition thesis. USRS, however, devote most of their paper to
   testing this direct-cause thesis. Near the end of their paper they
   briefly assess my necessary-condition thesis, asserting that several
   countries' high courts have had rights agendas in the absence of a
   support structure. Research on these countries, however, demonstrates
   that each had a support structure at the relevant time, confirming my
   thesis.},

Title = {Does Knowledge of Constitutional Principles Increase Support for Civil
   Liberties? Results from a Randomized Field Experiment},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {73},
Number = {2},
Pages = {463-476},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {For decades, scholars have argued that education causes greater support
   for civil liberties by increasing students' exposure to political
   knowledge and constitutional norms, such as due process and freedom of
   expression. Support for this claim comes exclusively from observational
   evidence, principally from cross-sectional surveys. This paper presents
   the first large-scale experimental test of this proposition. More than
   1000 students in 59 high school classrooms were randomly assigned to an
   enhanced civics curriculum designed to promote awareness and
   understanding of constitutional rights and civil liberties. The results
   show that students in the enhanced curriculum classes displayed
   significantly more knowledge in this domain than students in
   conventional civics classes. However, we find no corresponding change in
   the treatment group's support for civil liberties, a finding that calls
   into question the hypothesis that knowledge and attitudes are causally
   connected.},

Abstract = {The paper seeks to reconcile insights from winner-loser gap research
   with mainstream understanding of election legitimacy. The paper
   acknowledges that winning and losing elections creates differential
   incentives for citizens to remain supportive of their political system,
   but it argues that losers nevertheless have enough reasons to remain
   supportive in absolute terms. Drawing on democratic theory, the paper
   develops a rationale for why citizens are willing to accept electoral
   defeat voluntarily, and suggest a new way to conceptualize citizen
   reactions to election outcomes. It presents findings from a sample of
   election studies in established democracies to show that winners
   typically become more supportive whereas losers at minimum retain their
   level of support from before the election. It concludes that elections,
   when reasonably well executed, as they most often are in established
   democracies, build system support rather than undermine it. (C) 2010

Volume = {39},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Investigations of American politics have increasingly turned to analyses
   of political networks to understand public opinion, voting behavior, the
   diffusion of policy ideas, bill sponsorship in the legislature, interest
   group coalitions and influence, party factions, institutional
   development, and other empirical phenomena. While the association
   between political networks and political behavior is well established,
   clear causal inferences are often difficult to make. This article
   consists of five independent essays that address practical problems in
   making causal inferences from studies of political networks. They
   consider egocentric studies of national probability samples,
   sociocentric studies of political communities, measurement error in
   elite surveys, field experiments on networks, and triangulating on
   causal processes.},

Abstract = {The term ``Muslim democracy{''} is an oxymoron because democracies by
   definition cannot take religion as a reference point. It is also unfair
   to the religion because in a Muslim democracy, democracy deficits will
   be attributed to Islam. These days it is fashionable among Westerners to
   brand Turkey as a model country for the Middle East. This practice not
   only favors the ruling AKP but also disregards an important reality of
   Turkey's political evolution: without secularism, AKP would not have
   ever existed. So the Islamists in the Arab world would need to first
   adopt a secular democracy, and then take AKP as a model. A question left
   lingering is, are they interested in doing this?},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},

Volume = {50},

Abstract = {Market economies inevitably generate social inequalities, of which the
   new democracies of Central and East European (CEE) societies have seen
   dramatic - though widely diverging - levels of growth. Do CEE citizens
   believe that inequality is excessive and, if so, why? And what is the
   connection between perceptions of social inequality and citizens' views
   of new markets and democracy? These questions are addressed using new
   data from mass surveys conducted in 2007 in 12 post-communist CEE
   states. Surprisingly weak links are found between social inequality
   perceptions and national-level measures of inequality as well economic,
   social and political conditions. Perceptions of social inequality are
   mainly driven by individual-level assessments of market and democratic
   performance, but not by market or democratic ideals.},

Abstract = {Scholars estimating policy positions from political texts typically code
   words or sentences and then build left-right policy scales based on the
   relative frequencies of text units coded into different categories. Here
   we reexamine such scales and propose a theoretically and linguistically
   superior alternative based on the logarithm of odds-ratios. We contrast
   this scale with the current approach of the Comparative Manifesto
   Project (CMP), showing that our proposed logit scale avoids widely
   acknowledged flaws in previous approaches. We validate the new scale
   using independent expert surveys. Using existing CMP data, we show how
   to estimate more distinct policy dimensions, for more years, than has
   been possible before, and make this dataset publicly available. Finally,
   we draw some conclusions about the future design of coding schemes for
   political texts.},

Abstract = {Traditionally neglected, Locke's First Treatise of Government has taken
   on new significance with feminist interpretations that recognize the
   importance of its sustained engagement with patriarchal power. Yet
   feminist interpreters, both critics and admirers alike, read Locke as a
   champion of the ``man of reason,{''} a figure seemingly immune to the
   influences of passions, imagination, and rhetoric. These interpreters
   wrongly overlook Locke's extended engagement with the power of rhetoric
   in the First Treatise, an engagement that troubles the clear opposition
   of masculine reason and its feminine exclusions. Taking Locke's rhetoric
   seriously, I argue, makes the First Treatise newly important for what it
   shows us about Locke's practice of political critique. In following the
   varied and novel effects of Locke's feminine figures, we find a practice
   of political critique that depends on a mutually constitutive relation
   between rhetoric and reason.},

Abstract = {Hobbes in Leviathan, chapter xv, 4, makes the startling claim: ``The
   fool hath said in his heart, `there is no such thing as justice,'{''}
   paraphrasing Psalm 52:1: ``The fool hath said in his heart there is no
   God.{''} These are charges of which Hobbes himself could stand accused.
   His parable of the fool is about the exchange of obedience for
   protection, the backslider, regime change, and the tyrant; but given
   that Hobbes was himself likely an oath-breaker, it is also
   self-reflexive and self-justificatory. For, Hobbes's fool is not a
   windbag (follis), or one of the dumb mob, led astray by priests
   (stultus). He is, in the terminology of Psalm 52, an insipiens, a madman
   or raving lunatic, whose rebellion against God the King is his own
   destruction and that of his people. A long iconographic tradition
   portraying the fool as insipiens, Antichrist, heretical impostor and
   tyrant king, was at Hobbes's disposal.},

Volume = {39},
Number = {1},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This essay argues that many modern discussions of Locke's political
   theory are unconsciously shaped by an imaginative picture of the world
   inherited from the past, on which authority and freedom are
   fundamentally antipathetic. The consequences of this picture may be seen
   in the distinction made customarily in Locke studies between the
   `authoritarian' Locke of Two Tracts on Government, for whom authority
   descends from God, and the later, `liberal,' Locke, for whom authority
   arises from the will and agreement of individuals, and felt in the
   emphases placed on consent and resistance in most interpretations of
   Lockean political thought. The essay examines the composition and
   contours of this picture and, by holding up a mirror to contemporary
   Locke scholarship, draws attention to some of the ways in which it
   unwittingly distorts Locke's thinking.},

Abstract = {In this article, I develop a new account of the liberal view that
   principles of justice (in general) are meant to justify state coercion,
   and consider its implications for the question of global socioeconomic
   justice (in particular). Although contemporary proponents of this view
   deny that principles of socioeconomic justice apply globally, on my
   newly developed account this conclusion is mistaken. I distinguish
   between two types of coercion, systemic and interactional, and argue
   that a plausible theory of global justice should contain principles
   justifying both. The justification of interactional coercion requires
   principles regulating interstate interference; that of systemic coercion
   requires principles of global socioeconomic justice. I argue that the
   proposed view not only helps us make progress in the debate on global
   justice, but also offers an independently compelling and systematic
   account of the function and conditions of applicability of justice.},

Abstract = {In Russia the issues of budgetary process have been traditionally
   developed in the framework of economic theory and judicial studies.
   However, there is a range of questions, the answers to which will
   require employing political science instruments. Comparing the Russian
   and US practices, E.Bayadina designs several directions of budgetary
   process analysis from the political science viewpoint. In the first two
   parts of the article the author reviews theory and practice of the US
   budgetary process, in the third one she evaluates budgetary process in
   the Russian Federation as a whole, in the fourth part she analyzes the
   experience of the Perm Krai (district) using a budgetary process model
   that is unique within the Russian Federation.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL CRITICAL THOUGHT},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {1},
Number = {4},
Pages = {385-396},
Abstract = {This article reviews the four major theories of development by which the
   advancement of the modern world has been explained since Adam Smith's
   The wealth of nations; these major theories include the classical
   economic theory, the neoclassical economic theory, the Index of
   Sustainable Economic Welfare theory and the Human Development Index
   theory. It traces the story of each of the theories and reveals that the
   Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare and Human Development Index are
   now accepted as better theories of development. However, the Index of
   Sustainable Economic Welfare and Human Development Index theories have
   been found here to be deficient in participatory attributes and not to
   promote the exploration and use of indigenous knowledge in the process
   of development planning and implementation. Consequently, this article
   proposes the Human Development Index Literacy Theory of social
   development as a new and alternative development theory that is not only
   human-centred but also participatory in its approach to development
   planning and execution.},

Journal = {POLITY},

Volume = {43},
Number = {1},
Pages = {106-127},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This article argues that political theory could gain from a revival of
   the form of ordinary language analysis advocated by J. L. Austin. It
   distinguishes three objectionable forms of scholasticism widespread in
   contemporary political theory, and shows how Austinian methods might
   help to combat them. To illustrate the potential of Austinian analysis
   in political theory, the final third of the article considers, in the
   light of pertinent ordinary language, the widely canvassed claim that
   coercion can involve ``disrespect for persons{''}; these considerations
   suggest that this claim is more complicated, less obviously sound, and
   more interesting, than political theorists often assume. Polity (2011)

Title = {German Political Careers: The State Level as an Arena in its Own Right?},
Journal = {REGIONAL AND FEDERAL STUDIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {21},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {205-222},
Abstract = {This article looks at political career patterns in Germany with a focus
   on the state level. After all, state legislators are a far more
   representative group of professional politicians in Germany than members
   of the federal parliament. Furthermore, by looking at pathways to the
   state legislatures, strategies to remain there (including office
   accumulation) and options of career advancement from a state mandate to
   other positions the authors substitute a dynamic career perspective for
   a mainly institution-centered one. The main finding of the article is
   contra-intuitive: Despite an institutional structure that allows for
   high levels of permeability between different territorial levels of
   government in Germany, there is actually very limited movement. The high
   degree of professionalization of state politics, a certain
   regionalization of the party system and some other factors seem to have
   turned state politics into a career arena in its own right.},

Abstract = {Europe's relevance in American foreign policy has declined. The

   conflict the joint creation of liberty, security, democracy, and

   by U.S. President Barak Obama's new policy toward Russia and the lack of
   clarity as to whether the United States will remain at their side. A new
   vision is needed to revitalise transatlantic relations. But there is a
   shortage of common ground in content and of politicians ready to involve

Abstract = {The ongoing war in Afghanistan presents many questions for both scholars
   and policymakers. In particular, understanding insurgent military
   behavior generates considerable interest. Using a newly assembled daily,
   province-level data set, I begin to study the violence, focusing on the
   timing of US and allied fatalities in the war. I evaluate arguments
   commonly made about those elements favoring insurgent military success,
   proximity to resupply and difficult terrain, and find strong evidence
   supporting the first but less supporting the second as determinants of
   coalition fatalities. In addition, I find significant evidence linking
   factors unexamined in most civil war research, such as religious
   observance (the month of Ramadan) and warm weather, to these fatal
   events.},

Journal = {CIVIL WARS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {13},
Number = {2},
Pages = {157-188},
Abstract = {This article analyzes the previous and current dynamics of the arms
   trafficking network of the former Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
   (LTTE) in Asia and its relevance for the post-conflict situation in Sri
   Lanka. It also analyzes some of the leading western theories on civil
   war and determines their relevance in this specific theater. Further
   analysis is provided regarding the state of the Tamil diaspora as well
   as the remainder of the LTTE's financial network. This article argues
   that the governments in Asia that house key sources of weaponry and
   other supplies for violent nonstate actors do not seem either willing or
   able to take any kind of meaningful action against these illicit markets
   aside from making occasional high-profile arrests. Further, key former
   LTTE financiers continue to reside in several western countries and many
   remain willing to underwrite arms smuggling operations in Asia, provided
   that there are effective managers. Given these realities combined with a
   nascent government-in-exile that continues to espouse the LTTE's raison
   d'etre, the insurgency in Sri Lanka could reignite quicker and more
   intensely than most think if current political and demographic trends
   are not reversed and force levels of the Sri Lankan military cannot be
   sustained. However, any new Tamil militant groups would likely look
   quite different from their LTTE predecessors.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the causal relationship between campaign
   activity during U.S. House elections and district-wide turnout rates
   from 1972 to 2006. Utilizing panel data and a first differences modeling
   approach, turnout is conceptualized dynamically as change in turnout.
   Changes in campaign expenditures, competition, and other political
   campaigns are used to account for this conceptualization of turnout.
   This design permits inferences to be made about the causal relationship
   between changes in campaign activity and expected changes in turnout.
   The results indicate that House spending, competition, and Senate
   elections are important to turnout, especially during Midterm elections.
   Finally, a comparison between cross-sectional and first differences
   models provides evidence that problems can arise when attempting to make
   causal inferences using crosssectional data.},

Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Pages = {525-539},
Abstract = {The onset of the Great Recession raised hopes among union supporters
   that organized labor would be able to use the downturn to gain greater
   political influence and new members. But despite Democratic Party
   victories in 2008, unions found it quite difficult to take advantage of
   the crisis. No revival of union organizing occurred, and membership
   continued to decline. Moreover, unions were unable to effectively
   present themselves as defenders of a larger public interest in equitable
   economic policy. Instead, many in the public turned against unions,
   viewing them as labor market `'insiders'' who benefited from government
   largesse in the form of bailouts to the auto industry and excessive
   salaries and pensions granted to public employees. Resentment of union
   privileges grew more common than solidarity with union workers. While
   public employee unions had some success in opposing attacks on
   collective bargaining rights, these efforts did not alter labor's
   fundamentally weak strategic position.},

Journal = {GERMAN POLITICS},

Volume = {20},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {325-341},
Abstract = {This introduction provides a theoretical framework for investigating the
   effect of gender on national-level executive branch leadership.
   Currently, there is no consensus as to what is expected of a woman who
   occupies her country's highest office. The article argues that this
   disagreement is due to the assumption of an idealised `woman leader'.
   Adopting an intersectional approach to studying gender and executive
   leadership, it is argued that it is possible neither to identify a
   single `female chief executive style' nor to a priori identify a set of
   `female' policy positions. Because gender norms differ within and across
   countries, we must determine `what kind' of a female politician we are
   studying to determine how her particular gender might impact on her
   governance. The article then considers what might be expected of a
   German Bundeskanzlerin who is also a Protestant CDU member trained as a
   natural scientist and raised in the GDR.},

Abstract = {The redefinition of rights of equality and liberty by radical and
   deliberative democrats during the last decades of the 20th century
   resulted in the denial that a consideration of property is integral to
   political philosophy. Theorizing property as intrinsically political
   demands a return to Marx but on terms he may not have recognized. I
   outline a politics of property in this paper contending that there can
   be no universal justification for any regime of property. Property is by
   definition the institution of a wrong. The articulation of something as
   property establishes a border, determining what can be owned, how far
   ownership extends, where it is limited, as well as terms of use and
   terms of abuse. It establishes a set of property relations, and defines
   a vocabulary of the proper. Here sovereign state power is enlisted to
   enforce relations of property beneficial to some, but not all. A
   challenge to any political regime must of necessity put in to question
   both the forms of proper behaviour, and the regime of property. These
   are intrinsically related to each other. I conclude by arguing that
   democracy is always improper. Property, in all of its forms entails
   enclosure. Enclosure requires the drawing and the maintenance of
   boundaries of exclusion and inclusion. The sovereign determination of
   the proper, as well as of the exception to the proper defines trespass.
   Trespass is a form of democratic enactment when, and if, it destabilises
   enclosure.},

Abstract = {There are longue duree patterns that differentiate the behaviour of
   constitutional courts in multi-nation and mono-nation federations. While
   constitutional courts in multination federations let politics take
   primacy over jurisprudence, constitutional courts in mononation
   federations play an important role in bringing about constitutional
   change. Instead of relying on institutional/constitutional factors to
   explain this variation, the article proposes a sociological explanation
   based on differences in democratic legitimacy between mono-nation
   federations based on a single demos and multi-nation ones where the
   federation represents a union between multiple demoi. The argument is
   applied to the paired comparison of the Canadian Supreme Court and the
   German Federal Constitutional Court.},

Abstract = {This paper lays the foundations for a democratic defence of the argument
   that at least some non-citizens are entitled to claim rights of
   political participation with regard to states in which they are not

   participatory rights to certain non-resident non-citizens, based upon
   the central claim that in a democracy those who are governed ought to
   have the opportunity to participate in the exercise of government. I
   offer support for extending rights of participation to some non-resident
   non-citizens by addressing two possible democratic objections, relating
   to political equality and reciprocity.},

Abstract = {This article challenges the dominant assumptions in the literature that
   cutting social policy incurs voter wrath and that political parties can
   efficiently internalise electoral fallout with blame avoidance
   strategies. Drawing on the diverse literature on the role of
   partisanship in the period of permanent austerity, several partisan
   hypotheses on the relationship between social policy change and
   electoral outcomes are posited. The results indicate that religious and
   liberal parties gain votes, and thereby are able to `claim credit', for
   retrenching social policy. None of the other coefficients for the effect
   of social policy cuts reach significance, raising the question of
   whether parties excel at blame avoidance or the public fails to place
   blame in the first place.},

Journal = {ASIAN POLITICS \& POLICY},

Volume = {3},

Abstract = {This study offers a historical review and analysis of public perceptions
   of police performance in Taiwan spanning the 64-year history of Taiwan's
   National Police Agency (NPA). Data for the study were drawn from several
   sources, including selected waves of the Taiwan Social Change Survey,
   Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index, the World
   Values Survey, the Taiwan Public Safety and Police Service Survey, a
   Gallup survey, and a survey conducted by the authors. The findings
   indicate that there has been a gradual but steady improvement in public
   perceptions of police performance in three perceptual areas: perceptions
   of police officers in general, perceptions of police service, and
   perceptions of police corruption. Additionally, the increasingly
   positive opinion of the police parallels Taiwan's political transition
   from authoritarian rule to full democracy and the subsequent
   professionalization of the NPA. However, despite the positive trend,
   three issues continue to concern the public: service attitudes,
   investigative effectiveness, and police corruption. Policy implications
   for law enforcement administration are discussed.},

   Introductory Political Science Courses},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE EDUCATION},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {7},
Number = {4},
Pages = {394-415},
Abstract = {Political science is a challenging field, particularly when it comes to
   undergraduate teaching. If we are to engage in something more than
   uncritical ideological ``instruction, it demands from the student a
   willingness to approach alien political ideas with intellectual
   generosity. Yet, students within introductory classes often harbor
   inherited notions of what the ideal political system ought to be. This
   attachment to the proper meaning of core political ideas may stultify
   their consideration of alternative formulations of these concepts. In a
   related vein, recent research within educational and cognitive
   psychology examines ``automatic thinking'' as a prevailing dimension of
   human cognition. In many instances, researchers find that seemingly
   thoughtful activity actually draws upon long-settled previous learning
   so routine and scripted that ``true'' thinking becomes unnecessary. In
   order to gain new knowledge, as well as a critical and reflexive
   understanding of oneself and others, recent research in this vein has
   advocated the value of exposure to ideas and experience that destabilize
   these understandings. In order to apply these insights in relation to
   our field this study is an attempt to offer political science educators:
   (1) a more precise sense of how such ``automatic thinking'' operates at
   a cognitive psychological level, (2) descriptive empirical documentation
   of what preexisting frames are widespread within the American
   undergraduate community, and (3) a sketch of ways in which educators
   might confront ``automatic thinking'' in the classroom.},

Abstract = {This article aims to analyze the process of independence of Kosovo, its
   legal and policy frameworks and especially its implications for
   Geopolitical of Europe in the XXI century. After three years of Kosovo
   independence, its arising is being identified into two issues: the
   legitimacy and legality of the new leadership (which is not the purpose
   of our analysis) but also a question mark on the independence process
   artificially accelerated, creating a precedent. The article also
   proposes to analyze and compare, if appropriate, the socio-ethnic
   quicksand of some EU countries. A trend which could become rampant in

Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {4},
Number = {1},
Pages = {52-75},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Party programmes, frequently also called manifestos or platforms, are
   written documents in which a political party sets out the programme
   either for its general inter-party making or for broader pre-and/or
   post-election purposes. As such, the party programme is regarded as an
   important constitutive part of each democratic party `body' or, even
   wider, the element of democratic election processes or even the
   democratic political system in general. Analysing party programmes also
   represents one of most visible theoretical and methodological research
   topics inside various political science disciplines. Based on such
   understandings of the roles of party programmes, the main aim of this
   article is to disclose the prevailing characteristics of those party
   programmes prepared or used for the purposes of Slovenian national
   parliamentary elections (e.g. electoral programmes). With this in mind,
   we expect to be able to give mainly a general descriptive assessment of
   the status and importance of party electoral programmes in the case of a
   young post-socialist democratic state, actually the first of that kind
   in the Slovenian case. Accordingly, a comparative approach of analysing
   the outlook and content dimensions of party programmes is applied. The
   comparison is made from three different perspectives: a) party
   perspective that relates to the comparison of the programme content of
   the competing political parties, where their pre-and post-electoral
   parliamentary status is especially considered; b) time perspective
   relating to the comparison of the last two national parliamentary
   elections (2004 and 2008); c) coalition agreement perspective, according
   to which party electoral programmes are compared to the contents of the
   crucial post-electoral document. The conclusions, on one hand, expose
   many similarities among the compared elements regardless of party
   status, as well as some major differences on the other hand. The latter
   relate mostly to the contextual dimensions of the programmes and enable
   us to classify electoral party programmes into four different types
   according to their prevailing characteristics.},

   coordination structures between sectoral business associations mainly to
   effects of the national system of business interests, to the
   establishment of new associations, and to competition about interest

   associations within their sectoral population is guided predominantly by
   the `preferential attachment' to business associations that are viewed
   as influential, no matter on what this attribution is based. Thus,
   dynamic systems of business interests seem to follow `laws' similar to
   those found in physical and organisational network topographies.},

Abstract = {While formal truth recovery processes have been commonplace in many
   transitional societies, the question of whether Northern Ireland should
   have an official examination of its past has been contested. Some of the
   most vociferous opposition to a truth mechanism has been from unionist
   and loyalist political parties and associations. The Consultative Group
   on the Past's recommendation for the establishment of a `Legacy
   Commission' - a bespoke truth recovery body for Northern Ireland - has
   hence become the most recent focus for their concerns. Based upon
   extensive and original qualitative interviews with elite level political
   and civil society representatives, this paper analyses and explores
   unionists' and loyalists' opposition to and reluctance to engage in the
   truth recovery debate. This paper argues that their oppositional
   discourses to truth recovery are grounded in prevailing ideological
   beliefs and perceptions. The longevity of these factors poses
   significant questions for the future development of the truth recovery
   debate in Northern Ireland and the place of unionists and loyalists
   within it.},

Abstract = {Parliamentary systems of government are founded on the principle of
   members of a legislative party acting in toeing the party line. The aim
   of this article is to identify the factors influencing the level of
   unity of parliamentary party groups in the Czech Chamber of Deputies. As
   the research is a one-country study, the theoretical explanations used
   are party specific. Hypotheses refer to government status, party size,
   party system fragmentation, differences in parties' ideological
   platforms, and political socialization and incumbency. This study is
   based on roll-call data for the 1993 to 2008 period, aggregated to
   legislative terms. Using an OLS regression modelling approach, this
   article finds support for the hypothesis that a party's status in
   government influences the observed legislative party unity. However,
   legislative party unity declines when the size of a government's
   majority increases and the chances of losing a roll-call vote decline.
   Moreover, there is weaker evidence regarding the influence of party size
   on party unity. In short, legislative party politics in the Czech
   Chamber of Deputies is strongly determined by government and opposition
   competitiveness.},

Abstract = {The article reports the results of a 2008 national survey of political
   theorists concerning what and how they teach. The results are based on
   1,086 responses from professors at accredited, four-year colleges and
   universities in the United States. The responses include information
   about which thinkers are currently being taught, the status of
   non-Western political thought in political theory education, the
   relative degrees of implementation of various teaching methodologies,
   demographic information about the respondents, information about the
   kinds of texts theorists use to teach, and finally a ranking of
   undergraduate programs in terms of their strength in theory.},

Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},

Volume = {15},

Pages = {145-159},
Abstract = {The burgeoning literature on transitional justice, truth commissions,
   reconciliation and official apologies tends to ignore the conditions of
   settler states in which `reconciliation' needs to take account of
   indigenous minorities. The settler colonialism literature is worth
   including in the general discussion because it is exceptionally
   reflective about political theory (the constitutional recognition of
   indigenous rights) and ethnogenesis (the origin and viability of both
   settler and indigenous identities), challenging mainstream liberalism,
   in particular, to account for difference beyond platitudes about
   multiculturalism. This article highlights the postcolonial critiques of
   the Australian governments' apology to the indigenous peoples of the
   country. The authors of these critiques seek to protect indigenous
   alterity from the Australian state, which they regard as irredeemably
   colonialist, especially in its liberal and progressive mode. The article
   suggests that Indigenous political agency transcends the
   resistance/co-option dichotomy presented in much of the apology's
   commentary.},

Title = {`Business as Usual': The Response of the Corporate Sector to the May
   2008 Xenophobic Violence},
Journal = {POLITIKON},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {38},
Number = {1},
Pages = {149-167},
Abstract = {This article focuses on broadly understanding the contribution of the
   South African corporate sector to the response to the xenophobic
   violence of May 2008. As a starting point, it discusses the external
   structural factors driving the xenophobic violence in South Africa. It
   draws on the historical legacy of apartheid, the nature of South
   Africa's transition to democracy and current global and economic
   conditions. It describes in broad terms the corporate response to the
   xenophobic violence, and shapes the array of views expressed through a
   number of in-depth interviews with some key role-players into an
   analytical understanding of the corporate sector's stance and
   orientation toward the xenophobic violence. Critical questions are
   raised about the wider developmental and transformative responsibilities
   of corporate capital in South Africa vis-a-vis its compatibility and
   `fit' with issues of social justice. The article concludes with
   reflections on the nature of the relationship between civil society and
   the corporate sector and the possibilities for civil society-business
   engagement.},

Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Pages = {385-403},
Abstract = {This article addresses the relationship of toleration and humour as
   virtues. It argues that our understanding of toleration as a virtue has
   been captured and shaped by the conception of tolerance as a duty and,
   through a critique of John Horton's classic article on toleration as a
   virtue, seeks to show what a view freed from such captivity would look
   like. It then turns to argue that humour plays a fundamental role in
   relation to living a virtuous life. Finally, it attempts to establish
   the practical necessity of the relationship between tolerance and humour
   setting out what I take to be significant structural relationships
   between them and between their formation as settled dispositions of
   character.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS IN LATIN AMERICA},

Volume = {3},

Pages = {141-172},
Abstract = {Studies on coalition management in presidential systems usually focus on
   two types of goods used by the president and formateur party to hold
   together coalitions: exchange goods (such as individual budget
   amendments) and coalition goods (such as ministries). This research
   notes analyzes, with an original dataset of party members and political
   appointees in Brazil, a different type of good: presidential political
   appointments. Our study shows that partisan political appointees vary
   greatly among Brazilian ministries and within them. We also found that
   there is a disconnect between how many seats a political party holds in
   Congress and the number of political appointment offices it controls.
   This has implications for the literature on bureaucracy and politics and
   the literature on coalition management.},

Abstract = {Delegation in the European Union (EU) involves a series of
   principal-agent problems, and the various chains of delegation involve
   voters, parties, parliaments, governments, the European Commission and
   the European Parliament. While the literature has focused on how
   government parties attempt to monitor EU affairs through committees in
   national parliaments and through Council committees at the EU level,
   much less is known about the strategies opposition parties use to reduce
   informational deficits regarding European issues. This article argues
   that the European Parliament (EP) offers opposition parties an arena to
   pursue executive oversight through the use of written parliamentary
   questions. Using a novel dataset on parliamentary questions in the EP,
   this article examines why Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) ask
   questions of specific Commissioners. It transpires that MEPs from
   national opposition parties are more likely to ask questions of
   Commissioners. Questions provide these parties with inexpensive access
   to executive scrutiny. This finding has implications for the study of
   parliamentary delegation and party politics inside federal legislatures
   such as the EP.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on historical conditions and sociological variables
   that contribute to or impede the development of religious freedom. One
   major set of variables focuses on characteristics of legal and judicial
   systems. Another set evaluates the characteristics and history of a
   society, including a society's cultural values, and how those values are
   implemented in the regulation of religion. A further set of
   considerations flows directly from the work of Donald Black in the
   sociology of law, and includes important variables such as status,
   intimacy, and third-party partisanship, as well as evidentiary processes
   and production. Finally, the work of William Chambliss has identified
   the dialectic processes of law development as useful in allowing us to
   understand how legal structures protective of religious freedom might be
   produced.},

Title = {Bordering solidarities: migrant activism and the politics of movement
   and camps at Calais},
Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-19},
Abstract = {The proliferation of more restrictive border controls governing global
   mobility provides important sites of crystallization through which
   differentiated and stratified rights to movement are produced,
   negotiated, and reimagined. One such form, the detention of migrants, is
   often understood through a logic of exception as the exclusion of
   unwanted migrants from the borders of the political community. Critical
   scholarship on detention informed by an autonomous migration perspective
   suggests a more nuanced reading of detention as the differential
   inclusion of migrants through positions of precariousness,
   transformations of legal statuses and subjectivities, and control over
   the direction and temporality of migratory flows. Building on this
   trajectory, this paper argues that the very meaning of the camp also
   needs to be brought into the analysis of a politics of migration and of
   control. For spaces of detention are sites of contestation that can be
   used by migrants (and those in solidarity with them) as resources to
   navigate border controls, reimagine political community and
   subjectivities and through which migrants engage in practices of
   citizenship. Reflecting on the destruction of the migrant camps in and
   around Calais, the paper examines three different images of the camp
   space known as `the jungle' and draws attention to camp spaces as social
   and political spaces, in which the struggles to define them are an
   integral part of what is at stake in the struggle between a politics of
   control and a politics of migration.},

Title = {Insaniyat for peace: survivors' narrative of the 1971 war of Bangladesh},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GENOCIDE RESEARCH},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {13},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {475-501},
Abstract = {The scholarship on post-conflict resolution is growing and new light
   continues to be shed on the larger field of peacemaking from multiple
   non-Western perspectives. Although the earlier focus of scholarship on
   the usefulness of truth and reconciliation commission, war criminals
   tribunal, implementation of human rights and international monitoring
   remains relevant, there is also a need to move beyond these existing
   models to explore new ways of empowering people for developing
   indigenous methods of peacemaking. Non-institutional practices based on
   religio-cultural models can be particularly relevant if they are
   narrated and constructed by survivors in post-conflict societies.
   Focusing on the war of 1971 of Bangladesh within Pakistan, this article
   highlights the historical construction of an `enemy' who was victimized
   during the war and the subsequent struggle of perpetrators to come to
   terms with loss of their humanity, insaniyat, in violence. Are victims'
   and perpetrators' understandings of humanity, insaniyat, different in
   Bangladesh and Pakistan? How do the discourses on insaniyat impinge on
   the narrative of violence upheld by official institutions in Pakistan
   and Bangladesh? In what ways can survivors' alternate discourses open
   the space for dialogue for writing larger histories of peace in the
   region? In particular, perpetrators' acknowledgement of violence in the
   war and their repentance, tauba, contain powerful vocabularies appealing
   to the principles of compassion and forgiveness, rahm. The concepts of
   insaniyat, tauba and rahm are Islamic values of peacemaking that, I
   suggest, can be utilized for restoring the rights of people, huquq
   al-ibad, and empowering the reconvened human collectives. This method, I
   argue, would be acceptable to the Muslim communities of Pakistan and
   Bangladesh because it is connected to their religio-cultural values that
   inform them of their fundamental identity as Muslims and human beings.
   The Islamic method of peacemaking is highly relevant and useful for
   restorative justice in the contemporary Muslim world.},

Journal = {AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {46},
Number = {4},
Pages = {699-706},
Abstract = {The troubles of Alice Springs have been widely discussed in the
   Australian media since The Weekend Australian published Nicolas
   Rothwell's (2011) feature article `Destroyed in Alice' in February.
   Discussion has covered many things: violence, drugs, alcohol, sex, town
   camps, property crime, Aboriginal people coming in from outlying
   communities and the idea of another Commonwealth intervention. One topic
   that has not been mentioned is Alice's highly unrepresentative town
   council, built on a little-known electoral system used in Northern
   Territory local government called `exhaustive preferential'. This paper
   explains and critiques this electoral system and suggests that it is
   causing significant problems for both Alice Springs Town Council and
   other local governments in the Territory. 1 It notes that the Northern
   Territory government is currently reviewing the system and is possibly
   moving slowly towards change. If change is not effected soon, it asks:
   is this electoral system cause for another Commonwealth intervention?},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Blainey (1988) argued that crises are more likely to end in war when two
   nations disagree about their relative power. Fey and Ramsay (2007) claim
   that this widely used ``mutual optimism{''} explanation is theoretically
   incoherent. Their criticism neglects the need to specify a behavioral
   causal mechanism that links beliefs to the outbreak of war. We show how
   the rationalist game-theoretic work on the causes of war provides such
   mechanisms-the risk-return trade-off and costly signaling-and
   demonstrate that these models are immune to Fey and Ramsay's critiques.
   We also show that the class of models Fey and Ramsay propose make the
   substantively unwarranted assumption that an actor can unilaterally
   impose peace on an opponent who strictly prefers war. Their finding that
   war does not occur in equilibrium has nothing to do with mutual
   optimism. We conclude that the mutual optimism explanation can be
   grounded on firm rationalist foundations.},

Pages = {179-230},
Abstract = {Youth's perception of democracy is important. We are faced with young
   people born during a transformative period in the Mexican political
   system. Their values and ideological tendencies are different from those
   of previous generations. They also exercise a different kind of
   citizenry. This must be translated into a favorable, but not
   unconditional, opinion of democracy. In this regard, one must also
   consider the socioeconomic conditions that favor this form of
   government. For this purpose, we introduced the variables of level of
   studies attained and socioeconomic level, and related them to the
   opinion that young persons have of democracy. Through the use of
   contingency tables, the results demonstrate that there is some relation
   between these variables and democracy, although it is not causal.},

Abstract = {Space, as the material field in which personal, collective and social
   practices develop, is imbued with the values and meanings of each
   occasion and is shaped, as regards its organization, content and form,
   in correlation with the different aspects of a predominant ethics and/or
   the conflicting value systems that characterize the specific production
   context. A disputed term that is relativized in accordance with the
   formative cultural, geographical, environmental, technological, social
   and economic context, ethics has from Plato to contemporary thinkers
   provided answers to questions relating to values, meanings and how to
   live as an individual or a society, proposing concepts or systems
   differing in their epistemological character, particularly in cases of
   descriptive ethics and meta-ethics. This paper attempts to record,
   comprehend and critique the contemporary content of ethics, the
   difference in relation to earlier periods (i.e. modernity, if we accept
   that the age of globalization on which we shall focus coincides with
   hypermodernity), and its effects on the constitution of contemporary
   urban public space in the Western world.},

Journal = {DEMOCRACY \& SECURITY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {7},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {317-337},
Abstract = {Early British colonialism was originally driven by the pragmatic trading
   needs of the East India Company, which only interfered with local custom
   and tradition in the interests of company profit. To some extent
   subsequent British governments adopted similar policies, and this
   strategy partly explains why postcolonial states such as Singapore,
   Malaysia, and most African states have always had legal pluralism. In
   many postcolonial societies in the late twentieth century, there was a
   political drive by indigenous peoples for customary law, and hence the
   principle of the unitary sovereign state was, at least in Latin America,
   weakened. In the contemporary situation, the prospect of accepting
   Shari'a in many European and North American societies has been rejected
   on precisely the issue of sovereignty, despite the fact that, for
   example, religious courts (both Jewish and Muslim) have often operated
   in such societies. The recent protest against the Archbishop of
   Canterbury's public lecture' is an obvious example. This article argues
   that acceptance of religious law (of any variety) in the public domain
   can only work on the basis of strict secularization (the state's
   religious neutrality) and on the enforcement of gender equality.
   However, if accepting religious law means in practice accepting
   third-party arbitration, then legal pluralism is not a direct threat to
   state sovereignty. In the United States, tribunals are not uncommon
   features of the legal system, and military tribunals have regularly been
   used to try enemy combatants. Furthermore, with the Internet some degree
   of informal but popular arbitration takes place between individuals in
   ways that are compatible with Shari'a as a consensus-seeking legal
   tradition. In a broader framework, however, the decline in direct
   personal taxation, the disappearance of conscription, and the growth of
   legal pluralism (within the framework of the nation-state) does imply
   both the development of a postnational and weaker state, as well as the
   erosion of citizenship. We need to be worried about both.},

   Three elections later in Peru and two in Bolivia, the ability of
   national political parties to articulate interests differs markedly
   between the two countries. Peru tends toward fragmentation with national
   parties incapable of participating or successfully competing in
   subnational elections, while in Bolivia, the Movimiento al Socialismo
   (MAS) - and other parties to a lesser extent are increasingly capable of
   participating and winning subnational offices. This paper argues that,
   despite having undergone very similar institutional reforms, the
   difference between the cases can largely be explained by two
   ``society-side{''} variables: the caliber of the political ideas in
   debate and political social density. The substantive quality of ideas in
   debate and a greater political social density have been crucial to the
   Bolivian trend, while their absence has lessened the possibility of
   anything similar occurring in Peru. In general terms, the article sheds
   light on the social conditions that favor party-building in a context of
   decentralization reform.},

Abstract = {In 2006, Stephen Harper boldly pronounced Canada as an ``emerging energy
   superpower{''} to a variety of international audiences, including at the
   G8 meeting in London. While this label is likely more representative of
   a marketing campaign than reality (Hester, 2007), it is important to
   understand the degree to which the Canadian media has embraced it. This
   paper determines the extent to which Canada's national newspapers, the
   Globe and Mail and the National Post, and its largest paper, the Toronto
   Star, adopted the ``energy superpower{''} frame in their reporting about
   Alberta's oil sands over a 25-month period. The oil sands were selected
   as a case study because proponents of Canada as an ``energy
   superpower{''} cite the development of Alberta's oil sands as a key
   component of the country's new-found status. To discover how this new
   label was intertwined into the broader discourse on oil sands
   development, I used content and discourse analysis to examine newspaper
   stories over 300 words in length that contain ``oil sands{''} or ``tar
   sands{''} in the lead paragraph and/or headline. While my study found
   few instances of news stories containing the term, it did find that
   these newspapers more closely adopted Harper's underlying ideas about
   what an energy superpower is than the more activist government
   traditionally associated with the term.},

   group (PSORHE) in the formulation of political-institutional dimension
   of the Prospective Vision Santander 2019-2030. The idea is to present
   some proposals emerged from the case study that can enrich the debate on
   the challenges for the XXI century and guide the search for a model that
   collects, from a holistic perspective, the concerns, needs and interests
   of all those current interested people. This inductive method will
   extrapolate some public policy elements for social inclusion.},

Title = {Why is Quebec Separatism off the Agenda? Reducing National Unity Crisis
   in the Neoliberal Era},

Abstract = {The development of federalism in the context of the neoliberal era in
   the 2000s has partly created the conditions for a more stable
   co-operation between the federal and Quebec governments, contributing to
   the trend of separatism being sidelined in Quebec. In the context of
   neoliberalism, federal provincial agreements have created conditions for
   just enough asymmetry in the relationship between the federal government
   and Quebec, something that Quebec has historically demanded, for
   separatism to remain off the agenda. What separates this relationship
   from past ones is a significant change in the context whereby the
   neoliberal orientation is becoming the common currency for co-operation.
   If Canadian federalism continues its present course under neoliberalism
   without any major mishaps, for the first time since the divisive period
   of the 1990s and early 2000s. federal Quebec relations likely will be
   stable without national unity crises of the kind that culminated in the
   1980 and 1995 Quebec referenda on sovereignty.},

Abstract = {While substantial research examines the dynamics prompting policy
   adoption, few studies have assessed whether enacted policies are
   modified to meet distributional equity concerns. Past research suggests
   that important forces limit such adaptation, termed here ``policy
   inertia.{''} We examine whether block grant allocations to states from
   the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program have evolved in response to major
   technological and political changes. We assess the impact of initial
   allocations on later funding patterns, compared to five counterfactual
   distributional equity standards. Initial allocations strongly predict
   future allocations; in comparison, the standards are weak predictors,
   suggesting the importance of policy inertia. Our methodology of
   employing multiple measures of equity as a counterfactual to policy
   inertia can be used to evaluate the adaptability of federalist programs
   in other domains.},

   properly trained and by using their multimedia cell phones, they
   register their routine on Canal{*} Motoboy website. This article
   analyzes the progress of this project, based on the communication for
   social change, once the right to freedom of expression, historically,
   has been expropriated from citizens on account of the expansion of

Abstract = {Female genital mutilation (FGM, hereinafter) is a form of gender-related
   violence that was hitherto only known to be practiced in many African
   countries and in Yemen. Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) is prevalent in
   all governorates of the Kurdish Northern Iraq, except in the far
   northern Duhok region. This area is also marked by very high rates of
   honor killings, domestic violence, forced marriages, and other
   gender-related crimes. FGM is just another product of the prevailing
   authoritarian and extremely patriarchal gender structures based on
   control and obedience, domination and subjugation, suspicion and fear.
   FGM is a human rights issue which should be dealt with on the human
   rights arena, irrespective of the bizarre ways of justification people
   might choose for this act. fighting FGM should be considered a battle
   for hearts and minds - comparable to a political movement, but strictly
   non-partisan, as a human rights commitment.},

Title = {The Circulation of Labour and Money: Symbolic Meanings of Monetary
   Kinship Practices in Contemporary Truku Society, Taiwan},

Year = {2011},
Volume = {5},

Abstract = {This paper examines the symbolic meanings attributable to the
   circulation of labour and the earnings of migrant labourers in
   contemporary Truku society, one of Taiwan's indigenous groups. With the
   integration of Truku society into capitalist market-based economies from
   the 1960s onwards, for many the most effective way to extricate
   themselves from the problems of poverty has been to secure work as a
   migrant labourer. In this paper, I attempt to discuss the
   interrelationship between migrant labour and monetary kinship practices
   in order to give consideration to the external and internal symbolic
   meanings which are attributed to the earnings from migrant labour. I
   argue that it is necessary for Truku people to follow a complex set of
   norms in the regular cycles of kinship practices, because they are based
   on social and kinship morality and belief in ancestral spirits. As such,
   any surplus from the earnings of migrant labour goes mainly toward
   monetary kinship practices, rather than for economic development in
   local society. However, for those Truku suffering from poverty, the
   performance of monetary-based kinship practices can become an onerous
   financial burden. As a consequence, it is through monetary kinship
   practices that the relationship between the poor and the rich is
   converted into a long-term relationship between the debtor and the
   creditor respectively. Hence, monetary kinship practices have become a
   mechanism for wealthier households to strengthen their social and
   political influence in society. As such, the circulation of labour
   combines with monetary kinship practices in the process of forming
   social and economic hierarchy in contemporary Truku society.},

Abstract = {This article advances a bounded rationality approach to account for a
   fundamental challenge in the study of voting behavior; finding a model
   that allows voters to be driven by both affective partisan attachments
   and rational issue considerations. Voters choose candidates they feel
   will perform best on the issues, but on the issues about which they care
   most, and on the issues as they see them. Party identification acts as
   the crucial bound on individual rationality, canalizing attention to
   issues either owned by or successfully leased by their own party and
   biasing expectations of issue handling. My empirical analysis of the
   2008 presidential election shows the recession was a powerful predictor
   of defection, but rather than valence-was the economy better or
   worse-what mattered was the level of importance an individual placed on
   the economy.},
