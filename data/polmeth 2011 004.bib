Abstract = {A novel theory of the healthcare policy of right-wing governments is
   presented in this article. It posits that the politics of health care is
   inherently different from the politics of a social policy related to the
   labour market. Health care protects against risks that are in the main
   uncorrelated with the income distribution. This implies that median
   voters will favour public provision, while high-income voters will not.
   This generates a unique challenge to right-wing governments that have to
   balance the interests of the two. The solution is marketization via
   compensation, where public spending is expanded but where public support
   of private market solutions is given special priority.},

Abstract = {What are the factors that lead to variation in the clientelistic use of
   state resources in electoral contexts? In this article I provide one
   answer to this question by focusing on the role of intra-party politics
   and analyzing the empirical case of patronage jobs in the Argentine
   provinces between 1984 and 2001. Patronage jobs in provincial
   administrations help governors build political support both in their own
   party and with the general public. However, when governors need their
   party (leader)'s support for their political careers and when the
   national party leadership position is open to competition, they reduce
   their clientelistic efforts not to lose the party's (or party leader's)
   support. The statistical analysis of public employment confirms this
   prediction that patronage is lower when the party's (or party leader's)
   support is important for politicians and when the leadership position
   within parties is open to competition.},

Abstract = {Lesbians, gay men, and bisexuals (LGBs) in the United States are
   strikingly more likely to vote for Democratic presidential candidates
   than heterosexuals. LGBs are one of the Democratic Party's most loyal
   voting blocs, despite the absence of one of the most important
   mechanisms for creating party identification: intergenerational
   transmission. We use the 2000 Presidential election to examine whether
   LGB voters overwhelmingly chose Al Gore because they viewed him as
   superior to George W. Bush on LGB-related policy issues or because of
   their greater overall liberalism and Democratic Party identification. We
   also examine the impact of socialization within the LGB community for
   generating political liberalism, Democratic Party identification, and
   interest in LGB policies. Using logit analysis on a 2000 Harris
   Interactive poll of 13,000 Americans, including 1,000 LGBs, we find that
   concern for LGB rights, policy liberalism, and party identification all
   played a role in the LGB vote.},

Abstract = {In the early 1980s, the U.S. government began to address the issue of
   substance use during pregnancy. Attention to this issue was ushered to
   the forefront of health-care debates due to the belief that the nation
   was gripped in an epidemic of ``crack babies{''} (children born addicted
   to crack cocaine). Many involved in developing policy addressing this
   issue called for harsh measures as an attempt to curtail a possible
   crisis involving thousands of children. This case study expands existing
   research through examining the events which led to two significant court
   cases in South Carolina. The first involves the establishment of fetal
   rights in the state and the other resulted in the strengthening of an
   individual's right to privacy and bodily integrity in the United States.
   The study also outlines the effectiveness of the creation of a moral
   panic to adopt politically controversial and questionably constitutional
   social policy.},

Abstract = {Many previous studies have examined the level of state grants to local
   K-12 school districts. However, these studies have not considered the
   role of citizen ``trust{''} in state versus local governments as a
   factor. We hypothesize that the role of the state in funding education
   reflects citizen ``trust{''} in the relative capabilities of
   governments. We measure ``trust{''} directly via public opinion polls
   that capture citizen attitudes about the appropriate responsibilities of
   state versus local governments; we also measure ``trust{''} indirectly,
   by the role of state government as revealed by its relative importance
   in overall service provision (net of K-12 spending). We find that the
   state share of K-12 education spending tends to be higher when there is
   greater citizen trust in state versus local governments.},

Abstract = {It has been suggested that interaction in online learning programmes
   promotes student-centred learning, encourages wider student
   participation, and produces more in-depth and reasoned discussions than
   traditional face-to-face programmes (Karayan and Crowe (1997) and Smith
   and Hardaker (2000) cited in Davies and Graff (2005: 1)). In this
   article, the participation rates and usage patterns by undergraduate
   political science students of online discussion forums are examined. The
   study is guided by a number of questions: (1) Are students willing to
   participate in online discussion forums? (2) Do students enjoy
   participating in such forums? (3) What discourages a student from
   participating in online discussion forums? (4) Is there a link between
   participation in discussion forums and grade performances in coursework?
   and (5) Does class size have an impact on forum participation rates? The
   study focuses on two groups of students studying introductory Irish
   politics courses in University College Cork, Ireland. The article
   considers student feedback on the use of online discussion forums,
   compares the level of participation with course grades, and finally
   presents an account of the author's reflections on the use of online
   discussion forums in teaching.},

Abstract = {This article reports the findings of two research projects which focused
   on the complex intersection of poverty and disability. Poverty is a
   widespread social problem and international institutions have published
   numerous reports on poverty and social inequality in the world. Despite
   the fact that data shows that disabled people are more likely than
   non-disabled to be poor, few research projects have considered the
   relations between disability and poverty. The goal of the research
   reported in this article was to gain an in-depth understanding and
   knowledge about the everyday lives of disability pensioners from their
   own perspective. Qualitative methods were used; individual and focus
   group interviews with disability pensioners. Participants were a diverse
   group regarding age, impairment, education, housing and other factors.
   Findings show that participants found it difficult to survive on the
   disability pension and many were struggling at the edge of poverty. Most
   used various strategies in order to subsist in the context of financial
   vulnerability. Despite that most found it difficult or impossible to
   maintain a surplus to withstand economic shocks. When people could not
   make ends meet most turned to their social net works, usually family,
   for assistance and our findings show that such mutual social networks
   can play a crucial role. The financial and social struggles to manage on
   a daily basis created insecurity, anxiety and stress which took a toll
   on people's physical and psychological health. It is important that
   action taken by authorities to prevent poverty be based on knowledge of
   people's lives and the complex forces at work at the intersection of
   disability and poverty.},

Abstract = {Discussion of the relationship between parties and the electorate is
   often based on the notion of partisan constituencies, that parties adopt
   policy positions that correspond to the average position of the party
   supporters. In contrast, the Downsian ``spatial model{''} assumes that
   parties are purely opportunistic and maneuver to gain as many votes as
   possible. A third, more empirical model, based on the early work of
   Stokes, assumes that voter choice is based on the evaluation of each of
   the party leader's competence or ability to deliver policy success. Such
   an evaluation can be provided by individual voter overall assessment in
   terms of the leaders' character traits.
   This paper attempts to relate these three classes of models by examining
   the elections in Great Britain in 2005 and 2010. Using the British
   Election Study, we construct spatial models of these elections in Great
   Britain as well as in the three regions of England. Scotland and Wales.
   The models incorporate the electoral perceptions of character traits. We
   compare the equilibrium vote maximizing positions with the partisan
   positions, estimated by taking the mean of each of the parties voters'
   preferred positions. We define an equilibrium to be a stable attractor
   if the vote share at the equilibrium exceeds the share at the partisan
   position by a significant proportion (determined by the implicit error
   of the stochastic model). We infer that none of the equilibria are
   stable attractors, and suggest that the partisan positions are also
   preferred by the party activists, the key supporters of each party. (C)

Abstract = {In recent decades, ordinary European Union (EU) citizens have been able
   to express their opinion on the course of the European project on
   several occasions. Judging from electoral outcomes, there is quite some
   Euroscepticism among them. What motivations underlie the Eurosceptic
   vote? Using an extended and comprehensive multidimensional measure of EU
   attitudes, we investigate which specific attitudes and issue positions
   were conducive to Eurosceptic voting in the 2009 European Parliament
   elections. Based on a voter survey in 21 countries, we conclude that
   concerns about the EU's `democratic deficit', low perceived utility of
   the EU for the country, negative affection towards the EU, opposition to
   EU integration, and an absence of EU identity enhance anti-EU voting. In
   addition, these effects depend on the dispersion of party positions
   concerning EU matters, so that the more the parties diverge on EU
   matters, the stronger the effect becomes of each of the five EU
   dimensions mentioned on party choice. We conclude by setting these
   findings in perspective and discussing their implications for the future
   of the European project.},

Abstract = {This article looks beyond economic explanations of the financial crisis
   in Iceland, and focuses on the political preconditions for the crisis.
   The argument is that liberalization of the economy, privatization of the
   banking sector and lax regulation, together with looting strategies from
   investors, explain both the rise and fall of the financial sector in
   Iceland. By examining the historic development of the Icelandic
   financial sector from 1991 until 2008, I show how fundamental changes,
   through liberalization and Europeanization, in the economic system made
   the crisis possible. Data have been collected from official government
   documents, newspapers, research papers and published reports.},

Abstract = {Soviet memorial literature addresses the Wehrmacht's blockade of
   Leningrad in a variety of ways. But for ideological reasons, it paid
   little attention to a key aspect of the physical and psychological
   reality: hunger. Only literary scholar and writer Lidiia Ginzburg
   investigated hunger as a physical, cultural, and existential fact in her
   writings about the blockade. She asked how the memory of this extreme
   situation could be kept alive. Going beyond official memory culture, she
   expanded the field of aesthetic and intellectual discussion of the
   Leningrad population's experience with suffering.},

Abstract = {Radical left parties - particularly their involvement in government
   either as full coalition partners or support parties to minority social
   democratic administrations - have not received as much attention as
   their counterparts on the far right of the political spectrum or,
   indeed, the Greens. This interview-based study, which focuses on the
   calculations made by left parties with a chance of getting involved in
   governing, suggests that this needs to change. It argues that, whatever
   the origins of these left parties, such calculations can fruitfully be
   explored by characterising them - just as we have begun to characterise
   the calculations of Green and radical right parties - as the kind of
   trade-offs between policy, office and votes that more mainstream
   political actors have been making ever since democracy was established
   in Europe. Similarly, other factors that impact on the calculations made
   by radical left parties thinking about government are unlikely to be
   exclusive to them. They include a history of coalition building at the
   subnational level, the views of trade unions, personal relationships
   with other party leaders, and finally their reading of how government
   involvement has impacted on their counterparts in other countries.

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Number = {3},
Pages = {463-477},

Abstract = {We use a field experiment to investigate whether race affects how
   responsive state legislators are to requests for help with registering
   to vote. In an email sent to each legislator, we randomized whether a
   putatively black or white alias was used and whether the email signaled
   the sender's partisan preference. Overall, we find that putatively black
   requests receive fewer replies. We explore two potential explanations
   for this discrimination: strategic partisan behavior and the
   legislators' own race. We find that the putatively black alias continues
   to be differentially treated even when the emails signal partisanship,
   indicating that strategic considerations cannot completely explain the
   observed differential treatment. Further analysis reveals that white
   legislators of both parties exhibit similar levels of discrimination
   against the black alias. Minority legislators do the opposite,
   responding more frequently to the black alias. Implications for the
   study of race and politics in the United States are discussed.},

Abstract = {Models of presidential success have sometimes focused on the importance
   of political capital and sometimes looked at the partisan environment of
   Congress. We develop time-series models of success that refine and
   integrate these perspectives while reframing the matter in terms of
   research on congressional parties. Measures of the ideological and
   partisan makeup of Congress are used to explain presidential success
   from 1953 to 2006 but the approval of the president's base is important
   as well. We also show the electoral consequences to congressional
   parties of presidential success-congressional parties gain and lose
   seats based on the battles won and lost by the president. This gives
   legislators (not) of his party an incentive to see his agenda
   implemented (defeated). Studying both the causes and consequences of
   presidential success in Congress is meant to integrate theories of the
   two institutions along with extant theories of party behavior.},

Abstract = {Marie Peze, Women at work. A second punishment
   What place the necessities for a social identity at work let in the
   construction of men and women? The working world is submited to social
   relationships between men and women, which are defining behaviours and
   world conceptions, that are not sexual in the psychanalytic meaning of
   the word. If men can appropriate tasks of responsability which are
   demanding a strong bio-availabily, we must record that the performance
   of man is often got through the support of man's body by the women. The
   capacity to work of men is therefore backed from the body work of women,
   an invisible work, which seems natural and which must be done with a
   smile. Because of the differences in the starting salaries, the
   discrimination in the repartition of work, the outsourcing of private
   life, the women, athletes of the everiday life, suffer from a lack of
   appreciation of their invisible know-how.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to make a commented reading on the book The revenge of
   God by Gilles Kepel where he studies the relationship between politics
   and religion, illustrating that this relationship has been present in
   the latest international developments in Christianity, in the followers
   of Islam and of Judaism. The contribution is to show that this
   relationship has been also present in Buddhism, a process which does not
   account Gilles Kepel in his book. It is important to address this issue,
   to understand how for a considerable length of time a large number of
   Buddhist monks in Myanmar (formerly Birmania), have been leading
   protests against the military regime in power. The interest to discuss
   this is not simply casuistic, but entails a reflection that is not
   included in the text by Gilles Kepel, i.e., unlike the
   re-Christianization, re-Islamization and re-Judaizing processes that
   have emerged since the 70s as a negation of the modernity; Buddhism, in
   particular as a nontheistic religion, claims modern values such as
   democracy; at least this is the reflection left by Dalai Lamas words in
   Paris regarding the last Olympic Games held in China.},

Abstract = {Economic voting models predict a direct translation of ``objective{''}

Abstract = {What Marx referred to as the ``so-called primitive accumulation'' has
   been frequently revisited in contemporary theoretical writing, but has
   often been read simply as a unilateral process of destruction of the
   supposedly holistic community that preceded it. More broadly, this
   illogical or irrational moment of beginning, the origin of the
   historical presuppositions for capital's development, is a general
   problem of power, the problem of how an order that appears as a perfect
   circle, a closed circuit with no outside that nevertheless paradoxically
   requires something outside it, can be generated and maintained.
   Schmitt's discussion of the formation of the modern order of
   nation-states, the enclosure of territory, the maintenance of their
   borders, and the acts that sustain this order itself can be effectively
   cross-read with Marx's discussion. The moment of primitive accumulation
   is not so much a force of destruction or elimination of difference as it
   is an even greater violence of creation-the creation of the owner of
   labor power and the formation of a system of difference that will
   furnish the basis for capital's full deployment.},

   Policy},
Journal = {SCANDINAVIAN POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {34},
Number = {2},
Pages = {123-142},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Cost effectiveness is a key principle of climate policies in
   industrialised countries, yet there are significant political barriers
   against its implementation. The Norwegian case demonstrates that
   differences in the climate policy instruments targeting different
   sectors cannot be explained by the sectors' relative significance in the
   national economy. Whereas the economically insignificant
   energy-intensive industries (EIIs) successfully resisted mandatory
   greenhouse gas (GHG) regulations until 2008, the offshore petroleum
   industry (the most important sector for Norway's gross domestic product)
   has paid NOK 300 per tonne of CO(2) since 1991. What explains why some
   sectors successfully resist GHG regulations while others do not? This
   analysis indicates that a key determinant is interdependence between
   target groups and decision makers in winning coalitions. EIIs were
   capable of issuing relevant and credible threats to shut down and
   relocate if costly GHG policies were imposed. In contrast, decision
   makers did not perceive as credible the offshore petroleum industry's
   claim that a CO(2) tax would undermine its competitiveness. Moreover,
   when target groups can issue effective threats, private information
   becomes more relevant and reinforces decision makers' dependence on
   target group cooperation.},

   Poland and for Poles increased after the 2003 vote to join and
   dramatically so after accession. Analysis of panel data from 2003 and
   2008 shows the increase in positive assessments is related to the size
   of EU transfers and to increases in personal income, particularly for
   assessments of personal benefits. The attitude changes are also related
   to variables associated with individuals mostly likely to benefit from
   greater access to the larger Europe. The positive EU attitudes on both
   dimensions are related to votes for the pro-EU party that came into
   office in the 2007 election. In this way, the benefits from entry
   `bought' more favorable attitudes and a more favorable government for
   the EU.},

Abstract = {This article offers a reply to Werner Bonefeld's recent contribution to
   the debate on value and abstract labour, in which he critically engages
   with our previous articles dealing with these questions. We argue that
   Bonefeld's criticisms are not simply based on disagreements over these
   controversial issues, but also on a misunderstanding of our stance on
   abstract labour and value. In addition to clarifying our position, the
   article provides some brief critical remarks on Bonefeld's own
   intervention in the debate and shows that his contribution fails to
   offer a solid analysis of the fundamental categories of the critique of
   political economy.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the apparent contradiction between the current
   tendency of many Indigenous groups and their political institutions to
   embrace the capitalist economic model as the one and only solution in
   establishing contemporary Indigenous self-governance, on the one hand,
   and on the other, the detrimental force of the market economy on
   Indigenous societies, pat and present. The starting point is the
   following question. If the global market economy-historically played a
   significant role in the loss of political and economic autonomy of
   Indigenous societies and women, how meaningful or sustainable is it to
   seek to (re)build contemporary Indigenous governance on the very
   economic-model that was largely responsible for undermining it in the
   first place? Shouldn't this history be taken into consideration when
   discussing and shaping models and policies for contemporary Indigenous
   governance and hence be more critical of the standard economic
   development frameworks hailed as the path toward self-governance?},

Abstract = {This article proposes a mode of analysis drawing from historical
   institutionalism and American political development but that is
   generated more organically from within the study of law. This approach,
   legal archaeology, focuses on the production of legal discourse while
   attending to the institutional boundaries and conditions around this
   production. Legal archaeology is particularly useful for understanding
   the role of law in constructing subordinated identities. Illuminating
   legal struggles over the boundaries of subordinated identities
   facilitates consideration of how subordination is institutionalized,
   though archaeology maintains legal institutions at the center of the
   analysis. The article concludes with examples of the analysis.},

   three ways: (a) It compares the oil regimes of Venezuela and Colombia.
   (b) It analyses the meaning of energy security for the US, China,
   Venezuela and Colombia. (c) It looks for analogies in the experience
   concerning Eurasian pipelines. If this experience is any guide, the U.S
   would oppose an oil pipeline from the Orinoco Belt to the Colombian
   Pacific Coast for exports to China, and its opposition would delay the
   project, but not necessarily prevent it from implementation.},

Abstract = {Over recent decades, the American states have implemented electoral
   reforms that make it easier for citizens to register and vote. This
   article examines the ``equality effects{''} of these reforms: the degree
   to which reform serves to equalize or further skew participation rates
   between the rich and poor. Using the Voter Supplement to the Current
   Population Survey, the authors generate state-level estimates of income
   bias in registration and voting for elections from 1978 to 2008.
   Findings support their theory that some electoral reforms promote
   equality, while others further stratify the electorate-particularly when
   state registration rolls are already unrepresentative in terms of income
   groups.},

Abstract = {Over the last years the debate about nuclear energy has been renewed.
   This option has reemerged as a ``clean energy{''}, due to the no
   emission of greenhouse gases during the power plant operation.
   Nevertheless, there still remain some controversial aspects about it:
   the uncertainty about the radioactive waste management, including
   reprocessing; the environmental problems of uranium mining; or the
   health and safety risks for workers in nuclear facilities. These issues
   constitute a complex and conflictive scene, and represent the main
   arguments of antinuclear and ecologist opposition. This article
   addresses the identification of the different environmental conflicts
   regarding the whole life cycle of nuclear energy. In so doing, its main
   objective is to contribute to enlight the debate about the environmental
   problems around the nuclear energy, through different proposals from the
   Peace Research field.},

Abstract = {This study applies attribution theory to examine public appraisals of
   the president. To date, most political science research on attribution
   theory has focused on domestic policy, and no work has considered both
   domestic and foreign policy domains in tandem. To fill this gap, we
   formulate and experimentally test a series of hypotheses regarding the
   level of responsibility and credit/blame that individuals attribute to
   the president in both policy domains across varying policy conditions.
   We also consider how party compatibility affects people's attribution
   judgments. Our findings provide a new contribution to the literature on
   political attributions, executive accountability, and public perceptions
   of presidential performance.},

Abstract = {To understand the politics of recognition, one must conceive of it as a
   politics of representation. Like representation, recognition proceeds at
   once in a constative and a performative mode, whereby they bring into
   being what is simultaneously represented or recognized. This structure
   has paradoxical implications. The politics of recognition is also a
   politics of representation in the sense that it always involves
   questions such as, Which representations are recognized? Whose
   representations are they? The reverse is also true: the politics of
   representation involves recognition because representatives and
   representations must be recognized in order to gain authority. In short,
   we can examine recognition as representation, and there is no
   recognition without representation, and vice versa. This is demonstrated
   through a reading of a recent British legal case, Begum, where the issue
   at stake concerned which representation of Islam should form the basis
   for the recognition of Islam in the school uniform policy.},

Abstract = {Hobbesian war primarily arises not because material resources are
   scarce; or because humans ruthlessly seek survival before all else; or
   because we are naturally selfish, competitive, or aggressive brutes.
   Rather, it arises because we are fragile, fearful, impressionable, and
   psychologically prickly creatures susceptible to ideological
   manipulation, whose anger can become irrationally inflamed by even
   trivial slights to our glory. The primary source of war, according to
   Hobbes, is disagreement, because we read into it the most inflammatory
   signs of contempt. Both cause and remedy are therefore primarily
   ideological: The Leviathan's primary function is to settle the meaning
   of the most controversial words implicated in social life, minimize
   public disagreement, neutralize glory, magnify the fear of death, and
   root out subversive doctrines. Managing interstate conflict, in turn,
   requires not only coercive power, but also the soft power required to
   shape characters and defuse the effects of status competition.},

Abstract = {We examine county-level campaign appearances by the Republican and
   Democratic tickets during the 2008 general election. Our analysis
   reveals that the McCain-Palin ticket campaigned in a way that was quite
   different from the Obama-Biden ticket. McCain-Palin pursued a ``base{''}
   strategy that was focused on counties where Bush-Cheney performed well
   in 2004. They also stayed away from counties that showed vote swings
   from 2000 to 2004 or population growth. On the other hand, the
   performance of the Kerry-Edwards ticket in 2004 was a very weak
   predictor of where Obama-Biden campaigned in 2008. They pursued a
   ``peripheral{''} strategy that targeted counties that had experienced
   significant population growth. Their efforts to target peripheral,
   rather than base constituencies, have significant implications for our
   understanding of presidential campaign strategy.},

Abstract = {Do political parties respond to shifts in the preferences of their
   supporters, which we label the partisan constituency model, or to shifts
   in the mean voter position (the general electorate model)?
   Cross-national analyses - based on observations from Eurobarometer
   surveys and parties' policy programmes in 15 countries from 1973 to 2002
   - suggest that the general electorate model characterizes the policy
   shifts of mainstream parties. Alternatively, when we analyse the policy
   shifts of Communist, Green and extreme Nationalist parties (i.e. `niche'
   parties), we find that these parties respond to shifts in the mean
   position of their supporters. The findings have implications for spatial
   theories and political representation.},

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {55},
Number = {2},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Can electoral rules be designed to achieve political ideals such as
   accurate representation of voter preferences and accountable
   governments? The academic literature commonly divides electoral systems
   into two types, majoritarian and proportional, and implies a
   straightforward trade-off by which having more of an ideal that a
   majoritarian system provides means giving up an equal measure of what
   proportional representation (PR) delivers. We posit that these
   trade-offs are better characterized as nonlinear and that one can gain
   most of the advantages attributed to PR, while sacrificing less of those
   attributed to majoritarian elections, by maintaining district magnitudes
   in the low to moderate range. We test this intuition against data from
   609 elections in 81 countries between 1945 and 2006. Electoral systems
   that use low-magnitude multimember districts produce disproportionality
   indices almost on par with those of pure PR systems while limiting party
   system fragmentation and producing simpler government coalitions.},

Abstract = {How polarized are American political parties? Recently, Kidd used an
   automated content analysis program to demonstrate that American party
   platforms reveal only minor policy differences. In contrast to his
   conclusions, this analysis produces three main findings. First, at the
   state level, state party platforms reveal considerable ideological
   differences between the parties. Second, differences in state public
   opinion do not account for these differences; rather, they are more
   closely correlated with activist opinions and increases in state party
   competition. Finally, the conflict is not simply ideological but applies
   to specific issues in the platforms. As such, American state parties are
   highly polarized on different measures. Automated content analysis
   programs clearly represent an important methodological advance in coding
   political texts, but the results here call attention to the importance
   of policy and agenda content in party platforms. Moreover, studies of
   American politics, particularly research focusing on parties and
   ideological polarization, need to take into account the diversity of
   agendas that is inherent in a federal party system.},

   Platon Lebedev, a verdict that surpasses its 2005 predecessor in
   arbitrariness and cynicism. This is the conclusion of a detailed
   analysis of the indictment, the facts of the case, the trial procedure,
   as well as the verdict. In contrast to the situation after the first
   trial, resistance is now stirring in parts of the elite.},

Abstract = {Many political theorists assume that Kant's categorical imperative can
   only present itself to politics epistemologically-that is, as a test or
   procedure for acquiring more certain knowledge of duties. This study
   retrieves the ontological aspect of the categorical imperative by
   showing that the Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals is a conversion
   narrative. In the Groundwork Kant describes a transformative encounter
   with the categorical imperative as a principle that discloses our
   (ordinarily concealed) ontological condition. This encounter opens a new
   mode of being characterized by the feeling of awe. In its ontological
   aspect, the categorical imperative discloses human freedom and demands
   an unflagging thoughtfulness, but offers no material guidance about
   duties. When understood in both its ontological and epistemological
   aspects, the categorical imperative offers a rich portrait of human
   responsibility and can help illuminate the ethical stance appropriate to
   politics without becoming a standard to be imposed upon politics.},

Abstract = {The transatlantic crisis of 2003 was not only about the Iraq War. It
   concerned a range of foreign policy issues, as well as commitments to
   multilateralism and security institutions more broadly. The dispute over
   the International Criminal Court (ICC), for example, was frequently
   cited as evidence of a transatlantic rupture or a growing gap between
   Europe and America. The US proved deeply ambivalent about the idea of a
   permanent court with independent powers and weary about limiting its own
   foreign policy maneuverability. The European debate, while internally
   fragmented, generally supported a Court that mirrored its own
   structures, cut across power politics and extended a legal regime
   internationally. Barack Obama's election brought a new wave of optimism
   in transatlantic relations as many expected his foreign policies would
   be more aligned with European priorities. The tone improved decidedly in
   2009, and because of political and humanitarian crises in Sudan the US
   prepared itself to engage constructively with the ICC. Nevertheless, as
   this article demonstrates, the US and Europe are still worlds apart on
   the ICC and the international legal order that it represents.},

Abstract = {Trade unions have protecting workers' economic rights as their main
   responsibility. They have, inter alia, to make sure that workers are
   paid reasonably in a workers-friendly working environment. It is however
   not canonical that trade unions should only stick to this role
   especially under a circumstance where public policies are silent about
   workers interests. In this context, a political role is inescapable as
   these unions have to go beyond economism and struggle to democratize the
   state. This paper therefore looks at whether the reintroduction of
   liberal politics has improved trade unions' ability to influence the
   state by making it more concerned about workers rights. It is however
   the view of this paper that the reintroduction of liberal politics in
   Tanzania has not improved trade unions' ability to democratize the state
   for they are still apolitical as they were before liberalization.},

   media coverage affects national parliaments' involvement in EU

Abstract = {This article empirically investigates how media coverage of European
   Union (EU) policy-formulation affects the involvement of national
   parliaments in these processes. The literature has variously argued that
   the involvement of national parliaments in EU policy-formulation is
   unrelated to media coverage, that media strengthen the hand of
   backbenchers and opposition or that media reinforce executive dominance.
   Using a mixed methodology research design for a longitudinal case study
   of debates on the EU budget in the Netherlands between 1992 and 2005,
   this article presents evidence for all three hypotheses, but with clear
   variations over time. Although institutional arrangements clearly
   structure parliamentary involvement limiting media effects, its
   explanatory power decreases as the intensity of debate increases.
   Limited media coverage reinforces executive dominance whereas extensive
   media coverage provides a weapon of the weak and strengthens the
   involvement of parliaments in general, and opposition parties in
   particular. Comparative European Polities (2011) 9, 123-144.

Abstract = {Existing studies on the determinants of negative campaigning conclude
   that context matters as the degree of positive and negative campaigning
   vary according to factors such as proximity to election day, poll
   standing, incumbency status, and the size of the `war chest'. The
   present article discusses whether not only the context, but also the
   content of campaigns needs to be considered when analysing why and when
   political parties go negative. The article argues that parties enjoying
   ownership of campaign issues tend to employ a more positive rhetorical
   style than parties with less ownership. Using four Danish election
   campaigns as cases, this proposition is empirically supported: the
   degree of issue ownership is positively correlated with a positive
   campaign tone, controlling for a range of traditional contextual
   factors. The new content factor does not outperform the usual contextual
   suspects, but it adds nuance to the general understanding of the
   determinants of negativity.},

Abstract = {This is a story about competition between a primitive political science,
   a modern political science, and their significance to the future of
   political science and the state. The old-fashioned political science is
   comprised of storytelling, otherwise called case studies. The modern,
   pure political science is committed to the incorporation of the methods
   of pure science. The difference between the two is the origin of an
   on-going debate within political science. When the state suffers a
   threat to its sovereignty, it seeks to suppress or coopt domestic
   centers of power. It patronizes the pure science because it shows some
   promise of valuable service. Chile is a significant example. And the
   older political science will suffer due to its tendency to expose
   pathologies and its inability to remain neutral. Thus, once the state
   tends toward authoritarianism, the storytelling political science is
   likely to suffer because thorough analyses find their way toward
   criticism, to pathology. Once the state has intervened, the national
   association may respond but with too little support, and the individual
   practitioners may have to retreat to their national association and to
   the International Political Science Association, which may speak for all
   of the 60+ national associations. The International Political Science
   Association will be the canary in the coal mine. The Nobel awaits.},

Abstract = {In contrast to the recent multi-billion dollar bailouts offered to
   leading sectors of capital, fiscal austerity is poised to make a
   comeback worldwide. Labour will be forced to pay for the public debt
   accumulated in the aftermath of the recent global financial and economic
   crisis. Notwithstanding change and evolution in the neoliberal model
   over time, this return to austerity is consistent with overall policy in
   the neoliberal period which can be considered an era of permanent
   restraint in most areas of social spending. This article examines a
   variety of trends that have emerged over the past thirty years of
   neoliberal rule: the various facets of neoliberal policy and their
   temporal dimensions; as well as the results of market-reliance and
   spending reforms: growing affluence for a minority of Canadians while
   the majority lose ground and inequalities are further entrenched. Asking
   `austerity for whom' directs attention at the interconnections between
   affluence and austerity that exist in Canada.},

Abstract = {Political scientists and constitutional engineers have recommended
   various power sharing models to guarantee political stability in
   multiethnic societies. The literature on power sharing seems to suggest
   that consociationalism and centripetalism are the two prominent models.
   While the former suggests grand coalition, the latter recommends
   multiethnic coalition cabinets to share power in diverse societies.
   Keeping in view these models, this paper attempts to examine the
   performance of various coalition cabinets in post-1971 Pakistan. The
   evidence shows that the coalition cabinets in Pakistan remained
   short-lived. The Pakistani experience seems to suggest that the power
   sharing models have certain limitations in diverse societies and are
   not, necessarily, appropriate option for all multiethnic states.},

Journal = {STATE POLITICS \& POLICY QUARTERLY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Pages = {48-75},

Abstract = {The creation of racial/ethnic majority-minority districts lies at the
   heart of debates regarding the utility of descriptive representation for
   minority policy advocacy. The general puzzle that emerges from these
   debates, however, rests on the possibility that by electing
   representatives who are policy outsiders, minority interests would exert
   little influence in the policy decisions of median-dominated
   institutions. The authors present a model that shows how
   majority-minority districts can act to (1) increase the likelihood of
   electing minority representatives who are unique policy advocates and
   (2) concurrently increase the level of institutional status of
   descriptive representatives. The empirical analysis employs a novel data
   set of observations on political, sociodemographic, roll-call and
   institutional position, covering twenty U.S. states in the late 1990s
   and over 2,600 state legislative seats to show how majority-minority
   districts produce policy outsiders as well as institutional insiders.},

Abstract = {Despite attempts to mobilize communities of color, gaps in turnout among
   racial and ethnic minorities persist (e.g., Abrajano et al., J Polit
   70:368-382, 2008; Pantoja et al., Polit Res Q 54:729-750, 2001;
   Kaufmann, Polit Res Q 56:199-210, 2003; Ramirez, Ann Am Acad Pol Soc Sci
   601:66-84, 2005, Am Polit Res 35:155-175, 2007). Scholars are only
   beginning to understand how parties or independent groups seek to
   mobilize these communities. In this paper, we develop and test the
   Differential Contact Thesis, which holds that turnout differences
   between whites and minority groups are influenced both by lower rates of
   contact by the parties and the use of less effective methods of contact.
   To test this, we examine data from the 2004 National Annenberg Election
   Study (NAES), 2004 American National Election Study (ANES), and the 2004
   Miami Exit Poll. Our results support the Differential Contact Thesis:
   even controlling for the initial likelihood to be contacted by the
   parties, racial and ethnic minorities were less likely to be contacted
   using the most effective techniques. To some extent, non-partisan
   contact seems to compensate for the inattention of the major parties
   toward minority voters, but this contact is less likely to mobilize
   voters than contact from the parties.},

Abstract = {This article uses a survey experiment embedded in the 2008 CCES national
   sample to assess how the public responds to immigrant-rights protests
   and to determine whether symbolic representations of national identity
   can serve to ``prime{''} attitudes about immigrants and immigration
   policy. Based on social identity theory, the common in-group identity
   model, we expect responses to protesters waving American flags as a
   display of loyalty should be less hostile than responses to protesters
   waving Mexican flags. Our experiment demonstrates evidence in favor of
   this proposition but shows no impact of how protesters were framed on
   immigration policy preferences.},

Abstract = {At present, when we are once again faced with the question: quo vadis
   Bosnia and Herzegovina, towards new integration or towards further
   disintegration? - it is undoubtedly useful to show how and when the
   process was initiated of its administrative-territorial division and its
   connecting with the neighbour states in the 20th century; in this case,
   with Dalmatia in 1929 within the Littoral Banovina, and with the
   Banovina of Croatia ten years later. This paper provides a detailed
   account of the size of territory and population with regard to various
   denominations on the level of 8, i.e. 13 districts which comprised 38,
   i.e. 70 municipalities of BiH. The population data based on the 1931
   census, the last carried out in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, are the
   starting point of an attempt to establish the ratio between the Catholic
   majority and the Islam and Orthodox minorities. In the period of the
   Littoral Banovina, the Catholic population in the Bosnian-Herzegovinian
   districts had the absolute majority of 63\%, and in the Banovina of
   Croatia - 53\%. Beside the Catholics, the same counties were inhabited
   by minorities of Islam and Orthodox denominations, which were in the
   majority in some municipalities and districts. In Dalmatian districts of
   the Littoral Banovina, 84\% of the population were Catholics, while the
   percentage in BiH districts was 63\%, which means that the percentage on
   the level of the Banovina as a whole was 75\%. Consequently, many were
   right to perceive and proclaim that the Littoral Banovina was Catholic
   by denomination, and Croatian by ethnicity, although this became a fact
   only when it joined the Banovina of Croatia together with the Sava
   Banovina.},

Abstract = {Is electoral competition good for political selection? To address this
   issue, we introduce a theoretical model where ideological parties select
   and allocate high-valence (experts) and low-valence (party loyalists)
   candidates into electoral districts. Voters care about a national policy
   (e. g., party ideology) and the valence of their district's candidates.
   High-valence candidates are more costly for the parties to recruit. We
   show that parties compete by selecting and allocating good politicians
   to the most contestable districts. Empirical evidence on Italian members
   of parliament confirms this prediction: politicians with higher ex ante
   quality, measured by years of schooling, previous market income, and
   local government experience, are more likely to run in contestable
   districts. Indeed, despite being different on average, politicians
   belonging to opposite political coalitions converge to high-quality
   levels in close electoral races. Furthermore, politicians elected in
   contestable districts have fewer absences in parliament, due to a
   selection effect more than to reelection incentives.},

Abstract = {A large body of scholarship finds a negative relationship between
   natural resources and democracy. Extant cross-country regressions,
   however, assume random effects and are run on panel datasets with
   relatively short time dimensions. Because natural resource reliance is
   not an exogenous variable, this is not an effective strategy for
   uncovering causal relationships. Numerous sources of bias may be driving
   the results, the most serious of which is omitted variable bias induced
   by unobserved country-specific and time-invariant heterogeneity. To
   address these problems, we develop unique historical datasets, employ
   time-series centric techniques, and operationalize explicitly specified
   counterfactuals. We test to see if there is a long-run relationship
   between resource reliance and regime type within countries over time,
   both on a country-by-country basis and across several different panels.
   We find that increases in resource reliance are not associated with
   authoritarianism. In fact, in many specifications we generate results
   that suggest a resource blessing.},

Abstract = {A salient feature of China's Great Leap Famine is that political
   radicalism varied enormously across provinces. Using excessive grain
   procurement as a pertinent measure, we find that such variations were
   patterned systematically on the political career incentives of Communist
   Party officials rather than the conventionally assumed ideology or
   personal idiosyncrasies. Political rank alone can explain 16.83\% of the
   excess death rate: the excess procurement ratio of provinces governed by
   alternate members of the Central Committee was about 3\% higher than in
   provinces governed by full members, or there was an approximate 1.11\%
   increase in the excess death rate. The stronger career incentives of
   alternate members can be explained by the distinctly greater privileges,
   status, and power conferred only on the rank of full members of the
   Central Committee and the ``entry barriers{''} to the Politburo that
   full members faced.},

Abstract = {This article provides a critique of the self-validating public responses
   to the international crisis of legitimacy facing the banking industry
   and professional politicians since the economic crisis of 2009. It
   compares the failure of economic conscience within Establishment
   institutions with the public culture of intrinsic economic conscience
   found in some developing economies and similar embryonic developments in
   Western economies. It highlights the way this alternative economic
   conscience might contribute to public discourse about economic and
   political governance, and thereby to democratic renewal in more
   supposedly advanced societies.},

Abstract = {The emergence of the human security norm in global security studies
   continues to attract debates among international relations experts and
   security analysts. One of the dimensions of the debate is centred on the
   security focus of the newly created African Union (AU) that replaced the
   Organisation of African Unity on 26 May 2001. In view of the impact of
   violent conflicts on socioeconomic development of African states and
   peoples, the African Union has made the pursuit of peace and security
   one of its central functions. The security focus of the AU is fostering
   intra-regional cooperation as well as interregional cooperation to
   develop the AU's capacity to intervene in conflicts. This article
   explores the interregional security cooperation that is emerging between
   the North Atlantic Security Organization (NATO) and the African Union
   with regard to the building of the capability of the African Standby
   Force (ASF). I argue that the AU-NATO security cooperation is a unique
   relationship in the history of regional organisations in Africa and that
   this relationship has been fostered by a shared `militarised'
   understanding of human security and the threat that insecurity in Africa
   poses to global security.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the elements of continuity and divergence between
   the core concepts of Classical Fascism (1919-1945) and those of the
   European New Right, in both its forms: the orthodox, embodied by Alain
   de Benoist, and the heterodox, represented by Guillaume Faye and Pierre
   Vial. Though these authors differ in terms of whether they provide
   explicit support for neo-populist political formations, they share a
   Heideggerian/Dasein vision of the world. In their publications they
   present the same diagnosis of the situation (spiritual and/or racial
   decadence), set the same priority objectives (palingenesis) and use the
   same cultural reference points (for example, Friedrich Nietzsche and the
   German Revolutionary Conservatives of the first third of the twentieth
   century). In view of these traits, it seems justifiable to label them as
   twenty-first century neo-Nazis. Above all if we show (as we aim to do in
   this article) that their conceptions of man and nature (for example, man
   as an aggressive, hierarchical and territorial being) are the same as
   those of the ideologues of Classical Fascism.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the relationship between the nation-state and
   migration through the activities of the International Organization for
   Migration (IOM). The IOM operates at the intersection of nation-states,
   international human rights regimes, and neo-liberal governance. We find
   that the IOM enforces the exclusions of asylum seekers and maintains the
   central role of nation-states in ordering global flows of migration. In
   addition, we argue that the IOM acts on behalf of nation-states by using
   the language of international human rights, as though working in the
   interests of migrants and refugees. In providing a geographic appraisal
   of the IOM alongside its image and presentation with an analysis of its
   activities on voluntary returns, we address the new spaces of
   `networked' governance that control and order migratory flows in the
   interests of nation-states.},

Journal = {GERMAN POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Pages = {51-74},
Abstract = {The 2009 German national election took place under extraordinary
   conditions: the two major parties, CDU/CSU and SPD, entered the election
   race as partners in a Grand Coalition. Throughout the whole year
   preceding the election, the financial and economic crisis was the
   predominant issue among mass media, voters and politics. This special
   framework influenced the campaigns of the competing parties as well as
   the political news coverage. Building on the literature on political
   campaigning and on data derived from content analyses of the main
   evening newscasts in the months prior to the election, we analyse the
   campaign strategies of all parties and their reflection in the news
   media. Our analysis suggests that the smaller opposition parties,
   especially the FDP, adjusted their campaign more successfully to the
   special circumstances, while the SPD and the CSU failed to get `their'
   issues onto the media agenda. The CDU chose a different - and in the end
   effective - approach by avoiding controversial issues and instead
   highlighting the value of stability and their popular Chancellor Merkel.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {73},
Number = {1},
Pages = {232-247},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Scholars have hypothesized that policy choices by national, state, and
   local governments often have implications for ``location choices{''}
   made by residents (e.g., tax policies affect where firms set up
   business, welfare benefits influence where the poor live, government
   restaurant smoking restrictions influence where people eat). We develop
   a spatially explicit strategic theory of policy diffusion driven by
   intergovernmental competition over residents' location choices. The
   theory assumes that governments' decisions constitute a strategic game
   in which governments are influenced by their neighbors. We suggest a
   variety of policy contexts in which the theory is applicable. For one
   such context the adoption of lotteries by American states we use the
   theory to generate several hypotheses and then test them using event
   history analysis. The results provide substantial support for the theory
   and indicate that states compete for lottery business in a much more
   sophisticated fashion than has been previously recognized.},

Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {18},
Number = {1},
Pages = {25-51},
Abstract = {Religiosity increases both criticism and instability in democratic
   performance evaluations, and accordingly decreases reliance on these
   assessments in the construction of political self-efficacy, trust in
   institutions, and patriotism. This is due to the conflicting experiences
   that religious citizens of democracies live through; while their
   personal religious environment often adheres to many undemocratic
   characteristics, their experience as citizens contains assorted
   democratic attributes. These results, from heteroskedastic maximum
   likelihood models using data from a 2006 representative survey among
   Israeli Jews, augment the exclusive focus of the literature of
   democratic attitudes on the strength of attitudes, and shift attention
   from policy attitudes to other evaluative judgements.},

Abstract = {John Rawls's Justice as Fairness is the most systematic attempt to
   provide a liberal grounding for justice in plural democratic societies.
   Rawls argued that social and economic inequalities were justifiable only
   if they were to the advantage of society's least-advantaged members.
   Rawls argued that the citizen with the lowest expectation for primary
   social goods occupied the least-advantaged position in society (PSGs are
   all-purpose means like income, wealth and opportunity). In his theory,
   the least advantaged are the least well-off citizens. This paper argues
   that Rawls's theory is correct, but requires certain emendations to
   inform the actual practice of plural democracies. In particular, Rawls
   had stipulated in theory that society was both ``closed{''} and
   ``well-ordered{''}. In practice, these assumptions no longer hold true.
   This has the effect of broadening the idea of the least-advantaged
   citizens. In particular, the least-advantaged become the least well-off
   (Rawls), the least capable (Amartya Sen) and the misrecognised (Charles
   Taylor). This paper focuses on the third type of disadvantaged citizens,
   those whose identities are misrecognised. Misrecognition of identity can
   cause harm; it can restrict the agency and opportunity. Minority
   identity groups (whose identities are often misrecognised) do not do as
   well as others citizens in social, economic and political terms.},

Abstract = {Even though the global crisis had a quick and dramatic impact on Chinese
   exports, the Chinese government responded with a range of policy
   responses that have helped maintain high rates of growth. This success
   has helped propel China to the centre of global politics, accelerating
   what many perceive to be a power shift from the West to China. But these
   gains were achieved by reversing policy in previous years designed to
   make a fundamental shift in China's mode of development and have
   highlighted the problems associated with making such a transition. At
   the moment that many are looking at the Chinese `model' as a potential
   alternative to the Washington Consensus, one of the consequences of the
   crisis is to further question the long-term efficacy of this `model' in
   China itself.},

Title = {The Zero-sum Game of Governing Together? Effects of Merkel's Grand
   Coalition on the Results of the 2009 German Federal Election},
Journal = {GERMAN POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {20},
Number = {2},
Pages = {260-272},
Abstract = {Grand coalitions are highly debated in Germany, where large parts of the
   media and the political world expect negative effects of grand
   coalitions on parliamentary party systems. This did not happen either
   with Merkel's grand coalition resulting from the 2005 election or with
   other grand coalitions in the German Lander. On the contrary, only the
   SPD suffered heavy losses in 2009. Most experts agree that those losses
   were caused by the SPD's participation in the grand coalition. Still, it
   remains largely unclear how Merkel's grand coalition affected the 2009
   federal election. To close that gap, this paper thoroughly analyses the
   effects of Merkel's grand coalition by looking at a crucial but mostly
   neglected factor in that regard, the evaluation of the grand coalition
   by voters. It can be shown that the CDU/CSU was mostly unaffected
   whereas the SPD suffered from being perceived as the less influential
   party in Merkel's grand coalition.},

Journal = {ASIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1},
Pages = {48-73},
Abstract = {Like in other developing countries, many local governments in the
   Philippines have become innovative under decentralization. We
   investigate here the drivers of local innovations, with focus on quality
   of incumbent leaders, their political incentives and fiscal resources.
   We applied Poisson regressions on a survey data comprising 209
   innovations introduced in 48 cities and municipalities during the period
   June 2004-June 2008. The statistically significant factors are the
   mayor's competence (age, educational attainment), re-election status and
   term in office. Innovations appear to increase with local fiscal
   resources but at decreasing rate. Access to information appears not to
   matter much. However, these factors, including poverty rates, vary in
   relative importance in explaining innovations in expenditure services,
   and in revenue and public administration services. Some policy inputs
   are suggested.},

Abstract = {This study uses a nation-wide representative survey from 2004 to explore
   the link between civil society involvement and civic attitudes in
   Turkey. The article argues that, besides civic attitudes, political
   attitudes are also significant in explaining membership in `Olson type'
   institutions, while membership in `Putnam type' institutions does not
   depend on attitudinal variables. The article concludes that low civil
   society participation with a gender gap and intolerance of rural
   participants raises significant questions about the democratic potential
   of civil society in Turkey.},

Abstract = {National climate change policies are becoming similar, which can be
   interpreted as being a result of policy diffusion processes. Many of
   those policies are inspired by EU climate strategies. The EU actively
   promotes these policies in its external relations, such as in its
   partnership on climate change with China. This leads us to three sets of
   questions. Does the EU act as a transformative power in interregional
   cooperation on climate change? Can we identify a climate change policy
   diffusion process in EU-Chinese relations, and, if so, which
   communication channels as well as diffusion mechanisms can be
   identified? And, finally, is interregional cooperation on climate change
   a building block or a stumbling block in the global climate change
   regime? This article argues that the policy diffusion process depends on
   the scope of the interregional communication process between the EU and
   China, and the willingness and national responsiveness of China to adopt
   policy innovations.},

Title = {The Rise of Gender Quota Laws: Expanding the Spectrum of Determinants
   for Electoral Reform},
Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {34},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {514-530},
Abstract = {The seminal work of Arend Lijphart, Electoral Systems and Party Systems
   (1994), limits the definition of electoral reforms to those affecting
   electoral formulas, district magnitudes, assembly size, or electoral
   thresholds. Following this definition, studies on electoral reform have
   put political parties and their motivations at centre stage. Expanding
   the definition of electoral reform, however, requires a move beyond
   parties to explore the multiple possible sources of change. This article
   examines the most common reforms ofrecent years, electoral gender quota
   policies, and points to at least four explanations for the adoption of
   gender quota laws. Based on extensive data from gender quota campaigns,
   the article suggests that the literature on this topic would benefit
   from efforts to broaden the analytical focus to include the role of
   agency, group interests, anddiscursive struggles, and to call attention
   to the possibility of causal diversity by revealing different routes to
   electoral reform.},

Abstract = {With the coming to power and strengthening of progressive governments
   during the past decade in Bolivia, Ecuador and Venezuela, an
   intersection has emerged between mechanisms of participative democracy
   and authoritarian attitudes that relate actors of state and society in
   national contexts marked by sociopolitical polarization and conflict.
   The paper presents and discusses the theoretical bases of democracy and
   authoritarianism, described as a historical and poliological look at
   specific processes of political and institutional development where
   participation and authoritarianism overlap and/or confront each other in
   local scenarios in Bolivia, Ecuador and Venezuela. The threat that
   authoritarianism poses for increased citizen participation and, in
   general, for the survival and consolidation of democracy is highlighted
   in this paper.},

Abstract = {Since 1992, Thailand's young democracy has sought to ensure civilian
   control over its military. Yet since the 2006 coup, the military has
   become a powerful political actor and Thai democracy has eroded. As
   such, institutionalizing civilian control has become particularly
   challenging. This article examines civil-military relations in Thailand
   and argues that while civilian agents have initiated moves towards
   political outcomes of civil-military relations, agents' choices and
   strategies have only been realized through the conditioning of
   structure-macro-structural, institutional and ideational factors. The
   study seeks to answer four questions. First, how have structure and
   agency played roles in explaining civil-military relations in Thailand's
   emerging democracy? Second, what strategies have civilian agents sought
   to use in attempting to achieve civilian control and what structural
   factors have conditioned strategy choices? Third, how successful have
   Thai civilian governments been in achieving control? Finally, what might
   be the future for Thai civil-military relations?},

Abstract = {Relying on the materials of the research conducted in Samara oblast
   during the summer, 2010, A. Chirikova shows that the clearly traceable
   reorientation of the Kremlin towards forming gubernatorial body out of
   people who have nothing to do with the local community cannot itself
   guarantee efficient functioning of the ``vertical of power{''}. Having
   analyzed by the example of the regional case study how the arrival of
   the ``varangian{''} gubernator (i. e. outsider) impacted the situation
   in the region including the standings of the local elites and
   disposition of intra-elitist forces, the author demonstrates that even
   the wholehearted support for Moscow appointee by the federal centre does
   not preclude rapid increase in governability, and the increasing
   dissatisfaction of the local elites even if it is concentrated within
   certain political institutions puts stability of the situation in the
   region under question.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ELECTIONS PUBLIC OPINION AND PARTIES},

Volume = {21},

Pages = {237-253},
Abstract = {This paper presents the results of analyses of forces shaping electoral
   choice in the 2010 British general election. The analyses are based
   primarily on data gathered in the Campaign Internet Panel Survey (CIPS)
   that was conducted as part of the 2010 British Election Study (BES).
   Tests of rival models of electoral choice reveal that, as in earlier
   British elections, a valence politics model provides a strong
   explanation of voting decisions. However, as in those earlier contests,
   a model based on the spatial modelling tradition also contributes to
   understanding how voters made up their minds in 2010. The paper
   concludes by reprising major findings and discussing why the
   Conservatives failed to secure a majority in a context seemingly ideally
   suited for them to do so.},

Abstract = {Despite the importance of Supreme Court opinions for the American
   polity, scholars have dedicated little systematic research to
   investigating the factors that contribute to the content of the
   justices' opinions. In this article, we examine the ability of lower
   federal courts to shape the content of Supreme Court opinions. We argue
   that lower court opinions will influence the content of the Court's
   opinions to the extent that the justices perceive that integrating
   language from lower court opinions will aid them in making efficacious
   law and policy. Utilizing plagiarism detection software to compare lower
   federal court opinions with the majority opinions of the Supreme Court
   during the 2002-2004 terms, we uncover evidence that the Court
   systematically incorporates language from the lower federal courts into
   its majority opinions.},

Abstract = {On the basis of the case of a specific public device, the feed-in
   tariffs supporting photovoltaic energy, this paper analyzes a reverse
   movement that goes from solution to problem. First, it highlights how
   this device which proved providential in Germany has turned into a
   public problem in the French context, up to the point of becoming a
   matter of public controversy. Second, beyond the study of the
   construction of public problems, it shows that this controversy makes
   visible the modes of problematization that lay hidden beneath such a
   policy answer, in which the state just has to promote the right
   conditions for the creation and development of markets. Thus the
   corresponding governmentality of both energy and climate raises two core
   questions related to the emergence of a figure of the citizen subsumed
   under the consumer, and to the resulting uncertainty regarding the
   collectives that are targeted by public policies.},

Abstract = {The essay examines the dangers of the integration of emerging powers
   into the world system. It then analyses the methodological possibility
   of scientific prediction of the evolution of global society in the
   twenty-first century. The key to that prediction is the deciphering of
   the `DNA' of social evolution, that is, its specific mode of production
   and superstructure. We identify both for twenty-first-century socialism.
   The evolutionary context of Deng Xiaoping's development strategy is
   described and the causes for the erosion of the Soviet model and the
   failure of Perestroika are analyzed. A reflection of the class character
   of the Chinese model follows. Finally, the essay discusses the
   conditions under which the Chinese way to socialism might become a
   general transition model for twenty-first-century socialism.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL CRITICAL THOUGHT},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {1},

Pages = {129-137},
Abstract = {This discussion offers a critical analysis of the idea of a `Chinese
   model'. The idea originated in the successful economic development of
   the People's Republic of China beginning in the 1990s, and has attracted
   even more attention since China's apparent success in coping with the
   global economic recession since 2008. The discussion examines: (a)
   Chinese attitudes toward the idea of an `exportable' model, (b) the
   historical context of revolution for China's development that is often
   ignored in discussions of the `Chinese model', (c) whether or not it is
   possible to speak of a `model', since China's development is very much a
   work in progress, and (d) what may be the appeals and the shortcomings
   of the path of development China is pursuing. I suggest that a
   `paradigm' for inspiration may be a better way to understand what
   Chinese development represents than a `model' for emulation.},

Journal = {GERMAN POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Pages = {107-127},
Abstract = {This article looks at the development of the relation between social
   divisions and voting in Germany in the Bundestag elections after German
   unification. Considering the data from German electoral studies since
   1994, it examines how social class impinged on support for the Social
   Democrats and for the post-communist PDS/Left and how church attendance
   and religious denomination affects the tendency to vote for Christian
   Democrats. It seems that it is much too early to write off the electoral
   relevance of social cleavages. The `core constituencies' of
   cleavage-based parties have anything but disappeared and still show
   marked differences in voting patterns. In addition there are striking
   east-west differences in the patterns of electoral behaviour, especially
   regarding support for the post-communists. There is some, though not
   overwhelming, evidence of change in the social patterns of voting. But
   these changes hardly justify the elimination of the concept of social
   cleavages from electoral research. Instead, the results are consistent
   with the view that the politicisation of social cleavages depends on
   parties' appropriate mobilisation strategies and policies.},

Abstract = {Based on primary research that was in field immediately before and after
   the May 2008 xenophobic violence, this article explores the social base
   that fed and continues to feed xenophobia in South Africa. It examines
   the different ways that the violence has been labelledcriminal,
   xenophobic, negrophobic, Afrophobicand explores possible motivations for
   using these different labels. It also examines the role that civil
   society organizations played during and after the violence, and
   concludes that without a far more deep-seated economic and social
   transformation, South Africa will remain beset by unresolved challenges
   that have their roots in our past but remain with us today.},

Abstract = {The past decade has seen an increasing interest on the part of the
   Spanish media and civil society in ``historical memory{''}, marked,
   among other things, by a number of public debates on issues related to
   recent Spanish history (1931-1981). In these debates, academic
   historians have participated alongside other social actors, ranging from
   writers and filmmakers to citizen activists. The following essay
   analyzes one such drawn-out polemic that took place in the spring of
   2010, in order to point to a series of structural problems, particularly
   the tendency on the part of opinion makers-including academic historians
   writing as media personalities- to monopolize the right to ``tell the
   story of the past,{''} a claim based on a naIve invocation of scholarly
   historical knowledge as factual truth. The essay's first part addresses
   the role of historians and academic history in the media. The second
   part analyzes the ethnocentric position of some Spanish liberal
   intellectuals faced with the internationalization of transitional
   justice. The third part takes a critical look at the way that Spain's
   ``media intellectuals{''} help to prevent a truly democratic mode of
   discussing the collective past.},

Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {48},
Number = {1},
Pages = {9-25},
Abstract = {Migrates, wherever they have been settled, have always moved in order to
   set up groups somehow formalised, normally organised upon their ethnic
   or national origin. These groups always work to give a response to their
   needs. Thus, associations have become a basic element in the day-to-day
   life of immigrants. A basic element working two ways: On one hand, in
   the relationship between immigrates and the institutions of the
   receiving societies, considering that these groups act as
   representatives for political issues. On the other hand, in the
   relationship within the group itself, placing themselves, sometimes in a
   non-easy way, in a new settling context. In both levels, the
   associations act as a privileged way for social and cultural
   intermediaries. Associations arise as institutions based on identity
   reasons, members and non-members of the group can define them as
   religious, national, ethnical or cultural. But in these organisations,
   apart from identity, they create new spaces from which they work on
   migration contexts, music, dance, food or dressing habits, religious
   practices or use of languages become in identity references, in ways of
   expression of a community not just margined but also re-localised.},

Abstract = {The article rebuilds the process of adaptation of the MLN-Tupamaros to
   legality and electoral competition since the restoration of democracy in
   Uruguay (March 1985) and the election of Jose Mujica, founder of the
   MLN-T and candidate of the Frente Amplio, as president of Uruguay
   (November 2005). This path is a particularly remarkable case of
   successful party adaptation. The central argument is that the remarkable
   adaptability of this organization must be explained mainly by some
   features of its ideological matrix which is distinguished, in the
   Uruguayan left, for his pragmatism.},

Abstract = {Over the course of the last three presidential elections, young voters
   and minorities have become an increasingly sought after segment of the
   electorate. In particular, youth are also the most likely to be the
   beneficiaries of advances to technology, while minorities often lag
   behind in access. The 2008 election provided a number of examples of
   campaigns utilizing online technology as a means of targeting young
   voters. This article examines the influence of the Internet on young and
   minority voters, focusing specifically on Internet use for political
   purposes, such as visiting a candidate's Web site or engaging in
   political discussions on blogs, as predictors of youth political
   participation offline. The authors find that engaging politics online
   leads to increases in political participation offline and that among
   younger voters, racial minorities are as connected as whites. However,
   among older voters, whites are far more likely to have access to and use
   the Internet politically.},

Title = {From exile of citizens to deportation of non-citizens: ancient Greece as
   a mirror to illuminate a modern transition},
Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {15},
Number = {5, SI},
Pages = {565-582},
Abstract = {This article is an ancient Greek historian's response to an invitation
   to reflect upon modern liberal democratic deportation. The article
   identifies a revealing contrast between ancient Greek city-states and
   their modern republican successors. In ancient Greece, institutionalised
   lawful expulsion of non-citizens was not a major concern. Rather, it was
   lawful expulsion of citizens which was a prominent political issue,
   comparable to modern liberal democratic deportation. Indeed, modern
   liberal democratic deportation and associated rhetoric were
   significantly foreshadowed in the ancient Greek politics of expulsion:
   Greeks used and justified lawful expulsion of citizens as a means of
   constructing and reinforcing both state power and abstract,
   rationalistic norms of citizenship. The article suggests the hypothesis
   that the contrast between the ancient and the modern situations can be
   explained by the modern prevalence of universalist human rights norms,
   not politically influential in ancient Greece. First, human rights norms
   exert pressures on modern liberal democratic states, unparalleled in
   ancient Greece, to integrate and assist outsiders. Deportation is partly
   a reaction against those pressures, of a type unnecessary in the ancient
   Greek world. Second, although the modern liberal democratic analogues of
   Classical republican ideas, partly derived from their Classical
   antecedents, encourage lawful citizen expulsion, the modern citizen's
   inalienable human right to residence in his home state militates against
   it. Modern liberal democratic deportation of non-citizens, and
   associated rhetoric, can thus be interpreted partly as alternative
   outlets for the use of expulsion and exclusionary rhetoric to construct
   and reinforce complex norms of citizenship.},

   (1) the positive and negative valence of associations to the five target
   words would differ; (2) the perception of a suicide terrorist would be
   influenced by target word used and by the context of the act, such as
   the kind of victims; (3) the reasons given for why a person becomes a
   suicide bomber would reflect more often those discussed in scientific
   research and less often those commonly presented in the media; and (4)
   the reasons given would differ between target words and context. Results
   mostly confirmed the hypotheses. Although context information seems to
   outweigh the connotations of the individual terms, results caution
   researchers and media on the need to reflect on possible consequences
   resulting from the use of specific terms.},

Abstract = {This article discusses the possibility of the simultaneous existence of
   inclusion/empowerment and exclusion/dominance within the practices of
   everyday political participation. Taking a point of departure in the
   Bourdieusian approach to practice and symbolic power, the article first
   constructs a theoretical framework for studying political practices and
   power as both symbolic capital and symbolic violence. Secondly, results
   from a qualitative research project are presented, making it possible to
   trace and follow the logics of political habitus and the symbolic
   classifications of democratic practices, and explore how mechanisms of
   symbolic boundaries and misrecognition work to produce both elements of
   inclusion and exclusion.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF GENOCIDE RESEARCH},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {13},

Abstract = {In July 2004, the UN created a new post-the special adviser on the
   prevention of genocide. This office was established in the midst of the
   conflict in Darfur and heralded as a means by which the UN could respond
   more expeditiously and appropriately to mass atrocity crimes. This
   article first examines the nature of this new office and analyzes its
   competencies in order to identify whether it does constitute a
   significant development. Second, the article assesses the record of this
   office since its establishment, and particularly the nature of its
   recommendations to the Security Council and the council's response. It
   will be argued that while the special adviser on the prevention of
   genocide comprises certain novel features, it is not sufficiently
   empowered to overcome the primary obstacle to the prevention and
   cessation of genocide, namely the lack of political will amongst the
   permanent five members on the Security Council.},

Abstract = {This article offers a revisionary re-description of the central
   characteristics of terrorism in an attempt to put forward a persuasive
   definition under which scholars could converge. It accepts that there
   are valid reasons for rejecting the term, not least because it is a
   socially constructed label that has been misused in public discourse.
   Nonetheless, it argues that, based on a `minimal foundationalist'
   ontological position, it is possible to define and describe the key
   characteristics of terrorist violence. The article then attempts to
   re-describe the characteristics of terrorism by dealing with a number of
   common misconceptions, such as the notion that terrorism is violence
   directed at civilians or non-combatants by non-state actors, before
   offering a contingent definition of terrorism relevant to the present
   historical moment. The article concludes by outlining a range of
   additional pragmatic and normative reasons for retaining the term as a
   research concept.},

Journal = {AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {46},
Number = {1},
Pages = {3-18},
Abstract = {Labor's broadband policy influenced key regional independents to support
   the formation of the minority Gillard government. However, analysing
   information technology policy doesn't only demonstrate continuing
   differences between Labor and the Coalition. It also demonstrates
   changing Labor attitudes on issues ranging from neoliberalism,
   globalisation and social inclusion to conceptions of market failure and
   the rising power of Asia. In particular, this article compares and
   contrasts the attitudes of the Rudd government to those of the Hawke and
   Keating governments, arguing that the Rudd government placed much more
   emphasis on the role that market failure had played in contributing to
   Australia's poor broadband provision. The resulting policy involved an
   increased role for government in rolling out broadband not only to the
   cities but also to regional Australia. That approach benefitted Gillard.
   It also reflected ideological differences between not just Labor and the
   Liberals, but also between Rudd and his Labor predecessors.},

Abstract = {Kenya experienced unprecedented political violence following the flawed
   and disputed presidential election result in December 2007. Over 1,100
   people were killed and another 600,000 displaced. The violence spread
   rapidly and threatened Kenya as a nation-state. Following international
   mediation by the African Union's Panel of Eminent African Personalities
   under the chairmanship of Kofi Annan, the former United Nations
   Secretary General, the two main protagonists agreed to end violence and
   to share political power. Although much has been written about the Kenya
   post-election violence, little has been said about the role the
   country's indigenous civil society groups played in the mediation
   process, and to end the violence. This article discusses the role they
   played in ending the crisis by responding to two questions: `How did
   civil society put out the fire?' and `What lessons can other African
   civil society organizations learn from the experience?'.},

Abstract = {The ``symmetry assumption{''} in public-choice theory-the idea that
   people act just as selfishly in the political sphere as they do in the
   economic sphere-is a good theory that runs afoul of much of the
   evidence. The public-choice theorists in this symposium, Munger and
   Mueller, have thus retreated from claiming that public choice explains
   most political behavior, with Munger positing it as an ideal type that,
   in principle, might explain no behavior at all. For example, Berman
   suggests that even politicians who say and do ``anything{''} to be
   elected or re-elected may well do so in order to acquire the power they
   think they need if they are to enact policies that will serve the public
   good. The normative project of ``constitutional political economy{''}
   into which the original, empirical version of public choice seems to
   have evolved may or may not tell us how to structure institutions to
   prevent greedy actors from using politics as a means to their personal
   aggrandizement. But that project cannot, even hypothetically, produce

Abstract = {The article anatomizes the `universal values' propagated by some Chinese
   scholars in recent years. According to the author, what they mean by
   those concepts, however neutral and omnipresent they may appear, is
   actually China's conversion to Western capitalist institutions. The
   historical and contemporary context of `universal values' together with
   their theoretical partiality and absurdity are discussed.},

   can gain a great deal by adopting and using Information and

Abstract = {PhD programs in the United States are increasingly marked by the rising
   influence of market-oriented dynamics. As a case in point, one of the
   primary objectives of the new PhD program offered at the University of
   South Dakota is to deliver a doctoral program through a flexible-or
   hybrid-format that is accessible to nontraditional as well as
   traditional students. Currently, no such PhD program in political
   science exists in the country, but the geography and demographics of
   South Dakota have encouraged creativity and innovation. This article
   situates the USD program in the current context of nontraditional
   doctoral training in the United States and provides a description of the
   design of USD's PhD program and student and faculty experiences in the
   implementation of the program.},

Title = {Efficient Markets, Free Investors and Guarantor States: Political
   Threads of Professional Financial Practice},
Journal = {POLITIX},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {24},
Number = {95},
Pages = {155+},
Abstract = {During the last thirty years, financial regulation has been reoriented
   within a political project aiming at establishing ``efficient
   markets{''} where ``investors{''} could contribute to an ``optimal
   allocation{''} of resources, backed by a ``minimal state{''} limited to
   the role of the guarantor of the functioning of the system. Yet, the
   financial industry set up according to these concepts has progressively
   led to the obliteration of the political genealogy from which they
   proceed: nowadays they appear to be mere technical tools in the hands of
   professionals handling them in practical contexts. An analysis of the
   daily practices of fund managers investing in credit derivatives before
   the crisis, in 2004 in Paris, corroborates that observation, but also
   shows that this technicization is not total: in situations of change and
   conflict, the same concepts are likely to engage the clutch again to
   moral and political justifications along the lines of the liberal
   philosophies they stem from. This reveals that while the financial
   system is a framework in which the unequal distribution of credit is
   believed to be just a technical question and thus cannot be discussed as
   a political issue, i.e. as a matter of a relation of forces, the
   technicization can only be understood as being itself political and thus
   as being part of the relation of forces: the tension between the
   technical and the political appears then as an internal component of the
   political project framing contemporary finance.},

Abstract = {The article is devoted to the analysis of those problems that the
   Russian researchers face when considering the link between
   ``identity{''} and ``modernization{''}. L. Polyakov demonstrates how the
   status of identity crisis was transformed from being a mere
   ``instrument{''} into the key actor of modernization. Modernization is
   declared impossible since the existing regime rests upon the identity
   that is both anti-modernizing and in principle cannot be modernized with
   the change of the latter being in its turn connected to modernization.
   According to Polyakov, a solution to the vicious circle that emerged as
   a result of the above mentioned situation can be found in the nontrivial
   theory elaborated by A. Aksherov that treats Modern and modernization in
   Habermas' style of ``unfinished project{''} rather than entrenched and
   unshakable forms that require imitation. It is this setting that opens a
   prospect for the Russian mass production of theoretical variants for
   defining national identity through modernization.},

Abstract = {The vagueness that attends the notion of terrorism is a source of
   constant confusion. This article proposes to shift the discussion from
   the concept of terrorism to that of terror, in the psychological sense
   of the term, and thus open up a new perspective on the analysis of the
   emotional impact of political violence. This requires us to refine the
   conceptual framework and make the terminology we use compatible with the
   empirical data we have on the psychological sequelae of violence.},

   military production to socially useful purposes in the 1970s and 1980s,
   participation in regional cluster policies in the 1990s and new
   approaches to a democratic transition of the socio-economic development
   model in the latest crisis of capitalism. The findings show that
   regional alternatives of local trade unions were often transformed into
   a ``logic of integration{''} to capitalist modernization. Unions can't
   no longer use the given institutional configurations of regional policy;
   they have to rebuild the conditions trought autonomous practices ``from
   below{''}, in which democratic alternatives in the regions will be
   possible again.},

   nationalities - the European citizenship - is a recent phenomenon,
   formally established in 1992 by the Maastricht Treaty and, unlike the
   ``national{''} citizenship, it has not been conquered (by revolution,
   treaty or other political event), but granted by ``superior{''} body in
   a process that has not really involved citizens. Additionally, this
   citizenship is rooted in the Member States; it is automatically granted
   and nobody can demand it or give it. It provides rights, diplomatic
   protection, a relatively free movement of persons, but no duty. But is
   it really a ``new{''} citizenship?},

Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {33},

Abstract = {This paper considers the question of whether the collapse of the global
   economy in 2008 and subsequent uneven national recoveries constitute an
   existential challenge to the legitimacy of hegemonic neoliberal
   globalization. Neo-Gramscian international political theory is reviewed,
   and its application to globalization and then the critical insights
   provided are used to describe China's embrace and subsequent rejection
   of neoliberalism to conclude that the near future of the global economy
   is likely to be one of ideological heterogeneity and thus unlikely to
   spawn a new hegemonic system of globalization.},

Abstract = {The Conservative/Liberal Democrat Coalition government has announced its
   intention to hold a referendum on the possible introduction of the
   Alternative Vote (AV) for future elections to the House of Commons. This
   paper uses survey data from the 2010 British Election Study to simulate
   what the effects on the seat distribution in the House of Commons would
   have been if AV had operated in May 2010. The results suggest an outcome
   for the three main parties of Conservatives 284, Labour 248 and Liberal
   Democrats 89. This outcome would have radically changed the arithmetic
   of post-election coalition building, with the Liberal Democrats being
   able to form a majority coalition with either Labour or the
   Conservatives.},

Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {34},
Number = {2},
Pages = {181-207},
Abstract = {Previous research is unclear about which citizens support the use of
   referendums and how a referendum campaign can affect support for direct
   democracy. This study investigates, first, the factors that determine
   support for referendums and, second, the role of the campaign in
   changing support. This is done in the context of the 2005 Dutch EU
   Constitution referendum. A media content analysis of national media
   (N=6,370) is combined with panel survey data (N=1,008). The results
   suggest that those who felt more politically disaffected were more
   supportive of referendums. Furthermore, higher levels of exposure to
   tabloid style campaign news led to increased approval of referendums. In
   a second step, the mechanism behind this effect was tested using an
   experiment (N=580). When exposed to negative tabloid style news about a
   referendum proposal, opponents perceive the assumed consequences as more
   of a threat. This threat perception increased their support for a
   referendum on the issue at stake as a means to prevent the proposal. The
   article concludes with a discussion about the conditions under which a
   dynamic like this is likely to unfold and when alternative explanations
   for referendum support apply.},

Title = {A Two-Dimensional Approach to the Political Opportunity Structure of
   Extreme Right Parties in Western Europe},
Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {34},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1044-1069},
Abstract = {Previous studies on the electoral fortunes of extreme right parties
   (ERPs) have pointed to the importance of variables of party competition
   for the success - or failure - of ERPs. These studies vary greatly when
   it comes to describing the political opportunity structure of the
   extreme right. Apart from their methodological differences, existing
   studies differ especially with regard to the assumed underlying
   dimension of party competition. This article tests the impact of three
   frequently discussed variables in the political opportunity structure of
   ERPs (mainstream party convergence, position of the established right
   and party system polarisation) on the vote share of ERPs in Western
   Europe. In addition to examining previous studies in this field, it
   focuses on the interplay between the economic and the cultural
   dimensions as part of the political opportunity structure. The authors
   show that a decrease in polarisation with regard to economic questions
   is accompanied by a growing salience of ERPs' core issues, leading in
   the end to an increase in ERPs' vote share.},

Abstract = {This article provides a case study of overseas development assistance
   for AIDS to South African civil society; it analyses how power is
   exercised as well as resisted in the context of international aid. While
   it is argued that governance theory tends to underestimate power
   inequalities in the context of policy networks, this case is instead
   related to the theoretical debate regarding whether current global power
   structures can be analysed in terms of a (US-led) neo-imperialism, or
   whether they should rather be understood in terms of post-imperialist
   power constellations based on `regulation of self-regulation' through
   market mechanisms, and with an emphasis on `civil society
   participation'. While the case demonstrates how US aid under the Bush
   administrations to a certain extent involved a `civilising mission', it
   is argued that `regulation of self-regulation' was the more significant
   form of governing AIDS aid networks, contributing to a development
   through which AIDS activism went through a process of `NGO-isation',
   de-politicising the AIDS issue.(1)},

Abstract = {The Popular Unitary Action Movement, MAPU (1969-1989), split from the DC
   to join the socialism and after a renewal helped the union of DC with
   the Socialists in the pragmatic ``Concertacion{''}. The MAPU
   demonstrates the ``transformative/innovative{''} contribution of
   enlightened elites, who moves from rupture to play a role in founding of
   new coalitions. The traditional debate in political science of
   disruptive or functional elites can be enriched with the concept of
   transformative elite that shakes and then stabilizes the system in the
   modernization process. To someone's might express a cynical pattern of
   accommodation, for others a case of flexibility. This article seeks to
   highlight the transformative role as a synthetic concept.},

Journal = {GERMAN POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {20},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {392-409},
Abstract = {Internationally, the number of female leaders has increased in recent
   years. While the rise of women to political prominence has been explored
   over the last two decades, we know much less about their actual
   decision-making. The article investigates what role Merkel's gender has
   played for governance during her first term in office. Has female
   leadership made a difference for the substantive representation of
   women's interests and, if so, how? This article compares and contrasts
   two explicitly gender-related policy areas, reconciliation and
   anti-discrimination policy, in a most-similar-case design. While major
   reforms were passed in the realm of family policy, anti-discrimination
   policy was considered a marginal political concern. To explain the
   different outcomes this analysis focuses on the identities and interests
   of relevant political players in their institutional context. In order
   to better understand female leadership and governance we use the lens of
   intersectionality, which has a promising theoretical and empirical
   potential.},

Abstract = {The American Political Science Review (APSR) centennial provided us an
   occasion for the examination of the political science profession as
   reflected from its pages. Employing a citation analysis of 220 major
   political scientists published in the APSR and probing deeper into the
   citation record of some of its prominent scholars, this paper charts the
   dynamics of political science history. Since its birth over a hundred
   years ago, the profession has been in a state of constant flux, where
   new movements surge as previous ones decline once their integration into
   the fund of professional knowledge was completed. The paper argues that
   the surge and decline pattern is not a ``tragedy of political
   science,{''} but a sign of a healthy and vigorous profession.},

Abstract = {Since its creation in 1961, the French Federation of Europe's Houses
   (FFME) aims to inform populations about the European integration in
   their urban area, thus providing a local background for EU issues.
   Nowadays, the organization plays an important role within the actors
   dealing with EU information. Nevertheless, this emphasis on a local
   perspective has been challenged in the past by political and ideological
   views on federalism and since the beginning of the 1990's, has been
   significantly transformed by the increasing professionalization of the
   executives of the French Europe's Houses. Internal dynamics (i.e. the
   institutionalization of the network of Europe Houses) as well as
   external relations (with other associations aiming to promote the EU,
   such as the European Movement or the Union for a Federal Europe, but
   also with supranational actors such as the International Federation of
   Europe Houses or the European institutions) have shaped this dialectic
   between a politicized and neutral conception of European integration.},

Journal = {ASIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {19},
Number = {2},
Pages = {186-207},
Abstract = {This article examines the nature of the two-party system in Japan. The
   electoral reform of 1994 has finally led to an alternation of power, but
   contrary to the predictions of the reformers, the competition between
   two major Japanese parties is not based on any substantial differences
   in their political programs. The Liberal Democratic Party and the
   Democratic Party of Japan are mixtures of various groups rather than
   coherent parties and the main axes of struggle on the Japanese political
   scene run across party divisions. Both major parties are internally
   divided with regard to economic as well as defense policy. The most
   important factor of Democratic Party of Japan's identity has been the
   goal of achieving an alternation of power and abolishing the Liberal
   Democratic Party style of policymaking. Nevertheless, the discourse on
   political renewal has been undertaken also by the Liberal Democratic
   Party. While the struggle between the partisans and the opponents of
   Koizumi reforms continues in the Liberal Democratic Party, the
   Democratic Party of Japan is torn apart between the proponents of `big'
   and `small' government.},

Abstract = {The 2009 German federal election took place during the deepest recession
   in German post-war history. It brought to power a coalition of Christian
   democrats and liberals while the social democrats suffered by far their
   worst result at a general election since 1949. This paper discusses
   whether there is a causal relationship between the government's response
   to the crisis and the election result. While voters basically supported
   the government's management of the banking crisis they were much more
   sceptical with regard to the grand coalition's management of the
   recession. Interestingly, a majority of the voters disapproved of some
   of the interventionist policies the SPD had suggested and believed that
   the Christian democrats were the most competent crisis managers.
   Therefore, the economic crisis may well have helped the bourgeois
   parties win the election.},

Abstract = {Some scholars have found that mass immigration fuels the success of
   anti-immigration parties, whereas others have found that it does not. In
   this paper, we propose a reason for these contradictory results. We
   advance a set of hypotheses that revolves around a commonly ignored
   factor, crime. To test these hypotheses, we examine a setting where an
   anti-immigration party, the LPF, participated in simultaneous elections
   in all Dutch municipalities, which form a single constituency. According
   to our results, the impact of immigration rates on the individual vote
   for the LPF only manifests itself among those voters who are very `tough
   on crime'. In addition, we demonstrate that high local crime rates make
   an anti-immigration vote more likely, but only among voters who are very
   `tough on immigration'. This suggests that immigration and crime rates
   do not make all citizens more likely to cast an anti-immigration vote,
   but only those who perceive a link between the two issues. Thus, if one
   wishes to reduce anti-immigration leaders' electoral support, countering
   their criminalization of immigrants may be a more fruitful strategy than
   trying to stop immigration - if at all possible. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {Since the end of the Cold War, multilateral treaties have again become a
   central vehicle for international cooperation. In this article, we study
   states' commitment to 76 multilateral treaties concluded between 1990
   and 2005. The article offers a systematic account of present-day
   multilateral treaty-making efforts and asks what explains variation in
   states' participation as witnessed in the act of treaty ratification. We
   test existing explanations and provide a novel argument that accounts
   for the strong participation of new European democracies in multilateral
   treaties. We find that regime type and being part of the European Union
   (EU) strongly affect treaty ratification. New EU democracies, in
   particular, are much more likely to ratify multilateral treaties than
   are other new democracies.},

Abstract = {The U.S. government's efforts to redefine policy toward Latin America,
   and to counter the image that it is doing little more than fighting drug
   trafficking, would be boosted if it embraced cooperation with its
   territory in the Caribbean: Puerto Rico. Despite years of disagreement
   and distrust between federal and Puerto Rican political leaders, it is
   time to refocus on how the island's developed infrastructure, educated
   population, demonstrated patriotism to the United States, and cultural
   affinity with Latin America can help U.S.-Latin America policy. Puerto
   Rico is an ideal location from which to send emergency and humanitarian
   assistance to the region and to establish training centers to assist in
   building judicial and other democratic institutions in Latin America. As
   important, federal and local cooperation in the national security sphere
   will improve economic and social conditions on an island fighting crime
   and chronic underemployment.},

   proposals. This analysis shows that, despite the fact that committees
   are strong, particularly the Finance Committee in the Chamber, among
   other factors, the inclusion of other actors in public fiscal policy
   making, such as legislative and political leaders, and the executive
   power limit them.},

Abstract = {Sovereign creditworthiness within the euro area hinges upon the
   credibility of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP). We analyse whether
   political events that worsen the SGP's credibility result in a shared
   default risk premium for all euro members, therefore leading to a joint
   deterioration of creditworthiness. We especially examine the decisions
   and statements of the Commission and the Council of Economic and Finance
   Ministers. Analysing daily data through the 1999-2005 period with an
   ARMA-GARCH model, we find the Commission plays a decisive role in
   affecting investor evaluations, where its credibility-strengthening
   decisions decrease volatility and statements signalling a weakening of
   fiscal credibility spark uncertainty on financial markets. Our results
   stress the importance of creating credible fiscal institutions that
   preserve sovereign creditworthiness within the euro area.},

Title = {Mandatory Maori wards in local government: Active Crown protection of
   MAori Treaty rights},
Journal = {POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {63},
Number = {2},
Pages = {186-204},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Historically, few Maori have been elected to local government. In the
   last 10 years the Crown has created two opportunities for local
   government to increase the number of Maori elected: the Local Electoral
   Act 2001 allows a local government to change its electoral system from
   the first-past-the-post (FPP) to the single transferable voting (STV)
   system; and the Local Electoral Amendment Act 2002 allows a local
   government to create local Maori wards and Maori constituencies
   (replicating the model of Maori representation in the House of
   Representatives). Very few local governments have implemented either
   option. A small (and declining) number of councils have changed to STV.
   A few councils have polled their electors on the matter of establishing
   Maori wards, but each poll rejected them. In 2010 the Crown renewed its
   commitment to the `option' of local electoral reform in establishing the
   new Auckland City Council. The Crown rejected a Royal Commission
   recommendation to guarantee Maori representation in the reconstituted
   council, preferring to allow the council and Auckland voters to engage
   in electoral reform if they wish to do so. Following the 2010 local
   government elections, Maori are still chronically under-represented
   amongst elected councillors. This article argues that the Crown is
   failing in its duty of active protection of Maori in laws relating to
   Maori representation in local government. Drawing on Kymlicka's
   arguments about group representation, the article argues that the Crown
   has dual obligations to Maori in relation to local representation. It
   must recognize Maori as a community of interest in local electoral
   boundaries and it also must increase the number of Maori elected to
   local government. Both obligations can be met through the mandatory
   creation of Maori wards in all local government. This article also
   defends guaranteed local Maori representation against some common
   objections.},

Abstract = {At least 700,000 Roma live in Hungary. Their situation is precarious.
   Most live in abject poverty and encounter discrimination and isolation.
   Hostility towards Roma is deeply rooted in the Hungarian majority
   population. Model projects show that it is possible to break the vicious
   circle of poverty, lack of education, and unemployment. The framework
   for the integration of the Roma adopted during the Hungary's presidency
   of the European Union gives rise to hope that, finally, steps to improve
   the situation of Roma will follow the rhetoric.},

Journal = {SCANDINAVIAN POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {34},
Number = {4},
Pages = {287-306},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Scholars in the field of electoral participation have for long been
   aware that turnout is strongly connected to sociopsychological variables
   such as religiosity, party identification, political interest and sense
   of political efficacy. The impact of personality characteristics has
   remained largely unexplored until recently. Based on the Jyvaskyla
   Longitudinal Study of Personality and Social Development (JYLS, original
   N = 369), this article analyses the links between individuals'
   personality traits and their propensity to vote at ages 36, 42 and 50.
   The personality traits are measured by using the five-factor model of
   personality consisting of extraversion, agreeableness,
   conscientiousness, neuroticism and openness to experience. The results
   show both extraversion and agreeableness to be positively associated
   with electoral participation, but the findings are not consistent at all
   ages. Finally, the analysis suggests that the effect of extraversion
   varies depending on the level of education. Whereas well-educated people
   are more prone to be habitual voters regardless of their level of
   extraversion, among less-educated respondents it has a more sizeable
   effect.},

Abstract = {Does trust in national institutions foster or hinder trust in the
   institutions of the European Union (EU)? There is no agreement in the
   literature on popular support for the EU about the direction of the
   relationship between trust in national and European institutions. Some
   scholars argue that both will be positively related, others have
   proposed the opposite hypothesis: low levels of trust in national
   institutions will lead citizens to higher levels of support for the EU.
   We argue that both hypotheses are true but operate at different levels:
   whereas more trusting citizens tend to be so in both the national and
   the European arenas, we also find that at the country level the
   relationship is negative: living in a country with highly trusted and
   well-performing institutions hinders trust in the European Parliament.
   We test our hypotheses using data from the European Social Survey and
   Hierarchical Linear Modeling.},

Abstract = {This article examines whether democracy affects quality of life.
   Scholars have conducted surveys to investigate whether democracy is
   likely to lead to good quality of life. There are two contested views to
   the relationship: some suggest that democracy has a positive causal
   effect on quality of life, whereas others contend that democracy does
   not play such a role. Previous findings are supported by cross-national
   statistical analysis with aggregated survey data. However, aggregated
   survey data may cause ecological fallacy. Also, in order to ascertain
   the extant research, it would be beneficial to test the hypothesis by
   incorporating both individual-and country-level variables. Therefore,
   this paper applied hierarchical modeling to investigate the regularity.
   Both individual-level perception of democracy and country-level
   political regime data were incorporated in our empirical model. Our
   findings suggest that individual-level satisfaction with democracy has
   positive causal effect on one's quality of life, whereas the
   country-level characteristic of the political regime has no effect.},

Title = {What the Filibuster Tells Us About the Senate},
Journal = {FORUM-A JOURNAL OF APPLIED RESEARCH IN CONTEMPORARY POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {We argue that even as the Senate filibuster poses serious governance
   challenges in today's Congress, it persists because most senators prefer
   to maintain the minority's right to obstruct. We consider what this
   rank-and-file support for the filibuster tells us about the nature of
   individual senators' preferences and about the Senate as an institution.
   We believe that continued support for the filibuster underscores the
   importance of personal power and publicity goals, the ability of rules
   to provide ``political cover{''} for legislators, and the role of shared
   understandings about the appropriate use of rules and about the Senate's
   place in the political system. Where nineteenthcentury senators
   propagated a set of beliefs that limited the legitimate use of
   obstruction, today's senators have developed an alternative set of
   beliefs that bolsters the institutional role of the filibuster. Under
   these circumstances, reform will likely require substantial pressure
   from outside the institution rather than emerging from within the
   Senate.},

Abstract = {The relationship between politics and economic knowledge is contested.
   One general view claims that economics should be devoid of politics
   because of its corrupting effects, while another view posits the
   converse that politics can be distorted by the impact of economic
   knowledge. Both views hold that the solution is to remove the influence
   of the one on the other. I construe these two broad views as variations
   on the same contamination thesis, the idea that politics and economics
   are separate domains and so should not contaminate one another. I
   suggest that this thesis is a version of the political/non-political
   distinction required by the ubiquitous ideal of a self-governing
   community, and that it therefore exhibits the limitations intrinsic to
   this ideal. The remedial possibilities of Michel Foucault's
   investigations into governmentality are then briefly explored.

Abstract = {Why do some immigrant minorities in the developing world integrate into
   their host societies whereas others face exclusion and hostility? This
   article offers new insights on the determinants of political identity
   and group relations in ethnically diverse societies through the lens of
   South-to-South migration. Using original data from surveys and
   interviews collected during 12 months of field research in West Africa
   and a unique empirical strategy that allows for single-group
   cross-country and single-country cross-group comparisons, this article
   tests the relationship between cultural proximity and immigrant
   exclusion. The analysis indicates that cultural similarities between
   immigrants and their hosts may limit immigrant integration because they
   motivate community leaders to highlight group boundaries. The results
   shed light on immigrant exclusion in Africa and contribute to the debate
   on the determinants of political identity in ethnically diverse
   societies.},

Abstract = {Recent discussions of teaching research methods have focused on
   understanding the relationship between methods courses and the broader
   discipline, including the need to integrate qualitative methods and
   other approaches beyond the traditional statistical approaches still
   common in the majority of undergraduate research methods courses. This
   article contributes to this conversation by arguing that the basic
   elements of research design and qualitative techniques should be
   integrated into substantive (or ``non-methods{''}) courses across the
   discipline. To accomplish this aim, I offer a brief outline of
   methodological. benchmark skills-drawn from the pool of skills necessary
   for a successful thesis-that can be taught in various courses across the
   discipline through a traditional assignment: the semester research

Title = {Taking stock of policy performance in Central and Eastern Europe: Policy
   outcomes between policy reform, transitional pressure and international
   influence},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {50},
Number = {6},
Pages = {719-748},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Despite the ever growing body of scholarly work on policy developments
   in the post-communist New Member States of the European Union (NMS),
   systematic comparisons of policy outcome performance and its
   determinants are still scarce. This article identifies patterns of
   post-communist policy outcomes across the fields of economic, social and
   environmental policy. By employing pooled time-series cross-sectional
   analysis with a Fixed Effects Vector Decomposition (FEVD) estimator it
   investigates to what extent policy outcome performance is determined by
   differing policy efforts (outputs or reform tracks), transitional
   conditions and international influences. Although citizens are still
   negatively affected by the initial economic recession, especially in the
   social domain, policy reforms and efforts are decisive in determining
   the outcome performance of the NMS relative to one another in the longer
   run. Successful and comprehensive market reforms and steering
   capabilities prove to be particularly important in this regard.
   Furthermore, internationalisation has an important, albeit ambiguous,
   impact. While exposure to the world market is reflected in negative
   policy performance, interaction with and financial commitment from
   Western European Union countries promote positive policy outcomes.},

Abstract = {This article integrates empirical and normative discussions about why
   global economic inequalities matter in critically examining an approach
   known as derivative global egalitarianism (DGE). DGE is a burgeoning
   perspective that opposes excessive global economic inequality not based
   on the intrinsic value of equality but inequality's negative
   repercussions on other values. The article aims to advance the research
   agenda by identifying and critically evaluating four primary varieties
   of DGE arguments from related but distinct literatures, which span a
   number of disciplines, including economics, international relations, and
   political philosophy. Overall, DGE offers a number of persuasive
   arguments as to why current levels of global inequality are of concern,
   but aspects of DGE beg further philosophical and empirical examination.
   By situating DGE within the wider theoretical and empirical contexts,
   this article provides resources for its critical assessment and
   theoretical development.},

Abstract = {This article sheds some light on the widely exercised but little
   understood political activity of the petition and its potential in local
   politics. It posits the petition as a tool of group politics used by
   citizens to obtain some favorable policy decision. Among many factors
   that determine the success of an initiative, three are examined: (1)
   resources, operationalized simply as number of names collected; (2)
   media attention, which can raise the salience of the issue; and (3)
   coherence, operationalized as the number of issues a petition
   implicates. Hypotheses are tested against evidence gathered from 126
   petitions circulated in two municipal regions. Results imply the
   petition can help facilitate greater citizen involvement in public
   affairs.},

Abstract = {This paper argues that Marx's economics leads us to a deeper
   understanding of our current crisis than do either mainstream, Keynesian
   or `mainstream Marxist' economics. First, Marx explains how a tendency
   for the rate of profit to fall in boom manifests in the generation and
   speculative investment of `surplus' capital in the financial
   system/fictitious capital, providing a tendential basis for, rather than
   an accidental account of, financial bubbles/crises. Secondly, Marx's
   understanding that crisis is absolutely necessary to restore the profit
   rate, and so return the economy to boom, explains why developed
   countries' governments' attempts to postpone or limit crises since the
   1970s have merely prevented a decisive enough crisis to restore the
   profit rate. Persistently low profitability has simply caused the world
   economy to stagnate, with persistently surplus capital taking many
   disruptive, adventurous paths. Finally, I consider how Marx's
   identification of when lending is `lending', and when it is simply
   `usury', can help us understand how the nature of the financial system
   has changed over the last forty years.},

Abstract = {This article introduces the European Union Policy - Making (EUPOL)
   dataset. The dataset contains the complete records of the European
   Commission's PreLex database, which tracks the interactions between the
   European institutions on legislative proposals and non-legislative
   policy documents over time. To be of maximum use to the research
   community, the dataset is both comprehensive and replicable. It relies
   on 2600 variables to describe the detailed event histories of more than
   29,000 inter-institutional decision-making processes between 1975 and
   2009. The data collection has been completely automated, enabling
   scholars to scrutinize and replicate the generation of the dataset. To
   illustrate the dataset's general utility and discuss specific pitfalls,
   I present a descriptive analysis of the outcome and duration of Council
   decision-making.},

Month = {FAL},
Abstract = {In this paper we examine how subjective perception of government's
   policy performance affects satisfaction with how democracy works in
   Iceland. This we base on the argument that the public is aware of and
   evaluating the governments' performance when the political system is
   faced with a major crisis that has been extensively publicly debated and
   triggered widespread protests. The financial and political crisis in
   Iceland 2008-09 provides an opportunity to examine if government
   performance can be seen as a causal factor explaining satisfaction with
   the democratic process. We take into account two alternative
   explanations; that satisfaction with how democracy works depends on
   citizens' belief in how well the representative system works; and if
   they are more satisfied when their party is represented in government.
   Our principal conclusion is that subjective policy performance is the
   main explanation for citizens' increased dissatisfaction with democracy
   during a severe crisis.},

Abstract = {Students of economic voting have recently made substantial progress in
   their understanding of when the economy is and is not likely to impact
   election outcomes. Our knowledge of the lower level dynamics that drive
   these aggregate results remains fairly murky. In this paper we test
   competing theoretical claims about how individual level orientations
   toward political economy lead to observed aggregate trends in support
   for incumbent politicians. We do this with models of support for the
   Labour Party in the United Kingdom before and during the recent global
   economic turndown. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Once called the ``Model Partnership,{''} the Turkey-U.S. relations were
   in a semi-crises mode by the time the Arab Spring began in the early

   the mesmerizing bilateral visit by President Obama to Turkey was dented
   significantly by disagreements over various regional and conceptual
   issues between the two countries later on. By the beginning of 2011, the
   uprisings across the greater Middle East have not only challenged those
   states at where they took place but also others who have vast interests
   in the region, such as Turkey and the U.S.-whose bilateral ties were

   activity of individual parliamentary candidates for the 2004 European
   Parliament elections. The principal interest is in the effects of
   variations in the design of electoral institutions across the Member

   an important distinction needs to be made between campaign effort and
   campaign goals, with electoral institutional factors having a more

Abstract = {This article affirms that during 1990's the economists plays the role of
   organic intellectuals of the neoliberal hegemony then consolidated,
   whose crisis and closing was tragically expressed in the events of
   December 2001.
   They proposed a model country based on the principles indicated by
   economic ideology supported by neoliberalism, which proposed a world
   vision that, at the same time as it uproots the economy from the
   society, subsumes social and political at the market - understood it as
   auto regulated-therefore, their principles were extended to those two
   areas, producing actively at the same time this rupture and
   incorporation.
   The hypothesis that is presented proposes that, as part of this process,
   the social was also built in economic terms and as an economic issue;
   consequently, during the period of the hegemony of neoliberal thought,
   the concepts used to elaborate the diagnosis and the policies relates
   their contents and rationales to Economy.
   Given the preceding hypothesis, this article proposes to reconstruct and
   analyze the way how the economists had given signified the society in
   general and the social issue in particular.},

Abstract = {A leader's culpability for involving his state in a conflict affects
   both his war termination calculus and his domestic audience's
   willingness to punish him if he loses. I define a culpable leader as any
   leader who either presides over the beginning of a war, or comes to
   power midwar and shares a political connection with a culpable
   predecessor. Using a data set created specifically for this study, I
   find that culpable leaders are more likely than nonculpable ones to
   achieve favorable war outcomes. I also find that domestic audiences will
   be willing to punish culpable leaders who lose, yet spare nonculpable
   leaders who do the same. Taken together, my findings underscore the need
   to appreciate more fully the role individual leaders play in bringing
   their states to war.},

Abstract = {This essay explores the relation between two perspectives on the nature
   of human rights. According to the ``political{''} or ``practical{''}
   perspective, human rights are claims that individuals have against
   certain institutional structures, in particular modern states, in virtue
   of interests they have in contexts that include them. According to the
   more traditional ``humanist{''} or ``naturalistic{''} perspective, human
   rights are pre-institutional claims that individuals have against all
   other individuals in virtue of interests characteristic of their common
   humanity. This essay argues that once we identify the two perspectives
   in their best light, we can see that they are complementary and that in
   fact we need both to make good normative sense of the contemporary
   practice of human rights. It explains how humanist and political
   considerations can and should work in tandem to account for the concept,
   content, and justification of human rights.},

Title = {Constitutional patriotism, liberal nationalism and membership in the
   nation: An empirical assessment},
Journal = {ACTA POLITICA},

Volume = {46},

Abstract = {Liberal nationalists contend that moderate cultural nationalism
   promulgates liberal practices, while constitutional patriots stress its
   illiberal consequences, arguing that attachment to political democratic
   norms is more inclusive than cultural attachment. Although this issue
   has been the subject of extensive normative debate, it has rarely been
   studied empirically. This article addresses the question: How are
   political and cultural patriotism related to people's perceptions of
   national membership? To this end, it distinguishes between `political
   patriotism', which reflects the principles of constitutional patriotism,
   and `cultural patriotism' as an expression of liberal nationalism.
   Employing survey data from 15 Western democracies, the study explores
   the structure of these components of national identity, their empirical
   distinctiveness and their cross-country comparability. The way(s) in
   which cultural and political patriotism are related to people's
   conceptions of the nation is examined by models that analyze their
   relationship to the criteria of national membership. The results reveal
   that, virtually ubiquitously, cultural patriotism is positively
   correlated to ethnic, cultural and political criteria of membership,
   whereas political patriotism is principally correlated solely to
   political criteria. To a certain degree, these findings support the
   assertions made by constitutional patriotism on the one hand and
   disprove those linked to liberal nationalism on the other. Acta Politica

Abstract = {Electoral rules have long been held as important for the success of new
   political parties, but research has neglected the dimension of territory
   in this equation. This article argues that the territorial structure of
   social groups, in interaction with the electoral system, makes a crucial
   difference for the ability of new parties to enter parliament. In
   district-based electoral systems, social groups that are highly
   concentrated face much lower hurdles with an own party than groups that
   are spread throughout the country. The argument is tested on a novel
   database on ethnic minority groups from post-communist countries in
   Europe, including 123 minorities in 19 countries. To test hypotheses
   with complex interaction effects and binary variables, Qualitative
   Comparative Analysis appears as the most suitable method. After
   controlling for size and special minority-relevant provisions in the
   electoral systems, there is strong confirmation for the hypothesised
   effect. Acta Politica (2011) 46, 217-238. doi: 10.1057/ap.2010.26},

Abstract = {This article addresses Andrew Rehfeld's attempt to ensure a place for
   political theory within political science, which he does partly by
   showing how political theory fits into a defensible definition of
   political science and partly by excluding much political theory from the
   discipline in order to safeguard the rest. His account of what the
   discipline should comprehend is overly narrow, however, and does not
   serve the interests of the sorts of political theory he strongly
   believes are worth doing. I argue instead that political science must be
   defined by its subject matter alone, and that political theory's
   contribution to this subject matter must be defended.},

Abstract = {Could the absence or presence of objective values make democracy fall
   into totalitarianism? This has been a key question since the Second
   World War postwar period. Leo Strauss's critique of Max Weber and Carl
   Schmitt is pertinent to dealing with this problem. In fact, the core of
   this discussion lies in if politics can be based on objective and
   transcendent values or if it begins with and is based on the creation of
   and the fight around these values. While Weber and Schmitt understand
   that values are not objective and that this ensures pluralism, Strauss
   maintains that objective values essential to man do exist, and the
   negation of this truth prefigures the return of totalitarianism.},

Abstract = {The main topic of this text is the analysis of the impact that policies
   and practices of evaluation and accreditation have on the autonomy of
   public universities, within the framework of the research Autonomy and
   Legitimacy of Higher Education in Latin America: a comparative study,
   carried out by professors from the National University of Colombia. The
   focus of ``quality assurance{''} is aim at ensuring compliance in a
   minimum acceptable level of certain specifications (Gonzalez, 2003) has
   been imposed in most countries and institutions. However there is a
   standardizing tendency that carries a certain isomorphism in national
   policies and regulations and institutional practices although there are
   differences in concepts, methodologies, actions and effects of the
   assessment between both countries and universities. In some cases,
   evaluation and accreditation have become a fetish (Granovsky, 2003)
   because they are used mainly as tools of information and control.
   However there are also examples that stand them out as institutions that
   produce sense and dynamize processes of individual, collective or
   institutional change.},

Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICS RESEARCH},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {39},
Number = {4},
Pages = {724-753},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The authors examine how institutional context affects political decision
   making in Congress by investigating party leaders' agenda construction
   strategies and members' roll-call participation across regular and
   lame-duck sessions in the pre-Twentieth Amendment House (1877-1933). The
   authors find evidence to suggest that party leaders pursued relatively
   more partisan agendas in lame-duck sessions and did so successfully.
   Next, we investigate the effects such agendas had on roll-call
   participation. The authors find that returning (reelected) members
   significantly decreased their abstention levels, while departing
   (defeated and retiring) members significantly increased their abstention
   levels. Yet the authors also find that departing members could be drawn
   to participate on certain types of roll-call votes even in the face of
   strong incentives to shirk. Party leaders rely on the generally higher
   levels of participation by returning members as well as the selective
   participation of departing members to overcome ``participatory agency
   loss{''} and pass surprisingly partisan lame-duck agendas.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {73},
Number = {3},
Pages = {680-691},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This paper explores Hobbes's defense of monarchy in light of the problem
   of flattery. In doing so, it addresses two central issues in Hobbes
   scholarship: his relationship to republicanism, and his attitude toward
   rhetoric. Faced with criticisms of monarchy rooted in the monarch's
   susceptibility to flattery, Hobbes defends monarchy by focusing on the
   benefits of its unitary character. Rather than look to the virtue of
   monarchs as a bulwark against flattery, Hobbes argues that the
   singularity of the monarch diminishes the space and scope for flattery.
   Moreover, the unitary structure of monarchy provides an institutional
   context more favorable to taking counsel than forms of sovereignty
   incorporating many individuals. Hobbes's defense of monarchy counters
   contemporary republicans, incorporating his suspicion of rhetoric
   without relying on claims of monarchical virtue.},

Abstract = {Despite the fact that China and Vietnam have been the world's two
   fastest growing economies over the past two decades, their income
   inequality patterns are very different. An examination of the political
   institutions in the two countries shows that profound differences
   between these polities influence distributional choices. In particular,
   as compared to China, elite institutions in Vietnam encourage the
   construction of broader policymaking coalitions, have more competitive
   selection processes, and place more constraints on executive decision
   making. As a result, stronger political motivations exist for Vietnamese
   leaders to provide equalizing transfers that limit inequality growth
   among provinces than for Chinese leaders.},

Abstract = {Over the past two decades, a growing number of `outsider parties' have
   entered governing centre-left and centre-right coalitions across Western
   Europe. In this introduction, we first define outsider parties as those
   which - even when their vote-share would have enabled it - have gone
   through a period of not being `coalitionable', whether of their own
   volition or that of other parties in the system. Based on the articles
   in this issue, we then discuss the problems which outsider parties
   encounter when entering government and suggest some reasons for the
   success and failure of these parties in office. Finally, we propose a
   number of avenues for further research, in particular that of examining
   differences between the first and subsequent experiences of office for
   such parties.},

Abstract = {Doctoral programs take great care in assuring that students are prepared
   to enter the job market and become effective teachers and researchers.
   However, once faced with the daunting task of landing their first

   that students understand the process and what they should expect as they

   students through the hiring process from deciding which jobs to apply

Abstract = {This article introduces a simple theory of bargaining between presidents
   and members of Congress. Although it employs the analytics common to the
   typical ``sequenced{''} theories, its approach places more emphasis on
   give and take, on less reliable information about intentions, and on
   more complex strategic considerations. The formal results highlight a
   presidential tenure effect, which in turn suggests four empirical
   expectations. The article then uses a unique empirical opportunity and
   data to assess and eventually validate expectations suggesting, in turn,
   that declining presidential tenure has a substantial effect on
   confidential bargaining, making coalition formation more erratic and
   costly. The article concludes with a theoretically informed discussion
   of how growing congressional seniority led to imposing the 20th and 22nd
   constitutional amendments.},

Abstract = {Economic thought in the eighteenth century conceived a new kind of
   politics, aimed at serving public happiness rather than dynastic power.
   The idea was to apply the ``spirit of trade{''} to enlightened
   policy-making (which Montesquieu christened sweet commerce) to replace
   the then-hegemonic ``spirit of conquest{''}. In the adverse context of
   absolutism, such politics required public instruction and domestic and
   foreign publications to bring about a profound change in the way society
   saw things ({''}public opinion{''}). Books and articles expressly
   intended to spread knowledge of economics came to be a genre in their
   own right. They show that economic thought could have played a hidden
   role as the debate about a constitution first began, especially in
   Spain, where political thought as such had so few outlets. Such
   introductory writings also reflect the characteristics of the public
   realm in the final stages of the antiguo regimen ({''}old regime{''}).},

Title = {Wets and Dries Resurgent? Intra-Party Alignments Among Contemporary
   Conservative Party Members},

Volume = {64},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {This article maps new survey data to show that there are three main
   ideological tendencies among Conservative Party members today and that
   they differ significantly on a range of contemporary political issues.
   The Liberal conservatives are the youngest, most male, claim to be the
   most active of these tendencies, and are distinguished by being the
   least hostile to Europe and immigration, to environmentalism or to
   feminist values, but the Traditionalist Tories-the largest, most working
   class and most female of the intra-party tendencies-are surprisingly
   progressive on a number of specific proposals and issues, including
   taxation and public spending, gender issues and the institutional reform
   of politics. Thatcherites support cuts in tax and spending, but are
   hostile to environmentalism, European integration, immigration and
   gender-related reforms. Overall, this suggests that, in so far as David
   Cameron has sought to push the party in a generally more `centrist' and
   progressive direction since 2005, he has often gone with the grain of
   grassroots opinion; the Traditionalist Tories in particular would appear
   to endorse the thrust of much of his strategy. That said, there is clear
   scope for intra-party tension over the government's agenda of cuts in
   public expenditure. This points to a potential revival of the old
   conflicts between `wets' and `dries' of the 1980s.},

Abstract = {Policy coherence, understood as synergy between policies, has been found
   to facilitate development and economic growth. However, there is little
   research on the conditions in which it emerges. This article identifies
   different paths conducive to policy coherence in the process of
   transforming centralized economies of Central and Eastern Europe into
   market-driven ones. It shows that government characteristics with likely
   impact on the quality of policy-making, such as accountability and
   institutional constraints, are associated with coherent policies only in
   a limited number of cases. It also shows that governments that are not
   constrained and accountable, formulate coherent policies if they find
   themselves in contexts that do not pose constraints, or that offer
   strong incentives.},

Abstract = {The article sets out to answer two closely related questions of why
   western states do outsource and why they display a variance. Hypotheses
   will be drawn from historical and sociological institutionalism and
   probed in two cases: Germany and the US. Historical institutionalism
   argues that the current contractor support is in keeping with the
   historical trend. Sociological institutionalism instead argues that
   states organise their militaries according to a globally shared
   template. However, the extent to which it is implemented is strongly
   influenced by the ideational foundations the states are built upon.
   Comparing these explanations, this study argues that patterns of
   military privatisation result from globally shared standards and the
   ideational foundations of the state rather than from historical
   trajectory and material benefits.},

Abstract = {This article attempts to examine the mafiosi's potential economic and
   political power with the help of two analytical tools: the mafioso mode
   of production, and mafioso capitalists. In evaluating the actual power
   of the mafiosi, the article presents empirical information on Turkey and
   other countries. It acknowledges that although the mafioso (capitalist)
   bosses hold the direct command of armed power, neither their antagonism
   nor their alliance with the conventional bourgeoisie can be
   essentialised. The results and prospects are evaluated in a way that
   stresses the need for a change in our worldviews in order to construct a
   more compassionate world.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Since Spanish colonial times, Latin America has lived under the shadow
   of caudillismo. Today, caudillismo takes on a different form. I refer to
   this new phenomenon as ``bicaudillismo{''}-a state of affairs in which
   two caudillos control and share extensive political power. Current
   President Daniel Ortega and former President Arnoldo Aleman spearhead
   the two largest and most powerful Nicaraguan political parties in
   caudillo-like fashion, exerting control over their respective parties,
   as well as over government institutions and individuals. The power held
   by Aleman and Ortega reached new highs in early 2000. In what
   Nicaraguans commonly refer to as ``the pact,{''} Aleman and Ortega
   colluded with one another to back a series of constitutional reforms to
   the electoral law, resulting in a repartition of judicial, legislative,
   and electoral power. In this article I argue that, under the pact,
   Aleman and Ortega share political power in a fashion similar to two that
   of duopolistic firms in a market situation. Power is channeled through
   tit-for-tat strategies in which the actors engage in ``signaling,{''}
   much as duopolistic firms do in a market situation.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {30},
Number = {2, SI},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The Seats-Votes model forecasts party seat shares in the House of
   Commons using data from general elections and opinion polls between 1945
   and 2009. The model is built on a generalisation of the cube rule which
   provided a fairly accurate method of translating votes into seats when
   Britain was effectively a two party system prior to the 1970s. It
   combines past information on seat shares in the current Parliament with
   voting intention data six months prior to the general election to
   forecast seat shares. Applied to the task of forecasting the outcome of
   a general election in early May of 2010, it predicts a hung Parliament,
   with the Conservatives as the largest party. The relatively small sample
   used to estimate the model means that predictions about the size of the
   parties in Parliament are quite tentative, though predictions about the
   likelihood of a hung Parliament are more certain. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {When socialist feminists discussed the potential and pitfalls of Marxism
   in the ``domestic labour debate,{''} the specific relationship between
   patriarchy and capital emerged as a defining concern. While offering a
   trenchant critique of orthodox Marxism, the tenor of the debate was
   highly abstract and theoretical, and largely ignored the question of
   capitalism's origins. Political Marxists, in contrast, have devoted
   fastidious attention to this question in their own attempt to renew
   historical materialism; but their dialogue has dedicated little
   attention to questions of gender, families, and social reproduction in
   the feminist sense. This paper makes an initial attempt at closing the
   analytical gap between these two historical materialist traditions. It
   departs from an unresolved theoretical impasse within the socialist
   feminist tradition: how to conceive of the imperatives of capital
   accumulation and class in a way that avoids both reductionism and
   dualism. I argue that this tension stems principally from an inadequate
   historicization of capitalism. A critical assessment of Wally Seccombe's
   historical work illustrates how political Marxism can be deployed to
   correct this deficiency, while also revealing the extent to which these
   concepts must be rethought in light of materialist feminist concerns. A
   synthesis of the two traditions offers a more complete and effective
   account of the transition, while providing a basis for a unitary
   materialist theory.},

Abstract = {Poland's membership in the European Union has far-reaching consequences
   for the interplay of state constitutional bodies. The government is
   strengthened, the parliament weakened. This, however, is accompanied by
   a loss of legitimacy. The participation of Sejm and Senate in Europe
   policy is to counter this. So far, success has been moderate. This also
   applies to the attempt to better coordinate Europe policy among the
   relevant ministries. Institutionalized domestic portfolio logic stands
   in the way of European cross-sectional thinking that is needed. The
   Constitutional Court has set itself up as the guardian of residual
   sovereignty.},

Abstract = {As the digital revolution in political discourse continues, there are
   some important conceptual, methodological and empirical challenges that
   must be met by scholars interested in new media politics in both France
   and the United States. Some of the challenges that the Internet poses to
   basic concepts and procedures in the field of political communication
   are profound, and perhaps explain a lack of disciplinary consensus on
   any kind of theory. This article uses an example of recent research to
   highlight these difficulties and suggest some possible solutions. It
   then surveys the realm of new media politics in France, and offers some
   suggestions for future research.},

Journal = {ACTA POLITICA},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {46},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {In this article, we investigate the presence and forms of populist
   frames in the discourse of the extreme right by looking at different
   types of extreme right organizations in Italy and Germany. Focusing on
   the meso, organizational level, and applying a frame analysis to written
   documents (for example newspapers, magazines) of certain selected
   extreme right organizations, chosen from the political party and
   non-party extreme right milieu in the two countries, the article
   examines the relevance and the characteristics of the populist discourse
   in the extreme right. Similarities and differences between types of
   extreme right groups and countries in the framing strategies of populism
   are underlined and linked to the cultural (historical) and
   political-discursive opportunities. The bridging of appeal to the people
   with other (more traditional) frames of the extreme right (for example
   nativism) is shown. In particular, we look at how the central populist
   frame (namely the people versus the elite) is linked to the extreme
   right definition of the `us' and the `them', when developing diagnoses,
   prognoses and motivations to action. The analysis is based on a total of
   around 4000 frames collected in documents from 2002 to 2006. Acta

   superiority of each as the best mechanism for generating and
   distributing well-being. We attempt an empirical appraisal of this
   issue, using the extent to which individuals find their lives to be
   satisfying as an evaluative metric. Considering individual levels of
   life satisfaction in advanced industrial democracies using the most
   recent wave of survey data from the World Values Survey, we find that
   citizens are more satisfied with their lives as the level of state
   intervention into the market economy increases.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN UNION POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Pages = {127-142},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Based upon existing fiscal federal arrangements, this article considers
   the options facing the European Union to reform its own framework. There
   are two plausible ways the EU can stabilize the finances of its member
   states over the longer term. The first is to take steps that complement
   the market discipline of individual member states. For market discipline
   to play this positive role, three conditions need to be met: (1) markets
   need to have accurate information on member state finances; (2) the
   market valuation of a given state also has to be an accurate valuation
   of the sustainability of that state's finances; and (3) populations need
   to interpret market discipline as a signal about their government's
   competence and punish governments that face market pressure. Such a
   system is possible under the current Stability and Growth Pact, and
   indeed it appears that all three conditions held in summer 2009. Any
   bailout of a member state, however, undermines this type of system. More
   political integration would be needed to prevent a state from getting
   into a situation where a bailout would be an option. The Brazilian model
   is a precedent that the European Union could emulate.},

Abstract = {We explore the effects of state-level election reforms on voter turnout
   in the 2000, 2004, and 2008 presidential elections. Using a cost-benefit
   model of political participation, we develop a framework for analyzing
   the burdens imposed by the following: universal mail voting, permanent
   no-excuse absentee voting, nonpermanent no-excuse absentee voting, early
   in-person voting, Election Day registration, and voter identification
   requirements. We analyze turnout data from the 2000, 2004, and 2008
   Current Population Surveys and show that implementation by states of
   both forms of no-excuse absentee voting and Election Day registration
   has a positive and significant affect on turnout in each election. We
   find positive but less consistent effects on turnout for universal mail
   voting and voter identification requirements. Our results also show that
   early in-person voting has a negative and statistically significant
   correlation with turnout in all three elections.},

   and legitimate-illegitimate. A pattern based on these dimensions is
   proposed thus concluding that individual's practice politicking for a

Title = {Does political trust matter? An empirical investigation into the
   relation between political trust and support for law compliance},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {50},
Number = {2},
Pages = {267-291},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Scholars have repeatedly expressed concern about the consequences low
   levels of political trust might have for the stability of democratic
   political systems. Empirical support and the identification of causal
   mechanisms for this concern, however, are often lacking. In this
   article, the relation between political trust and law-abiding attitudes
   is investigated. It is expected that citizens with low levels of trust
   in the institutions of the political system will find it more acceptable
   to break the law. As a result, low levels of political trust might
   undermine the effectiveness and legitimacy of government action and its
   ability to implement legislation. Based on survey data from 33 European
   countries using the 1999-2001 European Values Study (N = 41,125), the
   relation between political trust and legal permissiveness is examined
   using a multilevel ordered logistic regression analysis. The results
   show that respondents with low levels of political trust are
   significantly more likely to accept illegal behaviour such as tax fraud
   than respondents with high levels of political trust. Since it is known
   from earlier research that actors who are permissive towards
   law-breaking behaviour are more likely to commit these acts themselves,
   the hypothesis that low levels of political trust will be associated
   with less law compliance within a society is supported.},

Abstract = {The financial crisis of 2008 was widely blamed on reckless and predatory
   behaviour by the banks, and public debate therefore centred on
   supporting employment and reforming the financial system. But during
   2010, the focus of attention has shifted to the deficits and debts of
   governments, which are widely believed to be excessive and
   unsustainable. It is argued here that cutting government deficits is not
   an economic necessity, but a strategy for justifying attacks on the
   living standards of workers and heading off reforms that might threaten
   the power of the ruling classes.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL POWER},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {4},
Number = {2},
Pages = {217-235},
Abstract = {The article discusses the tacit concept of modernization in its various
   guises as a transnational framework and as part of world culture. The
   historical formation of the idea of modernization is traced back to the
   Enlightenment philosophers. The article further discusses how the idea
   is embedded in contemporary discussions of society and social change. In
   discussing how modernization discourse is utilized in spreading and
   domesticating worldwide models, the paper points out that it is coupled
   with the cultural framework of competition, in which cross-national
   comparative data are commonly used as evidence. The article concludes
   that to avoid unknowingly chasing its own tail, social science needs to
   see its own role in society, and study the feedback loop from
   scientists' desks to policy models and back again},

Abstract = {Distinguishing rules and principles presupposes a criterion as a means
   not only to identify rules and principles but also to underscore their
   differences. In this essay, the notion of defeasibility will be
   presented as such a criterion. Defeasibility shall be understood as the
   capacity to accommodate exceptions. Rules, in general, have exceptions.
   These exceptions cannot be listed conclusively, owing to the fact that
   the circumstances giving rise to cases in the future are unknown. Thus,
   legal rules always exhibit the capacity to accommodate exceptions, that
   is, they are defeasible. Contrariwise, principles as optimization
   commands do not accommodate exceptions in this sense. Rather, the
   circumstances of future cases along with other conditions - for example,
   competing principles -, are already implied in the concept of
   optimization and are, therefore, integral to applying the principle
   itself. This is to say that optimization is necessarily relative to all
   the circumstances at hand. Therefore, in order to apply a principle, one
   has to optimize - thereby necessarily take into account all of the
   circumstances at hand. There cannot, then, arise any exception in
   applying a principle. Principles, in other words, are not defeasible.
   This essay concludes wit an explanation of the distinct prima
   facie-character of rules and principles again by appeal to the notion of
   defeasibility, along with the proposal of a threefold conceptual
   distinction that offers some additional clarity where the concept of a
   principle is concerned.},

Abstract = {Environmental disasters, particularly oil spills, increasingly involve a
   complex intermingling of the national, international and often the
   transnational. Traditional responses to seeking remediation have pursued
   the legal path of class action suits against multinational corporations.
   This article examines one such historic case, Aguinda v. Texaco, Inc.,
   in which residents of Ecuador's Amazonian rainforest brought suit
   against Texaco in US federal courts through the legal opening provided
   by the Alien Tort Claims Act of 1789. Dominant analyses of this case
   have centered on the failed promise of this law to serve as a human
   rights tool and view this failure in terms of the sovereigntist
   limitations on an emerging cosmopolitan order. Against these analyses,
   this article offers an alternative approach that shifts the focus from
   the limitations of the law towards a perspective on power. Bringing to
   bear political science's power debate to develop this perspective on
   power, the article highlights what analytical tools from this debate are
   translatable or which are not for understanding the power relations of
   the Aguinda case. Through this exercise, this article aims to prod a
   reconsideration of dominant theories of power, developed in a frame of
   the nation-state, and to provoke their redevelopment to better engage
   with the complex and dynamic flows of power in cases of environmental
   justice and politics across borders.},

Title = {Democracy, identity and the politics of exclusion in post-genocide
   Rwanda: the case of the Batwa},
Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {18},

Abstract = {Since the 1994 genocide, the Rwandan government has sought to navigate a
   difficult path between the multi-party democracy favoured by donors and
   a more tightly managed political environment that it argues is necessary
   for security. Using the fragile post-genocide political context and a
   history of political manipulation of ethnic identity as justification,
   the government has stigmatized and criminalized all references to
   ethnicity. This paper argues that this strategy has required careful
   management and manipulation of local narratives of identity and
   citizenship. It suggests that this has led, for one group in particular
   - the indigenous Batwa - to a politics of exclusion which limits their
   ability to participate effectively in post-genocide politics and
   advocate for their rights. Drawing on interviews with Rwandan civil
   society activists, government representatives and key bilateral and
   multilateral donors, the paper explores the often-overlooked impacts of
   these strategies on the Batwa, Rwanda's smallest ethnic group. Rwanda
   has been praised for its achievements in creating stability, relative
   security and a degree of competitive politics in a divided society that
   is needed to prevent the recurrence of large scale violence. And though
   the government explains its attempts to manage identity narratives as
   part of a wider effort to create an inclusive national identity,
   promoting `Rwandan-ness', it is suggested that the effects of this
   policy for the Batwa have been negative and exclusionary. Whatever the
   potential virtues of such a strategy, the paper argues that there is
   little room for effective representation and accordingly for a political
   voice for the indigenous Batwa in such a tightly managed system.},

Abstract = {This article examines how the struggle for the recognition of genocide
   in the twentieth century opens up a political space which, on the one
   hand, generates historical discourses and imaginaries about the
   categories of victim and perpetrator and, on the other hand, redefines
   relationships between the state and its minority citizens. Genocide
   becomes a `critical event', in the sense of Veena Das, that citizens
   from different ethnic, social and religious backgrounds use to express
   their positions concerning the repressive state practices they have been
   victims of. This expression creates a collective space of solidarity
   where parties support each other by adopting similar strategies in the
   struggle for state accountability. At the same time, it opens up a space
   for negotiation among the state, minority citizens and migrant
   communities regarding claims to rights and justice.},

Abstract = {Presented paper elaborates on the topic of a politics of forms. It is
   based on the inclusion of aesthetic criteria, namely landscape-related
   criteria, into public policies and associative mobilisations, as well as
   the importance of new environmental aesthetics acquired in the area of
   perceptions. Our forms, i.e., landscape, narrative and atmosphere, are
   means through which we are aiming at re-articulating the private/public
   sphere, the spheres of the intimate, and the spaces of the public.
   Setting out from aesthetic experience, as articulated by Dewey, an
   American pragmatist philosopher, and from the aesthetic judgment as a
   way to make one's experience objective and as a place of passage and
   communication of a universal experience, we attempt to open up the
   public sphere, an actual space of dialogue, to different ways of
   comprehending the reality - namely aesthetics - than those of science.},

Abstract = {The increase of the role of the state in Russia's economics in the 2000s
   resulted in restriction of the freedom of business and brought about
   conflicts between political power and that part of the business world,
   which sought influence in the world of politics. At the same time arose
   a complex of questions concerning contradictory relations between
   business and the broad strata of Russian society. Business does not show
   sufficient readiness to assume its part of social responsibility. This
   complex of questions is studied by a new discipline - economic political
   science. It is the most general features of the authorities' interaction
   with business in Russia, as well as the difficulties in the process of
   the said interaction, that are considered in the article.},

   Europe for most of their career. This essay summarizes Smith's scholarly
   achievements. Smith's research shows how economic analysis can be
   helpful to analyse peace and security issues, very much in the spirit of
   Richardson's efforts to use scientific methods to study war and peace.},

Abstract = {This essay offers a discourse analytical study of the trajectory of the
   European Court of Justice's case law regarding the social rights of
   non-employed persons, which began in 1998 and has established its
   centrepieces in the meantime. The text aims at demonstrating that
   societal struggles turn into legal ones, once they enter the arena of
   European law. I argue in particular that before the backdrop of the
   crisis of neoliberal hegemony the Court of Justice integrates different
   forces into a new hegemonic legal project, which points towards a
   European social union and provides first evidence of a potential `state
   project Europe'.(1)},

Abstract = {A sizeable scholarly literature has generally uncovered weak,
   statistically trivial connections between social capital and political
   support, in spite of its logical appeal. Much of this research, however,
   has adopted an overly restrictive research design. It has overwhelmingly
   focused on the impact of social trust on political trust, from which
   broad inferences about the utility of the social capital perspective
   have been made. Rarely, however, has the impact of social capital been
   systematically assessed on indicators of political support which are
   more diffuse in character. Using data drawn from the German General
   Social Survey (ALLBUS), the present study analyses the impact of
   different measures of social capital on political support in the Federal
   Republic of Germany. The results strongly support the conclusion that
   social capital influences diffuse support.},

Journal = {CANADIAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {5},

Abstract = {Shale gas, a type of natural gas extracted from shale rock deposits deep
   underground, is poised to become the latest in a long history of staples
   industries in the British Columbian economy. However, its development
   poses challenges for the future trajectory of BC's economy and society.
   BC's economy, values, and political imaginary have increasingly turned
   towards a post-staples trajectory based on economic diversification and
   a cultural shift towards environmental and cosmopolitan values. In
   considering what is at stake in the development of shale gas, we locate
   the industry in the historical context of BC's economic, regulatory, and
   political transitions toward a post-staples society, and assess what
   political, environmental, and economic challenges arise from the
   disconnect between a staples industry and a post-staples society. We
   conclude that for shale gas development to be viable and profitable for
   BC's economy, the industry must be regulated to ensure the benefits that
   accrue from shale gas development (in terms of revenue, sustainable
   employment, and stable northern development) further BC's nascent
   post-staples trajectory of development.},

   There exist several challenges to which they will have to face the

   challenge, so on having excelled itself and this aspect to be improved
   might implant him in an easier way the new business culture with the

   our understanding of such phenomena. The introduction then provides an
   overview of the special issue's five articles, which draw upon evidence
   from Africa, the Balkans, Northern Ireland, and the Basque Country to
   highlight the benefits and drawbacks of third-party intervention in
   ethnic and ethnonational conflicts. In doing so, they highlight many of
   the most salient issues affecting the practice of intervention and

Abstract = {Scholarly work on diversionary war is ubiquitous as is the observation
   that findings in the literature are mixed. One reason for these mixed
   results may be that potential targets strategically avoid conflict.
   Another theoretical possibility is that some types of domestic trouble
   restrain state leaders' foreign policy behavior rather than giving them
   an incentive to use force. These domestic conditions could provide their
   international opponents. with an opportunity to exploit the state's
   weakness. If a state interprets its opponent's domestic context as an
   opportunity to take advantage of a weakness, then we should anticipate
   greater aggressiveness rather than the passive avoidance behavior much
   work on strategic interaction and the use of force suggests. Our
   heteroskedastic model provides evidence that where some domestic
   conditions create threats for foreign opponents, others provide
   opportunities.},

Journal = {POLITIQUE EUROPEENNE},

Volume = {35},
Number = {3},
Pages = {165-195},
Abstract = {We only have a patchy knowledge about how national authorities responded
   to the Europeanization of health care access, following the Kohll and
   Decker rulings on cross-border patient mobility. National responses have
   often been portrayed as being related to the level of misfit between
   national institutions and European law. A comparative study of how
   Swedish and French authorities reacted to cross-border health care
   developments shows that a more interactionist approach is needed. This
   paper therefore retraces the processes of implementation and engagement
   in European policy-making, showing that domestic usages matter the most
   in the different making of the French and Swedish EU health policies.},

Abstract = {Political advisers are attracting increasing attention in Westminster
   jurisdictions. Typically, scholars focus on the corrosive impact they
   allegedly have on elements of Westminster convention and practice. We
   argue that a concern with accountability detracts from other important
   matters, including understanding and theorising ministerial advisers'
   roles. In this article we address these issues using primary data from a
   survey of ministerial advisers in New Zealand. We draw on Maley's
   typology to classify advisers' activities according to the contribution
   they make to executive government policy-making. We then theorise these
   activities through the lens of the core executive. We conclude that
   ministerial advisers are increasingly important actors in governing
   environments characterised by complex resource dependencies, modes of
   operation that are as often relational as they are hierarchical, and
   bargaining relationships that are often positive and not zero-sum in
   nature.},

Abstract = {The article assesses the social consequences of the democratic
   transition that began in Pakistan in 1988 and ended in 1999 by analysing
   public spending for health and education and changes in human
   development indicators. Available information indicates that the return
   to democracy did not lead to greater spending in these two sectors. It
   is argued that the key internal factors that hampered government
   commitment to social welfare were the pre-eminence among elected
   representatives of social groups unwilling to invest in the human
   capital of the majority and the dominance of the armed forces in the
   country's power politics.},

Abstract = {What impact do majority rule and unanimity rule create on welfare and
   decision costs? According to Buchanan and Tullock ({[}1962] 1999) the
   unanimity principle must be regarded as a democratic norm, because it
   guarantees Pareto-efficient welfare effects. We present experimental
   results from a public goods game, which demonstrate in contrast to this
   assumption that majority rule can produce larger welfare effects than
   unanimity rule. This result suggests a critical revision of theoretical
   approaches which narrow the legitimacy of majority rule in this respect.},

Abstract = {This article applies David Galula's theory of counterinsurgency to help
   explain the failures and successes in Colombia's counterinsurgency
   efforts against las Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia, or the
   Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). The case study
   demonstrates the continuing utility of Galula's ideas which, in their
   parsimony, highlight most of the important causal factors that account
   for dissimilar outcomes in the Colombian conflict. Colombia's divergent
   responses to the FARC throughout the history of the insurgency
   demonstrate both the detriment of improper strategy and the progress
   that can be achieved when Galula's laws are utilized.},

Title = {Speech Cycle? `Election-Defining Rhetoric' in Westminster Democracies},
Journal = {AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {46},
Number = {1},
Pages = {35-52},
Abstract = {Leaders of government within Westminster democracies undertake a key
   rhetorical task on the day an election is called. Following a visit to
   the monarch or the vice-regal representative, leaders emerge to give
   their opening speech of the election campaign. These are moments of
   definition; moments when leaders rhetorically frame the battle to come.
   This paper argues that in Westminster democratic systems, these
   statements conform to a set pattern of rhetoric, which reflects the
   length of time the government has been in office. This pattern-or
   `speech cycle'- suggests that electoral rhetoric is not governed solely
   by the policy issues of the day, and that some restraints apply to
   governments in the rhetoric they can legitimately utilise at different
   points in their tenure.},

Abstract = {This paper suggests that new understandings of rights associated with
   right to the city movements in many cities around the world are
   subverting special treatment rights (understood as privilege) and the
   systems of differentiated citizenship that support them. To make this
   case, it examines the Brazilian formulation of differentiated
   citizenship as a telling historical example of a politics of difference
   based on a combination of universal membership and special treatment
   rights. It argues that by denying the expectation of equality and
   emphasizing that of compensatory equity in the distribution of rights,
   Brazilian citizenship became an entrenched regime of legalized
   privileges and legitimated inequalities. This paper then analyzes the
   insurgence of an urban citizenship in the poor peripheries of Brazilian
   cities since the 1970s, which promotes new kinds of contributor rights,
   the text-based rights, and the right to rights. It ends with a
   discussion of the entanglements and contradictions of these formulations
   of citizenship and rights.},

Title = {Ideological choices in contemporary China: With a discussion of Francis
   Fukuyama's declaration of the end of history},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL CRITICAL THOUGHT},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {1},
Number = {2},
Pages = {158-170},
Abstract = {One of the myths Western ideology keeps creating and maintaining is that
   nothing can surpass capitalism. However, this myth has been revealed to
   be false by contemporary China, with its firmly held banner of socialism
   with Chinese characteristics and its sustained rapid growth. China's
   growth has fundamentally rewritten world history and has made Francis
   Fukuyama's declaration of the end of history into a historical irony.
   The Chinese Communists have achieved this through Deng Xiaoping theory,
   the groundbreaking statement of the `Three Represents' and the strategic
   scientific concept of development in their comprehensive understanding
   of new historical developments in response to the new challenges posed
   by the times. In the process they have provided answers to three
   historical issues: (1) What is socialism and how can it be realized? (2)
   What is the nature of the Communist Party of China and how can it be
   strengthened? And (3) What is development aimed at and how should it be
   achieved? From this arises the theoretical framework of socialism with
   Chinese characteristics and the foundation for socialist ideology in
   contemporary China. These points also offer a clear answer to half a
   century of ideological debate: ideology remains a fundamental driving
   force for reaching consensus and forming synergy; political and public
   participation inspired by enthusiasm arising from theory and shared
   ideals are an irreplaceable and effective means to man's spiritual
   quest; history is far from ending, and socialism still stands for the
   direction of humanity's progress and development.},

   assistance still does not do enough to prioritise local businesses and
   promote enterprise. These professionals can be the building blocks of
   recovery and growth, becoming stakeholders in stability, rather than
   rent-seeking participants in an aid-bloated economy.},

Abstract = {This article presents an analysis of how the governments of Norway and
   Italy reacted when the Commission, citing EU regional state aid
   regulations, banned the use of social security tax subsidies in northern
   Norway and southern Italy, and how these governments chose to meet
   EU-level pressure. This is a salient issue, as EU state aid policy is a
   case of coercive Europeanization with potential redistributive effects
   nationally. The two countries reacted differently, and apparently
   contrary to expectations based on misfit or cultures of compliance. In
   order to understand what happened, we must study the actors in power,
   their preferences and their room for manoeuvre. Do they want change? Can
   they implement change? Or, if they do not want change: can they avoid
   it?},

   Companies' Regulation as a Renegotiation of the Limits of the State},
Journal = {POLITIX},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {24},
Number = {95},
Pages = {129+},
Abstract = {From an analysis of recent controls developed around private violence,
   this article offers a new perspective on the idea of the privatization
   of the state. The increasing use of private security companies by states
   reveals, indeed, both the extension and normalization of commercial
   logics as a way of governing, even when dealing with war. Yet, the
   limits of such a market for force and the consequent implementation of
   controls around this commercial activity incline to reevaluate the
   vision of a retreat of the state. The emergence, in three sequences, of
   a regulation where the state is progressively reintroduced, actually
   allows recognizing in fine its respecification as the legitimate and
   sovereign entity, all along this process of the outsourcing of violence
   and of its control.},

Abstract = {The Great Recession is not the end of capitalism. An innovative economy
   makes mistakes, but that is not a good reason to regulate it out of its
   innovations. The innovations not unions or regulation have increased
   real income per head by a factor of 100 in the places that have adopted
   bourgeois liberty and dignity. An innovative economy is ``rhetorical{''}
   because, if our economic lives are not frozen by tradition, we must
   persuade each other what is to be done. ``Rhetoric,{''} of course, is
   the ancient word for unforced persuasion. Samuelsonian economics, which
   is the usual kind, ignores words, persuasion, rhetoric. Yet one quarter
   of national income in a modern economy is earned from ``sweet talk.{''}
   Discovery, which Austrian economists like Schumpeter and Kirzner
   emphasize, depends on rhetoric, and the rhetoric depends on ethics.
   Realist political philosophy, and agency theory in business schools,
   miss the ethical foundations of our lives.},

Abstract = {Anders Behring Breivik, also called Andrew, is the author of the largest
   terrorist attack on Norwegian territory, which occurred on July 22,
   2011. Moreover, he is also the main author of a compendium of ideas,
   published in 2011, that aims to justify the attacks. The compendium,
   entitled 2083 - the European Declaration of Independence, brings
   together a wide range of topics carefully approached that, dogmatically
   presented, require us a study of the beliefs shared also by some
   European communities, not represented by the mental disease advocated by
   Andrew's defense. This paper has as focus an archaeological analysis of
   the above mentioned compendium in order to observe the central paradigms
   of a contemporary and not unknown phenomenon, the rise of the extreme
   right, based both on the electoral arena and on terrorists methods.},

Abstract = {What can be done when governments and leaders in states do not abide to
   internationally codified norms and values? The Westphalian order allows
   regimes to claim their domestic sovereignty over and above minimum
   standards of universally established normative frameworks, not least
   with regard to human rights. Is such a protective shield more legitimate
   than externally initiated interventions when basic norms are violated?
   Or is it not a matter of conscience and loyalty to fundamental human
   values if not a form of solidarity to take a stance against such
   injustices in the absence of any legitimacy of such forms of rule among
   the own people in these countries? The role of the United Nations,
   advocating a Responsibility to Protect and representing the most
   advanced form of institutionalised global governance, is hereby
   critical. This article discusses the options at hand when confronted
   with crimes against humanity. It pays special attention to the
   understanding represented by Dag Hammarskjold as second
   Secretary-General, his view of the international civil servant and the
   obligations of the United Nations to advance rights for people, at times
   against their rulers.},

Abstract = {Historically, the Philosophy of Law has provided a dynamic and
   influential framework in which to identify, explain, produce and develop
   the rationality is needed so as to come to terms with the fundamental
   issues and questions raised by the democratic experience. Currently, far
   reaching policy questions are being raised throughout the world
   concerning the present and future of democracy; and specifically the
   role of the law in the formation of the democratic experience. But the
   foundations and horizons of the problems appear to be left on edge.
   Legal students, researchers and practitioners are expected to produce
   knowledge and perspectives capable of addressing such needs. In such a
   historical context, the relevance of the Philosophy of Law to explore
   and contribute to the ongoing formative and transformative processess of
   democratic legal cultures needs to be reconsidered. Accordingly, this
   article reviews briefly the historical role of the Philosophy of Law in
   the processess associated to the conceptual understanding of the law, so
   as to reveal its identity as a legal discipline and its relevance as a
   framework for analysis and deliberation on the nature and role of the
   law. In so doing, the article reconsiders some of the traditional
   ontological, epistemological and ethical questions which characterize
   the exercise of the philosophy of law, and depicts the importance of
   inclusive, communicative and participatory experiences, as necessary
   conditions in the emergence of the legal philosophical framework needed
   so as to contribute to the needs of contemporary democracy.},

Abstract = {At the May 2012 NATO Summit in Chicago, the `success' of the Alliance's
   Libya operation will no doubt be a cause for celebration. However,
   despite the positive outcome, Libya will have a very limited impact on
   the future direction of the Alliance. Undue focus on recent operations
   deflects attention from the more important drivers of NATO's future
   course - ones which will likely ensure that the Alliance remains an
   active global security actor, even if many of its members do not always
   want to take an active part militarily.},

Volume = {26},
Number = {3},
Pages = {283-299},
Abstract = {Northern Ireland: A Comparative Analysis (F. Wright, 1987, Dublin: Gill
   and Macmillan) remains the most significant work of comparative
   historical analysis written on Ireland, yet its reputed difficulty has
   blunted its impact. This article reconstructs Frank Wright's research
   design and comparative method and situates the book in the research
   tradition of configurative macroanalysis pioneered by Barrington Moore.
   Wright's detailed, processual, analytic narratives comparing the
   breakdown of communal deterrence systems in Northern Ireland, the US
   South and Algeria have been relatively neglected in later literature.
   Those grounded comparisons focused on getting the concrete details of
   cases right while striving to build middle-range generalizations about
   ethnic stratification and political authority. His comparisons were
   morally serious searches for paths out of conflict, which analyzed the
   unfolding of temporal processes in ways that anticipated recent interest
   in path dependence; but Wright downplayed political institutions and
   overstated his categorical distinction between settlement colony and
   ethnic frontiers. Future comparative research on Northern Ireland should
   focus even more on variation across conflicts, including institutional
   change, but would benefit from re-engaging with A Comparative Analysis
   as a gateway to comparative historical analysis.},

   the British public at large. However, 86 percent called this a personal
   opinion only. While there may not be a groundswell of active
   republicanism in the Commons, a substantial group of sympathetic MPs
   exists who might be willing to seize on a future public crisis in the
   monarchy in order to effect reforms. Lacking party leadership support,
   republican MPs are not optimistic about change in the short-to-medium
   term.},

Volume = {34},
Number = {4},
Pages = {665-682},
Abstract = {This article assesses the `old' and `new' political economy of hedge
   fund regulation in the EU, explaining why the EU has decided to regulate
   hedge fund managers in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. A
   Franco-German alliance, with the support of Italy, other Mediterranean
   countries and some quarters of the European Parliament, has driven the
   EU's attempt to regulate hedge funds. The new EU rules are explained by
   institutionally-shaped economic interests rooted in national varieties
   of financial capitalism - the `old' political economy of hedge fund
   regulation. However, `ideas', in the form of competing regulatory
   paradigms, are instrumental in explaining why one coalition of actors
   has prevailed over the other in EU rule-making - the `new' political
   economy of hedge fund regulation.},

Abstract = {Totalitarian systems in Europe forced numerous artists into exile. The
   East Central European composers Bohuslav Martin George Enescu, and Bela
   Bartok went to the United States. Only there did Martinu become a
   composer of symphonies. His aesthetics corresponded with the main stream
   of American musical views. Enescu was held in considerable esteem in the
   United States, and two of his later works accommodated public taste.
   Bartok's masterpiece ``Concerto for Orchestra{''} is a prime example of
   how the experience of exile influenced artistic creation.},

Abstract = {One of the most prominent effects of social militarization is hostility
   toward anyone of the same nationality as the enemy. This is common in
   conventional wars, but has become even more pronounced in the War on
   Terror, as the enemy is hidden in the civilian population. Western fear
   of Muslims was common before this war, but has escalated since. Muslims
   are portrayed as a monolithic group that is intrinsically hostile to the
   west. The war narrative legitimizes xenophobia by associating individual
   actions with all members of a group, and for that reason, it is
   potentially dangerous to Canadian multiculturalism.},

Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {14},

Abstract = {We now know that intimate forms of parental partiality, such as bedtime
   storytelling, may entrench socio-economic inequalities. Egalitarians
   will differ on how it is proper to handle the equality-upsetting effect
   of intimate parental partiality. Rawlsians propose mitigating the
   resulting inequalities in nurtured skills (that is, prevent them from
   translating into social and political advantages later in life). Luck
   egalitarians, in contrast, propose neutralizing them, e.g. requiring
   parents not to read bedtime stories if and when this gives the child an
   undue advantage later in life. It has been suggested (by Andrew Mason)
   that this implication shows luck egalitarianism to be counterintuitive.
   The paper responds to that challenge and shows why, once we
   differentiate between different motivations underlying parental
   partiality, the luck egalitarian position on bedtime reading is no less

Pages = {965-980},
Abstract = {This article uses the lens of development discourse to shed light on
   subaltern politics of citizenship and rights claims in contemporary
   India. It argues that battles for development entitlements allow
   subaltern subjects to meaningfully inhabit and simultaneously alter the
   contours of legal citizenship, which they have been formally granted by
   the Indian constitution, but, in effect, denied. Subaltern claims on
   citizenship, articulated from a position of subordination and
   difference, not equality, and through specific idioms, contest and
   radically transform the generic and universal slot of personhood that
   liberalism provides - one that is rational, secular, sovereign and
   individualistic. Their citizenship claims draw upon multiple discourses,
   extending well beyond the law, mixing morality and materiality, ethics
   and politics, and traditional and bureaucratic languages of power, and
   thereby muddy the very distinctions on which modern citizenship rests.
   Subaltern struggles over development, thus, force us to reconsider
   hardened, normative ideas of legal citizenship and to widen the scope
   through which we look at and think about rights claims, justice,
   personhood and, indeed, the state in the neoliberal era.},

Pages = {295-311},
Abstract = {This article presents evidence designed to expand scholarly knowledge of
   how high school co-curricular activities generate the positive effects
   previous scholarship has found. Studies of empowerment across various
   fields identify a sense of autonomy, self-belief, self-expression, the
   ability to work together with diverse others, and a critical social
   consciousness as key factors that can enable people to achieve things.
   The evidence presented here from four state student council association
   workshops suggests that co-curricular activities may create the
   conditions in which students can learn a sense of autonomy, self-belief,
   self-expression, and, to a limited extent, the ability to work with
   diverse others. Therefore, the causal mechanism that this study
   recommends future Large-N studies test is that co-curricular activities
   cause students to gain these traits, which then translates into the
   gains in civic behaviors and other positive outcomes.},

Title = {The Institutional Power of Western European Parliaments: A
   Multidimensional Analysis},
Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {34},
Number = {4},
Pages = {731-754},
Abstract = {Parliaments are more than legislative bodies. However, we lack an
   adequate understanding of the theoretical relationship between different
   facets of parliamentary activity or `parliamentary functions'. Relying
   on the principal-agent framework, this article argues theoretically that
   parliamentary power is a multidimensional concept comprising three
   distinct mechanisms to ensure policy outputs in line with the collective
   preferences of parliaments: direct influence on policymaking, the ex
   ante selection of external officeholders, and the ex post control of the
   cabinet. These mechanisms mirror the classic legislative, electoral, and
   control functions of parliaments. Empirically, the paper uses factor
   analysis of newly developed indicators for electoral powers and
   established measures of legislative and control resources to show that
   the institutional powers of 15 Western European parliaments comprise
   four distinct dimensions. These dimensions match the three theoretically
   derived mechanisms with committee power as an additional factor.
   Locating the 15 parliaments in this multidimensional space of
   parliamentary powers demonstrates that classifications based solely on
   lawmaking lead to biased assessments of parliamentary strength and
   weakness. Instead, the paper provides a more nuanced picture of the ways
   in which Western European parliaments can influence policymaking under
   the conditions of delegation.},

Abstract = {The triumphal procession of American pop culture in East Central Europe
   is not a phenomenon of the post-1989 era, but picks up on established
   cultural norms and values. In Poland, U.S. products and symbols were
   mythologised and idealised throughout the interwar era and remained
   present, at least in the popular imagination, during the East-West
   conflict. America's popular and consumer culture is not only attractive
   because it is so accessible and appearance-oriented, but also because
   its individualism satisfies a deep lodging of people in post-socialist
   society.},

Abstract = {Apart from the great debates on the definition of terrorism or its
   causes, the discussion about whether `new terrorism' can really be
   considered new or not has become one of the central disagreements in
   terrorism research. This article will respond to the criticism voiced by
   some of the proponents of the `new terrorism' idea and reflect on the
   merits of their arguments. It will emphasis the importance of words and
   the implication of small predicates such as `new' for the construction
   of terrorism and our reaction to it.},

Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1-2, SI},
Pages = {231-235},
Abstract = {I agree with Paul Lewis that mathematics has a valuable but not
   all-encompassing role in economics, that event regularities must be
   supplemented with a persuasive narrative, and that inferences can inform
   our understanding of economic behavior. However, Lewis's full-throated
   defense of critical realism does little to allay my original concerns.
   It is absurd to maintain, as critical realists do, that mainstream
   economics has nothing valuable to offer heterodox economists, as their
   critique of the quantity theory of money tries to demonstrate. More
   crucially, critical realistsunlike Austrian economistsneglect to provide
   an epistemological explanation of economic actors' perceptions, which is
   necessary if we are to bridge critical realism's own division of the
   social world into the oactual,o oempirical,o and onon-actual real.o.},

Abstract = {Article analyses the Slavic component in the foreign policy of the four
   Central European Slavic (CES) countries. The central thesis is that the
   Slavic component is not (an important) part of those countries' foreign
   policy; however it is relevant within cultural affairs. The author
   argues that the CES countries instrumentalise their foreign policy to
   accomplish their interests within the geographically and culturally
   close nations. This presumption is verified by the
   comparative-foreign-policy methodology, 2 being applied to the structure
   of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Diplomatic Missions of CES
   countries. The article reaches two main conclusions; the analysis
   confirms that Slavism is relevant within cultural affairs only, while
   the foreign policy of all countries is determined by other variables.
   The derivation of this hypothesis shows that, because CES countries omit
   their cultural similarities and therefore are not an incentive for
   better collaboration in their foreign policy, they lose many
   opportunities and challenges within the EU, as this weakens their
   negotiating position.},

Abstract = {The first lecture, The Future of Religion, presents a reflection on
   near-Eastern salvation religions (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam) and
   in the secular ideologies of emancipation that these religions helped
   inspire. The advance of the religious consciousness of humanity now
   depends on a deepening of the distinctive content of this orientation.
   To be faithful to what made this orientation persuasive and powerful in
   the first place, we must radicalize it against both established
   institutions and dominant beliefs. The radicalization can take place
   with or without reliance on belief in a narrative of divine intervention
   in history. The difference between these two paths matters.
   Nevertheless, the profane and the sacred forms of this transformed
   religion are closer to each other than either of them is to much of
   conventional organized religion and to much of the familiar secular
   humanism.},

Abstract = {The model of labor politics-social democracy (quasi-revolutionary,
   evolutionary), insurrectionism (bolshevism, anarchism-syndicalism), or
   moderate syndicalism that emerges as dominant in an industrializing
   society depends on the choices made by labor elites in response to their
   case-specific environment of labor inclusion. By developing a systematic
   account for the interaction between elite agency and constraining
   environment, this theoretical proposition overcomes both theoretical and
   empirical limitations of prior structural and overly deterministic
   approaches. An empirical analysis for all industrialized polities during
   the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries reveals that variation
   in labor inclusion correctly predicts the outcome in seventeen out of
   twenty cases, representing a significant increase in predictive power
   over prior approaches.},

Abstract = {Nationalism and Islam have widely tended to be viewed as separate
   elements in the Turkish context. However, Islam has, in fact, been a
   foundational part of Turkish identity since the establishment of the
   Turkish Republic; and, on the popular level, Islam cannot actually be
   separated from nationalism. The equation of Turkish with Muslim identity
   was always tacitly understood; now it is explicit. Previous Turkish
   governments have, at times, won support by appealing to both nationalist
   and religious sentiments as well but none has done this so successfully
   as the AKP... The current Turkish government's rhetoric manages to
   appeal to both impulses, and that is why it is such a powerful brew. The
   AKP has been able to achieve what no other government has before:
   wedding popular religious nationalism to the levers of government and
   remaining in power whilst doing so.},

Title = {Should Scholars Delineate a Data Set Apart from a Research Project?
   Considering Objects, Methods, and Purposes for Studying Presidential
   Rhetoric},
Journal = {PRESIDENTIAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {41},
Number = {4},
Pages = {752-760},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Rather than identifying a data set prior to engaging in scholarship, we
   need to consider how scholars' choices of which presidential speeches to
   study depend importantly on their understanding of objects, methods, and
   purposes of analysis. Presidential speeches may be understood as
   discrete, meaningful texts and/or as parts of larger bodies of
   discourse. In either case, speech making may proceed in a moment that
   advocates and audiences alike appreciate as significant. At other times,
   speech itself may lend gravity to a moment, such that the magnitude of
   an address may not be appreciated until after it has been delivered.
   Methods may incorporate social scientific and/or humanistic approaches,
   seeking to generalize common characteristics across speeches and
   presidents as well as explicate distinctive discursive traits within
   speeches and among particular presidents. Alternative approaches give
   varying weight to the distinctive contribution of the analyst. Purposes
   may address a range of elements, including appreciation and/or
   demystification of presidential speech. Focusing scholarship on a common
   set of texts may initiate conversations across theoretical and
   methodological perspectives. At the same time, pursuing different
   purposes and analyzing the full range of presidential speeches may
   generate illuminating differences among speeches and presidents.},

Abstract = {Hungary was considered a pioneer of democratic reforms in the Soviet
   bloc. After 1989, the new democratic system quickly achieved a very high
   degree of stability by regional standards. Consolidation, however, was
   accompanied by growing polarization between the political camps. The
   tendency of political elites to call into question the legitimacy and
   integrity of their political opponents not only strains the ability of
   democratic institutions to function. It also poses risks to Hungarian
   democracy.},

Abstract = {Many attribute the demise of the solid South, and changes in party
   attachments outside the South, to elite-level changes in the parties'
   positions on racial issues and an issue evolution of the party system.
   Support is also growing for the notion that, as the Republican Party
   became an acceptable alternative to the Democratic Party for racial
   issues in the South, a resurgence of class-based partisanship further
   fueled the exodus. By investigating whether political awareness mediates
   responsiveness to changes in the political environment, evidence that
   partisan evolution is concentrated among more aware citizens is
   uncovered, and the implications are examined.},

Abstract = {For many years, mass media has transformed its original role from one of
   simply informing people to one of shaping societies by making them adopt
   elements of different cultures. Giving information is only one of its
   attributes, but in this day and age it is not the main activity. Today,
   mass media acts more like a group of ``feature writers and feature
   speakers{''} than of informative channels. Mass media has become an
   important new player in all states and a decision maker in some spheres.
   In Mexico, mass media has influenced the adoption of lifestyles and the
   integration of new traditions and values, but these are not the only
   aspects in which media intervened. It also has participated in the
   building of a new political culture that shows people how to become real
   citizens. This article will study the role of television and the press
   in the transformation of the Mexican political regime. It will focus on
   the way that mass media can influence the process of transforming
   political attitudes by making democratic political values a daily
   routine.},

   Revisited},
Journal = {POLITICAL BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {33},
Number = {4},
Pages = {685-701},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This paper examines the permanence of differences in the psychological
   underpinnings of ideological self-identifications. Previous research has
   suggested that conservatives differ from liberals insofar as their
   self-identifications as such are best explained as the product of a
   negative reaction (both to liberalism generally and to the groups
   associated with it in particular) rather than a positive embrace.
   However, this paper demonstrates that the dynamics underlying the
   formation of ideological self-identifications are not static reflections
   of inherent differences in liberal and conservative psychologies but
   rather evolve in response to changes in the political environment.
   Whereas feelings (positive or negative) toward liberalism played a
   decisive role in shaping individuals' ideological self-identifications
   during the New Deal/Great Society era of liberal and Democratic
   political hegemony, the subsequent resurgence of political conservatism
   produced a decisive shift in the bases of liberal and conservative
   self-identifications. In particular, just as conservative
   self-identifications once primarily represented a reaction against
   liberalism and its associated symbols, hostility toward conservatism and
   its associated symbols has in recent years become an increasingly
   important source of liberal self-identifications.},

Abstract = {Identifying causal mechanisms is a fundamental goal of social science.
   Researchers seek to study not only whether one variable affects another
   but also how such a causal relationship arises. Yet commonly used
   statistical methods for identifying causal mechanisms rely upon
   untestable assumptions and are often inappropriate even under those
   assumptions. Randomizing treatment and intermediate variables is also
   insufficient. Despite these difficulties, the study of causal mechanisms
   is too important to abandon. We make three contributions to improve
   research on causal mechanisms. First, we present a minimum set of
   assumptions required under standard designs of experimental and
   observational studies and develop a general algorithm for estimating
   causal mediation effects. Second, we provide a method for assessing the
   sensitivity of conclusions to potential violations of a key assumption.
   Third, we offer alternative research designs for identifying causal
   mechanisms under weaker assumptions. The proposed approach is
   illustrated using media framing experiments and incumbency advantage
   studies.},

Abstract = {This article explores how interest groups decide policy positions
   through case studies of three organizations' shifting stances on the
   issue of immigration. In all three cases, the AFL-CIO, the Sierra Club,
   and the Christian Coalition, issue positions are signaling mechanisms
   central to the construction of an organizational identity. Leadership
   considers the message the stance on a policy issue sends to potential
   constituents and allies. Organizational agendas are one tool used by
   leaders to craft new narratives about what the group stands for, who the
   group represents, and who belongs. Key determinants of leaderships'
   calculation over redrawing the boundaries of inclusion and
   representation and what signal an issue stance will convey includes
   organizational strength and a reading of a shifting political terrain.
   An evolutionary metaphor, instead of a rational actor model, is better
   suited to understand this critical component of interest group behavior,
   agenda setting.},

Abstract = {Despite the importance of the Left-Right dimension in comparative
   politics, establishing an index that captures this dimension in both a
   theoretically and empirically sound manner remains an ongoing challenge
   for political scientists. Having reviewed existing attempts to construct
   measures for the Left-Right dimension, and having concluded that they
   are merely inductive and problematic from a methodological perspective,
   this article proposes a deductive approach based on Norberto Bobbio's
   theory of Left and Right and suggests a combination with statistically
   robust measures drawn from the data provided by the Comparative
   Manifesto Project (CMP). The fundamental features of the proposed index
   are: first, Left and Right are theoretical concepts which should be
   accounted for in the empirical analysis. Second, the Left-Right
   dimension is time- and country-specific. Third, different statements
   have different meanings on a Left-Right scale. Fourth, the importance of
   the Left-Right dimension itself varies over time and across countries.
   Finally, the data have to be analysed adequately.},

Abstract = {The Canadian federal parliament is unique among Westminster
   parliamentary democracies due to the unusually high level of voluntary
   and involuntary MP turnover that occurs at each general election. This
   article builds on existing research to test the hypothesis that the MP
   career duration is related to MPs' expectations about parliamentary
   roles, insofar as voluntary turnover is concerned. Data on MPs drawn
   from historical records collected by the Library of Parliament and from
   surveys conducted in 1993 and 20011 are used to develop an event history
   model which estimates the hazard of voluntary career termination when
   different parliamentary roles are taken into consideration. Findings
   suggest that a number of individual factors play a role in voluntary
   turnover, most notably that MPs who enter Parliament hoping to affect
   policy are the most likely to move on.},

Abstract = {This paper tests whether the social information provided by the internet
   affects the decision to participate in politics. In a field experiment,
   subjects could choose to sign petitions and donate money to support
   causes. Participants were randomized into treatment groups that received
   varying information about how many other people had participated and a
   control group receiving no social information. Results show that social
   information has a varying effect according to the numbers provided,
   which is strongest when there are more than a million other
   participants, supporting claims about critical mass, and tipping points
   in political participation.},

Abstract = {The September 2011 Eastern Partnership summit in Warsaw was a sad

   European Union is dissatisfied with the partner states. And the partner
   states are disappointed in the EU. The Neighbourhood Policy has reached
   an impasse. It is time for a reassessment. The Eastern Partnership
   should concentrate on those states that have a real interest in
   Europeanisation: Moldova and Georgia. And the EU should pursue only a
   few very specific projects with them.},

Abstract = {This article examines the quality of democracy in Cambodia, arguing that
   Cambodian democracy since its inception in 1993 has evolved from
   unstructured competitive authoritarianism toward an authoritarianism
   characterized by the presence of a stable hegemonic party system wherein
   the minimum criteria for democracy have been severely curtailed.
   Although the quality of democracy has declined, the regime's legitimacy
   has risen, due mainly to sustained economic growth and political
   stability, and increased patronage-based development. Economic
   performance-based legitimacy has become path-dependent; without growth
   the ruling party's legitimacy might be called into question. Given the
   current political, social, economic and international contexts that
   favor economic growth with political stability, Cambodia will sustain a
   dominant party authoritarian regime with limited quality of democracy.},

Abstract = {When student presentations are offered in the classroom., instructors
   are most likely to be concerned about the extent to which students pay
   attention and learn from the experience of not only giving a
   presentation., but about what students learn, as an audience. After
   devising a peer-evaluation instrument for students to evaluate their
   classmates' presentations, over the course of two years and to courses,
   we surveyed students to determine the effectiveness and usefulness of
   peer evaluations. We found that students are more likely to pay
   attention, gain a different perspective on the presentation experience,
   and be more engaged in the presentation when they evaluate one another.},

Abstract = {We investigate various theories of legislative coalition formation in a
   bicameral context. More specifically, we employ a quasi-experimental
   design to examine the size of coalitions in both the House and Senate
   across the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. This offers us
   considerable analytical leverage in investigating how changes in key
   institutional decision rules (the adoption of the Reed's Rules in the
   House and the passage of cloture in the Senate) affect the likelihood of
   passing major policy reform. Our findings indicate that when the size of
   the majority party is adequately controlled for, changes in
   institutional structures do not have a significant effect on
   cross-chamber coalition formation.},

Abstract = {Confused students researching papers not knowing where they are going.
   Articles, lectures, and books on exciting topics that turn out to be
   boring. Such familiar phenomena are symptoms of a widespread, largely
   unconscious methodological habit of focusing on topics rather than
   problems. This habit rests on views about knowledge that are deeply
   ingrained in commonsense knowledge and in the methodology of mainstream
   social science. Such views saturate the understanding of scientific
   inquiry assumed by most methods textbooks. This article criticizes the
   method of topics and contrasts it with the method of problems. The word
   ``topic{''} suggests that there is some surface to cover, but not why
   covering it might be interesting. Interesting research is
   problem-driven. It begins with a sense that something is amiss with
   existing knowledge and requires explanation. Problem-driven research
   begins, not with collection of data or facts, or with clarification of
   concepts, but with identification of inconsistencies or gaps in existing
   knowledge. It seeks to solve problems through free invention and severe
   criticism of hypotheses.},

Title = {Racial Orders, Congress, and the Agricultural Welfare State, 1865-1940},
Journal = {STUDIES IN AMERICAN POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT},

Abstract = {One of the key questions posed by analysts of modern, twentieth-century
   agricultural politics 7:5, ``How and when did agrarian democracy end and
   the dominance of agribusiness interests begin?{''} In this article 1
   argue that the roots of this transformation lie in the origins of the
   agricultural welfare state and the overlapping of its birth with
   distinct eras in America's racial orders-those moments in time when
   political players mobilized coalitions and institutions around racial
   issues such as slavery, Reconstruction, or the segregated state of the
   Jim Crow order As a result of these historical overlaps, the
   agricultural welfare state was shaped in surprising and
   not-well-understood ways by America's racial orders. In order to trace
   these two intertwining aspects of racial governance and agricultural
   welfare state development, I provide a reinterpretation of the
   development of the agricultural welfare state from its Civil War origins
   to its New Deal transformation. I show that, from 1865 to 1964, the
   confluence of racial orders, partisan alignments, and congressional
   orders created an agricultural welfare state in which African Americans
   were variously included and excluded in a pattern of ``two-tier{''}
   citizenship. The broader racial governance aims of the Jim Crow order
   also had a significant role in shaping the development of the
   organizational ethos and administrative structures and practices within
   the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). The practice of
   ``two-tier{''} agricultural citizenship, which initially affected only
   African American and other minority farmers, was gradually extended to
   reflect the divide between large commercial farmers and the rural poor
   (including small farmers). The results from this analysis strengthen our
   understanding of how the American welfare state has been shaped-in
   particular, the ways in which racial governance and racial orders are
   deeply embedded in the American state building process.},

   Negative Campaigning on Voter Turnout},

Abstract = {Do negative campaign advertisements affect voter turnout? Existing
   literature on this topic has produced conflicting empirical results.
   Some scholars show that negativity is demobilizing. Others show that
   negativity is mobilizing. Still others show that negativity has no
   effect on turnout. Relying on the psychology of decision making, this
   research argues and shows that this empirical stalemate is due to the
   fact that existing work ignores a crucial factor: the timing of exposure
   to negativity. Two independent empirical tests trace the conditional
   effect of negativity. The first test relies on data from the 2004
   presidential campaign. The second test considers the effect of
   negativity over a broader period of time by considering elections 1976
   to 2000. Taken together, both tests reinforce that negativity can only
   demobilize when two conditions are met: (1) a person is exposed to
   negativity after selecting a preferred candidate and (2) the negativity
   is about this selected candidate.},

Abstract = {The development of the pattern of territorial organization established
   in the Spanish Constitution of 1978 creates non-statewide institutions
   with legislative powers, and regional elections are held in order to
   choose non-national deputies. Turnout in these contests is usually lower
   than the one registered in the national congressional elections. The
   paper argues that some special groups of voters are particularly prone
   to vote in national but not in regional elections. This phenomenon, that
   is called differential turnout, is studied in the 2005 Basque Country
   and 2006 Catalonia regional elections. Econometric models show a
   relationship between voters' judgements on the performance of the
   regional incumbent and the quality of non-national candidates, on one
   side, and the propensity of differential turnout, on the other.},

Abstract = {Scholars have shown that diversity depresses public goods provision. In
   U.S. cities, racial and ethnic divisions could seriously undermine
   investment. However, diverse cities spend significant amounts on public
   goods. We ask how these communities overcome their potential collective
   action problem. Using a new data set on more than 3,000 municipal bond
   elections, we show that strategic politicians encourage cooperation.
   Diversity leads officials to be more selective about requesting approval
   for investment and more attentive to coalition building. We show that
   diverse communities see fewer bond elections, but that the bonds
   proposed are larger and pass at higher rates. Diverse cities tend to
   offer voters bonds with more spending categories and are more likely to
   hold referenda during general elections. As a result, diverse cities do
   just as well as homogenous cities in issuing voter-authorized debt.
   Thus, political elites perform an important mediating function in the
   generation of public goods.},

Abstract = {The current defence doctrine in Finland is analysed from a cyber
   perspective, and doctrinal tenets that adapt to the cyber domain as well
   as fundaments that do not, are pointed out. In most cases, current
   defence doctrine and fundaments can be adjusted to cyber domain. Some
   need more research and planning, but also new legislation and
   organisational arrangements would be needed. As such, a cyber defence
   doctrine has a sound basis but should be elaborated in more detail once
   national cyber security strategy has been completed.},

Abstract = {According to the cultural literature, societies are composed from many
   different culturally dissimilar countries (Hofstede, 2001; House et al.,
   2004). Geert Hof stede is one of many researchers who had developed a
   method to measure national culture. His research on national culture has
   had a great impact on how we understand and measure different culture
   differences. The purpose of this research is to investigate the
   characteristics of Icelandic national culture and compare with Bearden
   et. al. (2006) findings, where data was used from university students
   from four countries, Argentina, Austria, Japan and USA. In this study
   undergraduate students from the school of Social Science at the
   University of Iceland were asked to answer a questionnaire (VSM 94) and
   a total of 427 responses were usable with the response rate of 15\%.
   According to the results, Icelandic national culture can be
   characterized by low power distance (PDI), high individualism (IDV), low
   masculinity (MAS), high uncertainty-avoidance (UAI) and average
   long-term orientation (LTO).},

Abstract = {Since 1994 when Tanzania held its first multiparty local government
   elections following the reintroduction of multiparty politics in 1992,
   corruption has been in a surge. There is a growing concern from civil
   society organizations, the media and the general public over an
   excessive use of money and other resources to influence the voters. With
   the money dictating the conduct of electoral processes, weak or poor
   candidates and parties have been risking their chance of being elected
   as they cannot compete with their affluent counterparts. In spite of the
   introduction of some anti-corruption measures in the country, there is
   yet no any glimpse of hopes for a breakthrough. Even with the
   introduction of Election Expenses Act of 2010, there are still a million
   miles away before corruption can be effectively dealt with. The main
   implementation challenge to anti-corruption initiatives is the fact that
   the war against corruption in Tanzania is led by the commanders who are
   conscience objectors.},

Abstract = {EU's policies towards neighbouring countries and subregions are often
   blamed for their ineffectiveness. This article explores the sources and
   dynamics of the Union's leverage. Surveying the literature on eastern
   enlargement and the European Neighbourhood Policy, it draws on IR
   conceptual apparatus to distinguish two modes of interaction between the
   EU and its neighbours - gatekeeping and power projection. Its core claim
   is that the former mode is central to the Union's influence in `near
   abroads', including parts of the former Soviet Union and the Western
   Balkans. Comparative European Politics (2011) 9, 414 431.

Abstract = {Why is Turkey's approach to EU's European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) and
   the Union for the Mediterranean (UfM) more cautious now after a period
   of active cooperation in their shared neighbourhood? I-low can such
   reversal he explained despite parallels in the interests of the EU and
   Turkey in their shared neighbourhood and complementarities in their
   policy instruments used to advance these interests? This article
   evaluates the explanatory power of rational choice, sociological and
   historical institutionalism in comparative politics in addressing these
   questions. On the basis of qualitative case study evidence including
   interviews with key stakeholders, it concludes that historical
   institutionalism, with its emphasis on context, interaction and
   temporality, is better equipped than rational choice and sociological
   institutionalisms at accounting for Turkey's changing foreign policy
   choices concerning the ENP and the UfM. Comparative European Politics

Abstract = {This article examines the 2010 Labour leadership contest, seeking to
   explain why Ed Miliband narrowly defeated his brother, and erstwhile
   favourite, David. The article places this contest in the context of
   previous Labour leadership contests, and also the historical development
   of the often controversial electoral college which, on this occasion,
   meant that the first preferences of the Party's parliamentarians were
   outweighed by the votes of affiliated bodies, most notably the trade
   unions. Crucially, though, we argue that while undeniably important, the
   role of the trade unions in ensuring Ed Miliband's victory has been
   somewhat exaggerated by his political and media opponents. His success
   over his brother was also due to the fact that he attracted enough
   second preference votes cast by MPs/ Members of the European Parliament
   (MEPs) and members of the constituency Labour parties (CLPs) to increase
   his share of overall support in the electoral college. David Miliband
   remained more popular than his brother among Labour parliamentarians and
   CLPs, but Ed Miliband reduced his brother's lead sufficiently over four
   rounds to ensure that when added to his share of the votes of individual
   trade union levy-payers, he secured a narrow victory over David
   Miliband. The votes of the latter were crucial to Ed Miliband, and
   ultimately decisive, but would still not have been sufficient to secure
   victory had he not also increased his support, via second preference
   votes, among Labour MPs/MEPs and CLP members. British Politics (2011) 6,

Abstract = {The present article discusses the evolution of the European Union (EU)
   sanctions imposed in response to authoritarianism in Belarus in an
   attempt to ascertain the impact of these measures on the limited
   rapprochement that took place in the period 2008-2010. It is argued that
   despite the mostly non-economic character of the measures levied by the
   EU, the Belarusian steps towards compliance were motivated by economic
   rationales. The EU's responsiveness to these measures reveals its nature
   as an accommodating negotiator of its own sanctions regimes. Comparative

Abstract = {The lack of a credible membership promise and a re-invigorated Russia
   have transformed the environment in which the European Union (EU) seeks
   to bolster its external policy in Central Eastern Europe. Examining
   Moldova, a country with concurrent commitments to creating strong bonds
   with the EU and Russia, the article analyses the challenges and
   opportunities to `Europeanize' the EU's Eastern neighbourhood. It shows
   that the effects of Europeanization do not solely depend on the
   incentives offered by Brussels, but significantly on the willingness of
   the elite and population to adopt these concepts and on external
   factors, such as the politics of Russia. Comparative European Politics

Volume = {11},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {Many theories of policy diffusion contend that the flow of information
   is the driving force in the diffusion process. Prior scholarship has
   identified at least two types of information: information about policy
   and information about political viability. Few empirical approaches have
   been able to distinguish between these separate mechanisms. The authors
   argue that an analysis of policy proposals can untangle political
   information from policy-based information. They employ their strategy
   with data on the proposal of tax and expenditure limits (TELs) in the U.
   S. states since 1970 through direct democracy. The authors find that
   states in close geographic proximity to states that have rejected TELs
   are significantly less likely to propose TELs themselves. Since this
   event does not reveal information about policy effectiveness, the
   authors conclude that information about political viability
   systematically diffuses from state to state at the proposal stage of
   policy making.},

Abstract = {To what extent did the extensive flooding caused by Hurricane Katrina
   affect voter participation in the 2006 mayoral election? This article
   uses voting record data from 20 election cycles, GIS-coded flood-depth
   data, and census data to examine the voting behavior of registered
   voters in New Orleans before and after Hurricane Katrina. We use a
   variety of statistical techniques, primarily propensity score matching
   methods, to examine how flooding affected mayoral turnout. We find that
   flooding decreased participation, but registered voters who experienced
   more than 6 ft of flooding were more likely to participate in the
   election than those who experienced less flooding. This finding confirms
   that increasing the cost of voting decreases turnout and suggests
   several mechanisms motivating an expressive component of voting
   behavior. Our results indicate there is a complex relationship between
   participation and the costs and benefits of turnout. Our findings about
   the characteristics of the voters who participated in the mayoral
   election provide insights into the scope of change for the political
   landscape of New Orleans.},

Abstract = {There has been significant scholarly research on judicial decision
   making and bureaucratic control but little research on bureaucrats who
   perform a judicial function, namely, administrative law judges. In this
   article, we analyze the influences on the decisions of administrative
   law judges (ALJs) from 1991 to 2006. Using ordered logit, we examine the
   influence of policy preference and hierarchical and political
   constraint. We find that ALJs are comparable to Federal District Court
   judges in that they use ideology in their rulings, are also subject to
   hierarchical control by higher courts, and that they are constrained by
   separation of powers influences.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes some of the basic forms in which the modern
   Nicaragua literature has conceived the Caribbean region, traditionally
   marginalized by the national discourses. Through the comparison of
   essays and narratives by three canonical authors, it establishes
   different views about the << otherness >> of the Caribbean. Firstly, in
   Jose Coronel Urtecho's texts, the Caribbean is portrayed as the place of
   the paradisiacal and pre-civilized. In second place, in Lizandro Chavez
   Alfaro's short stories, the Caribbean is a location of authentic but
   abject cultural production, an aspect related to the neocolonial status
   of the region. Thirdly, in a recent essay by Sergio Ramirez, the
   Caribbean is visualized as the source of a new mestizaje, one that suits
   the era of globalization. In these three examples, literature works
   inside the national discourse taking as basis some colonial marks such
   as the project of civilization, the paradisiacal space, the view of the
   travelogue, the propaganda of mestizaje, and the abjection of the
   native. These elements are located inside of the dominant mestizaje or
   in transcultural and contesting projects as Chavez Alfaro's.},

Abstract = {While the United States is an important Asia-Pacific actor, its
   engagement with the region is complex and often difficult. Not only must
   US regionalism balance the diverse requirements of an ambitious policy
   agenda, but also US policy norms and priorities often clash with those
   of other regional actors. This has important implications for the
   capacity of the United States to provide regional leadership. Recent
   years have seen growing policy convergence between the United States and
   other Asia-Pacific actors, particularly in economic terms, but US
   regionalism continues to feature competition alongside collaboration.},

Abstract = {Latino voters comprise a growing segment of the voting electorate, yet
   their levels of participation in elections lags behind the general
   population and even other ethnic and racial groups. Recent experimental
   studies have found mobilization efforts directed at the Latino
   electorate to boost electoral turnout in federal, state, and local
   elections. Over the past two decades, campaign organizations and
   operatives have been increasingly relying on the use of Spanish-language
   appeals to mobilize Latinos. Surprisingly, the impact of language use in
   targeting Latino voters has, for the most part, eluded scholarly
   inquiry. We conduct a randomized field experiment in which Latino voters
   were randomly exposed to a mobilization message in either English or
   Spanish. It is, to the best of our knowledge, the first randomized
   experiment to present a direct test between English- and
   Spanish-language appeals. The experiment was conducted in the context of
   a special election that took place in February 2009 to fill a vacancy on
   the New York City Council for District 21, located in Queens. The
   results from our field experiment suggest that both Spanish- and
   English-language mobilization have the capacity to boost Latino turnout.
   That said, English-language appeals were effective across the board for
   Latinos in our sample, whereas Spanish-language outreach was only
   effective among low-propensity voters and participants whose primary
   language was Spanish.},

Abstract = {Corruption has become a key concern throughout the world. Most of what
   is known about corruption comes from instances in which misdeeds become
   public, generating a scandal. Why do some acts of corruption become
   scandals and others do not? Corruption scandals are not triggered by
   corruption, but rather are initially caused by dynamics of political
   competition within government. Insiders leak information on misdeeds in
   order to gain power within the coalition or party in power. A powerful
   opposition, contrary to common belief, acts as a constraint for
   insiders, making corruption scandals less likely. These arguments are
   evaluated using empirical evidence from Argentina and Chile (1989-2008).
   The findings support the notion that corruption scandals emerge as a
   consequence of political competition.},

   problematic of primitive accumulation within the context of the
   constitution of capitalist wage labor. In this context, Mezzadra warns
   against romanticizing subaltern agency. This reflection takes his
   insights further, and suggests that we can deploy his interventions on
   the relationship between translation and abstraction to rethink the

Abstract = {This article is concerned with what determines a government's choice of
   pension reform. It starts from an argument by Myles and Pierson that
   claims that the newer pension systems are able to privatize whereas the
   older, matured systems faced with the double payment problem tend to
   adopt notional defined contributions (NDC) accounts. This argument is
   retested with in-depth qualitative analysis of the pension reforms in
   Latvia and Poland. The analysis brings three main contributions. First,
   it shows that within the matured camp the double payment problem is
   visible at different degrees. The systems with little visibility,
   although mature, can still privatize. Second, it shows that the NDC
   option is fit to deal with more urgent fiscal problems, whereas the
   privatization option is fit for long-term demographic problems. Third,
   the analysis finds that the two options in Myles and Pierson's argument
   can be used by governments symbiotically.},

Abstract = {In November 2009, the Slovenian government implemented a new
   participatory tool called ``Predlagam vladi{''} ({''}I propose to the
   government{''}) in order to include citizens in the governmental policy
   process, which aimed to increase active citizen participation and
   connect citizens and civil society with the government. At a declarative
   level of the proponent (the government), the use of this e-tool promotes
   inclusion, openness, accessibility, and deliberative communication.
   Although the web portal received almost no publicity in the mass media,
   citizens largely grasped the new opportunity for broader access to the
   policy process. This study focuses mainly on the deliberative character
   of the governmental portal on three specific levels: structure and
   architecture, openness to citizens, and concrete proposals and comments.
   By critically evaluating deliberative communication and the role of new
   media in such practical projects, the authors explain how these new
   opportunities are limited and, by debating deliberation and public
   sphere, determine important obstacles that prevent such projects from
   being deliberately effective.},

Abstract = {We analyze the first large-scale, randomized experiment to measure
   presidential approval levels at all outcomes of a canonical
   international crisis-bargaining model, thereby avoiding problems of
   strategic selection in evaluating presidential incentives. We find
   support for several assumptions made in the crisis-bargaining
   literature, including that a concession from a foreign state leads to
   higher approval levels than other outcomes, that the magnitudes of
   audience costs are under presidential control prior to the initiation of
   hostilities, and that these costs can be made so large that presidents
   have incentive to fight wars they will not win. Thus, the credibility of
   democratic threats can be made extremely high. We also find, however,
   that partisan cues strongly condition presidential incentives. Party
   elites have incentives to behave according to type in Congress and
   contrary to type in the Oval Office, and Democratic presidents sometimes
   have incentives to fight wars they will not win.},

Abstract = {Across Western Europe, parties have emerged that are both right wing and
   in favour of restrictions on immigration. These parties are commonly
   referred to in terms of either ideology (e.g. `far right') or policy
   ('anti-immigration'). This article compares far right parties, selected
   on the basis of their ideologies, and anti-immigration parties, selected
   based on their immigration policies. I argue and empirically demonstrate
   that, contrary to what the extant literature suggests, these sets of
   parties are not identical. I point out similarities and differences,
   showing why it is useful to distinguish between these two types of
   party. The article concludes by discussing the relevance of these
   differences to the relevant literature.},

Abstract = {Ever see a problem on the news and realize that you have a solution
   buried on your hard drive, or tucked away in a research journal in a
   library corner? Ever wonder what it would be like if you-the eminent
   political scientist-were in charge of making policy decisions? Or, ever
   try to get information out of the government or an interview with a
   politician? Consider joining the Practicing Politics Working Group, a
   newly formed division of the American Political Science Association,
   your personal consulting agency. Look out at the APSA 2011 conference
   where we are co-sponsoring panels on: Modern Diplomacy (with Foreign
   Policy); The Federal Budget (with Public Administration); Technology and
   Development (with Information Technology and Politics); and Bilateral
   Trade (with International Political Economy).},

Title = {The politics of protest in newspaper campaigns: Dissent, populism and
   the rhetoric of authenticity},
Journal = {BRITISH POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {6},
Number = {2},
Pages = {128-154},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Newspaper campaigns embody newspapers' most emphatic claims to speak for
   `the people', and as such are generally regarded as populist. However,
   they can be oppositional, engaging in dissent of one sort or another,
   and often assume a certain amount of political engagement with that
   dissent on the part of the audience. This article examines the potential
   of newspaper campaigns to facilitate the political engagement of
   citizens through the politics of protest. It draws on qualitative
   content analysis of seven campaigns that ran in the Scottish press
   between 2000 and 2005, and semi-structured interviews with relevant
   journalists. The distinction between legitimate protest and manipulative
   populism is made in terms of: (a) the rhetoric and strategies of
   political representation, participation and influence and (b) the
   construction of political legitimacy in terms of the public interest and
   the moral authority of the `victim'. It is argued that populist impulses
   dominate, driving a tendency to use discourses of emotional authenticity
   and offence to legitimise demands for a plebiscitary response to popular
   or `victim' preference and to close down controversy and debate, with
   the principle objective of marketing the newspaper as an influential
   community champion. British Politics (2011) 6, 128-154.

Abstract = {How do presidents win legislative support under conditions of extreme
   multipartism? Comparative presidential research has offered two parallel
   answers, one relying on distributive politics and the other claiming
   that legislative success is a function of coalition formation. The
   authors merge these insights in an integrated approach to
   executive-legislative relations while also considering dynamism and
   particular bargaining contexts. The authors find that the two
   presidential ``tools{''}a{''}pork and coalition goods-function as
   imperfect substitutes. Coalition goods establish an exchange baseline,
   while pork covers the ongoing costs of operation. Pork expenditures also
   depend upon a president's bargaining leverage and the distribution of
   legislative seats.},

Abstract = {Throughout the first seven months of the Arab Spring starting with the
   self-immolation of Mohammed Bouazizi in the Tunisian town of Sidi Bouzid
   on December 17, 2010, the EU clearly revealed itself as both an actor
   and spectator by resorting to both activism and passivism in a seemingly
   erratic fashion. Against this background and based on the EU's recently
   adopted Partnership for Democracy and Shared Prosperity with the
   Southern Mediterranean, this article aims at understanding this dualism
   more precisely and shedding some light on the EU's rather anachronistic
   foreign policy behavior in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) in
   recent months. The article identifies five dichotomies, all of which
   contribute to the situation in which the EU continues to be torn between
   being a relevant political actor in the MENA region and a simple
   spectator that continues to be overwhelmed by local and regional
   political developments.},

Abstract = {Critics traditionally portray state Supreme Court elections as
   low-information events that fail to accomplish the stated goal of
   engendering accountability to the public. Recent changes in the
   intensity of contestable judicial elections have led scholars to
   consider the effect of public opinion on state court decision making. We
   delineate necessary conditions for judicial responsiveness to public
   opinion, integrating research on state court decision making with the
   broader literature on representation. We then empirically test our
   framework for judicial responsiveness. Our findings suggest that the
   strength of the electoral connection between state supreme court
   justices and their constituents is quite dependent on method of judicial
   retention and the visibility of the case.},

Abstract = {There was a great deal of fear in Germany when the labour market for the
   new EU countries was opened. Developments since 2004 show that migration
   from Poland to those EU countries that opened their labour markets first
   differs from ``traditional{''} labour migration. The migrants are
   predominantly young, well-educated Poles who often settle abroad only
   temporarily. Such an influx is economically beneficial to the countries
   affected. German reluctance to open up its labour market could prove to
   be counterproductive. A high migration of Polish skilled workers to
   Germany is hardly to be expected.},

Title = {Comportment, not cognition: Contributions to a phenomenology of judgment},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {10},
Number = {2},
Pages = {232-254},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Current theoretical account of judgment has a difficult time saying
   anything positive about the experience of judging and, when they do
   offer positive accounts, they seem to overlook much that we know about
   the capacity already in our daily lives. Following the work of Martin
   Heidegger and Hubert Dreyfus, this article provides a phenomenological
   consideration of the structure of judging that considers judgment not as
   an intellectual act, but as a comportment. The article proceeds in two
   parts. The first offers a brief consideration of the assumptions of
   intellectualist accounts and shows why, ultimately, they may be unable
   to bring judging into focus. The second section offers a
   phenomenological account of judging. The argument of section two is that
   deliberate judgment (the subject of intellectualist accounts) is a
   continuation of the structure of judgment understood as comportment and,
   in turn, that intellectualist accounts come onto the scene too late.

Abstract = {As the Web has expanded in its use and utility it has fundamentally
   changed the way in which individuals gather and use information. This
   paper suggests that those changes give rise to tangible and significant
   effects in the impressions people form of others using Web-based
   information. This study explores the impacts of perceiver gender, target
   gender, and social networking presence on subjects' perceptions of
   potential teammates other-wise unknown to them as revealed by ratings
   they assign based only on search engine results. Experiments reveal
   differences in how male and female perceivers view others' social
   networking activity in general and suggest that how the perceiver gender
   matches, or differs, from the gender of the target affects how social
   networking presence plays into impression formation. Findings hold
   implications for professionals, academics and individuals concerned with
   the role that Web-based information plays in impression formation and
   how inherent gender-based biases may affect power and politics in the
   workplace and beyond.},

Abstract = {A power transition period in North Korea, following the hypothetical
   collapse of the regime of Kim Jong Il, is very likely to promote sudden
   insurgencies in a similarway as the Iraq and Afghanistan insurgencies.
   In such a scenario, how should the Republic of Korea's (ROK)
   counterinsurgency (COIN) forces deal with the inevitable mission ahead?
   Historically, the ROK's COIN forces achieved remarkable successes in
   Vietnam and Iraq, using ``hard{''} and ``soft{''} approaches. The
   interplay among four actors-the COIN forces, the domestic public in
   South Korea, the insurgents, and the local population of the
   insurgency-affected country-explains how ROK's armed forces as a middle
   power military achieved tactical successes there. It offers an insight
   into planning for a strategic success in potential North Korean
   insurgencies. The findings show that an approach characterized by
   initial soft remedies, followed by hard remedies, will be effective
   under a flexible-type military organization.},

Pages = {33-55},

Abstract = {Both general publics and elites have long used labels of left and right
   as cues for political communication and vote choice in Western
   democracies. This study examines the utility of these spatial semantics
   as means of encapsulating major political cleavages in East Asian
   democracies. Through analysis of public opinion surveys, we investigate
   the influence of organizational affiliation; views on socio-economic,
   religious, and `new politics' issues, as well as attitudes toward the
   political system, as anchors of public understanding of the left-right
   dimension in Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, and Taiwan. Patterns
   found in these countries are compared with two `Western' nations in the
   region, Australia and New Zealand. Results show that citizens'
   left-right positions in Japan and the Australasian countries are more
   clearly structured by well-defined cleavages, such as socio-economic
   issues and post-materialism, and that parties in these countries compete
   on the basis of clearer ideological profiles. In contrast, despite high
   rates of cognition of the left-right scale in South Korea, the
   Philippines, and Taiwan, left-right orientations are less firmly
   anchored in attitudes and policy preferences. These differences in
   publics' level of ideological conceptualization are likely related to
   party system development and democratic experience.},

Abstract = {Competitive political elites frequently offer conflicting,
   irreconcilable accounts of policy-relevant information. This presents a
   problem for members of the public who lack the skill, time, and
   attention to become experts on every complicated policy question that
   might arise. To analyze problems like these, this article presents a
   formal theory of political communication with competitive senders who
   have privately known preferences. In equilibrium, senders can jam
   messages from their opponents; that is, they can send messages designed
   to leave receivers uncertain about who has sent a truthful message. The
   article identifies differences between jamming and existing theories,
   reports empirical predictions, and discusses substantive implications
   for the politics of representation, the judiciary, and expertise.},

Abstract = {Donoso Cortes was a 19(th)-century Spanish political thinker deeply
   influenced by the Saboyan De Maistre. Both shared the need to construct
   an alternative narrative to the one provided by the French philosophes
   whose ideas were so important to the French revolution. Both started
   with Christian doctrine as the core of their thought. And both
   considered themselves interpreters of a message that humankind is unable
   to understand: that everything is pre-determined; that human acts are
   dictated by Providence; that the Pope is the only true representative of
   that Providence, and that Enlightenment ideals are universal destroyers
   of social and political cohesion. All revolutions are reduced to
   irreverent dreams of human pride.},

Abstract = {Jean-Claude Paye, Tulay Umay, Wikileaks: a virtual opposition ?
   The Wikileaks affair exposes an imperial political structure that not
   only erases any distinction between inside and outside, between policing
   and waging war, but cannot acknowledge any opposition either. Wikileaks
   illustrates a dissidence constructed by US institutions so as to prevent
   any capacity to set up any actual opposition. A secondary benefit of the
   operation is that it also provides US authorities with an opportunity to
   increase their control on the Internet.},

Abstract = {The former German Federal President Horst Kohler stimulated a debate on
   the direct election of the German Head of State. However, a vast
   political majority rejected the President's proposal by arguing that a
   more solid foundation of legitimacy would require more presidential
   powers. The article focuses on the issue of whether this theoretically
   derived or normatively justified correlation can be substantiated
   empirically in comparative perspective: Is there or in how far is there
   a positive relationship between the foundation of legitimacy and the
   powers of the heads of state in parliamentary systems? The article
   provides a comparative analysis of the heads of state in all
   parliamentary systems in the European Union. It concludes that the
   supposed correlation exists in some instances.},

Abstract = {Capital accumulation is the essence of production in capitalist society.
   Consequently, corporations are constantly driven and workers exhorted to
   increase productivity in the interest of raising profits. Economic
   slumps and recessions are used as reasons to argue that there is a
   productivity crisis and push for increasing productivity at the expense
   of wages, benefits and social programming, as we see with the post-2007
   Great Recession. This essay discusses these trends, theoretical and
   ideological arguments, and the need for a socialist alternative to the
   never-ending push to increase productivity for capital accumulation at
   the expense of workers' rights and social welfare.},

Abstract = {This study analyzes public opinion data on would-be first ladies during
   the presidential campaign season from 1992 to 2008. By comparing
   attitudes toward would-be first ladies over the last five presidential
   cycles, we identify key areas of stability and change in Americans'
   attitudes toward these individuals. Additionally, survey data are used
   to explore how attitudes about these women differ across key
   demographics, to identify factors that shape the public's attitudes
   concerning presidential candidates' wives, and to explore the impact of
   these women on their husbands' favorability ratings. The results
   indicate that spouses who embody the traditional role of first lady tend
   to be more popular, while spouses who assume an active role in
   advocating policy, such as Hillary Clinton, garner less support. Most
   candidate spouses generate highly polarized reactions along partisan
   lines, although more traditional spouses evoke a less divisive response.},

Volume = {30},

Abstract = {Researchers have paid little attention to the way citizens evaluate
   different electoral systems. This reflects the limited knowledge
   citizens are presumed to have about alternative electoral arrangements.
   However, the establishment of a legislature under new electoral rules
   creates conditions in which citizens can make more informed judgements.
   Such a situation occurred with the establishment of the Scottish
   Parliament in 1999, elected under the Additional Member system. Using
   data collected in 1999 and 2003, we consider Scottish voters' reactions
   to the new electoral rules. We examine how voters evaluated various
   features and outcomes of the rules, the structure of voters' attitudes,
   and which features and outcomes of the rules were decisive in shaping
   overall support for plurality and proportional voting systems. (C) 2011

Abstract = {Studying historical and archeological records shows us that most of the
   nations have built places for worshipping based on their own religious
   beliefs. Ka'abe is introduced as the first place for worshiping the
   Unique God of the Koran. The mosque was built by Muslims based on the
   Holy Prophet's order for worshiping the Unique God. Contrary to other
   temples or worship places during the history, mosque was not built only
   for worshiping and holding religious ceremonies, but for achieving many
   other purposes in the Islamic society too. This article is going to
   elaborate on these purposes.},

Abstract = {The United States has more immigrants than at any time since the 1920s
   and immigration rates remain high. Past research unequivocally predicts
   that the resulting increase in ethnic and racial diversity will reduce
   local investments in public goods. By analyzing a new, comprehensive
   data set on U.S. cities from 1950 to 2002, this article challenges those
   predictions. In the 1950s and early 1960s, the percent Black had no
   strong impacts on local public goods. Since the 1970s, the impact of
   diversity has been limited chiefly to criminal justice, an issue that
   has remained racially coded, nationally salient, and relevant to
   localities. Contrary to past work, diversity's influence on local public
   goods is neither pervasive nor consistent. These findings challenge
   static conceptions of local ethnic and racial divisions, and they
   suggest a connection between diversity's local impacts and trends in
   national politics.},

Abstract = {Having rebuilt radically in the global city concept since 90's, Istanbul
   have experienced a dramatic transformation which caused some important
   results also in terms of the labour. The diminishing of labour refers to
   the being invisible of labour in social-, historical and spatial
   texture; removing it out of city, its invisibility in city's historical
   memory, losing of its own public sphere, living spaces and production
   areas. It also refers to the deepening of its alienation regarding the
   urban area that created by labour itself. In the essay, this process
   defined ``diminishing of labour{''} has been described in its historical
   context and pointed out its resistance aspects.},

Abstract = {Qualitative accounts of Japanese party politics allude to the standard
   left-right spectrum, but they invariably devote much more space to
   discussions of foreign policy differences than to socioeconomic
   conflict. Quantitative estimates of Japanese party positions treat short
   party responses to newspaper interviews as if they were true manifestos,
   and fail both to confirm the claims of the qualitative literature and to
   demonstrate any consistent basis for party differentiation at all. We
   address both puzzles by applying a text scaling algorithm to electoral
   pledges to estimate Japanese party positions on three major policy
   dimensions. Our analysis largely confirms the findings of the
   qualitative literature, but also offers new insights about party
   movement and polarization over time. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {The challenge of cyber-threats is a modern reality from which no state,
   including Iceland, can hope to escape. Cyber-attacks can cause major
   damage remotely, at minimal cost and while concealing the culprits.
   Groups and individuals can carry them out as effectively as states,
   reversing traditional power calculations and making deterrence
   especially difficult. Individuals can use the Net both for mischief and
   to escape from authoritarian controls; groups such as terrorists and
   criminals can target states, commerce and individuals; and states can
   attack other states both directly and by proxy. The complexity of
   possible online conflicts was seen clearly in the events triggered by
   Wikileaks disclosures against the USA in 2010 and 2011. Among other
   recent developments, an attack on the Pentagon and the `Stuxnet' virus
   used against Iranian nuclear plants have shown how even the smallest
   devices can penetrate high-security systems, and that computer-driven
   infrastructures are no longer immune. Iceland, for its part,
   acknowledged the relevance of cyber-threats in its 2009 risk assessment,
   and recently decided to set up a coordinating team for protection; but
   it has lagged behind its Nordic neighbours in this field and should take
   full advantage of cooperation with them now. Vulnerable states also have
   an interest in international regulation and restraint on the use of
   cyber-weapons, but the context for this is complex and viable proposals
   are slow to emerge. Iceland can and should contribute to new thinking,
   and perhaps also assist poorer states: but it needs to put its own house
   in order first.},

Volume = {9},

Abstract = {This article brings together the literature on European Union
   conditionality and transnational NGO advocacy by considering the
   fundamental role non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have played in
   the EU's efforts to bring about reforms in countries working to join the
   organization. Based in part on interviews in Romania, the Czech Republic
   and Brussels, and focusing on the case of anti-discrimination and the
   Roma (Gypsies), I consider both how the EU helped NGOs achieve their
   objectives and how NGOs influenced the creation and effect of EU
   requirements on candidate countries from Central and Eastern Europe (now
   new Member States). While problems for the Roma have certainly not
   disappeared, one cannot fully appreciate the development of either
   advocacy or conditionality regarding the Roma without considering the
   mutual dependence of NGOs and the EU. The NGO role is frequently
   disregarded in the top-down EU accession process, but I find that
   neither NGOs nor the EU would have been successful at advancing or
   sustaining domestic change on their own. Comparative European Politics

Abstract = {Defence cooperation between Western European countries has increased
   considerably since the end of the Cold War. An analytical distinction
   can be made between political and economic cooperation, the latter
   having been neglected by political scientists. This study advances the
   debate on economic cooperation by identifying sources of variation in
   the European Union (EU)-15 countries' membership rate in cooperative
   armaments fora aimed at restructuring the demand side of European
   defence from 1996 to 2006. By combining six models from three different
   schools of thought, the risk of confirmation bias through
   intra-paradigmatic reasoning is reduced. At the same time, fuzzy-set
   analysis opens up the space for data-driven combination effects. Two
   distinct combinations form sufficient paths leading to high rates of
   membership. Most importantly, intentions to create collective defence
   technological and industrial benefits combine with trust in partners'
   ability and integrity to form an essential combination of conditions for
   governments to pursue cooperation on armaments.},

Abstract = {In order to overcome financial crisis, it is an international tendency
   to have the shift from a traditional government to local governance.
   Tony Blair's New Labour Party came to power in 1997 committed to
   modernise a local government system to local governance via launching
   series of long-term action plans. This paper attempts to discuss the
   institutional transformation and the key policy in the government's
   modernisational agenda for local government, i.e. the local strategic
   partnerships (LSPs). Moreover, the most important aim of this paper is
   to explore three neglected disadvantages of local governance. However,
   the local governance mechanism is by no means always a positive
   experience and a double-sided knife. On the one hand, the advantage is
   the flexibility and efficiency in service delivery and participation; on
   the other hand, there is the possibility of an increase in collaborative
   cost, unbalanced power relationship between these agencies and
   fragmented accountability.},

Abstract = {Could changing the locations of polling places affect the outcome of an
   election by increasing the costs of voting for some and decreasing them
   for others? The consolidation of voting precincts in Los Angeles County
   during California's 2003 gubernatorial recall election provides a
   natural experiment for studying how changing polling places influences
   voter turnout. Overall turnout decreased by a substantial 1.85
   percentage points: A drop in polling place turnout of 3.03 percentage
   points was partially offset by an increase in absentee voting of 1.18
   percentage points. Both transportation and search costs caused these
   changes. Although there is no evidence that the Los Angeles Registrar of
   Voters changed more polling locations for those registered with one
   party than for those registered with another, the changing of polling
   places still had a small partisan effect because those registered as
   Democrats were more sensitive to changes in costs than those registered
   as Republicans. The effects were small enough to allay worries about
   significant electoral consequences in this instance (e.g., the partisan
   effect might be decisive in only about one in two hundred contested
   House elections), but large enough to make it possible for someone to
   affect outcomes by more extensive manipulation of polling place
   locations.},

Journal = {AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {46},

Pages = {71-86},
Abstract = {This paper examines two different bill of rights models for Australia:
   the Dialogue model and a Democratic model. The Dialogue model aims to
   protect rights through a bill of rights, strong political review
   mechanisms, intergovernmental dialogue, and rights-based judicial
   review. The paper argues that, despite its popularity, there are serious
   problems with the legitimacy and effectiveness of the Dialogue model and
   it outlines an alternative model, a `democratic bill of rights', which
   attempts to avoid these problems by strengthening democratic
   institutions and political review mechanisms without adopting
   rights-based judicial review. The paper concludes that a democratic bill
   of rights is likely to be an effective and more democratically
   legitimate way of protecting and promoting human rights in Australia.},

   consciousness by the battles of the Second World War. Nevertheless,
   Waterloo remains a significant milestone in world history, for it
   assured the dominance, for better or worse, of a European model of
   liberal capitalism.},

Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {15},
Number = {6-7},
Pages = {769-798},
Abstract = {Dual/multiple citizenship has become a widespread phenomenon in many
   parts of the world. This acceptance or tolerance of overlapping
   memberships in political communities represents an important element in
   the ongoing readjustment of the relationship between citizens and
   political communities in democratic systems. This article has two goals
   and parts. First, it evaluates dual citizenship from the perspective of
   five normative theories of democracy. Liberal and republican as well as
   multicultural and deliberative understandings of democracy deliver a
   broad spectrum of arguments in favour of dual citizenship. Only
   communitarians fear that dual citizenship endangers national
   democracies. Nevertheless, empirical evidence and national policies
   largely contradict these fears. The second part of the article reverses
   the perspective and shows that most theories of democracy do not only
   legitimate and facilitate the acceptance of dual citizenship - the
   phenomenon of multiple citizenships induces innovation in democratic
   theory in turn. A second look at the relationship between dual
   citizenship and theories of democracy reveals that dual citizenship
   stimulates refinements, expansions and reconceptualisations of these
   theories for a transnationalising world.},
