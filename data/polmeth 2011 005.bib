Title = {Beyond Neoliberalism? Crisis and the Prospects for Progressive
   Alternatives},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Abstract = {The onset of the current global economic crisis was hailed by many as
   signalling the demise of neoliberal hegemony. Two years on however,
   neoliberalism appears to be quite durable. Indeed, after a brief period
   of Keynesian-type responses, states, on the whole, have embraced
   neoliberal solutions to the fiscal problems generated by the crisis.
   Greece, for example, is now following an IMF programme of privatisation
   and cuts to social expenditure, while other European nations are
   pursuing austerity policies. In the USA, state and municipal governments
   are selling off public assets in response to mounting deficits. This
   paper explains the durability of neoliberalism and the opportunities and
   challenges it creates for non-neoliberal progressive policy agendas.
   Drawing upon Karl Polanyi's conceptual framework, this paper argues that
   neoliberalism is best understood as a historically specific process of
   state and economic restructuring that is socially embedded through three
   mechanisms: ideological norms, class relations, and institutional rules.
   This paper examines responses by states to the crises and concludes
   that, although the ideological legitimacy of neoliberalism has been
   somewhat weakened, there is little evidence to suggest that the three
   mechanisms, through which neoliberalism is socially embedded, have been
   significantly eroded. The implication for progressive politics is that,
   just as neoliberalism is socially embedded, so would a successful
   progressive non-neoliberal political programme need to be socially
   embedded: through the articulation of a coherent alternative ideology;
   through the mobilisation of social forces; and through the
   institutionalisation of non-neoliberal rules and norms within the
   apparatuses of the state.},

   directions taken by the Italian Regions in the exercise of their own

Title = {From Networked Nominee to Networked Nation: Examining the Impact of Web
   2.0 and Social Media on Political Participation and Civic Engagement in
   the 2008 Obama Campaign},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL MARKETING},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {189-213},
Abstract = {This article explores the uses of Web 2.0 and social media by the 2008
   Obama presidential campaign and asks three primary questions: (1) What
   techniques allowed the Obama campaign to translate online activity to
   on-the-ground activism? (2) What sociotechnical factors enabled the
   Obama campaign to generate so many campaign contributions? (3) Did the
   Obama campaign facilitate the development of an ongoing social movement
   that will influence his administration and governance? Qualitative data
   were collected from social media tools used by the Obama `08 campaign
   (e.g., Obama `08 Web site, Twitter, Facebook, MySpace, e-mails, iPhone
   application, and the Change. gov site created by the Obama-Biden
   Transition Team) and public information. The authors find that the Obama
   `08 campaign created a nationwide virtual organization that motivated
   3.1 million individual contributors and mobilized a grassroots movement
   of more than 5 million volunteers. Clearly, the Obama campaign utilized
   these tools to go beyond educating the public and raising money to
   mobilizing the ground game, enhancing political participation, and
   getting out the vote. The use of these tools also raised significant
   national security and privacy considerations. Finally, the Obama-Biden
   transition and administration utilized many of the same strategies in
   their attempt to transform political participation and civic engagement.},

   Security Policy - Catherine Ashton: the President of the European
   Commission - Jose Barroso: and the President of the European Council -
   Herman Van Rompey. In connection with the creation of the European
   analogue of a Ministry for foreign affairs, the said three positions in
   the EU are mutually intersecting and may generate serious problems. The
   authors substantiate the thesis that the three high officials of the EU
   have a moderate level of ambitiousness, that they display constructive.

Abstract = {This paper aims to introduce and test the core theoretical idea of
   double securitisation and of the need to bring political economy back
   into discussions of (at least some) security agendas. It also argues the
   importance of technology and technological change in shaping, and
   potentially in undermining, security agendas. It identifies a case for
   exploring questions of security and securitization in parallel with a
   political economy enquiry in at least some cases, the versions of
   securitization which engage with both with discourse and speech acts and
   with markets and complex actor relationships through markets.},

Abstract = {When discussing the role of states in the world system, the conventional
   wisdom among scholars means different configurations of relations
   between leading states, i.e. the system of international relations. Such
   approach was fully grounded in the past, but in present-day conditions
   it is not only the place of the state in international relations system
   that counts, but also its place in the modern world political system,
   which includes also non-Westphalian states and their critical mass
   exceeds that of the Westphalian ones. The article suggests that a
   different approach has to be used and the research of leading states has
   to be replaced by the study of states within the broader framework of
   the world political system. In this view it is not only an individual
   state but the whole system being challenged today, thus it needs to be
   determined how the states so different in nature can coexist in one
   political system and whether a radical restructuring of the system
   should be expected.},

Title = {The unbearable rightfulness of being human: citizenship, displacement,
   and the right to not have rights},
Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Pages = {39-56},
Abstract = {Claims to human rights protection made by displaced persons are
   displaced from the universe of humanity and rendered ineffective by the
   geopolitical character of modern international human rights law, in
   favour of the protection of citizens' rights claims. In response, there
   is increasing interest in leveraging respect for and protection of the
   rights of displaced persons through extension of the rights enjoyed and
   supposedly borne by emplaced citizens. However, it is a mistake to
   assume that humans as citizens bear human rights or that the freedoms
   that they may be able to extend beyond state boundaries are
   universalisable. The extension of the right to citizenship functions to
   displace questions of human rights themselves. The question of the human
   in rights is in fact always displaced, as long as the human subject is
   acted upon as if it could possess rights. In paying attention to the
   critical perspectives with which displaced persons confront the citizen,
   she or he may come to appreciate the fact that the universality of human
   rights is served where one does not claim to have rights but, rather,
   actively engages, without limits, with others in the struggle for rights
   and their respect.},

Abstract = {This work analyses the position of the Estatutos de Autonomia within the
   constitutional system that the Constitutional Court ruled in the Spanish
   Constitutional Court decision 31/2010. This issue is essential to the
   future of the Estado Autonomico. For this reason in this work are
   studied both the legal nature of the Estatutos de Autonomia accoding to
   their enactment and reform process, and the function of the Estatutos de
   Autonomia as part of the bloque de constitucionalidad. This study
   contributes to draw an outline of the main characters and of the concept
   of the Estatuto de Autonomia, which the Spanish Constitutional Court
   decision 31/2010 lacks. After that the work analyses from a critical
   point of view both the role that the Constitutional Justice have to
   fulfil regarding the configuration of the State and the role that the
   decision establishes to it. The forecasts are discouraging. The
   constitutional case law and the Estatutos de Autonomia are essentials to
   the right development of the State but the Spanish Constitutional Court
   decision STC 31/2010 removes their potentiality and the capability to
   face this fact.},

Abstract = {The method of doing research from the abstract to the concrete can throw
   light on many topics we touch upon and hence our emphasis on it. The
   capitalists are the personification of productive relations. In modern
   industrial society, the capitalists not only gain surplus value via
   their ownership of capital, they also participate in management,
   supervision, etc., and some of these tasks also create value. Surplus
   value can be divided into different parts and takes various forms. In
   the real world, the income of the capitalists comes from many sources;
   however, in the antagonistic productive relation of capitalism, the
   plunder of the surplus labor of the working class by the non-productive
   class via their monopoly of the means of production will never change.},

Journal = {CONTEMPORARY POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Pages = {71-87},
Abstract = {This article aims to introduce corporate social responsibility (CSR) as
   an ideational concept that is being globally and regionally engineered
   by an epistemic community of elite stakeholders that include business,
   intergovernmental organizations, non-governmental organizations and
   government. The concept of CSR engineering seeks to address gaps in the
   literature that neglect the emergence of a highly integrated network of
   elite brokers committed to neoliberal ideology and the manufacturing of
   ethical corporate governance. Conclusions are drawn from 60
   semi-structured interviews with key CSR stakeholders and well over 250
   `off-the-record' conversations held at six industry-led conferences. The
   findings suggest that when powerbases within the elite networks are
   exposed, the Western nation-state is revealed as the most dominant
   stakeholder.},

Abstract = {This article expands on the conventional discourse relating rough
   terrain mountainous terrain and noncontiguous territory - to civil war
   onset. In addition to their direct effects on the strategic and tactical
   logic of insurgency, I argue these factors affect state capacity, as
   measured by tax capacity, and exert an indirect effect through this
   channel. Because tax capacity proxies bureaucratic and administrative
   capacity as well as material resources, it conditions the decision to
   rebel more than military capacity per se. I find a negative relationship
   between mountainous terrain and to a lesser extent, noncontiguous
   territory, and state capacity. Subsequently, I find tax capacity is
   strongly and negatively associated with civil war onset, though this
   relationship appears only with longer than conventional temporal lags.
   The cumulative (direct + indirect effects mediated by state capacity) of
   rough terrain is roughly 45 per cent larger than its direct effect.},

Abstract = {Many scholars have identified stateless nationalist and regionalist
   parties (SNRPs) as ardent supporters of Europe. This support has been
   explained as a result of positive developments in supranational
   integration that convinced these actors that Europe could facilitate the
   achievement of their territorial demands. Other work, however, leads to
   an expectation that SNRPs that mobilise within island regions that are
   geographically distant from the European centre of power (Brussels) will
   adopt more Eurosceptic positions. This article aims to test these
   competing hypotheses about the positioning of SNRPs on Europe. It does
   so by examining the attitudes of SNRPs in two island regions in the
   Mediterranean: Corsica and Sardinia. The findings suggest that SNRPs in
   both places cannot be adequately categorised as either Europhile or
   Eurosceptic. The article examines the role of several context- and
   actor-specific factors in shaping the complex positioning of island
   nationalists in Corsica and Sardinia on the issue of Europe.},

Abstract = {The article begins by analyzing the historical evolution of `'class
   ideology'' in China, especially since 1978. Next, it turns to the
   concrete effects of the recent and ongoing recession on the Chinese
   working class. It finds that the crisis affected rural-urban migrants
   far more substantially than it did workers in the formal (mostly
   state-owned) urban sector. While this situation presents numerous
   challenges (for the central state, a crisis of legitimacy; for the local
   state, a crisis of managing social unrest as well as providing welfare;
   and, for the workers, a crisis of survival), it also creates
   opportunities for new conceptualizations and practices of
   class-politics. In conclusion, we discuss the nascent articulation of a
   few of these opportunities in labor-union activity, protests, and
   emergent rights-awareness, and legal consciousness among workers, as
   well as the implications for China's model of economic development.},

Volume = {20},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {428-448},
Abstract = {Applying a typology of political systems and executive power, this
   article focuses on German Chancellor Angela Merkel's powers and autonomy
   in relation to other female executives worldwide. Like most women
   leaders, Merkel operates within a dual executive system and is subject
   to a vote of no confidence. Powers are exercised within a cabinet,
   suggesting collaborative governance. Coalition politics requires
   Merkel's cooperation with other actors. State powers also compete with
   the Federal government. In these ways, Merkel supports the prevailing
   model of the more constrained female executive. However, German
   presidential powers are generally symbolic, positioning Merkel as the
   dominant executive. She also enjoys greater insularity from dismissal
   than most prime ministers. As the only female head of state in a G-8
   country, Merkel plays a visible and central role in global politics. In
   these ways, Merkel ultimately challenges the weaker model of the female
   executive, suggesting a mixed pattern overall.},

Journal = {POLITIQUE EUROPEENNE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {33},
Number = {1},
Pages = {185-214},
Abstract = {Over the last century, the chemical industry has synthesised and
   commercialised more than 100,000 chemicals with no premarket
   authorization. The effects of those chemicals on human health remain
   therefore largely unknown.
   This article first analyses the political strategies that have aimed at
   controlling those chemicals over the past 50 years, and casts a light on
   the differences between Europe and the United States. Then it
   characterizes the political process that has resulted in the adoption of
   REACH in December 2006 after intense controversies and negotiations.
   This Regulation is not a complete innovation, quite to the contrary it
   has derived from political processes rooted in European policies.
   However, REACH implies some changes linked to the integration of the
   Precautionary Principle in environmental policies. In particular, it
   induces a shift of the burden of proof from governmental bodies to
   industrial firms regarding the identification and assessment of
   dangerous chemicals. Still, this shift is far from solving all the
   issues surrounding the implementation of the Regulation and from
   reducing all the uncertainties linked to the industrial use of
   chemicals.},

Title = {Educating for active compliance: discursive constructions in citizenship
   education},
Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {15},
Number = {6-7},
Pages = {897-914},
Abstract = {This article examines the discursive construction of `active
   citizenship' within recent civics curriculum documents across three
   provinces in Canada. New secondary school civics curricula have emerged
   across liberal democratic states since the year 2000, presumably in
   response to the perception of youth as disengaged from political
   involvement. Many of the new curricula subsequently emphasize `active'
   engagement within the polity. The central task of this paper is to
   better understand what such `active citizenship' actually means, via the
   methodological tool of discourse analysis. Engaging a theoretical frame
   that incorporates Foucauldian governmentality theory and cultural
   theories of the role of the state in creating subjectivities, the paper
   ultimately argues that the `active citizen' of contemporary civics
   curricula is, in fact, a deeply neoliberal subject. The article then
   draws on feminist theories of citizenship in order to assess the forms
   of exclusion that the curriculum documents inadvertently create, arguing
   that they ultimately participate in a long tradition of devaluing such
   elements of citizenship as relationality and emotional ties. We conclude
   that one of the fundamental goals of citizenship education - to expand
   access to citizenship participation for all - has failed.},

Abstract = {This article examines the political thought of the socialist campaigner,
   Guy Aldred, in order to reflect on divisions between anarchism and
   social democracy in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Aldred's
   thought drew on a diverse range of ideas and he labelled this rich
   synthesis communism. Believing that his position captured the best of
   Marxist and anarchist traditions, he argued that socialist factionalism
   was based on a distortion of Marx's work and that the relationship
   between Marxism and anarchism was properly understood as the one between
   the head and heart of the movement. His claim not only subsumed the
   anarchist critique of social democracy into Marxism but it also relied
   on a system of classification which undercut the creative tensions in
   his political thinking.},

Abstract = {Do women's political gains in office translate into substantive
   differences in foreign policy outcomes? Previous research shows that men
   and women hold different national security policy preferences and that
   greater representation by women in the legislature reduces conflict
   behavior. But are these relationships an artifact of confounding
   variables? To answer this question, we analyze the defense spending and
   conflict behavior of 22 established democracies between 1970 and 2000.
   We argue that the ability of female officeholders to represent women's
   interests is context dependent varying with the level of party control
   over legislators and the gender stereotypes that officeholders confront.
   Consistent with the literature on stereotypes, we find that increases in
   women's legislative representation decreases conflict behavior and
   defense spending, while the presence of women executives increases both.
   However, these effects are conditioned by the gendered balance of power
   in the legislature and the degree of party control in the political
   system.},

Abstract = {Rousseau seems to argue, on one hand, that moderns are luxurious, lazy,
   weak, and soft, in opposition to primitive hardiness, vigor, ferocity,
   and rustic virtue. On the other hand, he depicts modern life as cruel,
   frenzied, competitive, and harsh, in opposition to primitive gentleness,
   idleness, abundance, and spontaneity. Is Rousseau, then, simply an
   imaginative ideologue, forwarding wildly opposed and oscillating
   characterizations of these eras, merely to be contrarian? This article
   attempts to demonstrate a degree of coherence in his analyses, by
   focusing on the various sociopolitical contexts he discusses, and the
   various moral characterizations and norms which apply to each of these
   contexts. Building upon a half-century of interpretations, it offers an
   innovative logical typology of Rousseau's social thought-in terms of
   social complexity, environmental resources, and normative
   foundation-which may explain many of his central paradoxes.},

Abstract = {The question of international intervention, which emerged with full
   force in the 1990s conflicts in the Western Balkans, has taken center
   stage in world politics. This article analyzes the way humanitarian
   intervention was carried out in Bosnia and Kosovo, primarily from two
   perspectives: policy and strategy. It considers what issues were
   contested and why, and how their consideration has advanced and/or
   limited the humanitarian intervention debate. Presently, the perception
   of use of international institutions and norms to advance state
   interests other than humanitarian is likely to pose formidable
   challenges to mobilize sufficient international support for dealing with
   humanitarian emergencies.},

Abstract = {This article outlines a politics of postanarchism, which is based on a
   radical renewal-via poststructuralist theory-of classical anarchism's
   critique of statism and authority and its political ethics of
   egalibertarianism. I contend that while many of the theoretical
   categories of classical anarchism continue to be relevant today-and
   indeed are becoming more relevant with the collapse of competing radical
   projects and what might be seen as a paradigm shift from the
   representative politics of the party and vanguard to that of movements
   and decentralized networks-its humanist and rationalist epistemological
   framework needs to be rethought in the light of poststructuralist and
   postmodern theories. Here I develop an alternative understanding of
   anarchism based on a nonessentialist politics of autonomy.},

   Turkey},
Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {457-470},
Abstract = {This paper explores the ambiguous purchase that claiming Turkish
   ethnicity has in Bulgarian Turkish migrants' attempts to access formal
   and social citizenship. I suggest that despite the new Citizenship Law,
   which appears to eliminate ethnic privilege, the emphasis on Turkish
   ethnicity continues to play a significant role in the migrants' attempts
   at inclusion. I seek to resolve this seeming tension between, on the one
   hand, the continuing significance of `Turkishness' in migrants'
   discursive claims, and, on the other hand, the failure of most of these
   claims to materialize in practice by addressing the question of social
   and economic capital. Although ethnic belonging continues to be an
   important facet of citizenship, social class makes a significant
   difference in determining who qualifies as a citizen and has access to
   social citizenship. I thus argue that we need to expand the current
   terms of the debate on the inclusiveness of citizenship in Turkey, which
   revolve around `denationalization' and `postnationalism,' to include
   questions of class-based exclusion.},

Pages = {321-339},
Abstract = {The constitutional changes in Ukraine, which are aimed at making the
   political regime more democratic, can be successful only if they
   consider centre-periphery relations. The constitutional reform of 2004
   was focused on dispersing power more equally between the central
   political actors in Kyiv. It completely overlooked the division of power
   between central and sub-state levels. As a result, centre-periphery
   relations were quickly unbalanced, which became one of the crucial
   challenges for the state-wide political regime. Contrary to the
   constitutional reform of 2004, more recent constitutional initiatives of
   central political actors have paid attention to centre-periphery
   relations and suggested dispersing more power to sub-state levels,
   thereby seeking to restabilize the Ukrainian polity as a whole.},

Abstract = {The United Nations (UN) peacekeeping mission in the Congo in 1960-63 is
   a major chapter in African and Cold War history. The political
   consequences of the peacekeeping mission, particularly the use of UN
   troops against Moise Tshombe's secessionist Katanga Province,
   reverberated in neighbouring African States as well. The contours of the
   UN's role in the Congo crisis are well known, but this article will
   consider how UN intervention created a framework for the conflict
   between white minority rule and African nationalists in Southern
   Rhodesia. This article suggests that the intersection of Cold War
   politics and Southern African racial politics helped to create a
   situation in Southern Rhodesia in which white politicians felt
   threatened by the UN's intervention, while Zimbabwean nationalists
   viewed cautiously the role of the UN as pan-African nationalism in the
   Congo became consumed by Cold War imperatives. The Katanga secession
   also demonstrated to both white politicians and Zimbabwean nationalists
   how intransigence and a small fighting force could challenge much more
   powerful nations in Cold War Africa.},

   early 2011 serve to show why certain states have developed as they have.
   Much of Western scholarship has failed to conceptualize this aspect of
   statehood and has taken Max Weber's ideal-typical state as the holder of
   the monopoly of violence, seen as legitimate by all its people as a
   given. The debates have been limited to two ideal types: the strong,
   legitimate, and democratic state (in Western Europe and North America),
   and the failed and authoritarian state (in the Third World, mainly in
   Africa) plagued by insecurities and instability. States that fit neither
   characterization, like most Middle Eastern states, have not been
   adequately treated in the debate. These are neither failed states, nor
   are they fully democratic. Middle Eastern states are both strong in the
   area of security and coercion and weak in the area of democratic
   representation and legitimacy, and hence fill a middle ground. But as
   the Arab Spring shows, this is not a permanent or viable situation, and
   changes can be expected. By using a more nuanced model for states, we
   can further understand current developments in the Middle East and infer
   possible trajectory of state transformation.},

Abstract = {Freedom of speech is in every of its manifestations one the most
   important rights of human beings. That explains why it is considered as
   a preferred freedom, and granted protection against any kind of
   arbitrary interference on the part of public authorities. This concept,
   that we fully share, infuses the European Court jurisprudence, and it is
   supposed to permeate any case that comes under its consideration. The
   judgment in Jose Luis Gutierrez v. Spain was a good example in that
   sense; but the ruling in Otegui v. Spain did not meet the logical
   expectations. In our opinion, the Court should have regarded Otegui's
   announcement as a clear signal of `hate speech', and as such, without
   the protection of article 10 of the Convention.},

Abstract = {This article addresses one of the first French racial
   anti-discrimination policy initiatives, le parrainage a l'emploi
   (employment mentoring), institutionalized in 1998 at a period of time in
   which the intellectual climate was hostile to the public categorization
   of ``race{''} and ethnicities. The author undertakes the ethnography of
   this mentorship program and demonstrates why it was not adequately
   equipped to fight discrimination. Bringing together a sociology of
   public action and a sociology of public problems, he explores what was
   lacking in this initiative and uses the case study to interrogate the
   criteria through which scholars usually assess the emergence and the
   proposed solutions of a public problem.},

Pages = {312-328},
Abstract = {When discussing race in the classroom, getting students-including,
   importantly, white students-to see that all people have racial
   identities can be a challenge. This classroom exercise employs a rap
   video as a tool for helping to reveal white as a racial identity and for
   exploring the concept of white privilege-the idea that economic, social,
   and psychological advantages accrue to white people because of their
   racial identity. In this article, I argue the benefits of using rap
   videos as a teaching aid, paying special attention to the ways in which
   whiteness and white privilege can be analyzed using the video ``Hell
   Yeah'' by the group dead prez.},

   the 2010 Election},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ELECTIONS PUBLIC OPINION AND PARTIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {21},
Number = {2},
Pages = {125-145},
Abstract = {There is an increasing recognition of the importance of party leaders in
   British elections. The 2010 election only served to reinforce their
   perceived importance with the introduction of three leaders' debates.
   Thus, more than ever, an understanding of contemporary elections
   necessitates an understanding of the dimensions of leadership that
   matter most to voters. This contribution examines the influence of
   perceptions of the three major party leaders as responsive, trustworthy,
   and knowledgeable. It also examines how the debates and other events
   unfolding during the campaign served to structure these perceptions.
   There is evidence that voters' evaluations of party leaders can vary
   substantially over the course of the campaign and traits such as
   responsiveness weigh heavily in voters' assessments. There is also
   convincing evidence of media effects, suggesting that voters are
   receptive to events unfolding during the campaign.},

Journal = {CRITICAL STUDIES ON TERRORISM},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {4},
Number = {2},
Pages = {181-197},
Abstract = {The emergence of the school of Critical Terrorism Studies has been
   attributed to the lack of contextualisation of research on terrorism,
   primarily, the virtual absence of the state and its role in instigating,
   funding or promoting terrorism. While this is a much needed development,
   this article employs the Basque case in order to demonstrate that the
   dualism of analysis (terrorists versus the state) is not critical
   enough. What it overlooks is the role that civil societies can play
   inside that dichotomy by rejecting or upholding violent methods for the
   satisfaction of political demands.},

Abstract = {Qualitative methods are ever wider adopted in political science. The
   fact may be explained by distinctive features both of the qualitative
   paradigm and of the object of political science - political reality. One
   of the methods of the qualitative paradigm that has received wide
   recognition, is media-political discourse-analysis. Norman Fairclough's
   three-dimensional model of critical discourse-analysis helps to avoid
   some typical mistakes of a discource researcher. Illustrated (as
   example) with Internet-media analysis of a communication, this model
   demonstrates its own wide research potential extending far beyond the
   limits of concrete discourse practice.},

Abstract = {The paper makes a review of the decisions that the Spanish
   Constitutional Court has taken in its judgement 31/2010 regarding the
   rules about the judiciary in the Catalonia Act of 2006. After a short
   reference to the situation before this judgement, the paper analyzes the
   different points of it, from the language problems to the proposed
   Justice Council of Catalonia, looking also at the questions about the
   public prosecutor, the Superior Court, etc. The conclusion is that the
   judgement is a complete revision of the rules of the Catalonia Act in
   these matters, a revision that, through the interpretation of some
   norms, and the annulment of others, proceeds to defuse the value of that
   rules.},

Abstract = {Spain and Portugal's entrance into the EEC in 1986 propelled their
   bilateral relations. This landmark event fostered contact among
   territorial collectivities on both sides of the Spanish-Portuguese
   border, which for the last decades had acted as an insurmountable
   barrier. In the context of a full integration in Europe, and due to the
   cooperation policies promoted within the communitarian frame, the
   meaning of the border varied from dislike and closure to openness and
   contact (i.e., from barrier to bridge). New ways of communication are
   opened between Iberian actors; such is the case in the so-called
   Galicia-North of Portugal Euroregion. This contribution seeks to make a
   balance of the strengthening of relations in economic, political, social
   and institutional terms in this cross-border region. The border as a
   territorial and touristic resource will be emphasized as an element that
   contributes to Euroregional integration.},

Abstract = {The article analyses the situation of the working poor in Austria in
   context of the European social welfare states. Firstly, it is being
   investigated to which extent the social welfare regulations are
   responsible for differences in the quantity of the poor in the labor
   force. Secondly, the article presents an overview of the working poor in
   Austria, based on EU-SILC data for the years 2004-2008. Our results show
   that women, single parents and families with three or more children as
   well as employees in the agrarian and service sectors are confronted
   with higher risks to fall into the category of working poor. Moreover,
   our study reveals that these risks increased considerably over the
   examined time period.},

Abstract = {Migration has a positive impact on economic growth. It yields income to
   the migrants as well as to the host country's own inhabitants. However,
   both for the country of origin and the country of destination there are
   also certain costs to be taken into account. All these factors in turn
   influence the amount of people migrating, their quality and
   qualifications structure, labour market conditions, demographic profile
   and the economic development in each state. In the EU contradictory
   opinions prevail on the influence of immigration. Many people still
   suppose that immigrants are a great burden for the public sector, which
   is most visibly manifested in France, Italy or Germany. We will try to
   assess the contribution of views for and against these issues.},

Title = {Framing terror: an experimental framing effects study of the perceived
   threat of terrorism},
Journal = {CRITICAL STUDIES ON TERRORISM},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {4},
Number = {2},
Pages = {199-217},
Abstract = {An exploratory framing effects experiment was conducted to test whether
   three controversial news portrayals (or frames) of the terrorist threat
   increase subjects' perceptions of the danger. A total of 176 subjects
   were exposed to one of eight different article treatments. The subjects
   reported higher levels of perceived threat when the danger was
   associated with `radical Islamic groups' (as compared to homegrown
   terrorists) and `nuclear' technology (as compared to conventional
   weapons). Contrary to conventional wisdom, however, this study also
   showed that the term `terrorism' itself did not affect the perceived
   threat. These results provide support for a theory of framing that
   explains the precise ways in which a particular set of communicating
   texts (terrorism news frames) influence human consciousness. Further
   theoretical details, as well as the social and political implications of
   this study, are discussed.},

Abstract = {Social citizenship in the classical sense of T. H. Marshall has been
   declared to be eroded and to have lost its significance. The
   introduction to this special issue challenges this assumption and argues
   that recent anthropological work on social citizenship in post-colonial,
   post Cold War and post-socialist states have shown that social
   citizenship is relevant and is being claimed by citizens of these
   states. Historical notions of citizenship as well as claiming rights to
   state support in return for having worked for the state are at work
   here. Furthermore the contributions to this issue illustrate how notions
   and practices of social citizenship compete and sometimes replace other
   practices of claiming citizenship on the basis of ethnicity, nationality
   or cultural ties.},

Title = {Two steps forward, one step back? Bias in the 2008 presidential election},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {30},
Number = {4},
Pages = {607-620},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The candidates running during the 2008 presidential campaign were the
   most diverse in America's history. Prior to this historic election,
   female and minority candidates had little success in pursuing the
   presidency. Barack Obama's victory signals a decline in those barriers.
   Yet some groups, especially religious ones, continue to face barriers,
   including Atheists, Mormons and Muslims. The paper takes a close look at
   bias in presidential voting. This examination will provide an
   opportunity to consider new hypotheses about why barriers remain,
   shedding light on the nature and extent of bias within the American
   public. We consider social desirability, ideology, social contact, and
   group threat explanations. To test our ideas, we rely on list
   experiments using national representative samples in 2007 and in 2008.
   These data provide a unique opportunity to advance our understanding of
   the 2008 election, in particular, and the role of bias, in general. The
   results also offer some insight into future presidential elections. (C)

Abstract = {This article explores the relationship between the party system,
   electoral formulas and corruption. Previous research has focused on the
   various incentives for political actors to monitor, or engage in
   corruption based on variations in the electoral formula. However, the
   electoral formula has mainly served as a proxy for the party system -
   whether multi-party or two-party. In this analysis, I test directly the
   relationship between party systems and corruption and in addition, add a
   degree of nuance to the established line of thinking within this
   literature. I argue that two-party systems in countries with
   predominantly single-member district (SMD) electoral formulas will
   demonstrate lower corruption on average than multi-party systems in SMD
   countries. However, I argue that this interaction effect does not play
   out in countries with proportional representation (PR). I test this
   hypothesis on 70 democratic and semi-democratic countries from 1987 to
   2005 and find strong empirical support for the claim that multipartism
   in SMD countries is associated with higher levels of corruption, while
   the party system's relationship with corruption plays no role in PR
   countries. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Presidents' audiences have been shrinking over time. Prior research
   suggests that the rise of cable television is to blame. We investigate
   whether this shrinkage is occurring disproportionately among those the
   president most needs to persuade-disapprovers of his performance.
   Analyzing both A. C. Nielsen's audience ratings and self-reports of
   speech watching from 32 postspeech surveys, we find that as the share of
   households subscribing to cable has grown, the statistical relationship
   between the president's approval rating and the percentage watching his
   televised speeches has strengthened commensurately for each group of
   party identifiers. Consequently, as presidential approval ratings have
   polarized during the past two decades, so too has the partisan
   composition of presidents' audiences, a phenomenon unknown during the
   broadcast era. Modern presidents thus find themselves increasingly
   preaching to their party choir and losing the capacity to influence
   public opinion more broadly.},

Abstract = {Analyzing survey data from the 2007 Cooperative Congressional Election
   Study, this article examines citizens' preferences for assigning policy
   responsibility for environmental problems to different levels of
   government. I find that the public generally prefers the federal
   government to take the lead in addressing most issues, particularly
   those that relate to pollution and those that have a national or global
   scale. The public, however, prefers to give more responsibility to state
   and local governments to handle local-level issues. These results
   suggest a desire among many in the public to match governmental policy
   assignment with the geographic scale of the problem. The best predictor
   of individual's choice of government level is political orientation, and
   to a lesser extent one's general confidence in each level of government.},

Abstract = {Hungarian memory culture is in turmoil. For more than a decade, a
   reinterpretation of the past has been taking place. Right-wing
   extremists play an awkward role in this process. The ruling party,
   Fidesz, inadequately sets itself apart from this view of history.
   Unconsidered traditions and concepts such as the bird Turul, the Arpad
   stripes, and Greater Hungary have become national symbols. While Nobel
   Prize winner Imre Kertesz is ignored by the official media or
   disparaged, the politicians in power make respectable ``role models{''}
   such as writer Albert Was, who would have to be considered intolerable
   in a democratic constitutional state. In history policy, a creeping
   radicalization is to be observed.},

Abstract = {In this study we want to analyse various Kantian thoughts regarding
   citizenship in his work the Metaphysics of Morals. Despite of the
   temporal distance between us and these reflections we argue that Kantian
   thought is quite significant for its implications regarding problems
   that citizens have nowadays in a globalised world. These reflections are
   relevant for the present not only due to what they explicitly say, but
   rather for what they insinuate in relationship with the problem of
   citizenship. For instance, citizenship is not only comprised by a
   combination of legal rights and duties, but also implies the notion of
   ``civil independence{''}, in other words, the linkage of a notion that
   we can call the material conditions of the existence of citizenship in
   general.},

   This article starts from the situation in Guatemala to describe traffic
   patterns, types of weapons, users, and arms demanders, as well as the
   situations that favor the maintenance of the illegal market in the
   region. It also presents the way in which brokers operate, based on
   actual cases occurred between different regional actors. It treats a
   paradigmatic case of exchange of weapons between Nicaragua and Panama
   that finished in the hands of paramilitary Colombian groups, being an
   intermediary a Guatemalan-Israeli company. This affair was investigated
   by the OAS. The article shows the connections that can get these
   intermediaries and the form in which they continue operating in
   Guatemala and the region.},

Journal = {BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {41},
Number = {4},
Pages = {883-906},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Rational choice, historical institutionalism and sociological
   institutionalism are under criticism from a new `constructivist
   institutionalism' - with critics claiming that established positions
   cannot explain institutional change effectively, because agents are
   highly constrained by their institutional environments. These alleged
   problems in explaining institutional change are exaggerated and can be
   dealt with by using a suitably tailored historical institutionalism.
   This places active, interpretive agents at the centre of analysis, in
   institutional settings modelled as more flexible than those found in
   `sticky' versions of historical institutionalism. This alternative
   approach also absorbs core elements of constructivism in explaining
   institutional change. The article concludes with empirical
   illustrations, mainly from Australian politics, of the key claims about
   how agents operate within institutions with `bounded discretion', and
   how institutional environments can shape and even empower agency in
   change processes.},

Abstract = {The role of the American President as commander-in-chief has been a
   major subject of discussion in political science, history, law, and
   other disciplines. This discussion has particularly been developed on
   the constitutional basis of Presidential claims, and on how such
   authority has been used in dealing with citizens. Yet there is enough
   unknown about how Presidents exercise the role that both practical need
   and intellectual opportunity require that some further, fresh inquiry is
   needed. The fields of American politics (notably executive politics and
   public administration), comparative politics, and international
   relations provide a number of starting points from which to work. Our
   understanding of the Presidency, the military, and the making of
   American national security policy can only be strengthened through a
   renewed focus on their political intersection, the application of
   theoretical and methodological tools new and old, and the dusting off of
   the multiplicity of cases throughout the Republic's history that beg for
   attention.},

Abstract = {Are democracies more transparent than other types of political regimes?
   Many people believe that the presence of elections alone is not
   sufficient for a country to be considered democratic and that
   transparency must be included as part of the definition of political
   regime. We agree that contestability of elections and transparency of
   policymaking are analytically distinct concepts. Adopting minimalist
   approaches to democracy and transparency, we ask a basic question: do
   electoral politics provide incentives for governments to disseminate
   data? We thus investigate theoretically the relationship between regime
   type and the willingness of policy makers to provide credible
   announcements on policy-relevant variables. And we demonstrate
   empirically that the availability (or absence) of policy-relevant data
   is correlated with regime type, even after controlling for GDP per
   capita, IMF participation, country fixed-effects, and time trends'.
   Democracies are indeed more transparent.},

Abstract = {In his muted leadership on deficit reduction, Barack Obama has
   highlighted the continuing tensions between the Constitution and the
   modern presidency. The framers did not structure nor envision vigorous
   day-to-day executive leadership on any subject and largely granted the
   power of the purse to Congress. Yet in response to new fiscal realities,
   the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 required presidents to think
   holistically about agency estimates and budget aggregates. But neither
   this act nor its belated 1974 congressional sibling was designed to rein
   in majority will to balance the budget. Deficits result from a complex
   stew of old and new policy decisions made by both branches. From a
   constitutional view, then, deficit reduction should be an equal burden
   on both branches. From a modern view, the president must lead the way.
   By that measure, President Obama has failed. With his deliberative style
   and open political sensitivity to a volatile economic and electoral
   landscape, he has not yet offered a clear and bold fiscal vision. He has
   also ignored the fiscal commission he created. This neo-Whig strategy
   keeps pressure on Congress but also excuses the president from the
   spirit and purpose of the 1921 law.},

Abstract = {``If turnout was 100\%, would it affect the election result?{''} is a
   frequently asked research question. So far, the question has been
   primarily answered regarding the changes in the distribution of votes.
   This article extends the analysis to changes in the distribution of
   seats and government formation. It therefore proposes a method that
   factors in apportionment methods, election threshold, sizes of
   parliaments, leverage of nonvoters, closeness of election results, and
   individual characteristics of nonvoters. The method is then applied to
   German national elections from 1949 to 2009. The application shows that
   Germany's Social Democratic Party (SPD) would have gained from the
   counterfactual participation of nonvoters, although usually not enough
   to result in a government change. However, the elections of 1994 and
   2005 show evidence that such a change could have happened. (C) 2011

Title = {International Criminal Justice in Africa: Some Emerging Dynamics},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS AND LAW},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {4},
Number = {2},
Pages = {74-84},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The phenomenon of using international criminal justice to address war
   crimes and human rights violations in conflict and post-conflict
   situations of Africa has emerged. This consist of a platform which is
   anchored in universal norms, with a court which does not form part of
   the domestic criminal system, and which in some cases sits outside the
   geographical jurisdiction of where the offences took place. The
   adjudicators may also be non-nationals. This paper examines the
   experiences regarding the enforcement of international criminal justice
   in Africa as instituted in the International Criminal Tribunal for
   Rwanda (ICTR) and the Special Court for Sierra Leone as well as in the
   framework of the International Criminal Court (ICC). It emerged that
   international criminal justice is meshed in politics and hence lacks the
   unflinching cooperation and support from the continent. The evidence as
   to its appropriateness for peace-building in conflict and post-conflict
   situations is mixed. The package offered by internationalized justice
   alienates both the adjudicators and the adjudicating society from the
   process, thereby denying the process with the impetus required for it to
   be beneficial to the end users. The implication of this study then is
   that the prospect of international justice in Africa is currently
   uncertain and its success would require concerted efforts by African
   governments, the African Union as a unified continental body and civil
   society organizations in collaboration with the international community.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to provide a critical assessment of the rhetoric used by
   the Justice and Development Party (AKP) towards the United States and
   the NATO. In addition, the analysis aims to shed light on Turkish public
   opinion polls reflecting views about Turkey's alliance with the West.
   The ultimate goal is to compare and contrast the rhetoric employed by
   the AKP vis-a-vis Turkey's NATO membership and the decisions that it has
   actually taken in that capacity. As it will be revealed, there seems to
   be a correlation between the quite-often used negative rhetoric of the
   current government and the public opinion towards the United States and
   the NATO. Nevertheless, these trends are at odds with the major
   decisions that the AKP government has undertaken recently, namely
   placing a NATO radar in eastern Turkey or contributing to major NATO
   operations such as in Libya and Afghanistan. This paper will also look
   into other Western, non-NATO-led diplomatic and international
   initiatives to complement the analysis.},

Journal = {POLITICAL BEHAVIOR},

Abstract = {Numerous studies show that education has a positive effect on political
   participation at the individual level. However, the increase in
   aggregate levels of education in most Western countries over the last
   decades has not resulted in a corresponding increase in aggregate levels
   of political participation. Nie et al. (Education and democratic
   citizenship in America, 1996) propose the relative education model as a
   possible solution to this paradox. According to this model, it is not
   the skills promoted by education that have positive effects on political
   participation. Rather, education influences individuals' social status,
   which in turn influences political participation. The relative education
   model expects that the individual-level effect of an additional year of
   education will decrease as the mean level of education in the
   environment increases. This article evaluates this theory using Swedish
   election surveys (1985-2006) and it thus provides the first in depth
   evaluation of the relative education model outside the US. On voting and
   political participation related to political parties, support is found
   for the relative education model.},

   how transaction cost and exchange embeddedness contribute to the general
   problems of institutional collection action, contracting, and
   cooperation. An application of the framework to Georgia cities'
   interlocal cooperative behavior across multiple services suggests that
   interlocal cooperation provides a viable alternative to both private
   contracting and hierarchical arrangements and that transaction
   characteristics-asset specificity and measurement difficulties-and
   reciprocal exchange relationship predict the participation and the
   amount of interlocal cooperation. A curvilinear relationship was
   discovered between transaction characteristics and interlocal
   cooperation that extends Williamson's linear prediction.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to understand the 2008 economic crisis in Iceland in
   light of the `animal spirits' framework as pioneered in the 2009 book by
   George Akerlof and Robert Shiller. Rooted in a Keynesian perspective it
   analyses the micro-foundations of a boom and bust sequence. It
   demonstrates how human attributes such as confidence, reliance on
   stories and bad faith can help explain the decisions taken in Iceland in
   the time leading up to the crisis. The combination of high levels of
   confidence and a new era story spurred a development that morphed into a
   mania. Actions based on bad faith also contributed as they gave the
   impression of success even though, in the long run, they undermined the
   whole system.},

Abstract = {In this study, we explore the determinants of cosponsorship activity
   within state legislatures. Utilizing a social dynamic framework, we
   develop and test a model of the interplay of the activities of
   sponsorship and cosponsorship that includes both individual-level and
   social network characteristics as determinants of agenda-setting
   behavior; the latter demonstrating how collaboration and mutual
   interests shape the agenda-setting process. We find several consistent
   factors that influence the frequency of cosponsorship activity: (1)
   ideological distance, (2) proximity of legislators' districts, (3)
   homophily (similar characteristics such as race, gender, and ethnicity),
   and (4) transitivity (the idea that friends of my friends are also my
   friends).},

Abstract = {This article examines the multiple ways in which sexualized and gendered
   national discourses are alternately reproduced and challenged in Pedro
   Antonio Valdez's novel, Bachata del angel caido (1999) and in Andy
   Pena's bachata Quiero volar (2008). This article argues that the social
   meanings ascribed to bachata are challenged to varying degrees in
   Valdez's novel and on Pena's music. While Bachata del angel caido
   emphasizes the << machista >> and heteronormative undertones of bachata,
   Pena's work manages to pave the way for the incursion of an otherwise
   unlikely subject in bachata: the queer Dominican male.},

Abstract = {This article traces the development of major ideas about integration in
   Europe. It examines the historical development of, and competition
   between, ideas about the EU, exploring the clash of integration models
   and ideals. It draws on the visions of European unity that led to the
   creation and development of the EU. Regional integration in the EU is
   distinctive and not necessarily `exportable'. The article examines
   governing norms, material interests, power, and security. It
   demonstrates that the narrative of shared experience and history formed
   part of a need to both overcome hyper-nationalism and to share
   sovereignty, while also privileging some memories. EU norms are also
   enshrined in a distinctive institutionalized structure, based on a
   co-existence of national and EU interests and a balancing among often
   competing interests.},

Abstract = {This research examines two referenda in the Deep South, both of which
   can be categorized as antiblack. Specifically, we analyze a 2001
   Mississippi flag referendum (in which the electorate rejected a new flag
   and retained the old state flag containing a Confederate insignia) and a
   2004 referendum in Alabama (in which citizens voted to retain
   unenforceable constitutional language requiring separate educational
   facilities for black and white students, and a poll tax on voting).
   Using state election returns and census data, we employ weighted least
   squares regression to analyze voting patterns. The results reveal that
   across both states, white voters displayed significantly greater
   ``antiblack{''} voting behavior in those areas with larger black
   populations and more urbanized environments. Our findings pose a direct
   challenge to both those who insist that the ``racial threat{''}
   perceived by whites is diminishing and those who hold that urbanization
   will ultimately be corrosive of racist attitudes and behavior.},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This article examines changes in the electoral relevance of traditional
   social cleavage groups in eight West European democracies, where
   electoral relevance is defined as group contributions to party vote
   shares. The approach presented here demonstrates the critical importance
   of both the electoral behaviour and the size of the cleavage group when
   electoral outcomes are of interest. The findings from analyses of the
   behaviour and size of working class and religious citizens (1975-2002)
   reveal significant declines in the contributions of these groups to
   party vote shares. Analyses of the sources of these declines point to
   the importance of group size, suggesting that the changes we observe in
   election results and party strategies are likely to be long-lasting
   alterations in the electoral landscape of Western democracies.},

Abstract = {Do political tensions harm economic relations? Theories claim that trade
   prevents war and political relations motivate trade, but less is known
   about whether smaller shifts in political relations impact economic
   exchange. Looking at two major economies, we show that negative events
   have not hurt U. S. or Japanese trade or investment flows. We then
   examine specific incidents of tensions in U. S.-French and Sino-Japanese
   relations over the past decade-two case pairs that allow us to compare
   varying levels of political tension given high existing economic
   interdependence and different alliance relations. Aggregate economic
   flows and high salience sectors like wine and autos are unaffected by
   the deterioration of political relations. In an era of globalization,
   actors lack incentives to link political and economic relations. We
   argue that sunk costs in existing trade and investment make governments,
   firms, and consumers unlikely to change their behavior in response to
   political disputes.},

Abstract = {Do family members steer each other toward new and rising political
   parties? This article shows that the family-traditionally viewed as a
   bulwark for electoral stability over time-is an important locus for
   dynamic interpersonal persuasion. Swiss household panel data are used to
   unpack influence among mothers, fathers, and children with respect to
   support for radical right and green parties. Parents urge their
   offspring to support these rising parties, spouses influence each other,
   and-importantly-young people convince their parents. Comparing
   intrafamily influence for rising parties with parallel dynamics for
   their main electoral rivals reveals patterns that distinguish rising
   from stagnant parties. Most notably, direct influence between young
   people and their fathers exists for rising parties but not for stable or
   declining ones. Finally, interpersonal persuasion can be enhanced when
   family members' interest in politics is high, when family members live
   together, and during election years.},

Abstract = {The article ``Paths and trajectories of university extension. An
   approach to a typology of five Latin American public universities{''},
   compares the five most important public universities in the region
   (University of Buenos Aires, Universidad de Chile, Universidad Nacional
   de Colombia, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico and Universidade of
   Sao Paulo), in the context of their significant role in the
   consolidation of academic elites, their contribution to the process of
   institutionalization of public higher education as an expression of
   nation-building, and as forming entities of intellectuals who integrated
   political, economic, bureaucratic and social circles with modern and
   secular approaches. The text analyzes in detail the concepts and
   extension regulations of the five institutions, and follows up the
   related parameters while seeing some of the practices throughout
   history, methodologically supporting itself in the construction of a
   typology, that even though shows common trends, it evidences the
   differences in each one of the university processes. Particular emphasis
   is made in the article about current trends of university integration -
   the way the authors prefer to call the function, finding an important
   tension between the way the universities' approach seeks to articulate
   their self-financing processes and their connection to the market, and
   another posture which insists on the formulation of university
   initiative Programs that want, while articulating Teaching, Research and
   Extension, to contribute solving major national problems. Without this
   contradiction being resolved, it is clear the complexity of the
   questions, processes and problems that Latin American public
   universities are expose to, nowadays. Which leads at the end, into
   suggestions and strategies for cooperation, partnership and networking.},

Abstract = {like many other regions in Colombia, Nelson Mandela's district has
   created a new social order in the absence of the state, with its own
   rules and regulations created and sanctioned by illegal groups. In this
   context, this article tries to analyze how the networks and
   phenomenology of the actors, agents and residents of this particular
   district reflect and unfold the whole department of Bolivar. The role
   played by paramilitary groups in this region along with the genesis of
   their combatants and supporters are analyzed through different emotions
   and basic concepts related with the ideas of revenge, loyalty, success
   and order.
   This research shows that the absence of justice, the presence of
   different cycles of violence and paranoia, along with the permanent
   referent of success and a local context of cultural impoverishment, are
   the main factors that explain why part of the population turns into
   mafias. In the midst of a troubled notion of order, this paper notes
   that the oppressed and subordinate residents of the district are able to
   reproduce structures of patronage which manipulate the armed group for
   community affairs.},

   Outcomes in Congress},

Abstract = {What do constituents hold their representatives accountable for?
   Previous work outlines two distinct but often conflated theories of
   accountability: democratic theory suggests that voters respond to the
   policy positions representatives take; retrospective voting theories
   suggest that they respond to the outcomes of these policies. Using new
   survey data, this article demonstrates that perceived congruence with
   their senators' policy positions influences voters' decisions much more
   than do perceptions of peace and prosperity. This finding holds when
   correcting for endogeneity using instrumental variables analysis, when
   considering members of the majority and minority parties separately, and
   when looking at specific policy areas. Replicating previous studies of
   retrospective voting suggests that they overstated the importance of
   policy outcomes for congressional elections due to omitted variable
   bias. The buck that stops with Members of Congress is for the positions
   they take, not for the policy outcomes they preside over.},

Abstract = {The Obama Administration argued that a publicly announced withdrawal
   timeline would help further U. S. counterinsurgency (COIN) objectives in
   Afghanistan by incentivizing better behavior from the Karzai government
   and the Afghan people. In this article, I test the ``Obama timeline
   hypothesis{''} to determine whether it is likely to produce the positive
   change that the Administration claims. By utilizing a mix of consistent
   historical predictors, deductive logic based on contemporary COIN
   theory, and currently available evidence, I conclude that the withdrawal
   timeline has not produced, and likely will not produce, these results
   and that, on the whole, it has likely engendered perverse incentives
   that run contrary to America's COIN objectives. More broadly, the Afghan
   case should make U. S. policymakers deeply skeptical of assertions that
   withdrawal timelines can serve as an effective policy tool for changing
   the behaviors of key regional actors.},

Abstract = {This study traces the origins of Mexican paramilitary groups and argues
   that, contrary to what most of the literature on the subject implies,
   they do not represent a state strategy to thwart leftist groups seeking
   social change. Rather, they represent battles between groups of national
   and local- level elites with different visions of democracy and of what
   constitutes good governance. The polarization inherent in this type of
   conflict leads local actors to have to side with one faction of elites
   or the other. The presence of radical leftist groups in recently
   colonized indigenous areas with scant state presence gives rise to a
   process of radicalization among local elites. There are multiple factors
   that explain the emergence of paramilitary groups. Aside from the post
   Cold War international context, there were national factors like a shift
   in its focus away from security matters between 1989 and 1993, and
   presidential policies between 1968 and 1993, that planted the seeds of
   leftist radicalism in a context of rapid modernization.},

Abstract = {A system security analysis and system modelling framework tool is
   proposed adopting an associated conceptual methodology as the basis for
   assessing security and conceptually modelling a critical infrastructure
   system incident. The intent is to identify potential system security
   issues and gain operational insights that will contribute to improving
   system resilience, contingency planning, disaster recovery and
   ameliorating incident management responses for critical infrastructure
   system incidents. The aforementioned system security analysis and
   modelling framework is applied to an adverse critical infrastructure
   system incident case study. This paper reports on the practical
   application of the framework to a case study of an actual critical
   infrastructure system failure and the resultant incident implications
   for the system and the wider regional communities.},

Abstract = {Gradualism is common in international cooperation, as states begin with
   limited cooperation and choose more ambitious targets slowly over time.
   However, most models of international cooperation are static and thus
   cannot explain gradualism. I show that when states can implement
   domestic reforms to reduce the cost of international cooperation,
   enforcement concerns prompt gradualism. First, to achieve ambitious
   international cooperation, states must internationally enforce costly
   domestic reform. Second, defection at the reform stage is particularly
   pernicious. When other states reform, their ability to punish the
   defector by suspending cooperation is reduced. States choose the extent
   of reform to maximize the benefits of expected international cooperation
   in the future. As collective enforcement power increases or the number
   of states decreases, the extent and pace of reform increase. Gradualism
   is also most probable in international public good provision because
   excludable benefits mitigate enforcement problems.},

Abstract = {Multimethod analysis of earthquakes' effects in two enduring rivalries
   demonstrates that natural disaster can promote rapprochement, political
   steps toward warmer relations that make it difficult for interstate
   rivalry to continue. Public expression of compassion and support for
   rapprochement create audience costs for leaders who otherwise would
   maintain hostile policies toward the rival state. However, routine
   violence, including communal violence, discourages public support for
   postdisaster cooperation and rapprochement. Content analysis and
   time-series analysis of rivalry change in two cases, India-Pakistan and
   Greece-Turkey, demonstrate these phenomena, and comparative case study
   analysis shows that communal violence helps account for divergent
   outcomes between the two cases.},

Abstract = {Concern about the environment has grown around the world. Important work
   has assessed the correlates of support for the environment and its
   relationship to values (for example, Inglehart, 1995). Recent
   comparative work on political party positioning demonstrates how the
   issue has increasingly taken on a left right dimension (Dalton, 2009).
   Filling a void in the literature, this paper explores how and whether
   the environmental issue has been incorporated into the ideological space
   of Canadian citizens and reflected in the views of the major political
   parties outside of Quebec. In particular, we first consider the extent
   to which the environment is a left right issue in the minds of Canadian
   citizens. We follow this by assessing the effect of environmental
   concern on citizens' views of political parties and whether this issue
   tends to operate as a positional or valence issue in differentiating
   political parties. We use the Canadian Election Studies from 2000-2006
   to address these research questions empirically.},

Abstract = {Revisionists demonstrate campaigns mobilize, educate, activate
   predispositions, and change minds. Attention has turned from the
   ``minimum effects{''} thesis to questions about the conditions under
   which campaigns matter and questions about which types of people are
   susceptible to campaign effects. Focusing on whether campaign effects
   are mediated by chronic political awareness, I find that current
   scholarship on this question is mixed. Some find that campaigns affect
   the politically unaware most, some find bigger effects among more aware
   citizens, and some find similar effects across the awareness
   distribution. Noting the possibility that awareness mediates different
   types of campaign effects differently (e.g. priming, persuasion, or
   learning), Zaller's Receive-Accept-Sample framework is consulted to
   develop expectations. I test the RAS generated predictions using the
   2004 National Annenberg Election Survey pre/post panel. The results
   support the theory that awareness mediates different campaign effects
   differently.},

Abstract = {The state in the modern sense ought to appear as the instrument of
   Reason able to control the passions. This is the modern myth of the
   state which has been fortified through the age of Enlightenment.
   However, the concept of `enlightened reason' that lies behind the idea
   of the state is just a myth and thus is false. Rather, the modern state
   becomes the highest embodiment of `carnal reason'. As such, carnal
   reason manifests itself through the idea of self-preservation or
   life-preserving in general which feeds on human desire for domination
   over nature and over human beings themselves. Thus, the modern state
   provides the framework for the carnal discharge of sadistic passions in
   the name of the myth of `enlightened reason'. The argument is that the
   Enlightenment deceptively presented its goals as the cravings of Reason
   while deliberately concealing its carnal foundations. Namely, I
   differentiate between the sado-masochistic core of the Enlightenment and
   its rhetorical or intellectual mask. The life-preserving drive that
   inevitably transmutes into comprehensive destruction of the self, as
   well as destruction of the others and of the entire environment, is
   upheld through the legal framework of the state. I argue that it is this
   carnal reason that provides the foundation for the modern state, as
   opposed to the historically propagated ideal of `enlightened reason'.
   However, if the state represents the ultimate embodiment of `carnal
   reason', there are at least two possible responses to that condition.
   The first response recognizes `carnal reason' as an obstacle for the
   fulfilment of the Enlightenment's ideals or as a betrayal of the idea of
   the state. This is the criticism developed by Horkheimer and Adorno in
   their diatribe on the Enlightenment and on the state, both of which are
   described as totalitarian and life-denying. On the other hand, the
   carnal conception of the state, separated from the burden of moral
   argument, is defended by Carl Schmitt as the fact of the political. Two
   carnal conceptions of the state represent two different articulations
   which should be juxtaposed and illuminated.},

Abstract = {U.S. state politics researchers often analyze data with observations
   grouped into clusters. This structure commonly produces unmodeled
   correlation within clusters, leading to downward bias in the standard
   errors of regression coefficients. Estimating robust cluster standard
   errors (RCSE) is a common approach to correcting this bias. However,
   despite their frequent use, recent work indicates that RCSE can also be
   biased downward. Here the author provides evidence of that bias and
   offers a potential solution. Through Monte Carlo simulation of an
   ordinary least squares (OLS) regression model, the author compares
   conventional standard error (OLS-SE) and RCSE performance to that of a
   bootstrap method that resamples clusters of observations (BCSE). The
   author shows that both OLS-SE and RCSE are biased downward, with OLS-SE
   being the most biased. In contrast, BCSE are not biased and consistently
   outperform the other two methods. The author concludes with three
   replications from recent work and offers recommendations to researchers.},

Abstract = {This research examines collective actions that took two women's
   networks: La route Pacific and the initiative of Colombian women for
   peace during the transitional justice and the justice and peace law
   implementation process. You are based on a theoretical approach that
   combines the sociological perspective of the political process with the
   category of gender, to establish gender ideologies shape new social
   movements and affect their speeches, objectives, repertories and
   results. We conclude there is an important feminist influence in the
   claim for redistribution and recognition for the victims of armed
   conflict and these collective actions begin to change institutional
   rules and the way in which the State serves the human rights of women.},

Abstract = {This article investigates two issues unexplored in studies of the
   relationship between panel composition and voting on three-judge panels
   of the Courts of Appeals: how often will panel composition influence
   case outcomes, and how has the relationship between panel composition
   and panel voting changed over time? The author shows that while long
   stretches of single-party control of the presidency in the first half of
   the twentieth century often produced a high rate of panels with three
   judges from the same party, frequent turnover of White House control in
   the past half century has helped ensure that a majority of panels are
   composed of at least one judge from each party. The author also presents
   the first systematic longitudinal analysis of panel composition and
   judicial behavior, showing that the relationship between the two is a
   relatively recent phenomenon. These findings have important implications
   for understanding collegial behavior on the Courts of Appeals.},

Abstract = {Agenda theories suggest that problem indicator, focusing event, and

   systematically tested this. This study, using time series data and
   vector autoregression (VAR), examines how climate problem indicator,
   high-profile international event, and climate science feedback influence
   media and congressional attention to global warming and climate change.
   The findings confirm that these attention-grabbing factors indeed
   generally promote issue salience, but these factors may work differently
   across agenda venues. Attention inertia, interagenda interaction, and
   partisan advantage on agenda setting are also included and analyzed in
   the VAR modeling. Implications of the study and recommendations for
   future research are discussed in conclusion.},

Abstract = {Our paper explores how poor rural households in India are increasingly
   accumulating debt through micro-finance initiatives channelled through
   local self-help groups (SHGs). The aim of micro-finance and SHGs is to
   provide a cheap source of capital for investment in self-sustaining
   economic practices - typified by the Velugu programme. However, the
   reality of micro-finance has been more complicated. It has created a
   class- and caste-related debt-dependency and vulnerability whilst also
   channelling poor households, and women in particular, into subordinate
   areas of the economy, which ultimately serve to maintain fundamental
   inequalities in Indian society. The initiatives may, in addition, be
   viewed as aspects of broader processes of financialisation.},

Abstract = {Citizens participate in elections, at least partly, because they
   perceive voting as a social norm. Norms induce compliance because
   individuals prefer to avoid enforcement mechanisms-including social
   sanctions-that can be activated by uncooperative behavior. Public
   visibility, or surveillance, increases the likelihood of norm-compliant
   behavior and applies social pressure that impels individuals to act.
   Some scholars have linked social pressure to community size, advancing
   the notion that pressure to conform to social norms is heightened in
   smaller, less populous communities in which citizens interact frequently
   and where monitoring behavior is less onerous. Others argue that even
   highly-populated communities can exhibit ``small world{''} properties
   that cause residents to be sensitive to social pressure. In this paper,
   I analyze data from a recent field experiment designed to test the
   impact of social pressure on voting taking interactions with community
   size into account. The findings I report suggest community size does not
   moderate the impact of social pressure. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Over the past few years, attention to the role of state-wide political
   parties in multi-level polities has increased in recognition of their
   linkage function between levels of government, as these parties compete
   in both state-wide and regional elections across their countries. This
   article presents a coding scheme designed to describe the relationship
   between central and regional levels of state-wide parties. It evaluates
   the involvement of the regional branches in central decision-making and
   their degree of autonomy in the management of regional party affairs.
   This coding scheme is applied to state-wide parties in Spain (the
   socialist PSOE and the conservative Partido Popular) and in the UK
   (Labour, the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats). It is an
   additional tool with which to analyse party organization and it
   facilitates the comparison of parties across regions and in different
   countries.},

Abstract = {Deliberative democratic theorists argue that important moral questions
   turn on whether regimes are sufficiently deliberative. To attribute
   ``deliberativeness{''} to a regime, we need an account of ``deliberative
   integration{''} that connects such a holistic assessment to the acts or
   qualities of individuals and smaller groups. I turn to Aristotle's
   Politics for instruction in developing such accounts, arguing that he
   judges regimes according to how reliably they act pursuant to excellent
   common deliberation-a manner of excellent rule that I call the ``rule of
   reason.{''} I then interpret Aristotle's metaphorical argument for the
   ``wisdom of themultitude{''} to establish the claim that democracies may
   best integrate citizens' deliberations. This interpretation illuminates
   Aristotle's complex evaluation of regimes, including his ambivalent
   views on the rule of the many. It also suggests a structure for
   contemporary accounts of deliberative integration helpful even for those
   who differ from Aristotle in their basic moral concerns.},

Abstract = {Poland's European identity is beyond doubt. But Poland's position in the
   EU is unclear. The Europe policy of the liberal Civic Platform and the
   conservative Law and Justice party both lack substance. The Polish
   political class and Polish society barely intervene in the debate over
   the character of the EU. They conform to external requirements and thus
   merely imitate Europeanisation. This is symbolic compensation for the
   country's real economic weakness and its political and cultural
   dependence. This symbolic form of politics is anachronistic.},

Abstract = {The emergence of popular subjects in Latin America constitutes
   identities and profiles, from the use of popular social media, moving
   from themselves to the notion of us -from which are part-, through
   community action and social participation in hybrid cultural contexts.
   The configuration of the popular community profiles arises from the 60's
   and 70's, with SERPAL, UNDA-AL, CIESPAL works and the followers of Paulo
   Freire, among them, Mario Kaplun. The roles of popular communicators
   have been blurred by the logic of the market and cultural globalization.
   This work seeks to reconfigure and re-signify their profiles, to the
   current political and social debate in Latin America.},

Abstract = {Practitioners and scholars have long championed the positive effects of
   mediation by regional organizations on conflict resolution-an influence
   much quantitative research fails to confirm. Mediation by regional
   organizations signals powerful selection effects that can lead to
   erroneous inferences about the factors observed to influence the
   duration of dispute peace agreements. In order to control for selection,
   I develop a theory that accounts for the nature of the conflict and the
   identity of third-party mediators. Theoretically and statistically
   controlling for the negative effects of selection on agreement
   durability evinced through mediation by regional organizations makes
   clear their positive process effects. That is, by taking into account
   that regional mediators get especially hard-to-manage disputes we can
   observe the positive ways that regional mediation contributes to dispute
   resolution. This study advances our understanding of conflict
   management, regional organizations, and civil war.},

Abstract = {According to recent scholarship, parties in a variety of electoral
   systems can significantly increase their share of the vote with
   ``flanking moves{''} designed to siphon off opponents' supporters with
   appeals to neglected policy concerns. These models do not specify, the
   conditions that enable parties to carry out such maneuvers, however We
   maintain that to take advantage of flanking opportunities, parties must
   undertake two tasks ideology construction and grassroots mobilization
   prior to the emergence of those opportunities. We illustrate our
   argument with a comparative-historical analysis of the National Party in
   South Africa and the Republican Party in the United States. Facing
   similar strategic contexts after the Great Depression, the two parties
   responded very differently to opportunities to attract voters through
   conservative racial appeals during the 1940s. Polity (2011) 43, 154-178.

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Recently a call has gone up for a revival of the ``politics of
   humanity.{''} But what exactly is the ``politics of humanity{''}? For
   illumination this paper turns to Hume's analysis of humanity's
   foundational role in morality and modern politics. Its aims in so doing
   are twofold. First, it aims to set forth a new understanding of the
   unity of Hume's practical and epistemological projects in developing his
   justifications for and the implications of his remarkable and
   underappreciated claim that humanity is the only sentiment on which a
   moral system can be founded. Second, by attending to Hume's substantive
   definition of humanity and its relationship to benevolence and sympathy
   in particular, it aims to clarify the relationship between the principal
   elements of the politics of humanity: ``humanism{''} or secularism,
   ``humane{''} or other-directed values, and mutual recognition of our
   shared ``humanness.{''}},

Abstract = {Following a review of the literature on gender, power, and eDating, this
   paper introduces the eDating development model and discusses a number of
   hypotheses that can be derived from it. Findings from a research
   investigation that explored the hypotheses are presented. The findings
   supported all the hypotheses, indicating that: (1) male and female
   eDaters follow different sequence of stages in their eDating
   development; (2) the behaviors that males and females exhibit as eDaters
   are different; and (3) the feedback that male and female eDaters receive
   from the environment is different. The paper concludes with a discussion
   of the implications from this research to more general questions
   relating to gender, power, and eDating.},

Abstract = {The increasing acceptance of ``sabermetric{''} perspectives by sports
   media outlets provides a useful framework to think about the
   relationship between political science and political journalism. In many
   ways, the experience in the sports world, in which the conventional
   journalistic narrative proved flexible enough to accommodate
   quantitative methods and new analytical frameworks, represents an
   optimistic model for those who hope to see political reporting become
   more informed by scholarly research. On the other hand, there are
   important differences between the two cases. For example, political
   science poses a much larger challenge to the prevailing approach among
   journalists to everyday reporting than sabermetrics did. For this
   reason, it have the field may have less influence on practicing
   journalists than its supporters hope.},

Abstract = {This paper documents and analyses how populist discourse was used in
   very different ways by political entrepreneurs of the Italian right,
   leading to three specific manifestations. The empirical range of
   populist ideologies is identified through a frame analysis of party
   materials and connected to the varying political and cultural
   opportunities of different kinds of parties. However, it is argued that
   at the same time a common reliance on some common populist tenets
   constituted an innovative strategy of the Italian right, and that as an
   ideology one of it's distinctive functions has been to act as a
   conceptual glue in a coalition which would otherwise be deeply
   internally divided. Acta Politica (2011) 46, 158-179. doi:

Abstract = {In using parts of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act as a down
   payment on an ambitious education reform agenda, Barack Obama has
   accomplished what few others presidents have. The strategy has given his
   administration three distinct advantages: a large discretionary funding
   source with little Congressional scrutiny; flexibility in pursuing
   education reform goals without crowding out other policies on the
   president's agenda; and the ability to shape the national reform
   discussion for more than a year on the administration's terms, without
   being constrained by negotiations over a specific piece of legislation.
   Now the question is whether the Obama administration's political
   dexterity can be matched by skill in fashioning institutional
   arrangements that ensure the long-term sustainability of these reforms.},

Abstract = {From 1950, a lot of researchers try to understand what is policy, how to
   define it and what kind of knowledge we can produce about it. When
   Harold Lasswell in 1942 proposed to develop the policy science, he
   established a strong connection between the development of policy
   sciences and democracy. He deemed that there was a complementary
   relationship between knowing policy and the political system. With
   policy analysis at the end of the century, two kinds of knowledge have
   been developed. First, knowledge about the substance of policy, the
   different kind of instruments which compose it, their effects, meaning
   and goals. Second, knowledge of the policy process, to understand how
   and why policy changes. Each knowledge has its own dynamics. But the
   problem is always the difficulty to link the two kinds of knowledge:
   knowledge of instrument analysis and knowledge of policy dynamics
   analysis. We can choose between work which understands the substance of
   policy but does not examine policy dynamics, and work about policy
   dynamics that does not take into account the specific substance of
   policy. Finally, a lot of researchers who produce knowledge of
   instruments never understand why their knowledge has so little
   influence. The paper aims to review the complex relationship between
   knowledge of instruments and knowledge of policy dynamics, and proposes
   to open a new way by considering the role of knowledge of instruments
   inside policy dynamics. The main idea is to focus on the discursive
   process of actors who transform instruments into policy by making sense
   of the instruments, and to illustrate this by some empirical examples.},

Abstract = {The `challenge of convergence' has become a core element of the European
   policy-making agenda. Many programs have been initiated by European
   institutions with a view to ensure uniformity in administrative actions
   and structures. In this article, we will investigate the formation of a
   `European administrative space' as a result of a process of convergence
   toward a common European model, looking, in particular, at the role of
   communication and information technologies. As numerous policy documents
   produced by the European Commission indicate, new technologies have the
   potential to create administrative systems that are integrated across
   the European context in terms of their semantic, organizational, and
   technical content. We will pay close attention to the role of
   technological standardization in promoting economic development and
   competitiveness, as well as considering security policy as an example of
   `homogenization through technology'.},

Abstract = {The literature on new modes of governance suffers from a gap between the
   normative and the positive approaches to legitimacy. This article
   addresses this gap by studying the patterns of national stakeholders'
   support for the Open Method of Coordination (OMC). The results of our
   survey demonstrate that the OMC receives greater support than previously
   assumed and that the support of national stakeholders is largely
   associated with their involvement in national procedures. These findings
   corroborate the assumptions of normative theories of participatory
   democracy about the importance of involvement. Furthermore, the study's
   findings underline the pivotal role that national stakeholders play
   regarding matters of legitimacy in the EU's multi-level system of
   governance.},

Abstract = {In this essay, the Africanist critique of mainstream International
   Relations (IR) theory and the neo-neo synthesis, and in particular the
   realist tradition, is critically analysed. It is argued that although
   the Africanist critique does highlight some pertinent issues, it
   ultimately fails to be convincing due to, firstly, its misunderstanding
   of the neo-neo synthesis and the realist tradition in particular;
   secondly, its disregard for human nature; and thirdly, its promotion of
   a stance that would lead to further marginalization. It is posited that
   although Africanists perceive globalisation as Westernisation - and
   Americanisation to be more specific - and interpret the aforementioned
   as essentially echoing the Foucauldian notion of a power-knowledge
   nexus, their interpretation does not necessarily undermine the realist
   tradition, but rather substantiates it. It is concluded that the realist
   tradition, specifically, has not led to Africa's marginalization -
   rather it is something which has been the result of mostly internal
   dynamics which have created external vulnerabilities.},

   such as the right to travel, communicate and even join sports activities
   abroad. We believe that the decades-old negotiations have covered every
   aspect of the Cyprus problem with hair splitting detail. Extending the
   negotiations procedure at this point would serve no useful purpose and
   would only feed into Greek Cypriot aspirations to create problems for
   Turkey in its path towards EU membership.},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Business firms and Business corporations enter into thousands of
   contracts everyday. Making a formal and written contract is very
   important for business corporations and firms although oral contracts
   are accepted and recognized by law. There are certain rules on making a
   valid formal contract. If the business firms do not have knowledge of
   those contract formation rules and they make contracts in ignorance of
   those rules, their contracts would be liable to be declared as null and
   void by the court of law if it is referred to it to determine its
   validity or to get a remedy for breach of contracts by one of the
   parties in the contract. In this paper I have not discussed all the
   elements of a valid contract. I have discussed only one of the
   fundamental elements of a valid contract that is `acceptance'. In a
   business contract, there must have be an `offer' and an `acceptance', to
   make a valid contract, if not the contract will not be valid, recognized
   and enforceable in the court of law. The objective of this paper is to
   clarify the rules of making a valid `acceptance' which may lead to
   making a binding contract between the parties.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},

Volume = {50},
Number = {2},
Pages = {168-189},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The effect of globalisation on social spending is one of the most
   intensely studied issues in the political economy literature. Until
   recently, conventional wisdom held that globalisation leads governments
   to expand social spending to compensate workers for increasing risk
   exposure. The latest research shows, however, that globalisation has
   become strongly associated with spending cutbacks since the late 1980s.
   This article adds to this research by arguing that the negative impact
   of globalisation is conditioned on the capitalist system in different
   countries. In coordinated market economies (CMEs), employers are
   dependent on the willingness of the workforce to invest in specific
   skills and therefore become supportive of extensive social spending. Not
   so in liberal market economies (LMEs), where employers are much less
   dependent on social spending because the workforce in general invests
   less in specific skills. Employers in LMEs are therefore likely to use
   increasing globalisation as a means to push through retrenchment,
   whereas employers in CMEs are not. This argument is tested in a
   time-series cross-section regression analysis, which clearly supports
   it.},

Abstract = {There is no doubt that the rule of law is unambiguously enshrined in the
   Nigerian Constitution. The only surprising thing to any competent
   individual is the blatant disrespect shown to this constitutional
   provision by Nigerian rulers who had openly sworn to uphold it. From the
   backdrop of several cases of unjustifiable arrests, unfair trials,
   executive lawlessness, suppression of free speech and undue domination
   of minorities, this paper attempts to defend the thesis that Nigerian
   rulers have become sybaritic in their conscious reduction of the concept
   of the rule of law to a mere constitutional myth and never a reality

Abstract = {Advertisers have attempted to quantify the use of celebrities with the
   aim of evaluating their influence on the consumer. However, sometimes
   celebrities who engage in false or deceptive advertising are very likely
   to mislead consumers which may cause harm to consumers in terms of
   property loss and personal damage. Due to celebrity endorsements being
   highly visible to the public, the solution to this issue is of
   significant relevance to consumers and the general public. Therefore,
   advanced experience on celebrity endorsement should be drawn from
   abroad, and a clear assignment of obligation standard is highly
   desirable.},

Abstract = {Arbitral justice becomes a universal phenomenon requiring the
   involvement of all economic and legal players in developed and
   developing countries.
   OHADA is a common law that aims to secure legal security for regional
   and foreign economic agents by offering a vast economic space. The
   People's Republic of China (PRC) is an emerging country seeking to
   increase its economic participation in the global context. As economic
   interdependence increases, business disputes are more likely.
   This article compares two legal systems in the international commercial
   arbitration field: the legal system of OHADA and the PRC's legal system;
   especially in the effectiveness and the remedies of the arbitrators'

Abstract = {The internationalisation of Gulf capital throughout the economies of the

   development over the last two decades. This article traces the nature of

   the West Bank and Gaza Strip needs to integrate the internationalisation
   of Gulf capital with the exigencies of Israel's occupation. The
   theoretical and political implications of this are discussed in light of
   the projection of both US and Israeli power in the Middle East.},

Abstract = {This essay is about `creativity' and the way it is perceived in modern
   western society. Most people tend to see creativity in a rather simple
   fashion as something positive, and in view of its benefits for the
   individual, for culture and for society, it is generally agreed that
   creativity should be given a more prominent role. However, in a modern,
   globalized society this `angelic' view can present a misleading picture
   of the phenomenon. So what is its role and how should it be
   reconceptualized? The author takes two diferent ideological visions of
   creativity, a progressive, humane and democratic view in contrast to a
   market-led economic one. Paradoxically as it may be, these two opposing
   visions share much of the same rhetoric and the author attempts to strip
   away some of the confusing layers that mask these positions. Mrnarevic
   shows that the value of creativity is shifting from a traditional
   humanistic and cultural model to serve the new economic doctrine. It is
   believed that this shift is unwise since it ignores other aspects of
   creativity, which are of vital importance for society if it is
   constructively to deal with pressing issues that challenge it, such as
   reducing economic inequalities and other effects of a competition-based
   culture.},

Abstract = {It has often been argued that, notwithstanding his commitment to the
   authoritarian state, Thomas Hobbes is a champion of the ``minimal{''}
   version of liberty of conscience: namely, the freedom of citizens to
   think whatever they like as long as they obey the law. Such an
   interpretation renders Hobbes's philosophy more palatable to
   contemporary society. Yet the claim is incorrect. Alongside his notion
   of ``private{''} conscience, namely, Hobbes develops a conception of
   conscience as a public phenomenon. In the following, it is argued that
   this inconsistency serves the purpose of deception: it holds out the
   possibility of dissent while making it impossible to utilise. Arguably,
   moreover, this is the proper hermeneutical approach to take to Hobbes's
   inconsistencies in general. Indeed, said inconsistencies ought to alert
   contemporary normative theorists to the instability of the ``minimal{''}
   version of liberty of conscience attributed to Hobbes: Hobbes himself,
   namely, shows that it is insufficient.},

Booktitle = {HIZBULLAH'S IDENTITY CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2011},
Pages = {113-139},
Abstract = {The remaining chapters shift the tenor of the book to more practical
   matters of Hizbullah's political strategy in relation to its identity
   construction. Hizbullah altered its identity and militant character of
   the 1980s - when it anathematized the political system and regarded the
   Lebanese state as an apostate - to a gradual integration process in the
   political system, in particular, and the Lebanese public sphere, in
   general, since the end of the civil war in 1990 and the party's
   acceptance of the Ta'if Agreement, which became Lebanon's new
   constitution. This chapter suggests that Hizbullah adhered to its policy
   of cooptation and contestation from the early 1990s to 2005, the year PM
   Rafiq Hariri was assassinated and the Syrian troops withdrew from
   Lebanon after a presence of almost three decades, thus altering the
   rules of the game and even the geostrategic equation. This chapter
   argues that a bona fide policy shift, aiming at manipulation and
   obtaining more political power, picked momentum in the beginning of
   2005, ensued with more vigour after the July 2006 War, and continues to
   be the norm till this day, through piecemeal socio-political engineering
   and identity reconstruction that allows Hizbullah to read and interpret
   events and react to these dynamic changes accordingly, dwelling on the
   complexity, flexibility, and pragmatism of Shi'ite jurisprudence, and
   thus rendering legitimacy to the party's behavior.},

Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},

Volume = {14},
Number = {5},
Pages = {603-621},
Abstract = {Many of the foremost defenders of distributive egalitarianism hold that
   its scope should be limited to co-citizens. But this bracketing of
   distributive equality exclusively to citizens turns out to be very
   difficult to defend. Pressure is placed on it, for instance, when we
   recognize its vulnerability to `extension arguments' which attempt to
   cast the net of egalitarian concern more widely. The paper rehearses
   those arguments and also examines some - ultimately unsuccessful -
   responses which `citizenship egalitarians' might make. If it does turn
   out that citizenship egalitarianism cannot be defended, then two options
   are open to its adherents: to modify that position substantially in
   order to embrace at least some global egalitarian components, or to
   argue for a reorganization of citizenship regimes in such a way that
   citizenship might properly track the subjects of egalitarian justice.
   Both are radical options. Finally, the paper then briefly considers one
   way in which an attenuated form of citizenship egalitarianism might
   still be defended.},

Journal = {TEORIA Y REALIDAD CONSTITUCIONAL},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {28},
Pages = {385-406},
Abstract = {Regulation 1049/2001 establishes and shapes the right of access to
   documents in the European Union. This right is limited by a series of
   colliding principles and rights, such as privacy of personal data,
   `ordre public' or commercial interests. The European Court of Justice,
   through rulings by each one of its two Courts (the General Court and the
   European Court), has shaped and generally extended the scope of
   Regulation 1049/2001, increasing transparency in the institutions.
   However, there is no clear case-law trend as regards access to
   documents, since rulings often contradict each other and precedents are
   of relatively little value. Recent rulings, such as those given to the
   Borax and Bavarian Lager cases, seem to restrict public access to
   documents in the institutions by placing access to documents under other
   values such as privacy and data protection. This trend seems again to
   contradict what the Lisbon Treaty and the European Charter of
   Fundamental Rights have just introduced: a higher consideration of
   access to documents and a clear commitment with institutional
   transparency. This paper aims at giving a clear overview of the
   evolution and state of play of the right of public access to documents
   in the European legislation and case law. By analyzing the latest legal
   and jurisprudential developments, it can be concluded that law and case
   law do not seem to go hand in hand yet and seem to contradict each
   other. Immediate and further developments should be watched with a
   careful eye, as these will shape the post-Lisbon concept of access to
   documents. Consequently, essential principles such as transparency and
   data protection might undergo as well important changes.},

Journal = {QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-53},
Abstract = {We study a game-theoretic model where three political parties (left,
   median and right) can form coalitions both before and after the
   election. Before the election, coalitions can commit to a seat-sharing
   arrangement, but not to a policy platform or a division of rents from
   office; coalition members are free to break up and join other coalitions
   after the election. Equilibrium pre-electoral coalitions are not
   necessarily made up of the most ideologically similar parties, and they
   form under proportional representation as well as plurality rule. They
   form not only to avoid splitting the vote, but also because seat-sharing
   arrangements will influence the post-election bargaining and coalition
   formation. The median party's share of the surplus in a two-party
   government is large if ideology is not very important, or if its
   ideological position is not very distant from the third (outside) party,
   so that it has a credible threat to switch coalition partners. On the
   other hand, if ideology is very important, and if the right and left
   parties are ideologically distant from each other so each is willing to
   give up a lot to prevent the other from joining a governing coalition,
   then the equilibrium outcome may be that the median party forms a
   one-party government.},

Pages = {80-88},
Abstract = {In 2006, the UK government deployed forces into Helmand as part of the
   ISAF expansion into southern Afghanistan. It did so with limited force
   levels; a strategic choice that was further criticised when the move `up
   the valley' into the north of the province left UK forces thinly spread
   across a large and dangerous region. Helmand operations have cost over
   360 lives, but there have been stabilisation gains. Nevertheless,
   important lessons remain to be learned about Britain's strategic
   policy-making from the decisions of 2005-06.},

Pages = {545-567},
Abstract = {Despite several post-Cold War reforms which have promised far-reaching
   change, the Bundeswehr faces a set of deficits in force structures,
   capabilities, doctrines and military adaptation, which leave it in
   danger of slipping permanently behind its European partners. The study
   examines the extent to which reforms proposed by the Commission on
   Structural Reform of the Bundeswehr will remedy these deficiencies. It
   finds that the proposals of the Commission include several important
   measures which will accelerate German convergence with the reforms of
   its European partners. However, the Commission fails to address several
   fundamental problems which impair the Bundeswehr's capacity to adapt to
   ongoing operations. The article critically engages with the existing
   theoretical literature on German defence policy and highlights the
   utility of neoclassical realism in explaining the process and outcome of
   German defence reform. The study also points to the urgent requirement
   for further comparative scholarship on post-Cold War European military
   adaptation and civil-military relations in defence planning.},

Abstract = {The Henry Tax Review is a work in progress, but it has already advanced
   sufficiently to constitute an important case study of state capacity in
   Australia. Using the Henry Tax Review as a case study, this paper sheds
   light on the question of whether the national political system is
   capable of devising and implementing long-term reforms. Whilst specific
   policy failures inevitably have a contingent dimension in the form of
   poor strategy and leadership or unfavourable economic conditions, the
   paper discusses the erosion of institutional and relational structures
   which, arguably, has diminished systemic political capacity. This is
   tantamount to a structural weakening of state capacity in Australia, a
   development which has the potential to erode the potential of any
   government to enact significant strategic policy change.},

Abstract = {This paper examines countries' free-riding incentives in international
   environmental agreements (IEAs) when, first, the treaty is
   non-enforceable, and, second, countries do not have complete information
   about other countries' non-compliance cost. We analyze a signaling model
   whereby the country leading the negotiations of the international
   agreement can reveal its own noncompliance costs through the commitment
   level it signs in the IEA. Our results show that countries' probability
   of joining the IEA is increasing in the free-riding benefits they can
   obtain from other countries' compliance, and decreasing in the cost of
   not complying with the initial terms of the agreement. This paper shows
   that, when free-riding incentives are strong enough, there is no
   equilibrium in which all countries join the IEA. Despite not joining the
   IEA, however, countries invest in clean technologies. Finally, we relate
   our results with some common observations in international negotiations.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ELECTIONS PUBLIC OPINION AND PARTIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-27},
Abstract = {This article evaluates how social cleavages and institutions shape the
   number of parties in the world's newest democracies. It supplements
   existing propositions about the interaction of institutions and ethnic
   heterogeneity with an argument about the geographic concentration/
   dispersion of relevant groups. And it reflects on the interaction
   between institutions such as the electoral system, the form of
   government, and the relative decentralization of governmental authority.
   A quantitative analysis leveraging returns collected for 255 elections
   held in 61 ``third wave{''} democracies reveals that the interaction of
   ethnic cleavages and institutions is more complex than the existing work
   suggests. The territorial configuration of ethnic cleavages appears to
   be decisive to the effect of institutions, while the proportionality of
   the electoral system seems to work in interaction with decentralization.
   The findings have important implications for both the science and
   practice of constitutional engineering.},

Title = {Nothing Succeeds Like Access? NGO Strategies Towards Multilateral
   Institutions},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CIVIL SOCIETY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {7},
Number = {2},
Pages = {207-227},
Abstract = {Despite a large literature on international nongovernmental
   organizations (NGOs), we still know relatively little about their nature
   as strategic actors. This article addresses this gap, arguing that a key
   determinant of NGOs' strategies towards multilateral institutions in
   particular is their level of formalization. NGOs' choices over both
   organizational structure and strategy towards multilateral institutions
   reflect their level of commitment to being a social movement
   organization. Some NGOs bureaucratize their organizations and seek
   insider access to (and influence in) multilateral institutions, while
   others reject formalization as betraying the social movement network
   ethos and inviting co-option. Drawing on an original database, this
   article demonstrates that NGOs adopting formal bureaucratic structures
   are more likely to engage in insider strategies-i.e. lobby and seek
   accreditation at multilateral institutions-than those maintaining
   informal coalitional structures, regardless of these NGOs' budgets, age,
   or ideology. This finding gives us new insight into the divisions within
   global civil society and the limited prospects for cooperation between
   two sets of actors central to emerging forms of global governance.},

Title = {Does government performance matter? Electoral support for incumbents in
   six post-communist countries},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {17},
Number = {3},
Pages = {257-277},
Abstract = {For two decades, the Central and Eastern European party politics has
   been characterized by the widespread inability of parties to secure
   stable political support (reflected in high levels of electoral
   volatility) to allow their presence in government for consecutive terms.
   This paper investigates the factors that trigger support for incumbent
   parties in post-communist countries. In doing so, it examines the effect
   of individual evaluations at the systemic level (i.e. satisfaction with
   democracy, government activity), partisan attachment (i.e. preference),
   and objective indicators of individual economic success (i.e. the level
   of income) on the vote for incumbents. This cross-national analysis is
   conducted at the individual-level in six post-communist countries chosen
   on the basis of the most similar system design. The study uses data from
   election surveys at two different moments in time (mid-1990s and the
   first elections of the 2000s) and combines bivariate and multivariate
   statistical analyses. The results indicate that partisanship and
   positive evaluations of the government explain most of the vote for
   incumbents. Apart from these visible patterns, there are some other
   valuable results in specific countries understandable solely within the
   larger domestic political context.},

Title = {Pursuing Centralization amidst Decentralization: The Politics of
   Brazil's Innovative Response to HIV/AIDS},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS IN LATIN AMERICA},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {3},
Number = {3},
Pages = {95-126},
Abstract = {In recent years, Brazil has been highly revered for its response to
   HIV/AIDS. Despite the government's delayed response, why and how did the
   national AIDS program eventually become so successful? This is even
   further puzzling when one considers the challenges associated with
   Brazil's decentralized response to healthcare needs, lack of subnational
   resources and political will to effectively implement AIDS policy. This
   article maintains that Brazil's successful response eventually required
   the strategic centralization of national AIDS bureaucratic and policy
   authority, entailing policies designed to aid local governments while
   creating fiscal policies incentivizing sub-national compliance with the
   national bureaucracy and more effective policy implementation. Taking
   advantage of renewed political support, kindled by international
   pressures and the president's reputation-building pursuits, the sources
   of AIDS officials' success, however, resided not in their technical and
   financial prowess, but in their ability to forge historically-based
   partnerships with civic AIDS NGOs and social movements sharing
   like-minded ideational beliefs in policy centralization. This article
   also discusses how these findings contribute new insights into theories
   addressing the reasons for centralization, as well as the ideational
   sources of gradual institutional change.},

Abstract = {Blais (2006) and Blais and Aarts (2006) in their review essays on voter
   turnout call attention to a striking puzzle about the link between
   electoral systems and turnout, namely that, ceteris paribus,
   proportional representation (PR) systems with many parties appear to
   have higher national-level turnout than single-member district (SMD)
   plurality systems with few parties, yet turnout does not increase with
   the (effective) number of parties (ENP) at the national level. To
   address this puzzle we turn to district-specific within-nation panel
   data from Switzerland and Spain. Our country-specific findings allow us
   to explain the national-level puzzle as essentially an ecological
   artefact, in that the multi-member districts found in proportional
   systems, on average, do exhibit higher turnout than SMDs, but turnout
   does not rise with district magnitude, m, once we move beyond the
   contrast between m = 1 and m > 1. Using a more sophisticated approach to
   measuring political competition that does not treat all PR systems as
   generating identical turnout incentives (Grofman and Selb, 2009), we
   seek to explain this puzzle by showing both empirically and
   theoretically that (1) proportionality does not necessarily increase
   with district magnitude, and (2) competition does not necessarily
   increase with district magnitude.},

Abstract = {This paper examines issues of support for women with Information
   Technology (IT) careers. Data was collected from interviews with 38
   women, which lasted about 90 minutes. Questions were open-ended
   regarding aspects of their careers and career paths. The women
   represented a wide variety of experience and nine different industry
   sectors and at varying organizational levels. Research on the lack of
   women in STEM disciplines focuses mainly on undergraduate education and
   attracting women to STEM disciplines, focusing on ``filling the
   pipeline.{''} This paper examines what it takes to have a successful,
   satisfying career, highlighting areas of support for women that may
   influence their success in IT careers.},

Abstract = {One of the most significant developments in international relations
   theory in the past decade has been the reconciliation of radical
   post-positivist theorists to realism. This article examines the causes
   and consequences of that reconciliation. It argues that while advances
   in the history of international thought have prompted substantive
   re-evaluations of the work of past realist thinkers, including that of
   Carl Schmitt and Hans J. Morgenthau, the reconciliation of radicalism
   and realism has occurred because of the radicals' realisation of their
   common anti-liberalism. Drawing upon the work of Stephen Holmes, the
   article concludes with a discussion of the implications of the rise of
   anti-liberalism among international relations theorists.},

Abstract = {From 1993 to 2002, the emergence of the urban resident Minimum
   Livelihood Guarantee (MLG) system saw a major reconfiguration and
   expansion of social assistance in the People's Republic of China. The
   development of the MLG has been a complex process. The initial emergence
   and design of the MLG reflect space in the Chinese state for innovations
   and feedback in the social assistance agenda. The expansion and
   development of the MLG can be explained by the interventions of key
   policy actors. These actors pushed the MLG for a variety of different
   reasons. The resources available to these actors and the outcomes of
   their interventions were a reflection of their institutional position in
   the bureaucracy. Contributing to existing studies of Chinese social
   policy reform, this article argues that the emergence, design, and
   development of the policy reflects institutional space, constraints, and
   feedback in the Chinese policy process.},

Abstract = {Critical Terrorism Studies can be strengthened by scholarship that draws
   on a combination of critical realism (CR) and historical materialism
   (HM). CR relates epistemological relativism (we can know the social only
   indirectly through our interpretation of it) to ontological realism
   (there is a powerfully influential social reality that includes but is
   much more than our knowledge claims about it) through judgemental
   rationalism ( knowledge claims can be tested against social reality,
   although always in an indirect, interpreted and fallible way). We
   illustrate CR-informed HM's value in relation to analysing capitalism's
   constant remaking of the world, terrorism as an instrument of capitalist
   class rule and the reified thinking involved in the use of terrorism
   that it is inherently anti-emancipatory.},

Abstract = {This essay represents a reexamination of the reigning
   resistance/hegemony paradigm since it was elaborated by James C. Scott
   in the 1980s. It argues that the main problem haunting the paradigm is
   its overemphasis on the actor's experience of personal domination. Being
   deliberately bypassed is the experience of impersonal domination -
   shaped by values, traditions or the symbolic universe - when actors are
   to face and deal with local oppression. Situating the problem in a wider
   theoretical context, the author suggests that when actors have to face
   and deal with an oppressive situation in order that they may resist it
   or comply with it, they must experience both personal and impersonal
   domination pertinent to the social structure. Acta Politica (2011) 46,

Journal = {CIVIL WARS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-20},
Abstract = {The `Responsibility to Protect' (RtoP) principle represents a commitment
   to prevent and halt mass atrocity crimes. However, in his 2009 report on
   implementing the RtoP, the UN Secretary-General noted that more work was
   needed to understand the measures that states might take to exercise
   their RtoP. Given that UN peace operations are now customarily mandated
   to `protect civilians under imminent threat of physical violence', it
   would seem prudent to ask how peace operations can contribute to
   operationalising the RtoP and how the RtoP might support peacekeeping.
   This article explores the potential for implementing the RtoP through
   peace operations. It argues that the RtoP and peace operations are
   mutually reinforcing. Notwithstanding systemic challenges, peace
   operations offer a legitimate vehicle for implementing RtoP, whereas
   RtoP provides a facilitating norm for harnessing political will and
   buttressing the legitimacy and credibility of contemporary peace
   operations.},

Journal = {CONTEMPORARY POLITICS},

Pages = {411-427},
Abstract = {While NGOs reflect private initiative and voluntary action, they have
   increasingly become the primary vehicles through which many states
   deliver humanitarian aid. This study seeks to examine the relationship
   between state funded NGOs and states, using the USA as a case study.
   Does the relationship between the US and US funded NGOs result from
   pressure from NGOs on US foreign policymakers to address the
   humanitarian consequences of civil wars? Or does the relationship
   reflect one in which US funded NGOs activities in civil wars reflect
   strategic purposes in order for the USA to achieve its foreign policy
   objectives? The results reveal that US funded NGOs are more likely to be
   active in civil wars in which the USA has undertaken a military
   intervention and in civil wars that result in a large number of refugees
   and displaced people, but less likely to be active in civil wars with a
   high number of deaths.},

   is a very urgent task. It is time to fight against the normative logic

   of socialist tradition. The ``common{''} in order to become the new
   spirit of education must go along with a huge rebuilding, which will
   deal with the organization of teaching and pedagogy, the contents, as

Abstract = {For a sustained challenge to capital, working people need a clear vision
   of a socialist alternative based upon the centrality of human
   development. The concept of socialism for the twenty-first century, with
   its focus upon socialism as an organic system, a socialist triangle of
   (a) social ownership of the means of production, (b) social production
   organized by workers for (c) social needs and purposes, offers such a
   vision and points to the need to struggle to develop all three sides of
   the socialist triangle. But what does this mean internationally, given
   the vast inequality and differential access to our common social
   heritage? The paper stresses the necessity to develop a concept of
   socialist globalization to challenge capitalist globalization.},

Abstract = {Studies of policy diffusion have given insufficient attention to the
   role that characteristics of the policies themselves play in determining
   the speed of policy diffusion and the mechanisms through which diffusion
   occurs. We adopt Everett Rogers' (1983, 2004) attribute typology from
   the diffusion of innovations literature and apply it to a sample of 27
   policy innovations from the sphere of criminal justice policy in the
   U.S. states between 1973 and 2002. We find that policy attributes,
   ranging from the relative advantage of the policy over its predecessors
   to its complexity to its compatibility with past practices, affect the
   likelihood of adoption. Furthermore, policy attributes shape the extent
   to which spatial adoption patterns and learning mechanisms are relevant
   to the policy's diffusion.},

Abstract = {In this conversation Mann and Haugaard discuss Mann's four sources of
   power: military, political, economic and ideological power. It is argued
   that military and political power can have different sources, whereby
   political power is not reducible to coercion. The significance of
   ideological power is explored in relation to nationalism, `false
   consciousness', the enlightenment, and the rise of religion in the
   twenty-first century. The exchange concludes with reflections upon the
   relationship between these sources of power to globalization and current
   environmental challenges.},

Title = {Labour Flexibility: Meanings and Consequences},
Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {48},
Number = {2},
Pages = {381-402},
Abstract = {The objectives of the paper are 1) to analyse the effects of labour
   flexibility on individuals from a lifecourse perspective and 2) to know
   whether flexibility has undermined or reinforced the effects of social
   classes, education and gender on several aspects concerning the
   life-course, above all those related to employment in Spain. The
   peculiarity of the Spanish case lies in the proportion of fixed-term
   contracts. The greatest difference between these contracts and permanent
   contracts is not the job to be done, or even its temporary or permanent
   nature, but rather the lower layoff cost. The way that the Welfare State
   has introduced flexibilisation has achieved a balance of risks between
   the generations, so that there cannot be said to be clear winners or
   losers. The data indicate that the effects of flexibilisation on the
   main changes in the labour market and in demography are much more modest
   than what the hypotheses predict. Similarly, flexibilisation has not
   evened out the risks among the different social classes and educational
   levels, although it has not provoked an increase in inequality, either.},

Abstract = {At no time in history has the number of women elected to Dail Eireann
   surpassed 14 per cent of the total membership. In spite of significant
   social changes, the use of a proportional electoral system and no
   obvious bias among voters, the number of female TDs remains stubbornly
   low by international standards. This paper examines why, if the
   prospects for women's election are relatively good, so few women end up
   in public office. Using both aggregate and survey data, the issues of
   incumbency advantage, the electorate's attitudes and the candidates'
   differing experiences of the political process are explored. The
   evidence suggests that, all else equal, female candidates have as good a
   chance of being elected as their male counterparts, and the real
   difficulties in achieving equitable representation lie elsewhere, in the
   candidate emergence and nomination stages of the election game.},

Title = {Cultural Explanations of Electoral Reform: A Policy Cycle Model},
Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {34},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {531-550},
Abstract = {Electoral reform is largely regarded as an elite-level issue, dominated
   by partisan interests, where citizens are usually marginalised and
   powerless. This perspective may help to explain what specific reforms
   are enacted, but it lacks the capacity to account for when and why
   successful reforms are raised on the policy agenda. The first section
   ofthis article presents a general policy cycle model identifying
   multiple actors in the process of electoral change. It tests the
   proposition that political culture-notably citizen dissatisfaction with
   regime legitimacy-heightens the salience of institutional reform. The
   following section summarises the research design testing this
   proposition. Results are then presented. The evidence demonstrates that
   democratic aspirations are a strong, significant and robust predictor of
   the occurrence of subsequent electoral reforms. The conclusion considers
   the implications of these findings, both for theories concerning regime
   legitimacy, as well as for revising standard accounts of processes of
   institutional change.},

   infrastructure of governments, economies and militaries has potentially
   catastrophic effects. To date, however, governments are still trying to
   formulate strategic responses to this new threat. The development of a
   legal and policy framework consistent with international humanitarian

Abstract = {In acknowledgment of the demands of studying state secrecy, this chapter
   asks how novel possibilities for knowing can be fashioned. It does so in
   relation to the place of secrecy within international diplomatic and
   security negotiations associated with humanitarian disarmament. A
   conversational account is given regarding how ``cluster bombs'' become
   subject to a major international ban in 2008. Tensions, uncertainties,
   and contradictions associated with knowing and conveying matters that
   cannot be wholly known or conveyed are worked through. With these moves,
   a form of writing is sought that sensitizes readers to how absences
   figure within debates about social problems and the study of those
   debates, as well as how ignorance born out of secrecy helps secure an
   understanding of the world. Uncertainties, no-go areas, and blind spots
   are looked to as analytical and practical resources.},

Abstract = {This paper aims at showing the reality of law, or ``law in action{''},
   far from a legal belief that takes regulations as a guarantee for
   effectiveness. Law in action has to take into account a range of
   mediation and devices to assure its implementation. To prove this, we
   will focus on the research that analyzes the mobilizations of a Catalan
   association of gay and lesbian families (FLG) in the context of the
   homosexual marriages in Spain and the institutionalization of homosexual
   couples in Catalonia. We will pay attention to the actions and
   situations in which law is referred, and these range from mobilization
   to the implementation of law.},

Volume = {3},
Number = {1},
Pages = {29-64},
Abstract = {Many Latin American countries democratized between 1975 and 2000, and
   research has confirmed that contemporary Latin Americans hold democratic
   political attitudes. Using AmericasBarometer surveys of 18 countries
   from 2008, we examine the commitment of Latin Americans to three
   democratic attitudes - preference for democracy over other forms of
   government, support for general participation rights, and tolerance for
   participation by system critics. We also explore the impact of personal
   resources, crime and corruption, evaluation of system performance,
   social capital, and the sociopolitical context on democratic attitudes.
   A preference for democracy and support for citizens' participation
   rights are strong, but tolerance is lower than the other attitudes.
   Evidence is found for acculturation - that Latin Americans acquire
   democratic attitudes by living in democratic regimes and through
   education.},

Title = {Enacting the right to have rights: Jacques Ranciere's critique of Hannah
   Arendt},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Pages = {22-45},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In her influential discussion of the plight of stateless people, Hannah
   Arendt invokes the `right to have rights' as the one true human right.
   In doing so she establishes an aporia. If statelessness corresponds not
   only to a situation of rightlessness but also to a life deprived of
   public appearance, how could those excluded from politics possibly claim
   the right to have rights? In this article I examine Jacques Ranciere's
   response to Arendt's aporetic account of human rights, situating this in
   relation to his wider criticism of Arendt's conception of the political.
   According to Ranciere, Arendt depoliticizes human rights in identifying
   the human with mere life (zoe) and the citizen with the good life (bios
   politikos). For, in doing so, she takes the distinction between zoe and
   the bios politikos to be ontologically given whereas politics is
   typically about contesting how that distinction is drawn. For Ranciere
   `the human' in human rights does not refer to a life deprived of
   politics. Rather, the human is a litigious name that politicizes the
   distinction between those who are qualified to participate in politics
   and those who are not. In contrast to Arendt, Rancie` re's approach
   enables us to recognize contests over human rights, such as that of the
   sans papiers, as part and parcel of social struggles that are the core
   of political life.},

Month = {JAN-JUN},
Abstract = {Turkey's accession to the European Union (EU) has become, over the
   years, one of the most contentious issues of European integration. On
   October 3(rd) 2005, the European Commission began negotiations for its
   accession, and, although they will probably not be completed within a
   decade, its objective is the full accession to the Union. Turkey's
   accession to the EU presents challenges for both parties, but especially
   for the European Union. There are very different challenges from the
   previous accessions, indeed
   This work aims to analyze the challenges the EU will face towards
   Turkey's possible accession to the European Community. Therefore, this
   work has been divided into three sections. In the first of them,
   entitled ``Brief history of a complex negotiation{''}, the negotiation
   is briefly described. The second, ``Aspects to take into account for
   Turkey's accession to the European Union{''}, in which different
   relevant (geopolitical, economic and financial, demographic, cultural
   and religious) aspects of the possible accession are discussed: aspects
   that will have an important impact in the development and performance of
   the European Community, once Turkey's accession is fulfilled. The third
   and last section, ``Turkey's incorporating challenges{''}, discusses the
   challenges the EU will have to face with the potential accession of
   Turkey, specifically concerning four dimensions: institutional capacity,
   regional and cohesion policy, EU common security and foreign policy},

   approach to dealing with the crisis than the other organizations
   discussed, but was not successful at making strides towards achieving
   its goal'attack{[}ing] capitalism not foreigners!'. Placing hope in the
   ARP, leaders (including those in the APF) have failed to undertake a
   long-term programme to alleviate the social conditions such as poverty
   and unemployment that social movements and other analysts declare are

Abstract = {This treatise outlines the structure of migration policy forcefully
   integration policy. It explains the three traditional approaches to
   integration policy in Europe - assimilationism, multiculturalism and
   ethnic exclusivism and outlines a new approach to integration resulting
   from the current situation in Western Europe. In the context of
   immigration policy the study presents factors of its creation. It is a
   normative and philosophical background, question how the modern nations
   have been created and then the interests of nation states. More
   attention is paid to integration policy. Individual approaches are
   explained with an example of integration policy in France, Germany,
   Great Britain and the Netherlands. The text draws attention to current
   trends in migration policy. It is particularly emphasized retreat from
   previous several concepts towards a new type of integration policy,
   which is based on the individual integration of foreigners.},

   which emphasizes the political tug-o-war between the coalition of groups

   advocate for neo-liberal reforms to state structures and state policies,
   is used to plot the fortunes of the developmental state since the 1980s
   and the advent of globalization in East Asia. The elements of the Great
   Recession that influenced this battle between the two sets of collations
   are examined and the shift in the influence of the coalition supporting

Journal = {POLITICKE VEDY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Pages = {50-73},
Abstract = {The energy security is currently one of the fields where international
   community's attention is primarily focused. Several reasons can be
   identified; primarily to secure the energy sources is a crucial part of
   the economic security as such and therefore the economic strength of
   particular country. As the prices of crude oil are changing and the coal
   as such affects the environment, main attention is paid to the nuclear
   energy and its potential. The nuclear energy however contains a security
   risk and that is the possibility to acquire nuclear weapons on the side
   of the nuclear program. Nevertheless the prospective of a civilian use
   of nuclear power is great. The following article aims at the analysis of
   both of these factors inherent to the nuclear power, two countries are
   scrutinized here. Iran and North Korea are the actors focusing mainly on
   the acquirement of nuclear weapons however both countries have to deal
   with the energy shortages and therefore the civilian nuclear energy
   usage is becoming part of the game.},

Title = {Democracy promotion in Africa: the institutional context},
Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {18},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {443-461},
Abstract = {Democracy is seen by many as a viable means to rebuild the legitimacy of
   African states. However, African democracy is often based on a
   particular set of institutions which tend to concentrate power in the
   executive. A powerful president operates in a context of a minimal
   separation of powers, with few possibilities to restrain the executive,
   and a highly majoritarian party-political landscape. Democratic reforms
   and democracy assistance policies were first directed primarily at
   multiparty elections and political parties. Later donors have shifted to
   a broader approach of good governance and human rights. However, both
   the narrow electoral and the broader good governance and human rights
   approaches do not address sufficiently the institutional context of
   multi-party competition, which is characterized by the fusion of powers
   and a powerful presidency. This is a serious flaw which also limits the
   impact of current democracy promotion policies. This contribution
   suggests that democracy promoters could address this institutional gap
   by advocating for institutional reforms through which accountability in
   Africa may be increased, notably through greater inclusion of parliament
   and interest groups and of civil society actors in policy-making.
   Moreover, donors can set an example by introducing such reforms in the
   donor-recipient policy dialogue process they themselves conduct.},

Journal = {POLITIQUE EUROPEENNE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {35},
Number = {3},
Pages = {139-164},
Abstract = {The Lisbon Treaty considerably alters the presidency in EU external
   relations. In the Common Foreign and Security Policy the rotating chair
   is replaced by the long-term chairmanship of the High Representative of
   the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy (HR), while other
   areas of EU external relations remain with the rotating presidency. This
   contribution first examines the historical development of the Presidency
   in EU external relations. In line with the focus of this special issue
   it pays special attention to the position of the Presidency vis-a-vis
   other institutional players. Secondly, it examines the post-Lisbon
   situation. The double hat of the HR as chair of the Foreign Affairs
   Council and Vice President of the European Commission radically affects
   inter-institutional relations. While the HR may bring more continuity
   and leadership, the position also raises new coordination challenges:
   not only within the Council and amongst various institutions, but also
   amongst different dimensions of EU external relations.},

   Original research conducted in five commonwealth African countries
   reveals that conventional strategic approaches do not effectively

   African cases. An alternative theoretical framework, focusing on the
   extent to which leaders face acute personal insecurities and the extent
   to which the courts represent a threat to power holders, proves more

Title = {Participatory Deliberation. and then? The European Citizen Consultation
   Experiment in 2009},
Journal = {POLITIQUE EUROPEENNE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {34},
Number = {2},
Pages = {135-166},
Abstract = {This paper sketches out the political issues raised by the European
   Citizen Consultations (ECC) 2009 for European communication. Under the
   aegis of the European Commission, various kinds of ``Europe
   entrepreneurs{''} (associations, businesses, think tanks, NGOs...) were
   involved in designing and organizing the ECC. This process involved both
   national face-to-face consultations based on the ``mini-public{''}
   principle, and web-deliberation platforms in each 27 member country.
   Citizens were invited to produce recommendations on the economic and
   social future of Europe, intended for MEPs before the European elections
   in June 2009.
   The analysis of such experience highlights the binding nature of the
   political architecture of the EU on the implementation of deliberative
   democracy at a European level, which leads to the blurring of boundaries
   between public communication and participatory deliberation to generate
   EU Community support. It also shows the drawbacks of European
   communication, the importance of mediators whose actions may be
   contradictory in practice, or the unexpected behavior of citizens when
   taking part in the various phases of ECC. They were indeed sometimes
   reluctant to express their opinions within the framework defined by the
   entrepreneurs who sought as much to educate them on the virtues of
   Europe as to reveal the ephemeral and fragile development of their sense
   of European belonging.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL POWER},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {4},
Number = {1},
Pages = {127-144},
Abstract = {Who rules the European Union? The answers of the main schools of
   European Union (EU) theory diverge: neofunctionalism highlights
   function, group pressure, entrepreneurial leadership; international
   relations realism privileges state interests; and neo-institutionalisms
   favor the influence of incentive structures, organizational processes,
   or norms. These explanations reflect different concepts of power,
   producing irreconcilable disputes that expose the conflict among
   meta-theoretical methods in the warranting of knowledge. In confronting
   this dilemma, Deweyan pragmatism provides a tool for investigating the
   way meta-theoretical concepts ground ideas of power. Using this to
   examine the effects of philosophical assumptions in selected theories of
   the EU integration and policy-making demonstrates the impact of
   meta-concepts in shaping the analysis of power and calls for an
   alternative philosophical approach for studying who rules the EU.},

Abstract = {This essay offers a discourse analytical study of the trajectory of the
   European Court of Justice's case law regarding the social rights of
   non-employed persons, which began in 1998 and has established its
   centrepieces in the meantime. The text aims at demonstrating that
   societal struggles turn into legal ones, once they enter the arena of
   European law. I argue in particular that before the backdrop of the
   crisis of neoliberal hegemony the Court of Justice integrates different
   forces into a new hegemonic legal project, which points towards a
   European social union and provides first evidence of a potential `state
   project Europe'.(1)},

Abstract = {The authors explore whether the federal courts act as
   countermajoritarian institutions by investigating the influence of
   public mood on decision making in the U.S. Courts of Appeals from 1961
   to 2002. The results indicate that public opinion affects courts of
   appeals decision making indirectly through judicial replacements and
   institutional constrains from Congress, but the authors fail to uncover
   evidence that courts of appeals judges respond directly to changes in
   public opinion. They conclude that, absent membership turnover in the
   circuit or in Congress, the courts of appeals are not responsive to the
   will of the public.},

Abstract = {The gradual withdrawal of young voters from the active electorate is one
   of the strongest and most important factors in accounting for declining
   voter turnout in Canada and other western democracies. Because
   qualitative approaches may be better able to probe the reasons
   underlying these changing values and attitudes than traditional mass
   surveys, we used the popular social media site Facebook during the 2008
   federal election campaign to collect data on young people's perceptions
   of electoral politics in the context of their civic obligations. This
   medium proved to be a valuable and productive research tool. Based on
   this project, we argue that non-voting tends to be seen as a more
   socially acceptable behaviour to young voters than is typically found in
   the thinking of older cohorts, and that this may be connected to
   changing concepts of the obligations of citizenship.},

Abstract = {Public opinion is often said to affect the distribution of powers in
   federal systems, the legitimacy of the orders of government, and system
   functions. However, there is little comparative empirical and
   longitudinal research on public attitudes toward federalism. Using
   several years of surveys conducted in Canada, Mexico, and the United

   units, trust in the various orders of government, government value,
   power distribution, and federal political culture. We find many
   similarities, as well as significant differences, between public
   attitudes toward federalism issues in these North American federations.},

Abstract = {In this article the authors measure a phenomenon they name ``exit
   talk{''}: the undertheorized pressures that second-place contenders for
   presidential nominations face to exit the race. Content analysis of
   media exit talk from the 2008 Clinton candidacy compared with that of
   key comparators from other modern presidential campaigns suggests that
   Clinton experienced greater levels of exit talk than her historical
   comparators, though less explicit pressure to exit than was exerted on
   Ronald Reagan in 1976. The authors also find that a higher percentage of
   Clinton exit talk was unattributed to its source. They investigate the
   potential causes for these findings and recommend further study of
   whether this heightened pressure to exit constitutes an unexamined
   hurdle for female presidential contenders.},

Abstract = {We examine how political campaigns influence individuals' levels of
   correct, incorrect, and don't know responses and the gender gap in
   political knowledge during the 2000 American presidential campaign.
   Using data from the 2000 National Annenberg Election Survey (NAES), we
   demonstrate that as the campaign progresses the electorate provides more
   correct answers and fewer incorrect answers. Moreover, the political
   campaign significantly reduces (and possibly eliminates) the direct
   effect of sex on political knowledge. While the political campaign
   decreases the number of incorrect answers provided by both men and
   women, the number of correct answers provided by women increases. Our
   findings highlight the importance of the political campaign in
   determining relative levels of political knowledge for men and women.

Abstract = {This article analyzes the advocacy campaign and the policy process
   surrounding the International Violence Against Women Act (I-VAWA) in the
   United States and explains the mobilization of this campaign and its
   political outcomes to date. The main question the article explores is:
   How can we interpret the effort by advocacy groups in the United States
   to use the domestic political process to advance their international
   goals? The findings suggest that the literature on norm and policy
   diffusion as well as the structure of political opportunities and
   framing, both variables identified by social movement theorists, can
   help us understand the I-VAWA campaign and its strategies and
   achievements to date. The article interprets the policy process
   surrounding I-VAWA as an effort by rooted cosmopolitans to use favorable
   domestic political opportunities and strategic framing to diffuse
   international norms and standards.},

Abstract = {Resolving a controversy on the relationship of development to
   democratization, this article expands the time period under study with
   panel data running from the early nineteenth century ( a time where
   hardly any country was democratic) to the end of the twentieth century,
   and shows a positive and significant effect of income on the likelihood
   of democratic transitions and democratic consolidations. The estimations
   hold after I control for country and time effects and instrument for
   income. Results reveal that the effect of income varies across income
   levels and across eras. First, income has a decreasingmarginal effect on
   democratization. In already developed ( and democratized) countries, any
   extra growth has no further effect on the level of democracy. Second,
   the structure of the international system affects the resources and
   strategies of pro-authoritarian and pro-democratic factions in client
   states. The proportion of liberal democracies peaks under international
   orders governed by democratic hegemons, such as the post-Cold War
   period, and bottoms out when authoritarian great powers such as the Holy
   Alliance control the world system.},

Abstract = {Addressing historic injustice involves a struggle against absence. This
   article reflects on the foundations of that challenge, on absence and
   justice. I ask what it means to address the absent victims of deadly
   injustice given the distance of time and death that separates us from
   them. This topic embraces a wide swath of events of interest to students
   of politics. Some are as recent as the Rwandan genocide; others are by
   now historical: the Holocaust or slavery in antebellum America. All have
   in common that they and their victims are distant from us, a separation
   that makes doing them justice deeply perplexing. In response, I sketch
   an argument that the absent victims of injustice are not nullities but
   retain a status, a presence as claimants on justice that defines our
   efforts to address the wrongs done them.},

Abstract = {A common thought is that political participation must be equally high
   among different social groups - such as women and men or various
   socioeconomic groups - in order for political equality to be fulfilled.
   This approach has, however, been criticized for being too crude. Several
   scholars argue that one must also study the reasons behind group
   differences in participation. If these differences are explained by
   differences in resources - and not political motivation - political
   equality is threatened, as this points to structural inequalities
   determining participatory differences. Using this perspective, I make an
   empirical investigation into the political participation of women and
   men in Sweden, a country known for unusually far-reaching political
   gender equality. In spite of this, men devote more of their political
   activities to areas of production, such as questions relating to working
   life, and I find that this difference may be explained by a male
   advantage in political resources (civic skills, primarily). The
   conclusion is that political equality has not yet been fully realized
   between women and men in Sweden. Hence, future studies should consider
   separating between different policy areas, when empirically evaluating
   the status of political equality. Quantitative methods are used in the
   empirical analyses. Acta Politica (2011) 46, 380-399.

Abstract = {Much has been said about the institutional determinants of transitional
   justice (TJ), yet scholars still know little about the determinants of
   citizens' attitudes toward restorative policies aimed at addressing
   human rights violations of the past. This article draws on an original
   survey of a representative sample of Spanish citizens conducted in 2008.
   One year earlier, the Spanish socialist government had approved the
   so-called Law of Historical Memory, aimed at providing restitution for
   victims of the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) and the Francoist
   dictatorship (1939-1975). We analyze individual-level attitudes toward a
   set of TJ policies (i.e., truth commissions, trials, and symbolic
   reparations) in a comprehensive overview of the field. We study the
   effects of different sets of variables: individual sociodemographic and
   ideological factors, family and socialization variables, and
   context-related factors. Individual ideology, family victimization
   during the dictatorship, and regional context appear highly relevant in
   explaining individual attitudes toward TJ policies.},

   It focuses on the necessity to analyse slavery and subjection on the

Abstract = {Failure to take into account `strategic retirement' leads to inflated
   estimates of the incumbent electoral advantage. The one attempt to
   address this issue in the context of US House elections implies that
   much of the supposed incumbency advantage and most of its presumed
   increase over time are illusory (Cox and Katz, 2002). This paper
   identifies possible problems with the Cox and Katz (2002) method and
   develops a new approach based on simulating the counterfactual condition
   of incumbents standing for re-election rather than retiring. The results
   show that when the bias induced by strategic retirement is removed, much
   of the apparent incumbency advantage and its increase over time remain
   evident.},

Journal = {POLITY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {43},
Number = {4},
Pages = {409-431},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Much of contemporary constitutional theory underestimates the
   disharmonies within and disharmonies of constitutional orders. This
   article examines the dissonance characterizing constitutional identity
   that is present either in the disjunction between a constitution and the
   social order within which it functions, or between commitments internal
   to the document itself From very early on, American framing of rights
   has revealed a tension between individual and collective meanings,
   between rights of persons and rights of the people. This article
   explores the manifestation of this tension in the evolution of the
   vexing concept of unenumerated rights. While expressive of the
   particularities of the American constitutional experience, the story
   illustrates a broader developmental process that is endemic to the
   constitutional condition. Polity (2011) 43, 409-431.

Journal = {ASIAN POLITICS \& POLICY},

Abstract = {This article examines why Japan decided to promote an international
   development non-governmental organization (IDNGO) policy in 1989. While
   Reimann's 2003 and 2010 analyses argue that international norms and
   pressure account for the establishment of this policy, I find that
   domestic actors' interpretations and policy processes significantly
   contributed to producing it. I argue that the IDNGO policy reflects a
   shift in policy-makers' perceptions of Japanese identity froma
   ``merchant nation{''} to a ``leader.{''} This reconstruction entails new
   sets of interests regarding building a positive global reputation and
   friendly relationships not only with other states, but also with
   ``grassroots{''} citizens at home and abroad. This study highlights that
   identity is changeable and that domestic policy processes and actors
   need to be taken into more serious consideration. Demonstrating the
   importance of NGOs and grassroots people in constructing Japanese state
   identity, this article suggests that targets of recognition in
   international relations go beyond the state level.},

Abstract = {One of the most important characteristic features of today's digital age
   is the current and spread globalization, which has multi- political,
   cultural, social and economic aspects. The concept of globalization is a
   dialectic phenomenon that is seen by many writers as a necessary evil.
   In the present paper researchers explain the idea that globalization
   plays a real role in reducing the gap between the North and South,
   particularly issues related to economic gaps in order to achieve justice
   and the interests of the people of these States.
   The current paper attempts to clarify the current international factors
   stimulating this dialog and the suitability of the global climate
   participating in enhancing the efforts behind the dialogue. The paper
   focuses on issues related to dialogue in the context of globalization,
   the extent of the role of globalization in reducing the gap between the
   North and South, and the dominant role of the United States in this
   process.
   The current paper concludes that the globalization with all of its
   instruments reflects the U.S. hegemony over the whole process of
   dialogue between the states of North and South.},

Abstract = {In this article, we explore changes in state-local relations. Our
   interest is the degree to which states have devolved power and authority
   to their localities ... or not. From our empirical tests, we conclude
   that although centralization was the dominant trend from the mid-1950s
   until the mid-1980s, the pattern since then has been somewhat uneven and
   variable across states. A survey of city managers supports a finding of
   a loss of local power at the hands of the states, but a survey of
   legislators offers an alternative perspective. We conclude with a
   discussion of the meaning and implications of state centralization and
   suggestions about how the concept could be captured more
   comprehensively.},

Abstract = {This article tests two competing explanations of presidential
   vetoes-sequential veto bargaining (SVB) and blame game politics.
   According to the SVB model, vetoes are the result of uncertainty about
   the president's true preferences on legislation. According to the blame
   game model, vetoes result because Congress deliberately passes bills the
   president will veto as a means of communicating relative positions to
   outside audiences. This article implements a test of whether a veto was
   expected at the time a bill achieved final passage, reasoning that if a
   bill was seen as sure to be vetoed at the time of passage, the veto
   could not be the product of SVB. The evidence points toward blame game
   politics as a far more important cause of vetoes than SVB.},

Volume = {7},
Number = {2},
Pages = {227-248},
Month = {FAL},
Abstract = {Institutional theories of party cohesion may be divided into ``nomina
   tion theories{''} and ``structure of the executive theories{''}. The
   former seek explanations of cohesion in the way nominations are
   conducted, predicting that de-centralized and inclusive nominations will
   reduce party cohesion.
   The latter attempt to explain cohesion by reference to the structure of
   the executive, and predict that parliamentary govern ment will increase
   cohesion. Party cohesion in the Icelandic Althingi has, hitherto, not
   been extensively studied. In this article, large amounts of data are
   explored to test hypotheses derived from the two theoretical approaches.
   The analysis is based on roll-call data dating back to 1961 and
   electronic voting records from 1991 onwards. The main conclusion is that
   party cohesion is at a high level in Iceland, despite decentralized and
   inclusive nominations, and hypotheses derived from nomination theories
   therefore find no support in our data. Hypotheses derived from
   ``structure of the executive theories{''} fare much better and the main
   reason for high party cohesion in Iceland seems to be parliamentary
   government. Various features of our data, however, encourage us not to
   ignore other contextual features affecting party cohesion, which neither
   of the two institutional theories can account for satisfactorily.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses implications of Information Communication
   Technologies (ICT) growth on the new political discourse in Pakistan.
   The power play between the civil society and General Pervez Musharraf
   set new directions for Pakistani politics in 2007. This paper presents a
   critical discourse analysis of the controversy surrounding Musharraf's
   attempt to continue holding the offices of army chief and president of
   Pakistan simultaneously. He declared ``army uniform is part of my
   skin{''}. The civil society's online participation in the political
   process and the street protests that resulted forced him to flee the
   country. The paper offers an analysis of ICT growth and politics in
   Pakistan and provides an understanding of how ICT growth has shaped the
   political landscape in Pakistan. Social and electronic media have
   emerged as powerful political players and have influenced Pakistani
   politics and policy development. This critical discourse analysis
   explains political changes during 2007 that are generally attributed to
   ICT growth. The results indicate that ICT growth plays an important role
   in achieving harmony, coordination, social change, justice, and
   transparency of government.},

Abstract = {In recent years, critical infrastructure utilities have been faced with
   conflicting attitudes and cultural differences of where SCADA
   (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) and IT fit into an
   organizational structure. This lack of understanding between SCADA, IT
   processes, and business operations remains a concern for many utilities
   within the SCADA community. The importance of SCADA and IT relationships
   is an area of the SCADA landscape that is often unrecognised. This paper
   examines the results and findings of a SCADA and IT relationship survey
   that was undertaken to identify where SCADA operations fit within
   organizations around the world. It describes several proposed models
   that define the role and responsibility of SCADA within an
   organizational structure. It also presents a concept model for SCADA
   security responsibility and identifies key observations of SCADA and IT
   working together at the INL Control System Cyber Security Training in
   Idaho, USA. The main findings of the research suggest that clear defined
   roles and responsibilities for SCADA operations and SCADA security need
   to be established and secondly, that immediate cultural driven change is
   required in order to improve SCADA and IT relationships.},

Abstract = {In a work on autonomy and legitimacy in the Latin American public
   university, two university nets stand out due to their orientation,

   inter-institutional project that pretends to response to XXI century
   challenges, which is not going to be a part of this paper due to its
   scarce results until now.
   The UDAL is the region's only university organization that from its
   beginning have had the participation of the most representative Latin
   American public universities, such as the National Autonomous University
   of Mexico, Sao Paulo University, Buenos Aires University and the
   National University of Colombia. Until a few years ago, the University

Abstract = {A growing literature has focused attention on `expressive' rather than
   `instrumental' behaviour in political settings, particularly voting. A
   common criticism of the expressive idea is that it is ad hoc and lacks
   both predictive and normative bite. No clear definition of expressive
   behaviour has gained wide acceptance yet, and no detailed understanding
   of the range of foundations of specific expressive motivations has
   emerged. This article provides a foundational discussion and definition
   of expressive behaviour accounting for a range of factors. The content
   of expressive choice - distinguishing between identity-based, moral and
   social cases - is discussed and related to the specific theories of
   expressive choice in the literature. There is also a discussion of the
   normative and institutional implications of expressive behaviour.},

Abstract = {Japan, South Korea, and China have all achieved high economic growth
   rates in a relatively short period of time; they also have shared
   values. The phenomenon of rapid economic growth in a short period,
   however, raises questions about government effectiveness in managing
   sociopolitical issues such as corruption, human rights, and crime. By
   using the 2003 AsiaBarometer surveys, this article examines citizens'
   perceptions about government effectiveness on the issues of corruption,
   human rights, and crime as well as the economy in the three countries.
   It then looks at the impact of said perceptions on trust in political
   institutions such as the central government, the legal system, and the
   legislature. The multilevel estimates suggest that effective management
   of the economy primarily affects trust in the central government; how
   the government deals with corruption primarily affects trust in
   parliament; whereas the management of human rights as well as crime
   reflects on trust in the legal system.},

Abstract = {Patricia Legouge, Roland Pfefferkorn, Inequalities between men and
   women: advances and hurdles
   Despite of the transformations of the social relations between men and
   women, there are still inequalities in a lot of sectors. Women are more
   and more the victims of the worsening of the situation in the job market
   and of the degradation of employement conditions. The access to certain
   places of work or to a higher level in the hierarchy is still difficult.
   Those who are engaged in caring the dependant people are more and more
   migrants that are coming from the poor countries. The unequal
   repartition of house working is still a cause for discrimination in
   finding a job. Violence against women is still one of the most brutal
   manifestation of the inequalities between men and women. The movement
   towards a real equality is partial and contradictory.},

Abstract = {The success of modern democratic societies is dependent on the
   spontaneous and unforced support of the members of these societies; that
   is, on their identification with the communities to which they belong.
   In order to reinforce the sense of adherence on the part of members of a
   modern democratic community, a certain moderate level of patriotic
   sentiment is required. This sentiment should be conveyed (and gained)
   during the process of education, and should of course also arise as a
   part of belonging to a reasonably successful society with which an
   individual shares certain common traits. In this article, we define the
   notion of patriotism and place it in a broader context, namely from the
   perspective of globalisation, a perspective from which the question of
   whether patriotism represents an obstacle to cosmopolitanism and
   successful European integration cannot be avoided. In the empirical part
   of this article, the emphasis, aided by the selected parameters, is on
   the presentation of the results of comparative studies performed in 2008
   and 2010 among primary school pupils and secondary school students. This
   presentation enables us to analyse the degree of patriotism among the
   young in Slovenia.},

Abstract = {Most research on political tolerance relying on the `least-liked' group
   approach has painted a bleak picture of low and feeble levels of
   tolerance. An alternative approach, permitting an evaluation of the
   breadth of tolerance, is combined with the use of survey experiments to
   demonstrate that tolerance varies considerably across target groups.
   Specifically, the formation of tolerance judgements is shown to differ
   depending on a group's association with violent and non-democratic
   behaviour. Thus, tolerance is high and resilient towards groups that
   themselves observe democratic rights - even if these groups are disliked
   or feared. The theory suggests that this is caused by norms of
   reciprocity and, contrary to extant research, this article shows that
   within the limits set by these norms, tolerance is strong.},

Abstract = {Major elements of the Obama administration's health care, education,
   economic recovery, climate change, and financial reform initiatives have
   important intergovernmental consequences. This article reviews this
   broad intergovernmental agenda and analyzes its potential to shape the
   contours and future direction of American federalism. Utilizing a policy
   instruments framework, it examines trends in fiscal federalism, federal
   mandating, preemption, and other policy tools. We conclude that the most
   significant feature of President Obama's approach to intergovernmental
   relations thus far may be his hybrid model of federal policy innovation
   and leadership, which mixes money, mandates, and flexibility in new and
   distinctive ways. At the same time, political constraints on the scope
   and sustainability of the Obama administration's intergovernmental
   policies may limit this strategy's future development.},

Volume = {34},
Number = {2},
Pages = {101-122},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Given the vast amounts of research on party competition, party strategy,
   political communication and electoral campaigning, surprisingly little
   attention has been devoted to the study of national party elites'
   perceptions of voters and public opinion. This article argues that the
   mindset of leading party officials, and more specifically their
   perceptions of voter and public opinion rationality, driving forces and
   knowledge, is a much-neglected explanation for why parties adopt the
   electoral strategies they do. Analysed here are unique internal party
   documents from two Swedish parties during the period 1964 to 1991: the
   Social Democratic Party and the Conservative Party. A simple analytic
   framework is proposed for the study of party elite perceptions of voters
   and public opinion. In contrast to the overwhelmingly pessimistic view
   of voter rationality that still prevails in contemporary research, the
   findings presented in this article suggest that national party elites in
   general have had a surprisingly positive view of voters and, in
   particular, public opinion. Perceptions of voters and public opinion
   were largely unaffected by the parties' electoral fortunes, and did not
   become gloomier over time.},

   in three successive East Mediterranean contexts, each including the
   previous one, this essay seeks to marshal evidence in support of
   arguments on the continuing relevance of nationalism as a force shaping
   and therefore as a factor in understanding the contemporary world. It is
   also suggested, on the basis of the evidence discussed, that as a moral
   doctrine, nationalism remains dubious and can be a destructive ideology.},

Journal = {STATE POLITICS \& POLICY QUARTERLY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Pages = {198-222},

Abstract = {One common critique of direct democracy posits that minority rights are
   endangered by institutions like ballot initiatives and referenda.
   Empirical research testing this claim, however, has produced conflicting
   results that leave the question of direct democracy's effect on minority
   rights open to debate. This study extends previous research by providing
   a more direct test of this criticism-it compares anti-minority policy
   proposals from direct democracy states to similar proposals from states
   without direct democracy institutions. The author examines both ballot
   proposals and traditional legislative bills to account for both the
   direct and indirect effects of direct democracy. Analyzing anti-minority
   proposals from all 50 states from 1995 to 2004 shows that direct
   democracy states are more likely to pass these proposals than states
   without direct democracy institutions.},

Abstract = {Although campaign strategy often, and perhaps increasingly, emphasizes

   whether the balance of Democratic and Republican voters depends on the
   balance of campaign activity, the popularity of the incumbent president,
   and the state of the economy. Drawing on time-series cross-sectional
   data from state exit polls, we demonstrate that the partisan composition
   of voters depends on campaign activity more than on the political and

Abstract = {This article highlights that both structure and agency were important in
   the successful creation of the social movement organization, Attac
   France. The combination of three favorable structural factors - the
   existence of aggrieved individuals, the presence of movement
   entrepreneurs with resources and the existence of a large opportunity
   for mobilization - constituted a necessary condition for the emergence
   of Attac. However, these structural factors did not create Attac.
   Rather, fruitful interactions between the movement entrepreneurs (mainly
   the editorial team of Le Monde Diplomatique) and the potential recruits
   (mostly the readership of Le Monde Diplomatique) allowed for the swift
   creation of the organization. Thus, what created Attac was a successful
   communication between `masses' and `elites', their agreement on goals,
   and on organizational setup.},

Abstract = {For decades, the Polish view of Germany was fatalistic: Some believed
   that the two nations were ensnared in enmity. Others lamented Poland's
   peripheral situation in Europe. Still others complained about the
   inequality of developments that hindered cooperation. This fatalism is
   now pass. The Euro crisis, growing scepticism vis-a-vis the European
   Union, and the sputtering of the German-French motor show that the old
   logic of integration no longer applies, that old perspectives no longer
   work. This opens up the chance for Poland and Germany to act as a motor
   for a new ``Europeanisation of Europe{''}. Possible fields of
   cooperation are economic and monetary policy, energy and environmental
   policy.},

Pages = {483-511},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Why does the Supreme Court avoid deciding cases it accepts for review?
   In this article, I contend that the Court uses procedural access
   doctrines such as standing, ripeness, and mootness to sidestep
   constitutional cases when confronted with certain internal and external
   pressures. Using data from 1946 to 2001, the results suggest that the
   Court utilizes procedural tools to dismiss constitutional cases when
   preference heterogeneity on the Court increases and when the justices
   are confronted with issues about which groups feel strongly and are
   deeply divided. Although the Court does not appear to be influenced by
   the threat of political opposition, it is more reluctant to resolve
   disputes when members of Congress file an amicus brief. The results
   offer a first glimpse into how often the Court invokes the ``passive
   virtues.{''} They also have implications for our understanding of agenda
   setting, decision-making in access cases, and normative constitutional
   theory.},

Abstract = {Since the conclusion of the 1991 Treaty on Neighbourly Relations,
   Germany and Poland have come a long, long way on the road to
   understanding. But mutual perceptions within each country's society are
   still instable: In times of political tension, old prejudices and fears
   are easily resuscitated and politically instrumentalised. Public
   diplomacy and foreign cultural policy depend on the media to break down
   negative perceptions. Yet much of the media's reporting is insufficient,
   based on stereotypes, or fixated on conflict. This is counterproductive.},

Abstract = {The challenges of teaching introductory-level U. S. politics to
   reluctant audiences are well known and widely lamented. This article
   investigates the pedagogical potential of political satire, specifically
   The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, in engaging students in this
   tough-to-teach course. Based on a review of available literature and
   student survey data from the fall 2008 term, I argue that using this
   popular program in the classroom can enhance an introductory U. S.
   politics course. A review of both these survey data and student papers
   based on the program suggests promising possibilities for encouraging
   students' political engagement and critical-thinking skills. This
   preliminary examination demonstrates that further study on the program's
   potential both for student engagement and student learning outcomes is
   warranted.},

Abstract = {Today's entering college students have the advantage of a lifetime of
   computer use. Education scholars and professionals claim that such
   exposure makes these students the most prepared ever to enter college.
   It cannot be argued that the advent of the Web, and Web 2.0 has placed
   at students' fingertips great works of literature, art, and science. It
   also cannot be argued that despite all this opportunity, students enter
   college writing with less precision than at any time in the last
   century. The two facts are reconcilable because (1) students map the
   world of technology differently than we do; and (2) they live in a
   digital culture different from our own. Until we understand that our
   perception of computers and technology is vastly different from our
   students, we cannot understand why they do what they do, and they will
   never understand what we want of them. This article argues that unless
   we change our pedagogy of technology, students and faculty will continue
   to be frustrated at poor performance, plagiarism, and misunderstandings
   about what each expects of the other.},

Abstract = {Despite a large body of experimental data demonstrating consistent group
   outcomes in social dilemmas, a close look at individual behavior at the
   micro level reveals a more complicated story. From round to round,
   individual behavior appears to be almost random. Using a combination of
   formal deduction and agent-based simulations, we argue that any theory
   of individual choice that accounts for the observed behavior of real
   people is likely to require 1) premises of probabilistic choice, 2)
   preferences that are a function of others' previous behavior (i.e.,
   context dependent), and 3) preferences that are other-regarding rather
   than simply self-interested. We present a model that fits the
   requirements.},

Abstract = {This article contrasts three visions of political economy that appear in
   the writings of Keynes, Hayek, and Polanyi, and discusses their
   relevance to current debates over economic policy in the United States.
   Keynes proposed optimizing market practices through technocratic
   governance. In recent decades, this influential approach has proven
   vulnerable to the revival of Hayek's laissez-faire arguments. Polanyi,
   by contrast, introduced a framework that criticizes both laissezfake
   conceptions and the technocratic approach pioneered by Keynes. Because
   of its emphasis on democratic participation, Polanyi's reasoning
   provides the building blocks for a new type of contemporary progressive
   politics. Polity (2011) 43, 264-286. doi:10.1057/pol.2010.29; published

   Theories of British Politics},
Journal = {PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {64},
Number = {2},
Pages = {263-280},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This article suggests that political fictions can play a significant
   role for citizens in permitting them to imagine how key processes work
   within polities. Using the concept of `vernacular theory', it explores
   how politicians' behaviour, the operation of British political
   institutions and the country's external relations are theorised across a
   range of films and television programmes in the three decades since
   1979. The article also attempts to account for and assess the vernacular
   theories observed. It concludes that while these fictions all too
   frequently theorise a dysfunctional political system and depict
   self-interested and incompetent politicians, we should not isolate or
   overstate the potency of vernacular theories, nor neglect the
   responsibilities of elected politicians in relation to their fictional
   counterparts.},

Abstract = {While there is a growing literature on the factors linked to the power
   held by leaders in state legislatures, the complexity of leadership
   power as a concept makes assessing it difficult. The author demonstrates
   that measures of formal leadership power derived from the written rules
   are uncorrelated with survey measures capturing legislators' own
   assessments of their leader's strength. These differences have practical
   importance, with each type of measure yielding different substantive
   findings in models predicting leadership power.},

Abstract = {The economic crisis has revealed the extent to which sustaining the key
   tenets of the `Common Sense Revolution', implemented by the Conservative
   government of Premier Mike Harris, have eroded the fiscal capacity of
   Ontario. The proposal to freeze public sector wages and the ensuing
   consultation with public sector unions and employers in the
   spring/summer of 2010 signal Ontario is about to return to the rollback
   neoliberalism that dominated the 1990s. The difference between now and
   then is the more defensive posture of organized labour and the limited
   capacities that exist to resist such an assault.},

Abstract = {Although scholars have identified political talk radio (PTR) as an
   important site of political socialization, the current literature has
   largely failed to examine the political relevance of PTR's rhetorical
   strategies and has virtually ignored Canadian PTR altogether. This
   article addresses these gaps by analyzing Adler On Line, Canada's only
   nationally syndicated commercial PTR program, to show that how Canadian
   PTR talks, particularly its use of populist rhetoric, plays a central
   role in establishing what type of political deliberation and debate is
   possible within it. Divided into two main sections, the article first
   explores how Adler On Line renders a particular epistemological
   framework authoritative. The second section then analyzes the rules and
   norms of political expression and debate encouraged by the show's style
   of argutainment debate. The article concludes with a more speculative
   evaluation of the practical consequences as well as the theoretical and
   normative implications of these discursive practices.},

Abstract = {I develop a game-theoretic model of an interaction between an
   antiterrorist agency and a terrorist organization to analyze how the
   probability of a terrorist attack varies when the level of privacy
   protections changes. I derive two implications. First, privacy and
   security from terrorism need not be in conflict: when accounting for
   strategic interactions, reducing privacy protections does not
   necessarily increase security from terrorism. Second, and more
   important, the antiterrorist agency will always want less privacy. The
   very agency whose expertise affords it disproportionate influence on
   policy making will prefer a reduction in privacy protections even when
   that reduction harms security from terrorism. The analysis has
   implications for understanding the relationship between government
   powers and civil liberties in the context of terrorism prevention and
   times of emergencies more generally.},

   on the political map only in the 1950s. Covered by a dense net of

   offered a fabulous projection surface on which the ``socialist

   exclusive rights to mining raw materials in the central Arctic. The
   United Nations' Convention on the Law of the Sea determines which

   If a coastal state wants to exercise sovereign rights over the
   continental shelf beyond 200 sea miles, it must provide bathymetric,
   geodesic, geophysical, and geological data showing that the natural
   extension of its territory stretches beyond this legally determined
   boundary. Russia has failed in an appeal to the Commission on the Limits
   of the Continental Shelf, but is preparing a new appeal with better

Abstract = {The first section of this paper establishes the rationale for a

   global changes in the dominant mode of production, exchange,
   distribution and social reproduction, and the main specific
   socioeconomic circumstances in the European Union. In the second
   section, the main theories on the phenomenon of social solidarity are
   briefly discussed, as they pertain to the European labour movement. The
   third section looks at the limitations of the ideology, practice and
   institutionalised structures of `social partnership', as a starting
   point for the fourth section, in which an account of the main existing
   cross-border union strategies is provided. The final section identifies
   and discusses some of the more democratic and counter-hegemonic
   strategies, and summarises the main findings.},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Assuming that parties compete along a single left-right axis, most
   researchers assessing the impact of party positions on voting behaviour
   have typically tested whether the distance or proximity between voters'
   and party positions on left-right issues affects party choice or, less
   often, aggregate election outcomes. This piece of research suggests that
   the impact of other value orientations, namely materialism versus
   post-materialism, on election outcomes should be compared with the
   impact of those values representing the so-called industrial stage of
   development in West European societies. It then estimates models of vote
   share for each one of the main European party families (Socialists,
   Christian Democrats, Conservatives, Liberals, Left, Greens, Far Right)
   based on party distances from the average voter on a `left-right' and a
   `materialism post-materialism' scale. Model building aims at testing the
   hypothesis that the vote share of parties belonging to `new politics'
   party families is significantly related to their proximity advantage on
   the materialism post-materialism value orientation. Comparative European

   Methodological pitfalls and pathways},

Abstract = {Before the early 2000s, research on Europeanization and globalization
   developed largely independently of each other. Since then a limited, yet
   increasing, number of studies have shown an interest in investigating
   and differentiating between the domestic implications of European
   integration known as Europeanization and trends which are usually seen
   as having a broader global application including market liberalization,
   the construction of global institutions and policies. While research
   concerned with domestic change in the face of European integration and
   globalization in itself is a reaction to pressing epistemological
   concerns within the Europeanization literature, this in-the-making
   research agenda is also faced with a number of methodological
   challenges. This article deals with some of the most pressing
   methodological challenges we face when conducting empirical research and
   moving towards more comprehensive accounts of domestic change. Drawing
   on methodologies known from comparative politics and discourse analysis,
   the article argues in favour of three methodological moves: (1) from
   top-down towards bottom-up methodological set-ups; (2) from
   counterfactual analysis towards compound temporal comparative and
   cross-country research designs; and (3) from hypothesis tests towards
   multiple theoretical analysis. Comparative European Politics (2011) 9,

Abstract = {This article investigates the forms of respect and responsiveness that
   must be present in the process of practical reason. Drawing upon Jurgen
   Habermas' discourse theory and his incidental remarks about aesthetics,
   I identify two modes of respect. The first is the mutual respect and
   equality that emerges in the process of coming to agreement on proposed
   norms; the second is the call to infinite responsibility that emerges in
   opening to the transcendent character of others. However, Habermas makes
   an error in treating these two types of response as appropriate for
   different classes of beings when he suggests that mutual respect is
   appropriate for humans, but asymmetry is appropriate when humans deal
   with animals or others who are incapable of communicative action.
   Rather, drawing upon the work of Emmanuel Levinas, I argue that both
   responses are always present in all encounters with the world. There is
   therefore an aporia at the heart of the process of practical reason: the
   responsiveness required in the exercise of practical reason demands that
   participants be open not just to another's opinions and claims, but also
   to precisely that which is not understood, which entails the idea of
   infinite responsibility. It is the movement between these orientations
   that enacts the main features of ethical life. Contemporary Political

Abstract = {The ``party paradox{''} thesis claims that in the context of the legal
   corporate governance reforms of the 1990s, which aimed at adjusting
   national corporate governance systems to the ``finance capitalism{''} of
   the Anglo-American type, center-left parties promoted proshareholder
   corporate governance reforms, whereas center-right parties opposed such
   reforms. Based on case studies of Switzerland, Sweden, and the
   Netherlands, this article shows that this thesis does not apply to two
   of these cases: In Sweden and the Netherlands a broad coalition uniting
   center-right and center-left parties opposed-with considerable
   success-proshareholder reforms. Therefore, the author argues that
   firm-level explanations of the ``party paradox{''} are insufficient to
   understand the variance in center-left preferences across different
   cases. Instead, the historical role of labor in different countries is
   critical in the formation of center-left preferences. Where labor was
   not excluded from the formation of corporate governance structures,
   center-left support for proshareholder reform was weak.},

Abstract = {In comparison with other Arctic regions, Russia's Arctic is considerably
   more densely populated. This is the result of a population policy that
   served industrialisation first and foremost. In the Soviet Union,
   deportations, subsidised resettlements, and the sedentarisation of
   nomads were the instruments of this policy. Today, Russia is pursuing
   other political and economic goals and is trying to disband unprofitable
   settlements in the north. However, the process of settling people back
   to sub-arctic zones is encountering resistance. People who were once
   resettled to the north are still, or once again, living in the region's
   new ghost towns.},

Abstract = {In contemporary, complex organizations, ``open secrets'' may be just as
   common as intentionally concealed secrets, and are often associated with
   ethical failures and administrative evil. This chapter explores the
   ethical implications of open secrets in contemporary organizations and
   the dynamics by which they can become masked. Both the space shuttle
   Challenger disaster and Enron's corporate collapse, as well as other
   similar ethical debacles, show how organizational actors at all levels
   can promote the public interest and recognize ethical issues, only if
   they require of themselves a broader scope of ethical standards and
   vigilance that addresses not just individual behavior but also, and even
   primarily, the organizational and cultural context of values and ethics.
   The evolution of a moral vacuum within a culture of technical
   rationality and the resulting ethically deficient organizational
   dynamics produced the inability to recognize the open secrets that
   masked the pathway to disaster.},

Title = {A Dual Legal System in Australia: The Formalization of
   Shari'a},
Journal = {DEMOCRACY \& SECURITY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {7},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {354-373},
Abstract = {Legal pluralism, or the dual legal system, is in essence a postcolonial
   phenomenon. People movement-migration-from the poor South to the rich
   North started in earnest at the end of the colonial era. Many Muslims
   were part of this migration process, and as a result we have today a
   visible Muslim presence in many countries of the West. In a number of
   Western countries, demand by Muslims for dual legal system is fast
   growing and is a direct legacy of postcolonial migration processes.
   Great Britain, for example, which has over two million Muslims, in late
   2008 officially endorsed Shari'a (Islamic law) tribunals governing
   marriage, divorce, and inheritance to make legally binding decisions
   when parties involved agree. This article looks at the Muslim call for
   the dual legal system in Australia in relation to the establishment of
   Shari'a as a separate code of law and explores the basis upon which such
   a call rests. It argues that this demand by Muslims in Australia is not
   only premature but sociologically unsustainable. Although Islam is a
   permanent feature of Australian multiculturalism and the Muslim
   population through migration and birth is fast increasing, Muslims in
   Australia remain divided on ethnic, parochial, and ideological lines. To
   gather this fragmentary community to any religious function is
   enormously difficult, let alone getting it to agree on a set of Islamic
   legal codes or the Shari'a.},

Journal = {REGIONAL AND FEDERAL STUDIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {21},
Number = {4-5, SI},
Pages = {503-521},
Abstract = {Formal constitutional amendment can be difficult to achieve and, without
   the confidence of experience, may introduce changes that too quickly and
   too rigidly alter the balance of authority between federal and state
   governments. Therefore, in federal systems it is preferable to
   experiment with alterations prior to formal adoption. In this article I
   address how federal systems encourage two types of policy
   experimentation that are either unlikely to be tried or unlikely to be
   accepted. To encourage costly state experimentation, the federal
   government can alter financial incentives, nudge states towards a new
   policy by shifting public attention, set a pre-emptive floor and offer
   party-based rewards. To smooth union acceptance of selfish
   experimentation, a set of safeguards encourages deliberation and
   experience with the policy that leads to public acceptance or rejection.},

Abstract = {European integration, through euro-regions, voluntary zones of

   they engage in. If the experience of students in the border city of
   Szczecin is reflective of other European borderlands, than cross-border
   cooperation has not diminished the importance of the border as a mental
   marker of nation-state boundaries or the importance of national

Abstract = {Although history has shown us that the church plays a role in the
   political liberalization of non-democratic countries, the nature of the
   church's role and how it participates in politics has yet to be fully
   revealed. By revisiting the Polish Church's historic role in the
   collapse of communism, I argue that we have overestimated the church's
   effect on political liberalization in that case, which has led us to
   neglect or be prematurely disappointed in its role in the remaining
   communist countries such as in Cuba. Drawing from the Polish case, I
   conclude that the church's moral, self-limiting, and transnational
   character needs to be recognized and incorporated into a general theory
   of democratization. It is this aspect of the church that has helped it
   to remain active within remaining communist societies, and provide the
   moral support that is an integral part of political liberalization
   processes.},

Abstract = {The paper seeks to deepen our understanding of the relationship between
   the social composition of the Chilean political elite and party change.
   Based on a case study of deputies elected between 1961 and 2005, the
   article explores factors which have determined party change in the
   post-authoritarian period, concentrating empirically on transformations
   in the composition of parliamentary elites with regard to their social
   characteristics and political trajectory. It is argued that these
   transformations reflect the tensions that tendencies towards
   professionalization and democratization have created for Chilean
   political parties.},

Journal = {AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {46},

Pages = {601-615},
Abstract = {Ongoing local community dissatisfaction in some newly amalgamated local
   government areas resulting from the 2007 Queensland forced amalgamation
   program has raised the prospect of de-merger in that state. One catalyst
   has been the Opposition's commitment to de-amalgamation should it
   acquire government. Apart from some descriptive discussion of actual
   de-amalgamation episodes, almost no prescriptive analysis exists on the
   optimal form any de-merger process may take. Using two documented cases
   of de-amalgamation in metropolitan and regional settings, this
   exploratory paper seeks to address this gap in the literature on local
   government by presenting a `stylised' approach to de-amalgamation
   designed for Australian local government conditions built around five
   generic principles.},

Abstract = {In this article I consider the significance of the New World African
   slave to Marx's Capital. Although Marx frequently refers to slaves, the
   products of slave labor, and events centered on slavery like the
   American Civil War, and although he deploys the rhetoric of enslavement
   to describe the exploitation of wage laborers, he never acknowledges the
   slave as essential to his analysis. This is because Marx, for the sake
   of his analysis, accepts the widely held view in the nineteenth century
   that slaves lacked agency. I argue for the necessity of the slave to
   Capital, demonstrate how taking this seriously alters some key concepts
   in Capital, and re-read Marx so that the slave's agency can be traced
   from within Marx's theoretical apparatus.},

Abstract = {This contribution explores whether and under what conditions functional
   sectoral cooperation between the EU and the countries of the European
   Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) promotes democratic governance. In an
   analysis of four countries (Jordan, Moldova, Morocco, and Ukraine) and
   three fields of cooperation (competition, environment, and migration
   policy), we show that country properties such as the degree of political
   liberalization, membership aspirations, and geographic region do not
   explain differences in democratic governance. Rather, sectoral
   conditions such as the codification of democratic governance rules, the
   institutionalization of functional cooperation, interdependence, and
   adoption costs matter most for the success of democratic governance
   promotion. We further reveal a notable discrepancy between adoption and
   application of democratic governance in the selected ENP countries that
   has not been remedied in the first five years of the ENP.},

Abstract = {During the contest for Kansas attorney general in 2006, an organization
   sent out six pieces of mail criticizing the incumbent's conduct in
   office. We exploit a discontinuity in the rule used to select which
   households received the mailings to identify the causal effect of mail
   on vote choice and voter turnout. We find these mailings had a
   politically significant effect on the challenger's vote share, which is
   statistically significant in most, but not all, of our specifications.
   Our point estimates suggest that a 10 percentage point increase in the
   amount of mail sent to a precinct increased the challenger's vote share
   by 1.5 to 3.5 percentage points. Furthermore, our results suggest that
   these mailings had little mobilizing effect, suggesting that the
   mechanism for this increase was persuasion.},

Abstract = {Studying Islam and Middle Eastern politics has become highly popular,
   particularly in American and British universities after the 9/11 and 7/7
   terrorist events. Unfortunately, the increasing interest in Islam and
   Muslims in the West is often based on (mis) recognition of images of
   Muslims in the media. This has created a new set of problems of
   ignorance and misunderstandings about terrorism and the Islamic world.
   The intent of this article is to outline a `critical pedagogy' of
   research-based teaching for Islamic studies and illustrate how this kind
   of pedagogical engagement better equips students to `problematise the
   natural, cultural and historical reality' and dominant Orientalist
   assumptions about the relationship between Islam and terrorism. This
   article shows how research-based teaching can help students to become
   critical thinkers to connect knowledge and power while studying Islam
   and Middle Eastern politics.},

Pages = {357-368},
Abstract = {There is a growing body of literature dedicated to critiquing liberal
   peacebuilding. This paper revisits the current post-conflict
   peacebuilding agenda in light of these critiques, outlining how both
   proponents and opponents perceive three core principles, that is,
   democratisation, economic liberalisation and state-building. Drawing
   attention to the emergence of arguments for alternative approaches, this
   paper argues that recent developments provide some hope for reconciling
   proponents of the liberal agenda with their growing legion of critics.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CIVIL SOCIETY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {7},
Number = {2},
Pages = {129-156},
Abstract = {While a number of studies on the use of contacts in post-communist
   states have appeared in recent years, the large majority of these focus
   on the general public or on specific types of elites considered to be
   particularly vulnerable to corruption, such as politicians and public
   procurement officials. Less is known about the perceptions and personal
   experiences of those working in civil society in this regard. This
   article explores (i) general perceptions of the use of contacts; (ii)
   personal experience with contacts both as `users' and `go-betweens'; and
   (iii) the maintenance of personal and/or work-related contacts-drawing
   on large-scale qualitative and quantitative data collected among NGO
   representatives in east central Europe, southeast Europe and the West
   Balkans. It is argued that contacts are indeed widely used by NGO
   representatives. The article is rounded off by a discussion of civil
   society's ability to perform the role of anti-corruption watchdog, given
   that contacts are widely used also in this sector.},

Pages = {355-372},
Abstract = {This article submits, with Mandela, that despite political freedom and a
   lauded liberal constitution, South Africa remains collectively unfree,
   especially if freedom is understood as power across four economic and
   political dimensions. Although G. A. Cohen's notion of the `collective
   unfreedom' of the proletariat is not perfectly analogous to the
   situation of South Africans in general, this article maintains that it
   is still very useful in understanding the extent of unfreedom in South
   Africa. It argues that there are four main reasons for the condition of
   collective unfreedom in South Africa: poverty; inequality; the electoral
   system; and macroeconomic policy. In the end, though, the article
   contests Mandela's claim regarding the force of our moral duty to others
   to enhance their freedom; rather, it argues that it is the realization
   that our individual freedom depends upon the freedom of others that
   would motivate all citizens to secure the freedom as power of all South
   Africans.},

Abstract = {Al-Qa'ida has historically used Yemen as a safe haven rather than an

   resulting in a conflation of internal and external targets. A kinetic
   approach using increased aerial attacks will not decapitate the
   organisation. The key to its demise instead lies in the calls for good
   governance and economic opportunity found in the Arab Spring.},

   distinct pressures which are relevant to both referendums and draws
   lessons from the experience of the waferthin success of the 1997
   campaign for the forthcoming 2011 referendum. In so doing, it draws on
   interviews conducted with key figures in the upcoming campaign, as well
   as other interested stakeholders, who identified these pressures as
   concerns. It argues that the success of the `Yes' campaign will be
   dependent upon engaging with and overcoming these pressures.},

Abstract = {In order to overcome collective action problems inherent in campaign
   fundraising, political campaigns solicit donors through material,
   solidary, and ideological appeals. Over the course of the campaign, the
   percentage of donors motivated by these different types of incentives
   are roughly equal; however, no previous study has differentiated between
   those who donate during primary elections and those donating during
   general elections. This study of campaign fundraising solicitations sent
   out via e-mail during the 2008 presidential campaign by the two
   major-party candidates finds evidence that the campaigns recognize a
   difference between the primary election financial constituencies and the
   general election financial constituencies and that campaigns target the
   types of appeals that they send to potential donors accordingly.},

Volume = {33},

Pages = {189-210},
Abstract = {In recent years, political science research on ``intersectionality{''}
   has breathed new life into perennial debates about group politics,
   inequality, and marginalization, demonstrating that unitary identity
   categories are insufficient for understanding group interests. This
   article critiques this emergent body of literature, noting the
   theoretical tensions that have surfaced as the concept has taken hold
   within political science. It posits that the theoretical underpinnings
   of this growing research paradigm have to date relied upon a liberal
   conception of political power that advocates greater administrative
   attention to particularized subgroups. This pervasive liberalism glosses
   over the complex and dynamic power structures that both produce
   political marginalization and offer sites of political resistance. Using
   the internal tensions of LGBTQ politics as a guiding example, this
   article calls for a move beyond intersectionality and towards a notion
   of discursive marginalization to more accurately account for the
   processes by which citizen-subjects are produced.},

Abstract = {It is on the basis of modern approaches provided by the new
   institutional theory that in the present article the institution of
   civil participation is reappraised as an integral phenomenon securing
   inclusion of citizens into the political government process.
   Characterization and analysis of the evolution and of the current state
   of the institution of civil participation are offered. As is
   demonstrated by the investigation developed. there are few real public
   entities. and civil entities are in minority. Nevertheless civil
   entities, because they possess qualities of a ``competent{''} political
   actor. of a self-dependent subject of politics, with well-developed
   ``social practical skills{''}, are able to form - and in reality do form
   - a new. not an imitative, but a real institution of civil participation
   oriented at citizens' needs for influencing the process of political
   decision-making.},

Abstract = {By examining the language of social movements in Taiwan for the past two
   decades, this article argues that the language of social movements was
   not much more than another version of `end of history'. In their
   habitual consumption of the language, the language users lost in touch
   with history and reality while being intoxicated by a sense of political
   correctness. This article suggests a rethinking of the relationship
   between critical intellectuals and social movements. Social movements
   ought to be a quintessential part of the thought-searching efforts by
   regional intellectuals. In the meantime, the effort of thought-searching
   should also be on the agenda of any social movement which wishes to face
   the real problems peculiar to the region. `Autonomy' in a genuine sense
   can only be achieved on the concrete but nonintuitional level of
   historical reality. It is beyond dispute that we need social movements
   in our contemporary world. And exactly for this reason, we need to
   rethink the language of social movements. And the most difficult
   challenge lying in front of us is the fact that no ready language is
   going to serve well in our pursuit, no matter how liberal, how left, or
   how postmodern/populist it might sound to us. Chen Yingzhen's pioneer
   thinking along this line was discussed via a new reading of his 1980
   novel The Cloud.},

Abstract = {Will women transform party politics? As a group of relative newcomers to
   parties, women may contribute to shaping parties' policy agendas and to
   changing party rules. A party-level perspective allows for examination
   of the national-and party-level contextual influences that condition the
   effect of women on party platforms. Systematic analysis of a broad range
   of 142 political parties in 24 post-industrial democracies from 1990 to
   2003 illuminates the dynamic relationship between women's political
   power and party politics. Drawing on the Comparative Manifestos Project
   data and original party-level data, the multi-level analyses reveal that
   women's rising numbers among a party's parliamentary delegation and
   among its leadership committee contribute to an emphasis on social
   justice in the party programme, and to the adoption of gender quota
   policies. Furthermore, for welfare state expansion, the effect of women
   MPs is amplified by the presence of a women's organization within the
   party.},

Abstract = {Constitutional courts are considered powerful opponents of democratic
   politics and are seen as key actors in processes of judicialization. The
   paper discusses both assumptions in theoretical and empirical terms. In
   theoretical terms, it calls for expanding the ``opponents thesis{''}
   with a democratic theory perspective. Empirically, it shows that the
   German Federal Constitutional Court has neither been an antagonist of
   democratic politics nor actively pursued processes of judicialization.
   Instead, the court has met adequately its functional role in the
   democratic governmental system.},

Abstract = {Discussions of where the costs of climate change adaptation and
   mitigation should fall often focus on the `polluter pays principle' or
   the `ability to pay principle'. Simon Caney has recently defended a
   `hybrid view', which includes versions of both of these principles. This
   article argues that Caney's view succeeds in overcoming several
   shortfalls of both principles, but is nevertheless subject to three
   important objections: first, it does not distinguish between those
   emissions which are hard to avoid and those which are easy to avoid;
   second, its only partial reference to all-things-considered justice
   means it cannot provide a full account even of climate justice; and
   third, it assigns to the poor very limited duties to meet climate change
   costs, even where they have created those costs, which may incentivise
   them to increase emissions. An alternative pluralistic account which
   avoids these objections is presented.},

Journal = {POLITOLOGICKY CASOPIS-CZECH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2011},
Number = {3},
Pages = {254-273},
Abstract = {The article deals with the communication policy of the European Union -
   specifically, the communication policy of the European Commission.
   Though the Commission has considered communication policy to be one of
   its most important priorities in recent years, opinion polls and the
   behaviour of EU citizens during various elections or referenda show that
   little progress has yet been made in this field. The authors try to
   uncover the reasons for this situation by examining the institutional
   set-up within the Commission's communication policy. In doing so, they
   base their research on the assumption derived from discursive
   institutionalism that EU communication policy is characterized by its
   complex co-ordinative discourse, which limits the potential of its
   communicative discourse. In order to specify the subject, the authors
   begin with an overview of current developments in the communication
   policy and an analysis of the main strategic documents introduced by the
   Commission. Then, the coordination discourse, first at EU level and
   second at national level, is explored through the examination of various
   actors institutionally involved in EU communication policy and the
   coordination mechanisms present among them. Subsequently, the
   communication discourse is analysed through research into the
   communication tools the Commission uses to achieve its goals in the

Abstract = {This article analyses the 2009 German federal election campaign with
   specific emphasis on the three categories of actors that play key roles
   in contemporary election campaigns - parties and their candidates, the
   mass media, and the voters. Mainly aiming at a theoretically informed
   comprehensive description, the article addresses some key themes of the
   recent literature on electioneering. The Bundestag election on 27
   September 2009 was preceded by a campaign that lacked drama. There were
   several reasons for the absence of a more polarised campaign, not least
   the fact that CDU/CSU and SPD had been tied together in a Grand
   Coalition and had to deal with massive political challenges. Against the
   background of an unclear picture painted by the media, the feasibility
   and likelihood of various types of government coalitions were dominant
   topics of the campaign. The CDU/CSU in many respects had an edge over
   the SPD.},

Journal = {SRAVNITELNAYA POLITIKA-COMPARATIVE POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {2},
Number = {4},
Pages = {19+},
Abstract = {When discussing the role of states in the world system, the conventional
   wisdom among scholars means different configurations of relations
   between leading states, i.e. the system of international relations. Such
   approach was fully grounded in the past, but in present-day conditions
   it is not only the place of the state in international relations system
   that counts, but also its place in the modern world political system,
   which includes also non-Westphalian states and their critical mass
   exceeds that of the Westphalian ones. The article suggests that a
   different approach has to be used and the research of leading states has
   to be replaced by the study of states within the broader framework of
   the world political system. In this view it is not only an individual
   state but the whole system being challenged today, thus it needs to be
   determined how the states so different in nature can coexist in one
   political system and whether a radical restructuring of the system
   should be expected.},

Abstract = {Globalization, global citizenship, and political engagement have become
   such buzz-words and cliches that we often lose the sense of their
   meaning. Global citizenship in particular is an elusive concept to
   operationalize. This article proposes to look at three dimensions of
   global citizenship: legal (rights and obligations), psychological
   identification with the global community, and political ones. Heeding
   the calls to wed traditional liberal education with the experiential
   learning in pursuit of developing students' global values and
   competencies, we devised and implemented a simulation called the Global
   Summit on Sustainability, an active learning assignment we run in large,
   general education survey classes (Global Politics and Introduction to
   American Government \& Politics) populated by mostly nonpolitical
   science majors. The total number of students involved in the summit
   range from 225 to 360 each semester. But how does having a Global Summit
   influence the development of global citizenship and its three dimensions
   in large general education undergraduate political science classes? By
   using (1) instructor observations at the summit; (2) statistical
   analyses of pre-and postsummit surveys; and (3) a qualitative review of
   students' written assignments, we find that the Global Summit influences
   the development of global citizenship skills.},

Journal = {NATIONAL IDENTITIES},

Pages = {127-156},
Abstract = {This paper focuses on the perceptions of Greek public opinion concerning
   NATO's intervention in Kosovo as a case study for Greek anti-Americanism
   and, especially, its post-Cold War expression. Greek opposition towards
   NATO intervention in Kosovo (1999) has often been attributed to bias,
   nationalism and emotionalism. However, the main influential factor in
   the shaping of the Greek perception of the Kosovo war was the
   anti-American legacy. It should also be emphasized that the post-Cold
   War version of Greek anti-Americanism has distinct qualitative
   characteristics, the most important of those being its diffusion into
   the ideological and political spectrum. Based on a qualitative analysis
   of the press, this study attempts to show how this generalized
   anti-Americanism functions like a prism during the Kosovo crisis and to
   illustrate the influence of a complex set of historical myths and
   conceptual schemes, as well as the role of several secondary factors
   such as political strategies and party competition. In the conceptual
   field, the legacy of the Kosovo narration is the establishment of the
   totalitarian argument as far as the US is concerned and the shaping of a
   negative image of American society that is directly linked to US
   aggression in foreign relations.},

Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {439-453},
Abstract = {A standard justification of democratic voting is that it is a fair
   procedure, providing for the equal treatment of voters. Democratic
   theorist David Estlund challenges the adequacy of that justification:
   flipping a coin between alternatives is also a fair procedure, but no
   one would propose substituting random draw for voting. Estlund provides
   several arguments that fair proceduralism is an untenable view, and this
   article counters those arguments. He concludes that what distinguishes
   democratic voting from random choice is its better epistemic value in
   approximating a standard of justice independent of the procedure. The
   author replies that a less controversial distinction between voting and
   coin flip is that voting tends to select what is thought best by the
   most people.},

Abstract = {In the German mixed electoral system the PR tier is generally perceived
   as fully compensating for any disproportionality in the vote-seat
   translation generated by the plurality tier. However, as this article
   shows, the PR tier can itself increase disproportionality. In a mixed
   electoral system, small parties enter (hopeless) district races with the
   hope of boosting their PR vote share. But with a high number of district
   parties, parties may win districts at levels way below the usual 50 per
   cent vote share threshold. Looking at all 16 Bundestag elections from
   1953 to 2009, the article identifies the effective number of district
   parties as a very strong predictor for the disproportional translation
   of votes into seats in the plurality tier of Germany's mixed electoral
   system. The article points to consequences for the internal composition
   of parliamentary parties, for parties' nomination strategies and for the
   occurrence of so-called overhang mandates.},

Abstract = {This paper tries to explore the links between sport violence and the
   building of masculinity. Firstly, the papers describe the main
   theoretical frameworks in the sociological study of sport and violence.
   Secondly, a profile of the average football hooligan and of its main
   characteristics is sketched. And, finally, the relation between
   masculinity and football hooliganism is explored using the analytics
   tools of feminist paradigm in order to consider how sport violence helps
   to build the masculine identity. The paper concludes remarking the links
   between violence, sport and the decreasing of patriarchal structures.},

Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},

Abstract = {In the discussions of citizenship in post-socialist Georgia, the topic
   of social entitlements predominates. Soviet social citizenship, which
   granted the full range of social rights, significantly shaped the
   people's current expectations of social rights in Georgia. In order to
   address the external and internal pressure for poverty alleviation, the
   Georgian government started reforming the social support system of the
   country. The cornerstone of Georgia's current social policy is a new
   social assistance programme, the main principle of which is to provide
   social benefits to the poorest families as identified by an evaluation
   system. This paper explores the enactment of the `targeted social
   assistance' (TSA) programme in a village in north-western Georgia. By
   participating in the TSA programme, Georgian citizens exercise social
   citizenship as a practice of bargaining for universal social rights that
   at present are not achievable for all as the state provides social
   security only to extremely needy families. The category of social
   citizenship described by T. H. Marshall helps us to understand the
   claims of Georgian citizens for state support. The discrepancy between
   social security and social citizenship causes people to misunderstand
   the goals of the TSA programme and this ultimately leads to
   dissatisfaction among Georgia's citizenry.},

   Processes of Identification and Differentiation},
Journal = {FORO INTERNO-ANUARIO DE TEORIA POLITICA},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {11},
Pages = {127-150},
Abstract = {Numerous scholars have pointed out the transformations that have taken
   place in the political and social solidarities that structured the mass
   societies of the last century. Changes in the manners of constituting
   collective actors have forced a redefinition of theoretical and
   methodological tools to address political phenomena, posing new
   questions. What kinds of dynamics become central when traditional
   players such as political parties and social movements find that other
   players take the lead in political enunciation? How should political
   sociology deal with processes that involve agents who, in many cases,
   are circumstantial collectives? This article proposes to interpret
   contemporary political dynamics in terms of a sequence of political
   identification processes that are discontinuous from the point of view
   of crystallization into collective subjects, but that can be articulated
   by the thematisation of public affairs.},

   lawmaking, democratic legitimacy, and the Lisbon Treaty},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {17},
Number = {3},
Pages = {321-334},
Abstract = {A large body of European Union (EU) law - EU administrative law - is not
   made by the EU's democratically elected bodies, the Council of Ministers
   and the European Parliament (EP). Instead, most administrative laws are
   made by the unelected European Commission. That, of itself, does not
   mean that the EU is insufficiently democratic: most democracies delegate
   the power to make administrative laws to unelected regulators. In those
   democracies, however, elected legislatures can at least change
   administrative laws after they are promulgated. This article contends
   that the EU is different: the Council and EP are effectively unable to
   change administrative laws. This article identifies `design flaws' in
   the EU's lawmaking processes that are responsible for this democratic
   shortcoming. It then surveys relevant provisions of the new Lisbon
   Treaty in order to determine whether Lisbon will remedy that
   shortcoming: whether it will empower the Council and EP - or citizens
   directly - to change administrative laws.},

Title = {Charasoff and Dmitriev: An analytical characterisation of origins of
   linear economics},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL CRITICAL THOUGHT},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {1},
Number = {1},
Pages = {76-91},
Abstract = {Georg von Charasoff was one of the first economic theorists to recognise
   that the price of production is an eigenvector of the input matrix, and
   to determine the rate of profit using its eigenvalue. He anticipated, at
   this analytical level, most of the arguments that were proposed later in
   the course of the `transformation problem'. This paper aims to
   reformulate his significant arguments in a formal manner and to reveal
   their logical relationship by reproducing the mathematical reasoning, so
   that the logical characteristic of his system can be identified in
   comparison with Dmitriev's and Bortkiewicz's linear economic system.},

Title = {Citizenship and migration policies under Merkel's Grand Coalition},
Journal = {GERMAN POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {20},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {376-391},
Abstract = {Mindful of Germany's looming demographic deficit and its likely
   consequences for the national economy, Chancellor Angela Merkel has
   embraced the fact that Germany is a land of immigration, in stark
   contrast to other CDU/CSU stalwarts. Assuming power shortly after the
   enactment of a new Citizenship Law (2000) and the passage of the
   country's first real immigration cum integration law (2004), Merkel has
   introduced a pro-active strategy for integrating minorities of migrant
   descent with the National Integration Plan of 2007; she has done so, in
   part, by utilising recent EU developments to commit Germany to a
   socially inclusive approach as a `national' priority. Her holistic
   strategy owes much to the complex interaction of various socialisation
   factors: while `the Easterner' and/or `the Protestant' takes the lead in
   matters of policy substance, `the physicist' seems to prevail with
   regard to programme design and evaluation. The Chancellor's
   collaborative leadership style inevitably brings gender back into focus,
   although the `many colours of Merkel' all remain in the mosaic mix.},

   with the idea of political freedom, social mobility, and economic

   ethnicities and an alien culture. In the 20th century, the fronts of the
   real wartime alliances and of the Cold War are reflected in literature.
   Differentiated, often ambivalent descriptions of the United States are
   again found more frequently only after 1989.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to engage Jansen and Young's recent research on the
   impact of changing federal campaign finance laws on the relationship
   between organized labour and the New Democratic Party. Jansen and Young
   use models from mainstream comparative politics to argue that unions and
   the NDP retain links due to a ``shared ideological commitment{''} to
   social democracy, rather than an expectation of mutual rewards and
   despite changes in the global economy. We critically assess the
   evidence, method of comparison, and theoretical assumptions informing
   their claims and find many aspects unconvincing. Instead, we propose
   that better explanations of this enduring yet strained relationship can
   be formulated by drawing insights from Canadian political economy,
   labour history and working class politics, and comparative social
   democracy.},

Abstract = {Utilitarianism would allow any degree of inequality whatsoever
   productive of the greatest happiness of the greatest number. But it does
   not guide political action, because determining what level of inequality
   would produce the greatest happiness of the greatest number is opaque
   due to well-known psychological coordination problems. Does Rawlsian
   liberalism, as is generally assumed, have some superiority to
   Utilitarianism in this regard? This paper argues not; for Rawls's
   `difference principle' would allow any degree of inequality whatsoever
   that best raises up the worst off, and similar psychological
   coordination problems apply. It concludes that Rawlsian liberalism,
   designed to solve the problem that Utilitarianism will not give us
   stable rules and will counsel their violation, and giving us in the
   process a contract and rights within a semi-consequentialist framework,
   repeats (in the difference principle) that very problem of
   Utilitarianism. It fails substantively to guide the level of
   inequalities permitted in such a framework.},

Abstract = {Government corruption and secrecy are not new phenomena in Africa;
   however, international scrutiny has grown as nations end decades of
   conflict and seek to develop, donor nations consider providing more aid,
   and investors and transnational corporations look to the area for oil
   and other resources. Given that corrupt government activities account
   for millions of dollars diverted from public coffers each year in
   developing nations and lead to unfair benefit distribution to citizens,
   the chapter examines the global network of actors attempting to advance
   the international norm of government accountability to constrain
   corruption through advocating for the adoption of access-to-information
   legislation. The chapter also explores the relationship between
   perception of corruption in Africa and four political institutions of
   vertical accountability. The findings indicate that perception of
   corruption is inversely correlated with news media rights, civil
   liberties, and political rights. However, adopting access-to-information
   legislation or planning to adopt the law was not correlated with the
   perception of corruption.},

Abstract = {Building electoral alliances is a good opportunity for adding votes in
   order to support a common candidate and to increase the chance to win
   the election avoiding, in this way, wasting votes among different
   candidates or parties. The electoral alliances are not a product of the
   ideological distance among its members, but they are an endogenous
   outcome of the changes in the electoral competence conditions and, at
   the same time, a strong impulse of those changes. To support this
   hypothesis on the links between competitiveness and electoral alliances,
   and the pragmatism character of parties which are members of those, the
   article offer evidence from 96 sub-national elections of governors in 32
   Mexican states from 1998 to 2006.},

Abstract = {After the great earthquake disaster in Japan on 11 March 2011, Japan is
   considered to be confronting the third big change following the Meiji
   Restoration in 1868 and the defeat of World War II in 1945. In
   particular, the accident at the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant,
   which occurred as a result of the earthquake and tsunami, had a great
   impact on the Japanese people, who began to rethink the so-called
   `peaceful' atomic power. The author proposes that this tragic accident
   was a consequence of today's `imperialism against nature', and that only
   the program of ecological socialism will provide a political solution
   for the contemporary civilization of advanced science-based technology.},

Abstract = {The author discusses the issues of universality of Eurocentric
   capitalism and of possible alternatives to the contemporary model of
   social development. Problems of methodology of Russian social history
   conceptualization are considered, in the context of the political
   changes in the modern world. An overview of models of such analysis
   (including models that are examined in detail in the subsequent articles
   of this rubric of the journal's issue) is presented in the context of
   the well-known theoretical and methodological approaches to a non-linear
   analysis of political change. The focus of attention are the
   socio-cultural foundations of changes that are experienced by Russia,
   and the prospects of Russian modernization.},

   Foundations and their Grantees in China},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CIVIL SOCIETY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {7},
Number = {3},
Pages = {305-331},
Abstract = {Extant research on US foundations has found a generally conservative
   tendency towards support for professionalized non-governmental
   organizations (NGOs) rather than for potentially more radical grassroots
   organizations. Yet, the scholarly literature has had little to say about
   the decisions that grantmakers make when looking for grantees outside
   the USA. This article analyses data on over 2500 grants made to China
   between 2002 and 2009 to show that despite funders' rhetorical emphasis
   on NGOs and civil society organizations, in reality, the vast majority
   of funding has gone to government-controlled organizations, including
   academic institutions, government agencies, and government-organized
   NGOs. To help explain this gap between funder rhetoric and actual
   grantee choices, I draw on participant observation data and in-depth
   interviews with US-based donors and grassroots NGOs and argue that we
   can best understand the dynamics at work as a kind of `organizational
   homophily', a process in which the personal preferences of large,
   elite-led US funders and institutional pressures from both China and the
   USA converge to systematically disadvantage grassroots NGOs.},

Abstract = {Why do policies fail? There are many answers to this question, and many
   ways of answering it. In this paper, we use the tools of policy framing
   and systems thinking to investigate two recent Australian examples of
   public policy failure, each involving a different policy milieu and
   time-span. We show that, in both these cases, unintended consequences
   arose because governments lost control of the implementation process
   while remaining politically accountable for the outcomes. We develop the
   concept of transmitted risk to show how this occurred. We argue that
   governments expose themselves to this kind of risk when they make policy
   decisions involving a combination of excessive incentives and poorly
   controlled third parties.},

Pages = {109-123},
Abstract = {This article aims to discuss whether there is such a thing as
   citizenship performed at the level of the sub-state region and, if so,
   how this can be studied. It is suggested that aspects of citizenship
   should be studied not only in the context of sub-state administrative
   units, but also in the context of more loosely interconnected functional
   economic regions. The main argument for this is that, although there is
   no `contract' between the polity and the citizen in these functional
   regions, they are often highly politicized spaces, governed by
   coalitions of public and private actors whose actions can be of
   considerable importance for those inhabiting them. It is also suggested
   that, in the absence of formal rights and institutionalized relations
   between citizens and polity, we need to explore how `citizens' and
   `citizenship' are conceptualized by the polity in these regions more
   broadly. The article focuses (a) on the conditions for citizenship in
   the functional region and (b) on those discourses of citizenship that
   emerge under the conditions identified. A tentative conclusion is that,
   in the absence of formal citizenship rights connected to the functional
   space, a discourse about citizens and citizenship has emerged, which is
   focuses solely on citizens' capacity to contribute to economic growth.},

Abstract = {The article is devoted to the proof of a thesis that during the
   intraparty struggle in 1923-1927 between nomenclature and the supreme
   authority a political contract was concluded. On the basis of the
   analysis of I.V.Stalin's report at the Russian Communist Party
   (Bolsheviks) 13th Conference, K.Titov shows that the text formally
   presented as criticism against L.D.Trotsky's position contained in fact
   a range of responsibilities (regarding nomenclature) that a pretender
   for the supreme authority assumed in the exchange for the political
   support from the nomenclature. According to the author, in 1930-s this
   contract was unilaterally torn by the supreme authority that refused to
   act on the overwhelming majority of its promises, but it was restored in
   1956 and 1964 as a result of the ``nomenclature's revanche{''}.},

Abstract = {The process of statutory reform, commencing with the reform of the
   Catalonian Statute of Autonomy, has been the subject of numerous studies
   and reflexions. Although these reforms have yet to be finalised, it is
   true to say that the Constitutional Court's decision on the
   aforementioned Statute allows and obliges us to come to far reaching
   conclusions with respect to the future. Above and beyond the fact that
   the existing model has been approved by some new, second generation
   Statutes, while not by others, relations between Catalonia and the rest
   of Spain have been shown to be problematic, and the Constitutional Court
   has had to be brought in to respond to this. Constitutional reform would
   appear to be necessary both for an improved organisation of political
   decentralisation, and as a solution to problems arising from nationalist
   sensibilities.},

Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},

Volume = {18},

Pages = {1168-1192},
Abstract = {Citizens of the three East African countries Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda
   differ much in their expressed support for the political opposition and
   in their trust in the ruling political institutions of the president,
   the electoral commission and the ruling party. Citizens in Uganda and
   Kenya have become more sceptical towards their ruling institutions,
   while citizens in Tanzania are still very trusting and express much
   stronger deferential values than is the case in the other two countries,
   even though Tanzanians have experienced less of democratic changes. flow
   can this difference he explained, and to what extent is democracy being
   institutionalized in the three countries? Using Afrobarometer data it is
   shown that democratic constitutional values are an important reason for
   supporting the opposition in Kenya, but much less so in Uganda and
   Tanzania. In Kenya, democratic constitutional values are negatively
   related to support for the ruling institutions, while in Tanzania, the
   same values strengthen support for the government. A positive evaluation
   of democratic procedures and government output explains much of the
   support for the ruling institutions, while a perceived high level of
   corruption and a low estimation of delivered democratic procedures lend
   support to the opposition. Kenya appears to have reached a more advanced
   democratic awareness than the other two countries. While some important
   democratic institutions have taken root in the three countries, there is
   still a long way to go before the region has attained stable democracy.},

   mid-century heyday, through to the present, arguing that the utility of
   air power has fundamentally altered over this time. Do independent air

Abstract = {The article deals with the phenomenon of the naval blockade in
   peacetime. Instituting a naval blockade is an extensively used policy in
   international politics, both in history and in the contemporary world.
   The peacetime naval blockade is firstly defined and theoretically
   classified. This is followed by an analysis of several peacetime naval
   blockades, which serves to illustrate the limits of the effectiveness of
   such blockades. The analysis comes to the conclusion that there are many
   limitations on the effectiveness of the peacetime naval blockade, the
   most significant being that this kind of blockade has no formal rules
   and no background in international law. It also comes to the conclusion
   that an effective naval blockade in peacetime must be based on a complex
   approach and be part of a package of diplomatic measures. Also, it
   appears that such blockades themselves can have some deeper
   psychological effects, not only economic, political or military ones.},

Volume = {23},

Abstract = {Marxist feminists often refer to Capital to justify their explanation of
   women's (un-) productive domestic labor in a capitalist, patriarchal
   society, yet there is considerable slippage between the phrase
   ``productive labor'' as used by Marx and as used by feminists in the
   1970s. This paper closely examines Marx's language as he explains how
   women were (and failed to be) integrated into a capitalist labor market.
   Although he claims to work toward ``a higher form of the family and
   relations between the sexes,'' he occasionally conflates patriarchy and
   capitalism and quotes extensively from sources that suggest that married
   women working outside the home are ``tainted'' and ``customarily
   immoral.'' This essay examines Marx's deployment of words like

Abstract = {Research suggests that student learning is enhanced when students are
   engaged through active learning strategies. In studying public opinion
   and polling, challenges include the provision of meaningful active
   learning environments when resources are limited. In this article, I
   discuss the design and implementation of telephone surveys as a teaching
   tool for use in introductory American politics as well as upper-level
   public opinion courses. I emphasize polling situations in which there
   are limited resources or no established survey research center is
   available. Topics include student involvement in survey design and
   implementation, logistics, and budgeting. Student satisfaction with
   participation in the survey process is also discussed.},

Pages = {799-814},
Abstract = {This article explores how state redress programmes work to legitimate
   the state. The primary thesis concerns how state redress aims to
   restructure citizenship identity. This restructuring enables civic
   identification by victims of state wrongdoing which in turn enables
   greater legitimacy. Consequently, redress constitutes a movement by the
   state from lesser to greater legitimacy. The article illustrates the
   legitimating thesis by examining two Canadian responses to state
   wrongdoing with regard to indigenous peoples, Gathering Strength (1998)
   and the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement (Indian
   Residential Schools Adjudication Secretariat). This context provides
   material for contrasting the legitimating thesis with a competing
   approach redress as `therapy'.},

Abstract = {Fully agreeing with R. Pipes in that Russia is a misdeveloped rather
   than weakly developed nation, A. Zubov contemplates about the sources
   that the disease of our society originates from and possible ways of its
   treatment. He posits that the roots of Russia's misdevelopment dates
   back to the historical events, as deeply as 15 th century, when after
   having exiled the Greek metropolitan Isidore and declared independence
   from Constantinople, the Russian Church automatically isolated itself
   from the rest of the Christian world. According to the author, the
   second ``Russian mistake{''} that flows from the first one is having
   transformed the East Russian political system from the Medieval civil
   monarchy into the East tyranny. Pointing out several attempts throughout
   the Russian history to overcome national development distortions, Zubov
   suggests that today we might have a real chance to wander off the beaten
   path. According to his conclusion, this might be possible if the ruling
   elite will start to participate in the process of democratization and
   legal egalitarization of the society realizing that its own survival
   depends on this.},

Abstract = {Some twenty years ago, Richard F. Fenno, Jr. published ``The Senate
   Through the Looking Glass{''} - a particularly illuminating and
   trenchant assessment of the state of the Senate. Listening to senators
   debate whether to allow television cameras into the chamber, Fenno
   concluded that the Senate was still capable of thoughtful deliberation
   and consensual decision-making. In this article, I take a Fenno-inspired
   peek through the looking glass at the contemporary Senate, using a
   recent parliamentary dispute to probe senators' views about their
   institution. The view is unusually dark. Two decades after Fenno's
   assessment, rising partisanship has made the Senate nearly
   ungovernable-leaving a chamber that struggles to fulfill its most basic
   constitutional duties.},

Abstract = {Why are some interest groups able to lobby political decisions
   successfully whereas others are not? This article suggests that the
   issue context is an important source of variation because it can
   facilitate or hamper the ability of interest groups to lobby
   decision-makers successfully. In order to test the effect of issue
   characteristics, this article draws on a new, unprecedented data set of
   interest group lobbying in the European Union. Using quantitative text
   analysis to analyse Commission consultations, this article studies
   lobbying success across 2696 interest groups and 56 policy issues. The
   findings indicate that lobbying success indeed varies with the issue
   context, depending on the relative size of lobbying coalitions and the
   salience of policy issues, whereas individual group characteristics do
   not exhibit any systematic effect.},

Abstract = {The author improves on the measurement of U. S. state public opinion by
   (1) applying previous methods used only on cross-sectional data to
   create dynamic measures of state public opinion and (2) providing a
   systematic comparison of the performance of the various methodological
   approaches on these dynamic measures. The author shows that scholars can
   use multilevel regression, imputation, and poststratification (MRP)
   coupled with a simple moving average to measure state public opinion
   over time. Compared to aggregation, the MRP approach has less error and
   is more reliable, particularly for the less populated states. The author
   shows the applicability of the MRP approach by measuring and validating
   state partisanship and state ideology over time. The validated measures
   are available for public use. Armed with a method to measure state
   public opinion over time, scholars can begin to more fully understand
   the dynamic relationship between public opinion and policy in the U. S.
   states.},

Abstract = {The authors analyze gender differences in members' speech participation
   on the floor of the U.S.House of Representatives. Speeches increase
   members' visibility and voice in the legislative process, providing
   opportunities for members to highlight their policy knowledge,
   constituents' concerns, and partisan commitments. The authors
   hypothesize that women's underrepresentation, coupled with the related
   challenges that female legislators face in a predominantly male
   institution, motivates congresswomen of both parties to speak at greater
   rates than congressmen. Analyzing over ten thousand floor speeches
   during the 103rd and 109th Congresses, the authors find strong support
   for their hypothesis, demonstrating that congresswomen's participation
   in legislative debate increases their visibility and enhances women's
   substantive representation.},

Abstract = {Ideal point estimates based on roll-call vote results have provided
   leverage for a variety of theory testing efforts. Recently, scholars
   have suggested using cosponsorship data as a proxy for roll-call votes.
   Conceptually similar to roll-call votes, cosponsorship data are
   appealing for a variety of reasons. However, the data-generating process
   for cosponsorship is untheorized and little studied. We examine the
   properties of ideal point estimates from cosponsorship data. We find
   that the ability to estimate ideal points from cosponsorship data is
   contingent on the underlying data-generating process; reliance on such
   measures requires strong and often unrealistic assumptions.},

Journal = {PARTY POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {17},
Number = {6},
Pages = {711-743},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {When voters place parties in their system along the left-right
   dimension, they often pull their preferred party closer towards them
   (assimilation) and push the opposition further away (contrast). This
   article asks a simple question: are such assimilation and contrast
   effects similarly powerful across different types of electoral system? I
   hypothesize that systems employing single-member districts will tend to
   strengthen assimilation and contrast because they mechanically reduce
   the number of parties, while shifting the focus of electoral competition
   away from the party and towards the candidate. Using data from 18
   advanced democracies compiled by the Comparative Study of Electoral
   Systems and hierarchical modelling I find that contrast effects are
   indeed stronger in majoritarian systems, while assimilation effects
   appear similarly strong regardless of the institutional setting. These
   findings suggest that institutional design holds lasting consequences
   for how we perceive politics and, perhaps also, for our ability to
   effectuate democracy.},

Abstract = {When can presidents direct bureaucrats to allocate government
   expenditures for electoral purposes? To address this question, I exploit
   a scandal concerning the General Services Administration (GSA), an
   agency that contracts with private vendors to provide supplies and real
   estate to other agencies. Shortly after Republican losses in 2006, a
   White House deputy gave a presentation to GSA political appointees
   identifying potentially vulnerable congressional districts. I find that
   vendors in prioritized Republican districts experienced unusually large
   new contract actions from the GSA's Public Buildings Service following
   the presentation relative to unmentioned districts, a discrepancy that
   disappeared once the Washington Post broke the story. Contracts
   supervised by the agency's Federal Acquisition Service, by contrast,
   were largely unresponsive to the briefing and media scrutiny. My
   findings suggest that the extent to which executives succeed in
   politicizing discretionary allocation decisions depends upon key
   features of the implementing agency's tasks and its informational
   environment.},

Abstract = {In this article, the processes of re-stratification in Serbia during the
   period from the end of the 1980s until recent times are analyzed on the
   basis of findings of several empirical investigations. In the first part
   of the text, the author points out that a systemic change implies not
   only quantitative changes in the control and distribution of social
   resources, but also changes in the way of constituting the basic social
   groups, and the forms of their relations, which means that the groups
   themselves (ruling elites, middle classes, and even manual workers) in
   socialism and in capitalism must be defined differently. In the second
   part of the text, attention is drawn to the changes in three areas of
   the stratificational system in Serbia: mobility, economic
   differentiation and value orientations. In the field of social mobility,
   an increase of self-recruitment of all basic classes is established, but
   also, in particular, a strengthening of barriers between manual workers
   and higher social strata. Furthermore, the author points out an increase
   in economic differentiation, and a growing importance of private
   property to this differentiation (the singling out of major private
   entrepreneurs on the top of the material status hierarchy). It is shown
   that, on the level of values, all classes (including the ruling class
   and the middle class) are characterized by inconsistency, in terms of a
   pronounced presence of statist-distributive values, which hampers the
   process of consolidation of a new institutional and normative (market
   and pluralistic) order in Serbia.},
