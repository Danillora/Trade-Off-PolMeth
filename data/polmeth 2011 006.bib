Title = {Collective Action with Uncertain Payoffs: Coordination, Public Signals,

Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {105},
Number = {4},
Pages = {829-851},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {How can one analyze collective action in protests or revolutions when
   individuals are uncertain about the relative payoffs of the status quo
   and revolution? We model a ``calculus of protest{''} of individuals who
   must either submit to the status quo or support revolt based only on
   personal information about their payoffs. In deciding whether to revolt,
   the citizen must infer both the benefit of successful revolution and the
   likely actions of other citizens. We characterize conditions under which
   payoff uncertainty overturns conventional wisdom: (a) when a citizen is
   too willing to revolt, he reduces the incentives of others to revolt;
   (b) less accurate information about the value of revolution can make
   revolt more likely; (c) public signals from other citizens can reduce
   the likelihood of revolt; (d) harsher punishment can increase the
   incidence of punishment; and (e) the incidence of protest can be
   positively correlated with that of repression.},

Title = {The anti-abortion movement in 21st-century Spain: the leadership of lay
   Christian groups and their de facto alliance with the Roman Catholic
   Church},
Journal = {REVISTA DE ESTUDIOS POLITICOS},
Year = {2011},
Number = {154},
Pages = {11-39},
Month = {OCT-DEC},
Abstract = {Even though no relevant evidence exists about the revival of religion in
   the European public sphere, certain moral policies, such as those
   dealing with the regulation of abortion, have unleashed the protest of
   Christian-inspired lay groups, advocacy coalitions and churches. Social
   mobilization against this type of policies is not surprising in
   democracy, but one of the new traits of the antiabortion protest over
   the last decades is that it has been led by social groups and experts,
   not connected with the church, who emphasize scientific, rather than
   moral or religious arguments. On their part, churches in different
   countries have played different roles: unlike other religious
   institutions, the Spanish Catholic church (SCC) has clearly played the
   role of an adversarial interest group and has been de facto an important
   ally of Christian social groups. The adversarial strategy of the
   organized Christian world is basically due to the new Socialist agenda
   (2004-11), which has stressed morally-sensitive issues such as the
   liberalization of abortion, same-sex marriage and the subject of
   Education for Citizenry. The analysis of Christian social group shows
   however that important differences regarding their framings and
   repertoires are to be found. Likewise, relevant overlapping membership
   between these groups and the SCC can be detected, even though both
   actors have reiterated that no formal links exist between them. Finally,
   that religion in secularized societies may become a public issue should
   there be religiously-inspired actors who successfully mobilize
   Conservative sectors in the society which express a high intensity of
   preferences in the face of morally-laden policies, is another finding to
   be borne in mind.},

Abstract = {Ambition enjoys an ambiguous status in political practice. It is at once
   necessary and dangerous. Although Machiavelli's engagement with Cicero
   in the Prince has been well-noted, his critique in the Discourses of his
   preeminent rival authority on republicanism has received very little
   attention. This critique concerns Cicero's failure to respond to the
   threat posed to republican institutions by the ambition of leading
   citizens. By following out the details of this critique, this article
   speaks both to recent debates about Machiavelli's republicanism and to
   the obscurity about the problem of ambition in contemporary politics.},

Abstract = {Does the hiring of political consultants make election races more
   competitive? If so, why? Most scholars of political consulting argue
   their expertise enhances competition; I argue that consultant reputation
   also boosts competition. Many political consultants are part of the
   Washington establishment, which notices their association with
   candidates. In particular, congressional candidates of the out party,
   especially challengers, have an incentive to hire the most reputable
   consultants to signal to political elites their viability. I demonstrate
   a positive empirical relationship between out-party candidates hiring
   top consultants (compared to less reputable ones) and how competitive
   their race is perceived by elites. These findings and theoretical
   insight provide a basis for understanding the high costs of political
   consultants and their impact on election outcomes.},

Abstract = {The claim that the 2008 presidential election was a transformative one
   is fast becoming part of the conventional wisdom of American politics.
   Despite the election's undoubted significance, this paper argues that
   factors affecting voting decisions were strikingly similar to those
   operating in many previous presidential elections. Using data from the
   CCAP six-wave national election survey, we demonstrate that a valence
   politics model provides a powerful, parsimonious explanation of the
   ballot decisions Americans made in 2008. As is typical in presidential
   elections, candidate images had major effects on electoral choice.
   Controlling for several other relevant factors, racial attitudes were
   strongly associated with how voters reacted to the candidates. Other
   models of electoral choice, such as a Downsian issue-proximity model,
   are also relevant, but their explanatory power is considerably less than
   that provided by the valence politics model. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {The authors examine the relationship between the variation of policy
   choices on offer in a party system and citizen satisfaction.
   Cross-national analyses, based on 12 countries from 1976 to 2003, are
   presented that suggest that when party choices in a political system are
   more ideologically proximate to the mean voter position in left-right
   terms, overall citizen satisfaction increases. The central implication
   of this finding is that party positions matter for understanding
   within-country changes in satisfaction.},

Abstract = {To what extent can the decline of class voting in the Netherlands be
   explained by sociological factors (compositional changes, the evolution
   of the class structure and economic progressivism) and political factors
   (a party-merger and changing party positions)? Multinomial logit (MNP)
   and conditional logit (CL) are employed using the Dutch Parliamentary
   Election Studies (1971-2006) and data of the Comparative Manifesto
   Project. We find that the rise of the class of social-cultural
   specialists is important for understanding changes in the class-vote
   relationship. Surprisingly, the impact of economic progressivism became
   more important for left-wing voting. Finally, although there seems to be
   a clear relation between party positions and the strength of class-based
   voting, the party positions hardly explain the assumed linear decline in
   class-based voting. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The deepening of the EU's acquis communautaire, transformations of the
   European continent, and intensifying webs or interdependence have, since
   the 1990s. prompted a progressing blurring of the functional boundaries
   of the European Union. Whereas the integration project has produced
   externalities early on, the EU has engaged in an active promotion of its
   norms and rules beyond the member states, designing concentric circles
   of flexible `EUropean' integration. This article offers a typology of
   these evolving external circles of EU rule-export focusing on the
   European Economic Area. Swiss-EU bilateralism, the stabilization and
   enlargement policy towards the candidate countries of the Western
   Balkans, the European Neighbourhood Policy and countries beyond the
   neighbourhood. Drawing on the theoretical notion of external governance,
   it will be shown these outer circles of `EUropean' integration fall into
   three groups. While the first group, the `quasi-member states' of
   Western Europe, combine far-reaching regulatory alignment with limited
   opportunities for organizational inclusion in EU structures. the Eastern
   and Southern neighbours lace less legalized forms of rule transfer along
   with the establishment of parallel regional organizational structures.
   Links with countries beyond the neighbourhood finally stress the
   functionally differentiated rather than political and territorial
   dynamics of EU external governance. Comparative European Politics (2011)

   identifies individual-level barriers to an efficient publication

   the analysis of the publication market, I introduce the `seven deadly

Abstract = {Chinese politicians and businessmen and their African counterparts are
   improving economic and commercial relations between them. This manifest
   interest of partnership needs a legal framework which guarantees equal
   and fair advantages to both parties. To reach this global aim, China and
   Africa must develop their collaboration in the domain of law. In the 80s
   China has adopted laws to reflect the country's economic and social
   demands such as Economic Contract Law (1981), Foreign Economic Contract
   Law (1985), General Principles of Civil Law (1987). Now, to better
   facilitate economic growth the National People's Congress (NPC) has
   unified China's various national specialized contract laws to obtain the
   ``Uniform{''}Contract Law 1999. OHADA is a system that aims the
   harmonization of business law in Africa. This study aims to compare the
   two systems contract formation, breach of contract and liability for
   breach in order to have a legal frame more appropriate for business
   between China and this part of African Continent.},

Abstract = {Many spatial theories of policymaking in the context of a system of
   checks and balances require the estimation of ideal points which are
   comparable across institutions. This analysis evaluates comparisons
   between the president, Senate, and House. For applications which presume
   that legislators change their positions over time, the most commonly
   used estimates impose too many restrictions on the ideal points. I
   consider an alternative approach to creating a common scale by using
   interest groups (American Conservative Union {[}ACU] and Americans for
   Democratic Action {[}ADA]) as reference actors and incorporating
   ``bridge votes,{''} roll calls on which the House and Senate vote on
   identical text. The analysis demonstrates this approach can produce
   comparable estimates across time and chamber.},

Journal = {OSTEUROPA},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {61},
Number = {8-9},
Pages = {309+},
Month = {AUG-SEP},
Abstract = {The films about the Leningrad Blockade are a reflection of memory
   culture. In the postwar era, a narrative about the heroic defence of the
   city dominated. Films served political mobilisation. During the thaw, it
   was possible to tell individual stories. Under Brezhnev, memory of the
   war was standardised and sacralised. Only thereafter did ideologically
   critical films make an issue of the hunger, suffering, and mass death.
   Going into the 1980s, films were still being produced about the
   blockade, among them monumental war epics and children's films. In
   today's Russia, memory of the blockade is kept alive by the genre of
   documentary film. The scope ranges from television infotainment to
   artistically excellent documentary films. At the core of the narratives
   are the harrowing pictures from the winter of 1941-42.},

Title = {Policy Analysts in the Bureaucracy Revisited: The Nature of Professional
   Policy Work in Contemporary Government},
Journal = {POLITICS \& POLICY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {39},
Number = {4},
Pages = {613-633},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Thirty-five years ago Arnold Meltsner observed that professional policy
   analysts in the U.S. government undertook several roles in the
   policy-making process, the most common of which involved ``technical{''}
   information processing while others were more ``political{''} in nature.
   Although still prescient, more recent empirical studies of professional
   policy work have found little evidence of the predominance of
   technicians in the ranks of analysts employed in public policy
   bureaucracies. However, only very weak and partial information exists on
   the situation in most countries, and descriptions of the nature of
   policy work often remain primarily normative and lacking in empirical
   referents. This article reexamines the duties and nature of contemporary
   professional policy analysis in the Canadian bureaucracy. It reveals
   that contemporary policy work is constituted by more complex and
   multisided practices than Meltsner and his followers described. These
   findings are significant for those wishing to understand, and improve,
   the nature of policy work in contemporary government.},

Abstract = {This work analyses remittances behavior in Mexico from a statistical
   point of view. The study identifies trends and seasonal movements in
   remittances that allow statistical modeling and forecast applying
   Box-Jenkins time series methodology. Results point out that a trend
   reverse from previous years is likelihood in 2012. However, if an
   economic recession occurs in the United States it could diminish current
   forecast. That would confirm that remittances show a pro cyclical
   behavior.},

Abstract = {Nations have historically sought power and prosperity through control of
   physical space. In recent decades, however, this has largely ceased.
   Most states that could do so appear relucant, while the weak cannot
   expand. This article presents a theory of imperialism and decolonization
   that explains both historic cycles of expansion and decline and the
   collective demise of the urge to colonize. Technological shocks enable
   expansion, while rising labour costs and the dynamics of military
   technology gradually dilute imperial advantage. Simultaneously, economic
   development leads to a secular decline in payoffs for appropriating
   land, minerals and capital. Once conquest no longer pays great powers,
   the systemic imperative to integrate production vertically also becomes
   archaic.},

Abstract = {In the years following 9/11, surveys have revealed high levels of public
   support for policies related to the war on terror that, many argue,
   contravene long-standing American ideals. Extant research would suggest
   that such preferences result from the activation of authoritarianism.
   That is, the terrorist attacks caused those predisposed toward
   intolerance and aggression to become even more intolerant and
   aggressive. However, using data from two national surveys, we find that
   those who score high in authoritarianism do not become more hawkish or
   less supportive of civil liberties in response to perceived threat from
   terrorism; they tend to have such preferences even in the absence of
   threat. Instead, those who are less authoritarian adopt more restrictive
   and aggressive policy stands when they perceive threat from terrorism.
   In other words, many average Americans become susceptible to
   ``authoritarian thinking{''} when they perceive a grave threat to their
   safety.},

   period 1990 - 2010. Demographic and labour market trends, violence and
   women's participation on Parliament are analyzed. Even though the

Abstract = {One of the reasons offered for gaps in organizations' cyber security is
   the lack of a ``cyber security culture.{''} This article defines and
   explores the concept of cyber security culture within the context of the
   U.S. Army. It concludes that the Army would benefit from the creation
   and adoption of a cyber security culture, though it would not be a
   security panacea. The article concludes by identifying and describing
   important elements of such a culture and practical advice for
   approaching culture change. These include: the development of policies
   that can be understood, adhered to, and enforced; change management
   efforts that unfreeze current culture, seek change, then
   refreeze/institutionalize changes; a structure that offers incentives
   for desired behaviors but also identifies and enforces compliance; and
   change efforts that emphasize change in knowledge/awareness and in
   attitude.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to examine the potential impact of
   Hispanics on the electoral geography of the southern United States after
   the 2010 decennial census. Hispanics are the largest and fastest-growing
   minority group in the United States today. In addition to traditional
   Hispanic destinations such as Florida and Texas, many of the areas
   experiencing the most rapid growth in Hispanic population are southern
   states such as Georgia, North Carolina, and Virginia. Geographic
   information systems are used to determine where majority-minority and
   influential districts are likely to emerge in southern states. We argue
   that although the Latino population has increased significantly over the
   past decade, the proportion of Latinos living in southern states remains
   relatively low in comparison to the general population. Therefore, no
   new majority-minority or influence districts will emerge in Louisiana,
   Mississippi, or Tennessee. Majority-minority and influence districts are
   likely to emerge in Arkansas, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina,
   and Virginia at the state and local levels, but not at the U. S.
   congressional level. Texas and Florida are the only southern states
   where new majority-minority and influence districts are likely to emerge
   at the U. S., state, and local levels after the 2010 decennial census.},

Abstract = {The nuclear disaster at Chernobyl affected 23 percent of Belarusian
   territory: 3,678 villages and towns, where more than half a million
   people lived. Soviet information and evacuation policies ensured that
   the accident and its consequences failed to secure a place in society's
   collective consciousness. The residents of the 415 villages within the
   ``zone{''} were not resettled together, but spread out over thousands of
   villages and towns throughout Belarus. Thus, their memory and the memory
   of them were pulverized. After 25 years, Chernobyl remains a blind spot
   even for those directly affected. It is time to take a look back at the
   first month after the disaster.},

Title = {Under which conditions does spending on active labor market policies
   increase? An fsQCA analysis of 53 governments between 1985 and 2003},
Journal = {EUROPEAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {3},
Number = {2},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This article examines the conditions under which governments increase
   spending on active labor market policies (ALMPs), as the European Union
   and the organization of economic co-operation and development recommend.
   Given that ALMPs are usually expensive and unlikely to win a government
   many votes, this study hypothesizes that an improving socio-economic
   situation is a necessary condition for increased spending. On the basis
   of the data of 53 governments from 18 established democracies between
   1985 and 2003, the fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis shows that
   there are different combinations of conditions, or routes, toward
   activation and that an improving socio-economic situation is needed for
   each of them. Specifically, the analysis reveals that governments
   activate under decreasing unemployment combined with (1) trade openness,
   or (2) the absence of corporatism in the case of leftist governments, or
   (3) the presence of corporatism in the case of rightist governments.
   These findings advance our understanding of the politics of labor market
   reform.},

Abstract = {Regional trade institutions increase the local market size and attract
   higher foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows. The new economic
   geography provides the theoretical model for evaluating the spatial
   distribution of foreign capital within a multistate market. In this
   article, a fixed-effects cross-sectional time series regression examines
   109 states from 1980-2005. The study's findings are that multilateral
   regional trade institutions are more likely to attract FDI inflows, and
   the gains in FDI inflows are highest in states with the strongest
   regional economy.},

Abstract = {Post foundational political thought says that there are limits to
   describe the conceptual difference between policy and politics in the
   empirical sphere. However, this paper proposes to ``track{''} forms of
   political participation from the experience of migrants that escape of
   any attempt of domestication. This will address the articulation of
   certain key places on the economy called ``global cities{''} and the
   production of international legal devices exceeding the sphere of
   sovereignty state and put into crisis the ``Westphalian{''} model which
   presupposes the existence dominant and unified authority political whose
   jurisdiction over a piece of land is supreme, from which emerge new
   political actors today pivoting between ``being part of{''} and ``being
   outside of{''} through democratic iteration of affirmation about the
   human rights.},

Abstract = {The Romanian party system suffered significant changes in the past two
   decades. Initially characterized by high levels of electoral volatility
   and fragmentation, it has gradually reached continuity and stability. To
   what extent is such a pattern reflected in the ideological developments
   within the party system? Through a longitudinal analysis of the three
   main political families in Romania - the conservatives, the
   social-democrats, and the liberals - we reveal the degrees of
   ideological institutionalization within the party system.},

Abstract = {Citizenship is usually regarded as the exclusive domain of the state.
   However, changes to the structure of states resulting from
   decentralisation and globalisation have required a re-conceptualisation
   of citizenship, as authority is dispersed, identities multiply and
   political entitlements vary across territorial levels. Decentralisation
   has endowed regions with control over a wide range of areas relating to
   welfare entitlements, education and cultural integration that were once
   controlled by the state. This has created a new form of `regional
   citizenship' based on rights, participation and membership at the
   regional level. The question of who does or does not belong to a region
   has become a highly politicised question. In particular, this article
   examines stateless nationalist and regionalist parties' (SNRPs)
   conceptions of citizenship and immigration. Given that citizenship marks
   a distinction between members and outsiders of a political community,
   immigration is a key tool for deciding who is allowed to become a
   citizen. Case study findings on Scotland, Quebec and Catalonia reveal
   that although SNRPs have advocated civic definitions of the region and
   welcome immigration as a tool to increase the regional population, some
   parties have also levied certain conditions on immigrants' full
   participation in the regional society and political life as a means to
   protect the minority culture of the region.},

Abstract = {How does the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) distinguish itself from
   the Democratic caucus? Will distinguishing itself lead to the CBC
   introducing legislation that is significantly different from the rest of
   the Democratic caucus? Will CBC members behave just as other Democrats
   with similar ideological temperaments? This article seeks to place the
   role of the contemporary CBC within the larger Democratic caucus. By
   tapping into bill introduction, I conclude that in most ways, the CBC is
   remarkably similar to the rest of the Democratic caucus, and in only
   small ways, is there a demonstrable difference. CBC representation
   ensures constituents an increased likelihood that their congressperson
   will introduce legislation related to the government but not in Civil
   Rights or Community Development. Thus, the value to liberal black voters
   in electing black representatives to Congress is largely in the liberal
   voting behavior of black representatives, not the value they bring to
   bill introduction.},

Volume = {17},

Abstract = {`What constitutes a new political party?' The answer to this question is
   central to the analysis of stability, continuity and change of party
   organizations, inter-party politics (party systems) and the political
   system as a whole. Yet, political science literature does not offer a
   standard answer to this question. The use of different
   conceptualizations limits the ability of political scientists to
   communicate with each other, and a lack of awareness of the variations
   in the conceptualization and operationalization of new parties may lead
   to errors in the interpretation of data. This study proposes two tools
   by which to analyse a party's `newness'. The first involves a
   multidimensional framework that enables the relative `newness' of a
   party to be reckoned; the second is a definition that proposes a
   threshold to determine (dichotomously) whether a party should be
   considered as new or not. We use the borderline case of the Israeli
   party Kadima to demonstrate the usefulness of these tools at the level
   of the party and its significance at the party system level.},

Abstract = {At the height of the global economic crisis in 2009, Poland was all the
   talk. It was the only member state of the EU and the OECD that did not
   plunge into recession. The market economy created over the past two
   decades proved to be largely stable. Since 1989, Poland's economic
   structure has moved considerably towards the conditions of western EU
   countries. However, the crisis has slowed Poland's process of catching
   up. The move up into the Champions League of European economic powers
   will still take some time.},

Abstract = {In only 10 years, Wikipedia has risen from obscurity to become the

   visitor can edit any page on Wikipedia, which hardly fosters confidence
   in its accuracy. In this article, I review thousands of Wikipedia
   articles about candidates, elections, and office holders to assess both
   the accuracy and the thoroughness of Wikipedia's coverage. I find that
   Wikipedia is almost always accurate when a relevant article exists, but
   errors of omission are extremely frequent. These errors of omission
   follow a predictable pattern. Wikipedia's political coverage is often
   very good for recent or prominent topics but is lacking on older or more
   obscure topics.},

Journal = {FORUM-A JOURNAL OF APPLIED RESEARCH IN CONTEMPORARY POLITICS},
Year = {2011},

Number = {1},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Several studies of the post-war American political economy find that
   Democratic presidents have been more successful than Republicans. Most
   recently, Bartels (2008) found that economic growth had been greater and
   that unemployment and income inequality had been lower under Democratic
   presidents since 1948. If true, these findings combined with the
   frequent success of Republicans in presidential elections pose a
   challenge to theories of retrospective voting and responsible party
   government. This reexamination of these findings indicates that they are
   an artifact of specification error. Previous estimates did not properly
   take into account the lagged effects of the economy. Once lagged
   economic effects are taken into account, party differences in economic
   performance are shown to be the effects of economic conditions inherited
   from the previous president and not the consequence of real policy
   differences. Specifically, the economy was in recession when Republican
   presidents became responsible for the economy in each of the four
   post-1948 transitions from Democratic to Republican presidents. This was
   not the case for the transitions from Republicans to Democrats. When
   economic conditions leading into a year are taken into account, there
   are no presidential party differences with respect to growth,
   unemployment, or income inequality.},

Volume = {55},
Number = {2},
Pages = {247-262},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The ``democratic peace{''}-the inference that democracies rarely fight
   each other-is one of the most important and empirically robust findings
   in international relations (IR). This article surveys the statistical
   challenges to the democratic peace and critically analyzes a prominent
   recent critique (Gartzke 2007). Gartzke's claim that capitalist dynamics
   explain away the democratic peace relies on results problematically
   driven by (1) the censoring from the sample of observations containing
   certain communist countries or occurring before 1966, (2) the inclusion
   of regional controls, and (3) a misspecification of temporal controls.
   Analysis of these issues contributes to broader methodological debates
   and reveals novel characteristics of the democratic peace. Gartzke and
   other critics have contributed valuably to the study of IR; however, the
   democratic peace remains one of the most robust empirical associations
   in IR.},

Abstract = {How does a military's recruitment policy-whether a country has a draft
   or conscript army-influence mass support for war? We investigate how
   military recruitment affects the way the American public evaluates
   whether a war is worth fighting. While some argue that conscription
   decreases support for war by making its costs more salient, others argue
   that it increases support by signaling the importance of the conflict.
   Existing evidence is inconclusive, with data limited to one particular
   conflict. Using an original survey experiment, we find strong support
   for the argument that conscription decreases mass support for war, a
   finding that replicates in several different settings. We also show that
   these findings are driven by concerns about self-interest, consistent
   with our theory. We conclude by discussing the relevance of these
   findings for debates about how domestic political conditions influence
   when states go to war.},

Abstract = {Do hierarchical politics in the federal judiciary shape collegial
   politics on the U.S. Courts of Appeals and thus influence judicial
   voting and case outcomes? I develop a model in which the political
   control of the dual layer of hierarchy above three-judge panels-full
   circuits and the Supreme Court-affects the ability of a single
   Democratic or Republican judge on a three-judge panel to influence two
   colleagues from the opposing party. The theory predicts that panel
   majorities should be more strongly influenced by a single judge of the
   opposing party-a ``counter-judge{''}-when that judge is aligned with the
   Supreme Court. Examining thousands of judicial votes in multiple issue
   areas, I show that the effect of adding a counter-judge to a panel is
   indeed asymmetric, and varies based on hierarchical alignment. The
   interaction of hierarchical and collegial politics increases the Supreme
   Court's control of the judicial hierarchy and helps promote the rule of
   law.},

Abstract = {A transitional polity in the third wave of democratization may adopt
   many western institutional forms, yet its minority and disadvantaged
   groups may continue to face greater obstacles in addressing
   environmental injustice issues than those in more mature democracies. In
   a recent case in Taiwan, residents in a disadvantaged community were
   initially unaware of or reluctant to acknowledge the environmental harms
   that had been inflicted upon them. They were not mobilized until policy
   entrepreneurs from outside the community began to press the issue on
   their behalf by gaining their trust and support and by navigating
   various political and policy institutions, which at the same time were
   undergoing democratic transformations toward more inclusiveness. The
   case illustrates the interactions of identity politics and social
   movement leadership in the context of changing political opportunity
   structures.},

Abstract = {Until now, democracy research has hardly looked into how the manner in
   which the previous regime's human rights violations are dealt with
   affects the ability of young democracies to consolidate. The article
   supports the assumption that the search for truth and justice only
   influences certain democratic partial regimes and focuses on the Rule of
   Law dimension. While discussing possible effects of reconciliation work
   on the evolution of standards and institutions of the Rule of Law in
   theory, the article also points out the challenges of specifying and
   measuring the concepts pertaining to the dependent and independent
   variables. Empirical analyses provide clear indications of a positive
   relationship between reconciliation work and the Rule of Law. The
   challenges of further research on the effect of transitional justice are
   examined in this light.},

Abstract = {In comparison to research practices, intersectionality is an
   underdeveloped concept within policy discourse and application. Because
   of the complexity and relative newness of this approach, policy analysis
   grounded within an intersectionality framework remains largely
   undertheorized, and methods for integrating intersectionality into
   policy processes are in the nascent stages. This article (1) defines
   intersectionality and demonstrates the need for this approach in public
   policy, (2) outlines challenges in applying intersectionality to policy
   making, and (3) describes and evaluates three innovative approaches to
   applying intersectionality to policy development and analysis.},

Abstract = {States have come together throughout the past decades in an effort to
   legalise navigation and trade activity on the seas. The international
   community have taken account of the traditional behaviour of coastal
   states towards each other as well as past discussions on the subject.
   Recently there has been much discussion on the UNCLOS, and the efforts
   and effects of this major piece of legislation on member and non-member
   states. Increase in global population and the advancement of technology
   in fisheries as well as increasing pollution of the seas have resulted
   in grave depletion of marine resources. State subsidies to the fishing
   sector have trade and ecological consequences, especially for fisheries
   that are over-exploited. Growing interest in this biological problem has
   sparked the need to establish principles which would rationalise
   exploitation of live aquatic wealth.},

Abstract = {Actor-network theory suggests that those responsible for the operations
   of a complex system have reason to defend the idea of the system's
   stability in the face of challengers who suggest the system may have
   problems. One form this defence can take is the formation of a complex
   social network that makes it difficult for challengers' claims to be
   reasonably considered. This paper illustrates the formation or
   activation of such a network of Icelandic bankers, analysts,
   politicians, academics, business executives and newspapers, as well as
   their rational and emotional public arguments, in defence of the idea of
   the stability of the Icelandic banking system when challenged by the
   Danske Bank report of 2006. The analysis shows why it was difficult for
   the Danish challenge to receive a credible hearing among the Icelandic
   citizenry, which meant that citizens had a difficult time getting a
   clear picture of what was happening in their community. This research
   also shows a wider application for actor-network theory than previously
   discussed in the literature and draws implications of network formation
   or activation for policy makers.},

Abstract = {Recent research has shown the rise of domestic contention over European
   integration. This paper examines the extent to which preferences over
   European integration influence domestic party support in 19 European
   Union (EU) member states in West and East-Central Europe (ECE). The
   analysis finds broad evidence of EU issue voting across the countries
   included in the analysis, but the effect of the EU issue on party
   preferences is stronger in ECE. These results are consistent with the
   view that the same underlying causal dynamics explain party and voter
   behavior in both West and ECE, but the post-communist legacy shapes the
   political and economic contexts in the ECE states, resulting in
   predictable differences between the two regions. Comparative European

Abstract = {The summer ice cover in the northern polar sea has receded

   Russia's use of straight baselines has met with objections. There are
   also competing interpretations in the question whether the exemption
   clauses for ice covered areas as formulated in the Convention on the Law
   of the Seas allow the use of national rules for shipping instead of the
   regulations of maritime law.},

   issues relevant to United States-Mexico foreign relations, to the
   present, where that cooperation has broken down substantially. I offer a
   panorama of the scope and content of labor cooperation between Mexico
   and the United States, across both formal channels of representation,
   such as the NAFTA institutions and bilateral meetings, as well as the
   informal channels, including those forged by civil society and labor
   unions across borders. I then provide insight into the erosion of labor
   cooperation in recent years, discuss the wavering commitment to labor
   issues across successive administrations in both Mexico and the United
   States, and speculate as to what impact this may have on U.S.-Mexican
   relations more broadly.},

Abstract = {Presidential influence is partly a function of the partisan, economic,
   and international context within which the president governs. Presidents
   arc, however, more than bystanders relying on the political milieu for
   policy opportunities. Recent scholarship demonstrates that presidents
   consciously influence this milieu and build political capital by
   campaigning for congressional candidates. We contribute to this
   literature by assessing the effects of presidential campaigning on
   legislative support for two presidents who governed under extremely
   dissimilar circumstances: Bill Clinton in the 106th Congress and George
   W Bush in the 108th Congress. We find evidence of campaign effects on
   congressional policymaking during both administrations.},

Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {18},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {388-414},
Abstract = {Cameroon's President Paul Biya has weathered the transition from a
   single-party to a multi-party system, dramatically strengthening his
   control over the political apparatus in recent years. While many have
   noted the tendency of Africa's new `democrats' to consolidate their
   authority by removing various constitutional restraints on their power,
   this paper argues that Paul Biya has adapted more subtly to the various
   opportunities provided by open political competition and international
   discourse on minority rights. Beyond the sadly predictable fraud in
   electoral counting, he has manipulated electoral boundaries to his
   party's advantage, while at the same time prohibited voting access to
   citizens who would likely vote for the opposition. In addition, he has
   acceded to constitutional changes to recognize minorities in compliance
   with international and domestic pressures, which is in reality yet
   another useful tool to marginalize the opposition.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES},

Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Pages = {33-51},
Abstract = {In her more recent work, Chantal Mouffe enters into what she calls a
   `dialogue' with Carl Schmitt on the political. So far, interpretations
   of this dialogue suggest that Mouffe attempts to revise Schmitt's
   friend/enemy-distinction and carve out a theory of agonistic pluralism.
   An interpretation on these grounds, this article argues, reduces the
   dialogue to its analytical dimension and cannot comfortably be upheld.
   Mouffe indeed appropriates Schmitt's friend/enemydistinction, but she
   also gets inspired by the metatheoretical facet of his intellectual
   heritage with the result that her theory becomes organically interwoven
   with a polemical dimension. Rather than aiming at a post-structuralist
   defanging of Schmitt's conception of the political, Mouffe
   recontextualizes and applies it to the current academic discourse, for
   this allows decontesting her radical pluralist cause by establishing a
   we/them opposition along a political/post-political divide.},

Journal = {BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES OF TERRORISM AND POLITICAL AGGRESSION},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {3},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {131-149},
Abstract = {This article argues that academic debates on how and why terrorism is
   defined should not be reserved solely for abstract discussions about
   concepts of power, legitimacy and subjectivity, but should also include
   empirical, interdisciplinary case studies. Through the examination of UK
   legislation, debates of the Houses of Parliament and government
   commissioned reports and consultation papers, this article will
   demonstrate that a critical analysis of a particular case study can
   address some of the questions raised by philosophical debates on the
   definition of terrorism: how is terrorism defined? Who defines terrorism
   and why? What accounts for changing interpretations of what constitutes
   a terrorist or a terrorist organisation? Is there a single definition of
   terrorism that is acceptable to all societies? By examining how and why
   the definition of terrorism has evolved in UK law over the twentieth and
   twenty-first centuries, this article adds an empirical dimension to the
   academic debate on definitions of terrorism and presents the case that
   interdisciplinary studies of terrorism will greatly advance academic
   understandings of the field.},

   APPURTENANCE},
Journal = {POLITICKE VEDY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {14},

Pages = {27-36},
Abstract = {We propose to present a paper on the application of Ferdinand Tonnies'
   conceptual dichotomy ``Gemeinschaft{''} and ``Gesellschaft{''} to
   concepts and conceptions of citizenship and nationality. This reflection
   on the ultimate bases of appurtenance illuminates possible intentions
   behind the expression, ``community{''} in the political constructs of
   the European Communities. Here, we propose to return to Tonnies' work
   first to explore appurtenance to a common entity upon the basis of the
   Universalist natural law developed by Thomas Hobbes. Here, utilitarian
   anthropological assumptions underlie a quest for forms of governance
   with formal equality of appurtenance (Gesellschaft). Then we shall
   explore appurtenance based upon shared particularities rooted in blood,
   in soil and in time (Gemeinschaft), in which cultural assimilation is a
   prerequisite and appurtenance is asserted by degrees according to
   rootedness. The evolution of definitions of ``community{''} in the
   course of the twentieth century is related to the rise and fall of the
   attractiveness of Gemeinschaft when compared with Gesellschaft. This
   shall be illustrated with reference to the thought of Dominique
   Schnapper. We shall conclude with an exploration of historical
   distinctions related to the debate on nationality and citizenship in
   Germany, with its specific terminology of Staatsvolk, Volksgenosse,
   Staatsburger, etc.},

Abstract = {The aim of this volume is to explore again the notion of generation,
   which is of very common use in political sciences. It relies on a
   sociological definition inspired by K. Mannheim. According to him, age
   cohorts don't always form a sociological generation. It requires not
   only people linked with the same events and the same experiences during
   the youth, but also that these experiences take place in the same
   historical and social background. Parting from the political
   institutions rather than from the events labelled as ``political{''} in
   the media and in the dominant discourse, this volume puts under scrutiny
   the generational socialization of some population not very visible. It
   invites us to study, behind the so-called ``generation conflict{''}, the
   political work of representing and mobilizing different generational
   groups.},

Volume = {2},

Abstract = {The EU's borders, and those of its member states, are shifting zones of
   power arranged by novel institutional strategies and the subsequent
   proliferation of legal texts, maps, technologies and actors,
   reconstructing where and what the border is. This paper focuses on the
   phenomenon of ``border externalization{''} in the European Union, in
   particular the case of Spain, describing it as a stretching of the
   borderline. Externalization includes the outsourcing of border control
   to non-EU countries, as well as the spatial extension of where EU
   governments and forces can patrol, thus a literal expansion of the
   borderline. The latest EU strategy of border policy and migration
   control yet to be fully implemented is called ``the Migration Routes
   Initiative{''} and involves spreading checkpoints, migration control
   experts and other dispositifs of migration management along shifting
   migrants itineraries passing through sending, transit and destination
   countries. In this paper we identify different policies and institutions
   that constitute this ``external dimension{''} of border management for
   the EU as a whole and for Spain vis-a-vis its Southern borders with
   Africa, mainly focusing on the Rabat Process. These changes in migration
   management practices present possible reconfigurations in the exercise
   of sovereignty and its relationship to territoriality.},

Abstract = {``Cultural{''} approaches in Geography have opened new perspectives on
   the relationship between religious beliefs and practices and the
   different theoretical and existential dimensions of space, often related
   to the construction of subjectivity and bodily experience. In this
   context, this paper presents a case of study (based on ethnographic
   research) in which the sacred and urban spatial practices become the
   subject of a dispute about the urban structure of the town in the
   province of Toledo (Spain). Through the dispute for spatial practices,
   collective emotions come into play and symbols of collective identity
   are constructed and deconstructed. The paper addresses first the
   description of the municipal context in which events occur, followed by
   the description and analysis of the conflict, ending with some
   conclusions about the case.},

Abstract = {An exit poll conducted on behalf of the three main UK broadcasting
   organizations for the 2010 general election predicted that the Liberal
   Democrats would win fewer seats than in 2005, a suggestion that was met
   with widespread disbelief amongst commentators. Not only did this
   forecast prove correct, but the poll's prediction that the Conservatives
   would be the largest party in a hung parliament with 307 seats also
   proved to be spot on. This paper describes and evaluates the methodology
   of the poll. The key features were a focus on changes in party vote
   shares facilitated by conducting the poll in the same places as at the
   previous election, modelling of the variation in those estimated
   changes, and a probabilistic approach to identifying the likely outcome
   in seats. All three features contributed to the accuracy of the 2010
   poll. The data provided a highly accurate estimate of the change in the
   Liberal Democrat vote. Meanwhile, a slight overestimation of the swing
   from Labour to the Conservatives was corrected by the modelling of
   changes in vote shares and the use of a probabilistic approach to seat
   prediction.},

Abstract = {Since the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in 2003, it has
   been argued that there has been a substantial revision to the norm
   dictating the behaviour of states in the event of a disease outbreak.
   This article examines the evolution of the norm to `report and verify'
   disease outbreaks and evaluates the extent to which this revised norm
   has begun to guide state behaviour. Examination of select East Asian
   countries affected by human infections of the H5N1 (avian influenza)
   virus strain reveals the need to further understand the mutually
   constitutive relationship between the value attached to prompt reporting
   against the capacity to report, and how states manage both in fulfilling
   their duty to report.},

Title = {British perceptions of the East Pakistan Crisis 1971: `hideous
   atrocities on both sides'?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GENOCIDE RESEARCH},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {13},

Pages = {421-450},
Abstract = {British intelligence reports from 1971 describe how Pakistan suffered
   acute instability after central government forces attempted to brutally
   quash the East Pakistan nationalist movement, sparking guerrilla
   resistance and extensive social disorder. Much of the British media,
   political opposition and public sided with the nationalists, accusing
   government forces of violating human rights, and even of genocide. The
   British government, in contrast, declared it would not interfere in
   `hideous atrocities ... being committed on both sides'. While intent on
   neutrality and non-interference, officials continued deliberating on how
   to react to the crisis as it evolved. As a result, British
   responses-which extended to aid and diplomacy-were shaped by a number of
   contextual factors, including: the nature of diplomatic reports from the
   region, public and parliamentary pressure, Cold War geopolitical
   constraints and, as expected, strategic calculations of Britain's
   interests on the subcontinent. Reflecting both self-interest and genuine
   concern, British responses to the East Pakistan crisis highlight the
   complexities in comprehending multi-layered nationalist conflict, which
   government observers readily perceive as civil war.},

Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},

Volume = {18},
Number = {3},
Pages = {797-822},
Abstract = {This article contributes to filling a gap in the resurgent literature on
   legislative candidate selection procedures by analysing the adoption of
   such procedures in nascent democracies. We contend that within
   transitional systems distinct contexts constrain choice and bargaining
   for candidate selection procedures in different ways, and condition the
   adoption of legislative candidate selection procedures by parties. In
   particular we posit that the relative levels of uncertainty about the
   installation and continuance of democracy, strategic complexity of the
   electoral system, and party leadership autonomy, create incentives for
   the adoption of more or less inclusive candidate selection procedures.
   We evaluate our propositions based on evidence from the relevant
   political parties in Spain and Chile.},

Abstract = {Why do authoritarian dominant parties, once established, continue to win
   elections or lose power? Employing a time-series cross-national analysis
   of election outcomes and two country case studies, the author shows that
   dominant parties endure despite poor economic performance, voter demand
   for new parties, and sufficiently permissive electoral institutions.
   Instead, the author demonstrates that dominant parties continue to win
   when they can politicize public resources, and they fail when
   privatizations put the state's fiscal power out of their reach. The
   argument has implications for the fate of dominant parties, transitions
   to democracy in competitive authoritarian regimes, and the study of
   incumbency advantages and electoral fairness in comparative politics.},

Journal = {POLITISCHE VIERTELJAHRESSCHRIFT},

Volume = {52},
Number = {1},
Pages = {3-28},
Abstract = {Annulment actions before the European Court of Justice allow national
   actors to call into question supranational actions and decisions. By
   studying all annulment cases initiated by Member States against the
   European Commission since 1957 we show a substantial clustering in EU
   agriculture and competition policy, an action cycle over time and that
   some Member States are more likely plaintiffs than others. We argue that
   the struggle between member state governments and the Commission,
   becoming visible in these annulment cases, can be understood as a
   conflict about supranational executive action. Given that the EU
   increasingly has to assure application of supranational policy not only
   new policy formulation we expect conflicts about supranational executive
   action to grow and to become a constitutive element of the integration
   process. Based on an empirical analysis of annulment actions the paper
   develops an explanatory model that allows for isolating supranational
   and national factors explaining these conflicts about the concrete
   realization of EU-policies in the multilevel system.},

   physical and logistical limitations, while the great expectations made
   on such weapon systems could not be matched by performance. Yet directed
   energy may now be reaching a new phase of maturity. New emphasis on
   lower-powered systems could offer an advantageous set of tools,

Abstract = {Economists have explained the 2007-2008 global financial crisis with
   reference to various market and regulatory failures as well as a
   macroeconomic environment of cheap credit during the precrisis period.
   These developments had important political causes that scholars of
   international political economy (WE) should have been well positioned to
   study before the crisis. How well did they anticipate the crisis?
   Although none foresaw all the causes, a number of IPE scholars correctly
   identified many of the dangers associated with new models of
   securitization as well as accompanying regulatory failures and the
   politics underlying them. IRE scholars were less successful in
   identifying the macroeconomic roots of the crisis, particularly the role
   of international capital flows in fueling the U.S. financial bubble, but
   some scholars did usefully explore the politics that contributed to the
   latter phenomenon. The study of IPE scholarship in this episode contains
   useful lessons for the field's future.},

Abstract = {Since 1978 when Juan Linz posited his fears about the ``perils of
   presidentialism,{''} presidential democracies have been less likely to
   break down. Nonetheless, presidents continue to confront challenges.
   Between 1978 and 2006, 30 percent of all democratically elected
   presidents worldwide faced serious efforts to remove them from office,
   and 12 percent were forced out before their terms ended. While scholars
   have explored the sources of these crises, focusing on their effects is
   equally important. If such crises have profound consequences, then even
   with regime collapse not at issue, presidentialism would remain
   associated with normatively bad outcomes. Yet if challenges or failures
   have minimal effects, then early presidential exit may represent an
   underappreciated equilibrating mechanism. The evidence indicates that
   the challenges and falls in Latin America cause only superficial and
   ephemeral damage to democratic governance.},

Abstract = {This study explores a new facet of how the ethnic composition of states
   and the power of ethnic kin affect dyadic interstate conflict. Here,
   emphasis is placed on dyads containing ethnically diverse states with
   dominant ethnic groups. States with dominant ethnic groups but still
   significant ethnic minorities are expected to be more prone to
   international ethnic conflict than states without one of these two
   characteristics. Variation in ethnic composition is captured by a new
   measure. Looking at large-N panel data, it is found that dyads composed
   of ethnically diverse states with dominant ethnic groups are the most
   likely to engage in interstate ethnic conflict in which force has been
   used. Additionally, the power of a cross-border ethnic kin minority, as
   expressed in its share of the host state's population or its settlement
   patterns, also increases the likelihood of dyadic interstate ethnic
   conflict. Variables capturing ethnic dimensions have the strongest
   effect on interstate ethnic conflict compared to other traditional
   variables like regime similarity, capability and proximity.},

Title = {Can democratization undermine democracy? Economic and political reform
   in Uganda},
Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {18},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {415-442},
Abstract = {Democratization in Uganda may be seen as a form of policy transfer where
   the meaning of a multi-party system is significantly altered as a
   reflection of both the domestic political context, and the interests of
   the international donors. In making this argument, this paper provides
   three case studies of conflict between Uganda's parliament and executive
   branch over banking reform, central bank independence and electricity
   sector reform, between 1996 and 2006. Despite taking place in the
   no-party system, the executive oversight that the legislature provided
   constituted a particular form of substantive or `thick' democracy, where
   parliament functioned as an effective opposition. This, in turn, created
   an incentive for Uganda's executive branch to promote the 2005 shift to
   a multi-party system, in order to produce a formal-legal or `thin' form
   of democracy in which the executive branch could control parliament.
   This shift was supported by a donor community more interested in
   pursuing neo-liberal reforms in recipient states than in defending
   existing forms of substantive democracy.},

Pages = {326-348},
Abstract = {In this article the ecological modernisation is being presented as a
   hegemonic project in the international climate policy. Ecological
   modernisation emphasizes a treatment of climate change which is derived
   from institutionalised interpretation and behaviour patterns, and thus
   counteracts a radical transformation of societal relations to nature.
   The exploratory analysis of the Special Report on Carbon Dioxide Capture
   and Storage indicates a reproduction of this hegemonic project of
   ecological modernisation in policy advice of the Intergovernmental Panel
   on Climate Change (IPCC). The results of the analysis support the
   hypothesis developed in this article that the technology of Carbon
   Capture and Storage plays a key role in debates on the need for a
   radical transformation of social relations to nature.},

   represented as savage and in need of settler-imposed control, and also
   primitive and in need of development. These constructions understand
   Aboriginality temporally, situating it in the past but providing moral
   justification for coercing Indigenous people into the settler present.
   Aboriginality is also constructed spatially in this discourse, with
   prescribed communities framed as the location of both authentic
   Aboriginality and of threatening disorder. The intervention is framed as
   extending settler authority over this troubling terrain, containing and
   redeeming Aboriginality through inclusion in the settler nation's moral
   order.},

Title = {Democracy and `punitive populism': exploring the Supreme Court's role in
   El Salvador},
Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {18},
Number = {1},
Pages = {52-74},
Abstract = {El Salvador is characterized by the sad record of having one of the
   highest degrees of violence and crime in Latin America. Recent
   governments have tried to fight it with programmes called `mano dura' or
   `super-mano dura' with measures and practices that have often violated
   human rights and judicial guarantees. This paper aims to explore the
   Supreme Court's role in the application of these policies by the
   Salvadoran government. We discovered that the highest court in this
   country supports this kind of policies termed by some analysts `policies
   of punitive populism'. In this sense, the Constitutional Chamber acted
   in contrast to what is required by democratic theory. The paper proceeds
   as follows: in the first part we analyse the theoretical framework of
   public safety policies and frame the Salvadoran case. In the second
   part, we explore the Supreme Court cases that support (or not) these
   policies, examining the performance of the court in relation to these
   cases. The last part is a summary of our evidence.},

Journal = {RETHINKING MARXISM-A JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS CULTURE \& SOCIETY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Pages = {50-59},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This paper is an attempt to extrapolate an ethical paradigm from Marx's
   discussion of surplus value in the first volume of Capital. It sets out
   to put that discussion in conversation with certain ``postmodern''
   approaches to ethics that focus on the ways in which particular acts of
   predation and violation are allowed to proceed precisely because they
   are invisible from the perspective of the prevailing legal-juridical
   discourses. It examines the Marxian notion of the nature of labor as a
   commodity by means of Slavoj Zizek's concept of a ``parallax relation.''
   Ultimately, it argues that there is a fundamental affinity between
   Marx's analysis of labor and Lacanian ethics in that both rely on the
   location of a conceptual space in which the law coincides with its own
   transgression and that this is the space in which both (Lacan explicitly
   and Marx more implicitly) situate the ethical subject.},

Abstract = {To evaluate calls for a more theoretically generalizable, large-N study
   of EU interest representation, we adapt the ESA model of interest system
   density, originally developed to study the interest communities of the
   American states, to the EU case. We necessarily modify both model and
   measures in order to account for the unique features of the EU policy
   process. We test the model with OLS regression using data on the density
   of different types or guilds (economic and social sectors) of organized
   interests in the European Union. We use the findings to discuss the
   viability of inter-system transfers of theories about the politics of
   interest representation.},

Abstract = {Theorists of civil-military relations have for long tried to identify
   the specific factors that lead to weak civilian control of the armed
   forces in some countries and very strong oversight regimes in others.
   While some authors highlight the importance of structural factors (such
   as the level of economic modernization), others point to the crucial
   role of personal agency (i.e., the quality and characteristics of
   leadership). Obviously, some form of interplay between structure and
   agency does occur, but the precise patterns of this relationship have
   rarely been explored. This article analyses the overall strong, yet
   institutionally volatile state of civilian control in post-authoritarian
   Indonesia, and evaluates the role of structural and agency-related
   factors in this outcome. It concludes that Indonesia has broken its
   supposed path dependence in several historical, economic and political
   areas, suggesting that post-1998 actions by political leaders and elite
   groups have played a more significant role in shaping the new
   civil-military relationship than commonly thought.},

Abstract = {The debate on the Basque Statute during the Spanish Republic (1931-39)
   became an exceptional political myth in contemporary Basque politics.
   According to current political narratives of Basque identity, the
   traditional will to selfgovernment of the Basque people was expressed
   during those years in a broad demand for autonomy and collective
   identity. This article outlines the social complexity of the autonomy
   project, more related to religion than to ethnic conflict. This approach
   suggests that present concerns with Basque identity narratives undermine
   the historical parameters operative in the past, disabling our
   understanding of the history of the Basques.},

Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {34},

Pages = {1250-1271},
Abstract = {The article shows that civil servants who believe that the long-term
   interest of society is best served by their detached policy advice to
   policy-makers also hold on to their opinion more than any other actor
   involved in policy development. However, more civil servants currently
   emphasise responsiveness, at the expense of detached analysis, owing to
   increased exposure to international consultancy and forums. As a
   consequence, the attitude of civil servants in developing public policy
   is more likely to be indistinguishable from that of actors who have
   political functions, without significant variation from country to
   country. Evidence supporting this argument is provided by an analysis of
   the results of a survey first conducted in 2006 and repeated in 2008.
   The two waves of the survey drew responses from civil servants, interest
   group representatives and non-governmental experts who contribute to
   biotechnology policy development in the United States, Canada, the
   United Kingdom, France and the European Union.},

   regional-level administration, and reinforcing the instruments of
   parliamentary control of the regional governments and emergence of
   elements inherent to direct democracy. Despite their constitutional
   autonomy, far from questioning federal unity, these constitutional
   reforms point towards the effective realisation of its constitutional

Volume = {26},

Pages = {329-343},
Abstract = {For the past 20 years academics referring to the constituency caseload
   of Teachta Dalas (TDs) have in the main been forced to use data that
   were collected and analysed during a period which is now of limited
   comparability. This paper presents an analysis of twenty-first century
   TDs and their caseload. An analysis of how technological advancements
   and societal changes have altered the caseload of TDs will be explored.
   This is relevant because some had argued that the modernisation of
   society would decrease their level of constituency work. A profile of
   the constituents who contact TDs and the nature of their cases will be
   presented as will an outline of how they divide their time. Furthermore,
   this paper will also assess how TDs view their role as a broker and how
   influential their intervention can actually be in representations made
   on behalf of their constituents. This paper sets out to bridge the gap
   between research conducted during the 1970s and 1980s and the present
   day. Furthermore, it intends both to dispel and to enhance many
   long-held perceptions regarding the Irish TD.},

   officials began spying on Americans, plotting to kill foreign leaders,

   began to conduct real conspiracies, many Americans began to suspect it
   of even worse crimes, like the mass murder of American citizens to
   provide a pretext for war. Until the federal government becomes
   committed to transparency and openness, these toxic conspiracy theories
   will continue to pollute the body politic.},

Journal = {ASIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-24},
Abstract = {There is a certain ambiguity in the definition of regions and this can
   be seen in the relationship between the Association of Southeast Asian
   Nations (ASEAN) and Timor-Leste. This article discusses how regional
   actors have adopted and re-shaped the externally-imposed geographic and
   political definitions of Southeast Asia. These definitions were
   stabilized through the institutionalization of policies and practices of
   exclusion and inclusion which have affirmed the legitimacy of certain
   entities in the organization (i.e. being ASEAN), the acceptability of
   certain behaviours (i.e. acting as ASEAN), and the appropriate
   interpretive frames with which to solve problems (i.e. seeing as ASEAN).
   This enabled ASEAN to present a modicum of cohesion even while it
   facilitated the exclusion of East Timor as a `legitimate' political
   actor in Southeast Asia. Over time, however, these definitions were
   destabilized by a convergence of external crises and increasing
   inconsistencies within ASEAN. As ASEAN embarks on redefining the
   Southeast Asian `community', Timor-Leste is trying to demonstrate its
   bona fides by `becoming' an ASEAN state with the requisite institutional
   capabilities, and `acting' and `seeing' as an ASEAN state in order to
   generate a positive consensus on its membership.},

Abstract = {Nowadays the search for technological solutions that would allow taking
   extraterritorial activity of the corporate sector under control is
   moving to the forefront of politico-legal regulation. The historically
   elaborated mechanisms that used to rather successfully maintain socially
   acceptable forms of corporate behavior are losing their efficiency, and
   states and social communities appear to be armless before the increasing
   power of transnational corporations. The article presents the analysis
   of politico-legal reasons for the growing deficit of modern states'
   authority regarding TNCs with the main one being the contradiction
   between the principles of exclusive territoriality and state
   sovereignty, on the one side, and tendencies of deterritorialization and
   denationalization of economic activity, on the other side. The author
   also evaluates chances for the creation of compensatory mechanisms that
   will be able to overcome problems generated by the territorial logic of
   powers of authority distribution.},

   to be able to answer such question one should define precisely the scope
   of the very notion of European identity as it has been the subject of
   permanent disagreement among scholars dealing with the nexus between
   democracy, citizenship and identity in the EU. Following this conceptual
   clarification I will then outline the two leading working hypotheses of
   this analysis, namely: European identity is being constructed in a
   process of symbolic othering. European `we feeling' is primarily though
   not exclusively defined in opposition to significant others; and
   European identity is discursively constructed collective identity based
   on European citizenship.},

Abstract = {One quarter of all apartments in Vienna is located in so-called
   ``Grunderzeit{''} buildings. The Grunderzeit areas of the city are
   characterized by a stable urban structure, which has withstood the test
   of time for more than one hundred years while proving its capacity to
   accommodate and integrate major demographic shifts. However, also the
   following trend emerged, resulting in adverse effects on the quality of
   life in these densely-built urban areas: the visual and functional
   homogenization of the buildings' street-level zone in tandem with a loss
   of multi-use purpose. The article analyzes the built structure, the
   actual use and the potential of the historic urban ground floor. The
   focus is being put on the basement zones within residential areas and
   offside shopping streets, where vacancy problems appear to be most
   serious. The article also discusses the options of the city-planning
   department to impact on both, the architectural structure and the use of
   the ground floor. Based on local conditions and the specific historical
   situation, the methodical approach covers, in addition, various
   disciplines of the social sciences: urban research, transport and
   traffic research, migration and diversity research. The study finally
   offers an application-oriented action plan for further research and
   future planning.},

Abstract = {This paper examines whether the European Parliament strategically adapts
   to the inter-institutional balance of power by allocating its resources
   so that it spends more time in those areas of competence where it has
   the greatest power. Focusing on the legislative area, the authors
   examine whether differences in the inter-institutional division of power
   between different legislative procedures affect how long the EP spends
   on reaching its first reading position. They conduct a large-N analysis
   of over 3,000 legislative acts and a complementary analysis of treaty
   articles where the required decision procedure changed. In all analyses,
   the inter-institutional balance of power has the expected effect. The
   authors show that the EP spends more time reaching its first reading
   opinion in co-decision than it does in the consultation procedure where
   it has less power, even when they control for the characteristics of the
   files debated and the level of disagreement on the files.},

Abstract = {This paper elaborates on the deliberative democracy argument for freedom
   of expression in terms of its relationship to different dimensions of
   autonomy. It engages the objection that Enlightenment theories pose a
   threat to cultures that reject autonomy and argues that autonomy-based
   democracy is not only compatible with but necessary for respect for
   cultural diversity. On the basis of an intersubjective epistemology, it
   argues that people cannot know how to live on mutually respectful terms
   without engaging in public deliberation and developing some degree of
   personal autonomy. While freedom of expression is indispensable for
   deliberation and autonomy, this does not mean that people have no
   obligations regarding how they speak to each other. The moral insights
   provided by deliberation depend on the participants in the process
   treating one another with respect. The argument is related to the Danish
   cartoon controversy.},

Abstract = {the Andalusian cooperation appears today as a clear referent in the
   policies of development implemented by the regional institutions of our
   country. Since the beginnings of the nineties, the Andalusian Regional
   Government has put at the front of (in the lead) resources destined to
   help to the most disadvantaged countries. With the budgetary
   expenditure, the regional government has developed an important
   regulation law in regard to this subject that has been complemented with
   the creation of several committees (commissions) and decentralized
   administrative agencies in order to provide with mayor soundness his
   actions. The last innovations in all this process have been the creation
   of the International Cooperation Andalusian Agency (AACID), ``the short
   and medium term organization and planning{''} or the creation of the
   Council of Cooperation.},

Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},

Abstract = {Questions of institutional change have recently received increased
   attention in comparative politics. Even though comparative legislative
   research has identified important effects of parliamentary rules on
   processes and outputs as well as large variation across countries, we
   know very little about changes in these rules. This article takes
   several steps towards mapping and explaining rule changes in European
   parliaments. Theoretically, it sketches a model explaining such changes
   based on the rational choice notion of institutions as endogenous
   equilibria. Methodologically, it proposes two complementary approaches
   to measure rule changes. In combination, these measures allow us to
   identify the content, relevance, and effects of changes in parliamentary
   rules. Empirically, the article provides the first systematic analysis
   of all changes in the parliamentary standing orders of Austria, Germany,
   and Switzerland since 1945. This analysis demonstrates that
   parliamentary rules are changed frequently and massively. It also
   identifies differences across countries and content areas that are
   largely in line with theoretical expectations.},

   The Strong/Weak State Contradiction in Angola},

Pages = {295-313},
Abstract = {This article is a theoretical contribution to the debate on African
   statehood. We use the Angolan state as a `sounding board' for a
   mainstream neo-Weberian perspective and an oppositional historicist
   approach. We argue that the neo-Weberians inadequately explain the
   genealogy of state power and the historicists fail to provide a
   functionalist account of the state's relation to society. Neo-Weberians
   capture some of the basic facts related to a `successful failed Angolan
   state' and historicists focus on governance legitimation strategies. As
   a way forward, we propose an eclectic theoretical alternative which
   draws on the work of Mahmood Mamdani and Robert W. Cox. We argue that
   their approaches provide us with the outlines of an explanation of
   state-society relations in Africa which is contextualized in both space
   and time. This explanation, which regards history as a process, focuses
   on and encourages us to identify an African ideal-type of the state,
   which is different from the Eurocentric neo-Weberian ideal-type.},

Journal = {POLITIQUE EUROPEENNE},

Pages = {155-183},
Abstract = {This article investigates the evolving relationships between national
   interests and the global solidarity principles emerging from the 1992
   UNFCCC. It argues that France developed a distinctive climate policy
   template, which allowed modest but significant reductions in greenhouse
   gas emissions. However, faced with heightened climate challenges, policy
   elites in the 2000s hesitated between focusing on long- standing
   national interests and rescuing the policy template, or responding to
   global solidarity principles and substantially revising it. The article
   concludes that ambitious policy measures were proposed but not
   implemented due to the persistence of a construal of national interest
   in terms of short-term economic competitiveness, but also because of the
   underdevelopment of the international climate regime between the 1997
   Kyoto Protocol and the 2009 Copenhagen Accord.},

   in current thinking about empowerment, and I seek to advance our
   understanding of empowerment. I conclude by offering a theory of
   empowerment that brings our intuitions about the conditions of
   empowerment in line with our intuitions about the agency of the
   person(s) to whom the theory applies.},

   Three-Party System},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ELECTIONS PUBLIC OPINION AND PARTIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {21},
Number = {2},
Pages = {279-294},
Abstract = {The three-party method for bias decomposition shows that after the 2010
   general election Labour continues to benefit from a positive bias but
   that its advantage over the Conservative party has diminished. Indeed,
   there is now a positive bias towards the Conservatives also while the
   position of the Liberal Democrats has deteriorated. The Parliamentary
   Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011 will change the boundary
   review process. This feature of the legislation is based on a view that
   Labour's advantage relates to inequalities in electorate size which
   previous boundary reviews, constrained by existing rules, could not
   remove. However, close examination of the 2010 result shows clearly that
   most bias follows from the parties' vote distribution and to a lesser
   extent electoral abstention. It follows that inequality in the size of
   constituency electorates, malapportionment, accounts for a rather small
   proportion of the overall bias. The boundary review, due to complete in
   2013, will not, therefore, entirely remove Labour's relative bias
   advantage over the Conservatives although both parties will continue to
   have a considerable advantage over the third-placed Liberal Democrats.},

Title = {HYBRIDIZATION OF DEMOCRACY IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE: BETWEEN
   ``IMPORTED{''} DEMOCRATIC MODEL AND INHERENT POLITICAL CULTURE},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {4},
Number = {1},
Pages = {76-90},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In the last two decades, Central and Eastern Europe has gone through an
   intensive transformation process in which the adopted global neo-liberal
   political-economic model, the specifics of the Europeanization and the
   traditionally non-liberal corporate political cultures in the region
   merge/d to produce hybrid political systems that bear many features of
   oligarchies. ``Minimal democracies{''} of Central and Eastern Europe
   have not only been established on a state-reductive political system
   that benefits most the corporate economic sector, the author argues, but
   also represent a sort of a hybrid that emerged from adaptation of an
   ``imported{''} political model to the political culture in the region.
   The hybridization is the most visible in, yet not limited to, newly
   founded sovereign states without prior democratic tradition. Thusly
   ``democratized{''} specific political culture of Central and Eastern
   European societies has on the other hand facilitated the efficient
   implementation of the current global neoconservative economic-political
   paradigm. In order to support the argument on the hybridization of the
   ``imported{''} democratic model in Central and Eastern Europe, the
   author considers more closely the two presupposed key achievements of
   the political transition in the region, i.e. political parties and free
   elections. Also included are theoretical insights in political
   discourses and oligarchisation.},

   the nature of political science. Using my own work as the examples, it
   traces the evolution of comparative survey research as a method. And it
   outlines a list of works on citizen voice and political equality. It
   focuses as well on the openness and breadth of the discipline, two of
   its finest virtues.},

Abstract = {The external border of the EU challenges many traditional assumptions in
   border studies research. As scholars struggle to make sense of it, they
   often forego discussions of the role of race in the history of border
   control in Europe. This article aims to contribute to this discussion by
   exploring how the Southern EU border and the Spanish border can be read
   in racial terms. The discussion begins with an exploration of the
   concepts of race, racialization and white privilege from a spatial
   perspective. In the second section, I briefly discuss how the origins of
   processes of exclusion of racially defined groups in contemporary Spain
   can be traced to early attempts to create a Spanish national identity in
   the 16th century. I then return to current forms of racialization and
   exclusion of the non-white immigrant population in Spain. I conclude
   that European and Spanish forms of race-based exclusion coalesce at this
   border. To understand how this happens, a historical study of collective
   identity construction that revolves around concepts such as
   ``racialization{''} or ``white privilege{''}.},

Abstract = {Research that undertakes longitudinal analysis of presidential discourse
   inevitably wrestles with a difficult issue: which presidential speeches
   should be analyzed? Surprisingly, there has been essentially no
   interrogation of this issue. Studies vary in the speeches they analyze:
   some focus on inaugural addresses, others on State of the Union
   addresses, yet others focus on some broader body of speeches, often with
   limited discussion of the criteria used for selection. The result is
   that when scholars set out to study broad trends in the rhetoric of
   America's most important political figure, they have little guidance in
   determining what speeches they should analyze. This article offers a
   detailed conception of major presidential addresses, argues that such
   addresses provide an ideal corpus of texts for longitudinal content
   analysis of modern presidential speeches, and briefly describes the
   contours of a data set consisting of 406 such speeches. This data set
   serves as a resource for scholars to rely upon when studying
   presidential discourse, one that might standardize future analyses so
   that more meaningful generalizations can be made and more precise
   replications can be undertaken.},

Abstract = {In discussing the international relations of the European Union, it has
   been suggested that the European Commission is the `backseat driver' of
   European foreign policy, while the intergovernmental Council plays the
   primary role. This paper argues that the crossover between competencies
   is a result of functional `spillover,' particularly as regards the EU's
   relations with Moldova. This case study examines the different foreign
   policy instruments used by both institutions, focusing particularly on
   the EU's relationship with Moldova in the European Neighbourhood Policy
   (ENP) and the European Union Border Assistance Mission (EUBAM) in the
   disputed Transnistrian region.},

Abstract = {Using Swiss data from the 2003 International Social Survey Programme (N
   = 902), this multilevel study combined individual and municipality
   levels of analysis in the explanation of nationalism, patriotism and
   exclusionary immigration attitudes. On the individual level, the results
   show that in line with previous research nationalism (uncritical and
   blind attachment to the nation) increased exclusionary immigration
   attitudes, while patriotism (pride in national democratic institutions)
   was related to greater tolerance towards immigration. On the
   municipality level, urbanization, socioeconomic status and immigrant
   proportion (and their interaction effects) were found to affect
   nationalism, patriotism and immigration attitudes. Nationalist and
   patriotic forms of national attachment were stronger in German-speaking
   municipalities than in the French-speaking municipalities. Path analyses
   further revealed that living in a Swiss-German municipality indirectly
   led to more negative immigration attitudes through an increase in
   nationalism. The research is discussed in light of social psychological
   and political science literature on political attitudes.},

Abstract = {The Mexican government has committed voluntarily and unilaterally to
   reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 50\% by 2050 if resources from
   abroad are available to finance domestic mitigation policies. The
   Special Program on Climate Change has been created to reduce emissions
   domestically. It includes a series of measures in several sectors of the
   economy, with an emphasis on energy consumption and production and on
   the forestry sector. The program covers 2008 to 2012, which marks the
   end of President Calderon's administration. This article analyzes the
   economic, social, and environmental implications of implementing this
   package of policies and extending them through 2030 through a computable
   general equilibrium model. The objective is to discover whether these
   policies achieve the reduction in emissions that the government proposed
   and to determine its associated costs. The simulations we ran
   demonstrate that it is difficult to accomplish the goals to which Mexico
   has committed unilaterally and that the costs of some of the goals could
   be excessively high and regressive in terms of welfare for different
   income groups. The Mexican government must be careful regarding
   voluntary commitments acquired in the international context, given their
   economic and political costs.},

Abstract = {What kind of policy can the United States pursue that ensures its
   security while minimizing the likelihood of war? We describe and defend
   a realist theory of foreign policy to guide American decision makers.
   Briefly, the theory says that if they want to ensure their security,
   great powers such as the United States should balance against other
   great powers. They should also take a relaxed view toward developments
   involving minor powers and, at most, should balance against hostile
   minor powers that inhabit strategically important regions of the world.
   We then show that had the great powers followed our theory's
   prescriptions, some of the most important wars of the past century might
   have been averted. Specifically, the world wars might not have occurred,
   and the United States might not have gone to war in either Vietnam or
   Iraq. In other words, realism as we conceive it offers the prospect of
   security without war. At the same time, we also argue that if the United
   States adopts an alternative liberal foreign policy, this is likely to
   result in more, rather than fewer, wars. We conclude by offering some
   theoretically-based proposals about how US decision makers should deal
   with China and Iran.},

   Pacts of the 1990s},

Abstract = {This article provides a political-economic evaluation of the Argentine
   federal fiscal system during the 1990s. It describes and analyzes the
   innovations made to the rules governing the intergovernmental fiscal
   game, with a focus on the important fiscal landmarks of that decade,
   namely the fiscal pacts of 1992, 1993, 1999, and 2000. The record shows
   that many of the reforms to the fiscal regime have involved extensive
   political horse-trading and have been inefficient from an economic
   standpoint and that the level of players' compliance with fiscal pact
   clauses has been low. The main obstacle to crafting a more economically
   rational federal fiscal system rests on the overall institutional
   framework within which political exchanges take place. This weak
   institutional setting provides powerful incentives for players to focus
   on the short term and aggravates collective action problems by fostering
   a static and narrow conception of self-interest, divorced from the
   overall (dynamic) coherence of the fiscal regime.},

Abstract = {This research examines county-level voter turnout in the state of
   Washington-a state where a majority of its counties have chosen to adopt
   an all-mail electoral format over the past decade. Using the nearest
   neighbor match method to control for demographic and partisan variation
   among counties, this analysis of turnout in eight general and primary
   elections from 2004 to 2008 suggests that vote-by-mail has resulted in a
   modest boost in voter turnout during presidential election years and for
   special elections, but has little or no effect in congressional off-year
   elections.},

Abstract = {Policymaking is hard. Policymakers typically have imperfect information
   about which policies produce which outcomes, and they are left with
   little choice but to fumble their way through the policy space via a
   trial-and-error process. This raises a question at the heart of
   democracy: Do democratic systems identify good policies? To answer this
   question I introduce a novel model of policymaking in complex
   environments. I show that good policies are often but not always found
   and I identify the possibility of policymaking getting stuck at outcomes
   that are arbitrarily bad. Notably, policy stickiness occurs in the model
   even in the absence of institutional constraints. This raises the
   question of how institutions and the political environment impact
   experimentation and learning. I show how a simple political
   friction-uncertainty over voter preferences-interacts with political
   competition and policy uncertainty in a subtle way that, surprisingly,
   improves the quality of policymaking over time.},

Abstract = {Election boycotts are over twice as common when international observers
   are present. Do international observers increase election boycotts as
   this correlation and past research suggest? This article argues not.
   Observers tend to go to elections with many problems, and it is
   primarily these, rather than monitors, that drive boycotts. Furthermore,
   opposition parties have reasons to hope that observers can improve the
   quality of the election or that they will increase attention to election
   fraud, and therefore opposition parties may actually abandon boycott
   plans. Whether they do, however, depends on their expectations about how
   the observers will behave. This makes it important to account for the
   varying reputation of observer organizations. Thus, using matching to
   address the selection problem, this article shows that international
   observers can actually deter boycotts, but only if the observers are
   reputable.},

Abstract = {If voters punish elected officials who adopt incongruent policy
   positions, then representatives should take popular positions to avoid
   electoral sanction. Yet, scholars have noted gaps between citizen
   preferences and the behavior of elected officials. We argue that one
   important source of this gap is that individual citizens believe they
   are sometimes not well qualified to evaluate policy. Our analysis of a
   series of experiments shows that citizens' stated confidence in their
   own ability to evaluate a policy proposal substantially affects their
   willingness to reward or punish a representative for their votes on that
   policy. Our results hold both across individuals (within policy areas)
   and within individuals (across policy areas) and suggest that, rather
   than a failure of representation, gaps between citizen preferences and
   policy may reflect citizen deference to ``expert{''} legislators. We
   also show that understanding differences in policy confidence has
   important implications for understanding the contours of public opinion.},

Abstract = {Theorists of international conflict argue that territory is an unusually
   salient issue to states and, by extension, their publics. Comparing
   competing insights from the ``rally-round-the-flag{''} literature and
   those derived from theories of the state, I examine which theory best
   explains the effects of external threats to territory on levels of
   domestic trust. Using information from twenty-eight Afrobarometer
   surveys of sixteen different countries between 1999 and 2004, I assess
   the relationship between external threat and political trust using
   cross-sectional, multilevel models. The results challenge the rally
   effect hypothesis and suggest that government approval moderates the
   effect of territorial threat on trust. These findings demonstrate the
   salience of territorial issues domestically and generate novel insights
   about approval and trust in Africa. Polity (2011) 43, 432-461.

   No liberty and no salary characterize servile labour constraint. How do
   economic, statutory and political inequality consequences persist? How
   socialization through work passes competition between preference for
   freedom or for servile labour risk on? It introduces a debate on income
   and work value, on international labour reorganizations and on

Abstract = {Existing measures of article and journal. impact count citations that
   articles receive in other articles. Such metrics ignore citations that
   articles receive in monographs and edited-volume chapters. Counting
   article citations in books reveals that popular measures of article and
   journal impact discriminate against articles and journals that receive
   citations in books rather than (or in addition to) citations in other
   articles, thereby discriminating against the research, contributions of
   scholars who publish such articles. Analysis of citation patterns over
   25 years reveals that citations in. books have declined in American
   politics research while citations in articles have increased; citations
   in both books and articles remain important in the other subfields.
   Findings suggest that political scientists should supplement indicators
   of journal impact based on citations in peer-reviewed articles with,
   measures that account for the citations that published articles receive
   in books.},

Abstract = {Information Communication Technology (ICT) has become a core part of
   every organization. Any disruption in ICT's main infrastructure may have
   severe impacts and lead to huge losses. Governmental and military
   institutions' facilities, networks, and infrastructure are no exception.
   Defending the ICT military and public installations and infrastructure
   is vital in both times of peace and war. This study proposes a decision
   model using the appropriate criteria and fuzzy multiple criteria
   decision making to select the right action after a cyber-attack. The
   results show that the fuzzy multiple criteria model constructed in this
   study could indeed mitigate the inadequacies and uncertainties
   surrounding the decision to retaliate after a cyber-attack.},

Abstract = {That Congress has experienced increased polarization is clear, and
   burgeoning is the literature investigating its causes and consequences.
   Here we examine a counterintuitive wrinkle on the latter. Drawing from a
   simple game-theoretic model in which a president strategically allocates
   scarce ``political capital{''} to induce changes in legislators' votes,
   we show congressional polarization can actually improve a president's
   prospects for winning key roll-call votes-a hypothesis that emerges
   inasmuch as polarization enables presidents to concentrate their
   resources lobbying fewer members (compared to a more homogenous
   chamber). We test this hypothesis by investigating presidents' success
   on Congressional Quarterly's ``key{''} Senate roll-call votes,

   Applying Benford's Law tests to Bundestag elections in Unified Germany},

Abstract = {This article investigates electoral irregularities in the 1990 to 2005
   Bundestag elections of unified Germany. Drawing on the Second Digit
   Benford Law (2BL) by Mebane (2006), the analysis consists of comparing
   the observed frequencies of numerals of candidate votes and party votes
   at the precinct level against the expected frequencies according to
   Benford's Law. Four central findings stand out. First, there is no
   evidence for systematic fraud or mismanagement with regard to candidate
   votes from districts where fraud would be most instrumental. Second, at
   the state level (Bundesland), there are 51 violations in 190 tests of
   the party list votes. Third, East German states are not more prone to
   violations than Western ones. This finding refutes the notion that the
   East's more recent transition to democracy poses problems in electoral
   management. Fourth, a strong variation in patterns of violation across
   Bundeslander exists: states with dominant party control are more likely
   to display irregularities. The article concludes by hypothesizing and
   exploring the notion that partisan composition of nominees involved in
   the counting may produce a higher likelihood of violation and be a cause
   of Lander variation. This may especially be the case when a party
   dominates in a Bundesland or opponents to the former socialist regime
   party are involved in the counting. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Despite democracy's universal appeal, democracies have frequently
   suffered from debilitating crises, often of their own making. Sometimes,
   they have even self-destructed. Why is this the case and how might we
   respond to democracies that fail? In this article, I review five recent
   works which provide new answers as well as new provocations to these
   questions. In particular, I argue that there are three interrelated
   categories of reasons and responses prevalent in the literature on
   democratic failure. The first category intimates that democracies fail
   for reasons that have to do with unresolved institutional,
   socio-economic or political problems and that, as such, the best
   response is to seek to remove these impediments to democratic
   consolidation. The second category of literature, however, argues that
   there are certain conditions and characteristics intrinsic to democracy
   that make it prone to fail and self-destruct. Democracies that seek to
   guard against this possibility are those that are paradoxically the
   least democratic. This leads to the third category: studies that
   acknowledge democracy's inherent weaknesses and seek to overcome them
   through a call for anti-democratic alternatives. Foregrounding these
   categories is, I argue, crucial not only for improving our understanding
   of how and why democracies decline and then perish. It also provides us
   with a better glimpse into the very nature of democracy itself.

Abstract = {This article provides a new perspective on why the quantity and tone of
   media coverage vary between groups of politicians. The analysis makes
   three key distinctions: first, between the volume of reporting and its
   tendency; second, between attention-seeking politicians and
   blame-avoiding politicians; and third, between attention due to
   characteristics of media outlets and those of politicians. These
   distinctions, along with a comprehensive dataset and a multilevel
   analysis approach, comprise the building blocks of an empirical analysis
   of press coverage devoted to Norwegian parliamentarians between 2001 and
   2005. The results suggest that politicians who appear regularly in the
   newspapers, such as party leaders and long-serving MPs, face a greater
   amount of negative media coverage than those who do not. Female MPs
   receive less, but more positive, coverage. Reporting by the tabloids is
   more negative than that of other newspapers, especially with regard to
   party leaders.},

Abstract = {As voter turnout is steadily declining in western democracies, various
   authors have expressed concern about the stratification in electoral
   participation that this trend might entail. Some research suggests that
   specific categories of potential voters refrain from voting, leading to
   the electoral dominance of more privileged groups within the population.
   In this article, we investigate whether systems of compulsory voting are
   associated with more equal participation in elections. We study 36
   countries that participated in the 2004 International Social Survey
   Programme. The analysis shows that compulsory voting is associated with
   higher turnout rates, but we do not observe any significant differences
   in electoral participation based on gender or educational level.
   However, we find a significant interaction effect between age and
   compulsory voting, suggesting that young age cohorts are unlikely to be
   affected by the dynamics of the civic duty argument that is inherent in
   systems of compulsory voting.},

Abstract = {Evidence is mounting that presidents find difficulty in leading public
   opinion. However, focusing on presidential ability to lead mass opinion
   may underestimate the degree to which presidents are able to rally key
   groups on political and personal characteristics. In this article, the
   authors use an experimental design to test the effect of communication
   mode across issue types and groups. From three of President Bush's
   speeches on Iraq (the State of the Union, an Oval Office address, and a
   press conference), the data show that by going public the president can
   influence political opinions across certain issue types and groups.
   Among the findings are that the groups most affected by the president's
   speeches are not always his core constituency but often his putative
   opponents. However, this opinion change by the noncore groups is often
   limited to direct presidential addresses and evaluations of the
   president's personal qualities. The implication is that writing off
   presidential leadership as totally ineffective may be as yet premature.},

Abstract = {The success and efficiency of leadership depends on managerial position
   of what leader possesses of personal characteristics, education
   qualification and professional expertise. Nowadays, the leadership of
   woman is become more essential in the developing process for the
   civilized societies as a man's colleague in managing companies. However,
   woman in some societies still facing many difficulties at her work like
   cultural heritages that do not accept the woman as a leaders. In this
   paper we investigate on factors involving to improve the women's
   participation in positions of power and decision making and to
   illuminate some of the barriers that hinder their career development in
   Jordan. In this study we conclude that the personality characteristics
   of woman influenced negatively on the woman role to reach the leadership
   position. Besides that, we analyze the most important obstacles. We
   discussed the women's concerns when carry responsibility as a part of
   occupying the leadership position.},

Title = {Dialectics and distinction: Reconsidering Hannah Arendt's critique of
   Marx},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {10},
Number = {3},
Pages = {332-353},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Perhaps the most often criticized element of Hannah Arendt's political
   theory is her insistence on the necessity of constructing and
   maintaining rigid boundaries between various activities of the human
   condition. Less often, however, is the attempt undertaken to determine
   the philosophical motivation stimulating this project of distinction.
   This article will attempt to demonstrate the extent to which Arendt's
   imperative is rooted in a certain misreading of the Marxian dialectic.
   The first part of the article will outline the contours of Arendt's
   erroneous interpretation of Marx's understanding of labour,
   demonstrating the degree to which the latter breaks down the tripartite
   structure of the vita activa. The second part of the article will read
   Arendt's affirmation of distinction as being a response to what Arendt
   will take to be the problems of the dialectic, specifically the
   dialectic's allegedly necessary positing of conceptual contingency and
   logical necessity. Finally, the third part of the article will
   demonstrate, through an examination of two key passages in the work of
   Marx, the extent to which Marx himself was just as concerned with
   overcoming the type of homogeneous and abstract universalism rejected by
   Arendt. The ground will thus be provided for the overcoming of the
   necessity of Arendtian distinction, and perhaps also for a more fruitful
   engagement between the Marxian and Arendtian theoretical problematics.

Abstract = {This article addresses the political relationships between levels of
   government that took place during the process of structural reforms
   which started in July 1989. In particular, this paper approaches these
   processes and relationships focusing in San Juan province during the
   first wave of reforms, between 1989 and 1991, also the last govern
   period of Bloquista party. Five dimensions are considered: privatization
   policy, changes in the economic regulation, the revenue sharing system
   dynamic, state reform and protest actions. I will argue that these
   processes had impacted on San Juan province, and the local government
   remained in tension oscillating between consent and resistance towards
   national government policies.},

Title = {Distinguishing Between Influences on Brazilian Legislative Behavior},

Abstract = {Ideal point estimators hold the promise of identifying multiple
   dimensions of political disagreement as they are manifested in
   legislative voting. However, standard ideal point estimates do not
   distinguish between ideological motivations and voting inducements from
   parties, coalitions, or the executive. In this article we describe a
   general approach for hierarchically identifying an ideological dimension
   using an auxiliary source of data. In the case we consider, we use an
   anonymous survey of Brazilian legislators to identify party positions on
   a left-right ideology dimension. We then use this data to distinguish
   ideological motivations from other determinants of roll-call behavior
   for eight presidential-legislative periods covering more than 20 years
   of Brazilian politics. We find that there exists an important
   nonideological government-opposition dimension, with the entrance and
   exit of political parties from the governing coalition appearing as
   distinct shifts in ideal point on this second dimension. We conjecture
   that the Brazilian president's control over politically important
   resources is the source of this dimension of conflict, which has
   recently become far more important in explaining roll-call voting than
   the ideological dimension.},

Volume = {44},
Number = {7},
Pages = {910-931},

Abstract = {Why does the willingness of interest groups to join forces with their
   peers abroad vary across issues? The present article points to
   cross-issue variation in the ``constrain-thy-neighbor{''} effects of
   transnational law. Interest groups consider not only whether they are
   worse off if they themselves are subjected to a transnational law. They
   also consider how it affects them if the same law applies abroad.
   Depending on the issue, they derive advantages or disadvantages from
   seeing their neighbors constrained, and this affects their willingness
   to fight transnational legislation on that issue. To illustrate the
   argument, the article compares cohesion within the Union of Industrial
   and Employers' Confederations of Europe (UNICE), the European peak
   employer federation, on two aspects of EU company law. UNICE members
   were divided over EU takeover directives while uniting against EU worker
   participation directives. Statements released by German and British
   UNICE members show that the divergent constrain-thy-neighbor effect
   associated with these issues contributed to variation in cohesion.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the effect of race on deliberations inside
   congressional committees. It investigates whether black representatives
   are more or less likely to use liberal policy frames and mention
   marginalized groups during committee debates. The results suggest that
   black legislators are more likely than whites to present liberal policy
   frames for black interest bills and they often take a more active role
   during committee debates. However black legislators are no more likely
   than white Democrats to mention blacks and other marginalized groups
   during committee deliberations. When it comes to mentioning marginalized
   groups during committee deliberations, party is the most important
   explanatory factor Polity (2011) 43, 291-312. doi:10.1057/pol.2011.6;

Abstract = {In this article, I describe my work with Michigan State University
   undergraduates to produce the Michigan Policy Network, a web-based
   public service and research program that reports news and information
   about the political process surrounding Michigan state policy issues.
   The program empowers undergraduates to oversee website sections devoted
   to policy issue areas, each of which features background information,
   research, and current updates on government action, as well as regular
   blog posts, that aim to make the information accessible to a public
   audience. I explain how to inexpensively set up such a program and
   reflect on the strengths and weaknesses of the approach. I evaluate the
   four different methods that I have used to integrate the policy network
   with traditional teaching: (1) working with students as an
   extracurricular activity, (2) organizing a summer program for government
   interns acting as researchers, (3) integrating network assignments with
   traditional homework in topical classes, and (4) teaching a separate
   class for freshman honors students. My experience suggests that students
   are motivated to complete work intended for a public audience and are
   well-equipped to translate government information for public readers.
   Working on the policy network improves student employment prospects and
   helps build connections between state government and the university. I
   recommend that similar programs be developed elsewhere.},

   crisis on the United States and the progressive decline of its global
   influence. Finally, it expounds possible trends prevailing in the
   immediate future, emphasizing the need for nation states and oppressed
   peoples to act in a sovereign manner, disengaging them-selves from

Abstract = {The philosophical dimension of Marx's polemic against Proudhon
   represents a crucial stage in the development of his dialectical method
   and his conception of history and progress. The critique of Proudhon
   demonstrates Marx's hostility toward the very teleological account of
   social change of which he has himself been accused. In order to redress
   this imbalance, the break with Proudhon is presented here as a result of
   Marx's rejection of the speculative Hegelian dialectic. This rejection
   is an exercise in self-criticism that is highly relevant to our
   understanding of Marxian theory.},

Abstract = {On May 25, 1973, Peronism returned to govern Argentina after about two
   decades of prohibition and political persecution. After its
   establishment, certain crimes began to be signed with `` AAA{''}. The
   Triple A adopted the particularity of disappearing with the coup on
   March 24 1976. Why could this organization only exist in a democracy
   erected in the middle of two military dictatorships? Why did it exist
   during the very wished Peronist government?
   The article offers an approach to the Triple A, that is, from the
   perspectives of history, sociology and politics. It seeks to unravel the
   socio- historical conditions of the Triple A by analyzing the
   international, ideological, utilitarian and strategic factors. Our
   hypothesis is that this illegal group failed in trying a strategy of
   non- state conducted repression, which ended up legitimizing the coup
   option crowned on March 24, 1976.},

Abstract = {From the relations between Cinema, Political Science and Law, discursive
   fields of interpretative activity could be set; whose main
   characteristic is the search for interdisciplinary relations. Krzysztof
   Kieslowskis Trilogy of Colors: Blue (Freedom, 1993), White (Equality,
   1994) and Red (Fraternity 1994), is the analytical route to establish
   this connection. Studying Kieslowski means understanding its aesthetic
   and social diversity in a narrative and political context in which Arts
   and Social Sciences are lured by new views of epistemic deepening, such
   is the case of the postmodern debate. This paper aims to establish such
   link: in his narrative, Kiesloswski shares the same concern of
   Philosophy and Sociology: the disappointment at the unfulfilled promises
   of modernity, the imposition of ideological models of power, and the
   strengthening of a post-capitalist economic system which purpose is the

Abstract = {The experience of governing at the strategic centre of the UK political
   system raises many important questions about the philosophy of public
   management and delivery, and the scope and scale of the British state.
   This article sheds light on those debates by offering an inside account
   of government at the centre during the Blair and Brown years, albeit
   from a particular ontological standpoint given the author's role as a
   Special Adviser in the Prime Minister's Policy Unit. Among the most
   insistent themes is the gap that so often opens up between the
   intentions of those in 10 Downing Street and Whitehall, and the reality
   of what actually happens on the ground. The drive to expand the
   strategic centre during the New Labour era was intended not just to
   improve the performance of government, but to change the nature of
   British society. There were, nonetheless, many unintended consequences
   and outcomes that resulted from New Labour's governance and Whitehall
   reforms.},

Journal = {CONTEMPORARY POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {10},
Number = {2},
Pages = {166-189},

Abstract = {Traditionally, transitional justice has referred to that field of
   theoretical scholarship that proffers recuperative strategies for
   political societies divided by a history of violence. Through the
   establishment of truth commissions, public confessionals and reparative
   measures, transitional justice regimes have sought to establish
   restorative conditions that might help reconcile historical antagonists
   both to each other and to the trauma of their shared past. Because of
   some of the theoretical lapses in this scholarship some have turned
   recently to the field of radical democratic and `new pluralist' thought
   - and especially to agonistic literature to foreground a theory of
   post-conflict reconciliation based not on the principles of the
   sublimation of difference, but rather the perpetual deferral of accord.
   This essay works both to underscore that effort, as well as to
   (productively) problematize it. Through unorthodox readings of Giorgio
   Agamben, Jean Amery and Sheldon Wolin, the essay argues that an emphasis
   on messianicity as the temporal mode of political repair is ultimately
   less productive for what I call an agonistics of reconciliation than a
   more nuanced approach to what Wolin calls `fugitive democracy'. Where
   the former is allied with a problematic politics of mutual respect, the
   latter affirms a more germane politics of abiding resentment. In the
   end, a startling conclusion is drawn from reading agonistic
   reconciliation through Wolin: democracy may be a political experience
   reserved for scenes of transitional justice alone. Contemporary

Abstract = {Do ballot measures affect congressional voting behavior? Examining the
   issues of gay marriage, campaign finance, and minimum wage, we test if
   the results of statewide ballot initiatives inform congressional roll
   call votes on legislation occupying the same issue space. Theoretically,
   we expect signals from ballot measures-which provide precise information
   about the preferences of a member's voting constituency-reduce policy
   ``shirking{''} by members. Our findings across the three issues indicate
   that ballot initiative outcomes alter the floor votes of members of the
   House, reducing legislative shirking, but we find that the educative
   effect of ballot measures is attenuated in the Senate due to
   institutional factors. We attribute the positive effect in House to the
   precise signal ballot measures provide members about the preferences of
   the median voter in their district.},

Abstract = {This paper examines and argues against the neoliberal assumption that
   local community participation in market-based nature conservation
   projects is democratic and leads to community empowerment through
   economic development. It does so by analyzing the formation of Local
   Forest Management Committees, instigated by one of the largest US-based
   environmentalist NGOs - the Nature Conservancy - and its partnering
   local environmental NGOs for conserving the tropical forests of Cockpit
   Country, Jamaica. The paper dissects, specifically, the notion of
   ``stakeholder partnership,{''} frequently invoked in neoliberal
   conservation projects in the global south. Such flattening neoliberal
   terminologies imply a democratic platform, where different groups can
   express their political agendas and negotiate their differences with
   equal power. The language of ``stakeholder partnership{''} flattens,
   this paper argues, the hierarchical set of power relations both
   inherited and exacerbated by free market-based conservation projects.},

Abstract = {It is an established fact that off-cycle elections attract lower voter
   turnout than on-cycle elections. I argue that the decrease in turnout
   that accompanies off-cycle election timing creates a strategic
   opportunity for organized interest groups. Members of interest groups
   with a large stake in an election outcome turn out at high rates
   regardless of election timing, and their efforts to mobilize and
   persuade voters have a greater impact when turnout is low. Consequently,
   policy made by officials elected in off-cycle elections should be more
   favorable to the dominant interest group in a polity than policy made by
   officials elected in on-cycle elections. I test this theory using data
   on school district elections in the United States, in which teacher
   unions are the dominant interest group. I find that districts with
   off-cycle elections pay experienced teachers over 3\% more than
   districts that hold on-cycle elections.},

Abstract = {This article integrates insights from historical institutionalism and
   arguments of strategic action in order to develop a new conceptual and
   theoretical approach to explaining changes in civil-military relations.
   In order to enforce civilian control over the military in new
   democracies, civilian decision-makers need to ``break{''} stabilizing
   mechanisms of path dependence in civil-military relations. The ability
   of `change agents' to overcome `path dependence' depends on the concrete
   approach civilians take to reduce military power. Civilian choices,
   however, are structured by the specific structural, institutional and
   ideational contexts in which civil-military interaction takes place.
   These contextual factors also provide the constraints and resources for
   civilian actions. The civilian choices and the success of their control
   strategies are thus conditioned by the resources to which civilians have
   access and which allow them to initiate and consolidate changes
   vis-a-vis those actors opposing change in civil-military relations.},

Abstract = {The process of globalisation and the so-called war on terror are two
   prominent features marking our present age. While the process of
   globalisation promises the prospect of moving beyond or across borders,
   the war on terror marks a return to fences, check-points, and dividing
   walls. Terror war is a global politics of fear, a politics conducted
   under the rigid border control between `us' and `them'. This paper
   examines the ominous development of fear in world politics from a number
   of angles. First, it explores the growing linkage of politics with
   terror war by tracing its roots ultimately to the friend-enemy
   distinction. Next, it discusses the shortcomings of the terror war
   syndrome, by turning to some prominent critics of this ideology.
   Finally, it examines possible ways pointing beyond this ideology,
   enlisting for this purpose a number of theologians and intellectuals, to
   arrive at the promising notions of `border-crossing' and
   political-existential Grenzganger or people who criss-cross multiple
   borders.},

Abstract = {According to standard rational choice theory, as commonly used in
   political science and economics, an agent's fundamental preferences are
   exogenously fixed, and any preference change over decision options is
   due to Bayesian information learning. Although elegant and parsimonious,
   such a model fails to account for preference change driven by
   experiences or psychological changes distinct from information learning.
   We develop a model of non-informational preference change. Alternatives
   are modelled as points in some multidimensional space, only some of
   whose dimensions play a role in shaping the agent's preferences. Any
   change in these `motivationally salient' dimensions can change the
   agent's preferences. How it does so is described by a new representation
   theorem. Our model not only captures a wide range of frequently observed
   phenomena, but also generalizes some standard representations of
   preferences in political science and economics.},

Abstract = {Reality television programming has become a pervasive part of popular
   culture. Although such programming may seem to be mindless
   entertainment, it can serve as a tool to introduce political lessons in
   the classroom. This article examines how the concepts of alliance
   behavior and strategic voting can be explored by using the television
   program Survivor. An analysis reveals that contestants often behave
   strategically when forming alliances and voting, in ways that are
   similar to the strategic behavior of nation-states and individuals
   residing in democracies, respectively. This article does not suggest
   that reading political science texts should be replaced with viewing
   reality television, but rather that instructors can introduce abstract
   concepts to undergraduate students through popular culture. Such a
   technique can spark students' interest in politics and demonstrate the
   broad relevance of political concepts, leaving students with the desire
   to delve more deeply into the investigation of political phenomena.},

   Latin America and why they have emerged now and not earlier in each

   on, as well as the framing choices that each has made, account for the

Journal = {PS-POLITICAL SCIENCE \& POLITICS},

Volume = {44},
Number = {2},
Pages = {375-383},

Abstract = {Previous research has documented how political scientists evaluate and
   rank scholarly journals, but the evaluation and ranking of scholarly
   book publishers has drawn less attention. In this article, we use data
   from a survey of 603 American political scientists to generate a ranking
   of scholarly publishers in political science. We used open-ended
   questions to ask respondents to identify those scholarly publishers (1)
   to which they would submit ``a very strong book manuscript{''} in their
   area of expertise, and (2) that they ``read regularly or otherwise rely
   for the best research{''} in their area of expertise. Based on these
   results, we created rankings of scholarly presses based on publication
   and reading preferences. We find that certain high-profile university
   presses constitute a clear first tier in American political scientists'
   preference orderings, followed by a mix of university and commercial
   presses that represent the second tier and beyond. Moreover, we confirm
   the validity of our approach by comparing the results of our rankings
   (based on open-ended questions) with results from previous research
   based on respondents' evaluations and derived from close-ended lists of
   scholarly presses. Our results demonstrate that the rankings of
   scholarly publishers are similar for both approaches. These rankings can
   be used to guide political scientists as they decide where to send their
   best book-length work.},

Title = {When Mayors Matter: Estimating the Impact of Mayoral Partisanship on
   City Policy},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {55},
Number = {2},
Pages = {326-339},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {U.S. cities are limited in their ability to set policy. Can these
   constraints mute the impact of mayors' partisanship on policy outcomes?
   We hypothesize that mayoral partisanship will more strongly affect
   outcomes in policy areas where there is less shared authority between
   local, state, and federal governments. To test this hypothesis, we
   create a novel dataset combining U.S. mayoral election returns from 1990
   to 2006 with city fiscal data. Using regression discontinuity design, we
   find that cities that elect a Democratic mayor spend a smaller share of
   their budget on public safety, a policy area where local discretion is
   high, than otherwise similar cities that elect a Republican or an
   Independent. We find no differences on tax policy, social policy, and
   other areas that are characterized by significant overlapping authority.
   These results suggest that models of national policymaking are only
   partially applicable to U.S. cities. They also have implications for
   political accountability: mayors may not be able to influence the full

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the role of individual and system-level factors and
   the interaction between both these levels in shaping citizens' trust in
   the moral integrity of institutions, and their confidence in the
   capabilities of institutions. We conceptualize the standard
   questionnaire item of `institutional trust' as an additive composite of
   both trust and of confidence. Starting from the culturalist framework,
   we argue that social trust is sometimes transferred to institutions, but
   this transfer is condition on the institutions' trustworthiness. This
   explanation is supplemented with performance-based approaches to
   confidence in institutions, because the impact of institutional
   performance differs for citizens and might be conditional on their
   preferences and vulnerability to institutional failure. Because
   institutions are in charge of different tasks, the criteria for
   evaluating them can be expected to differ.
   Our analysis confirms the hypothesis that social trust is transferred
   only to trustworthy institutions, which explains why a relationship
   between social and institutional trust is found only in some countries.
   While different criteria are of varying relevance for different
   institutions, there is no clear distinction between political and
   non-political institutions. The impact of an institution's performance
   on institutional confidence is usually not conditional on citizens'
   characteristics.},

   diplomatic relations in 1988 due to some severe tensions between the two
   sides. Then, the article examines Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and
   occupying of Kuwait city, the capital, in August 1990 which led to some
   significant regional developments. The study also analyzes Iran's
   neutrality stance in this case as well as in Second Gulf War which was
   reaction of international community pertaining to the occupation.
   Finally, the article concludes that how Iranian rational and pragmatic
   decision during the crisis resulted in changing of viewpoints of
   regional countries in particular Saudi Arabia which eventually led to
   renewing of diplomatic ties of Tehran-Riyadh in March 1991 after three
   years frigidity.},

Abstract = {After the terrorist strikes of 2001 the US adopted an interventionist
   military posture that saw overseas bases as transit and access points
   for combat zones, rather than as tokens and instruments of long-term
   cooperation with Allies. US stationed forces in Europe were thinned out
   further while new missile defence bases were planned close to Russia's
   frontiers. Major basing changes were also planned in the Far East,
   tending to reduce the direct territorial support for local partners.
   These shifts caused turbulence abroad at the time and were also
   challenged by Congress on cost grounds. In retrospect, the
   military-technical concept behind them can be criticized as relying
   excessively on rapid intervention and remote strikes, while underplaying
   ground control and the importance of local expertise. Politically the
   new approach overlooked both the importance of established partnerships
   in democratic regions, and the multi-sided symbolism of bases
   themselves. In strategic terms, the post-9/11 military doctrine now
   looks over-risky, one-sided and inadequate to serve the full range of
   vital US interests in a globalizing, interdependent world. President
   Obama's new strategic goals recognize this, but are unlikely to lead to
   restoration of old-style bases on any significant scale. Yet the
   importance of controlling territory and being able to exploit its
   resources looks set to grow, rather than decline further, in view of the
   climatic, economic and demographic trends of the present century.},

Abstract = {The objective of this article is to present the results of a survey
   conducted in 2007on strategic management in Icelandic organizations. The
   survey was sent by e-mail to organizations with five or more employees.
   Answers from 222 top managers of companies and institutions (46\%
   response rate) were received. The distinctiveness of the survey is that
   it targets organizations of all sizes, both small and medium sized as
   well as the big companies and organizations. The main results of the
   survey are as follows: Most of the top managers answering the survey
   believe that the vision for their operations is very clear. In 57\% of
   the companies a formal crafting of strategy is conducted, showing
   variation for both size of the companies and the education of the
   managers; formal strategy is more likely to be in place in the bigger
   companies and in companies and institutions run by university educated
   managers. For around 70\% of the companies and institutions, crafting
   and implementing strategy is either an ongoing process or it was in
   progress at the time the survey was conducted. Board members and
   top-managers are most likely to partake in crafting the strategy for the
   companies. In 19.3\% of companies and institutions the performance of
   the organization's strategy is not measured at all, but in 41.2\% of
   them the performance is measured by both quantitative and qualitative
   measurements. Most of the companies apply performance measures for
   measuring both employee and shareholder satisfaction.},

Title = {Rights Variation within a Federalist System: Understanding the
   Importance of Mobility},

Abstract = {Cosmopolitanism at the international level-the recognition of an
   international human rights regime-has been much defended of late. Little
   attention has been paid, however, to the federalist analogue: should
   there be insistence on a national rights regime? Or should variation in
   the recognition of rights be tolerated at the subnational level, as a
   necessary concession to moral disagreement, as an effort to contain
   problematic experiments, or as a way to generate progress about rights?
   This article argues that subnational variation in the recognition of
   rights represents a second-best solution to the problem of deep moral
   disagreement about rights. However, federalism provides a second-best
   solution only on the condition that citizens are able to move from one
   subnational jurisdiction to another. To the extent that citizens are
   able to move to rights regimes that are more favorable to them,
   intranational variation in the recognition of rights may have advantages
   over international variation, where national borders may pose barriers
   to migration. However, in the United States, despite the privileges and
   immunities of national citizenship, there remain impressive legal
   barriers to such mobility in the case of contested rights. Given these
   barriers, federalism as it exists in the United States today does not
   fully realize the advantages of a second-best solution to deep moral
   disagreements about rights.},

Abstract = {Election campaigns are not only party campaigns, but depend to a
   significant degree on the efforts and activities of individual
   candidates. While some country-specific analyses of candidate
   campaigning have been done, large-N comparative studies are missing. The
   2009 European Election Candidate Study, conducted in all 27 EU
   countries, does allow for such a comparative analysis. On the basis of
   this data, the article takes a closer look at three core components of
   individual campaigns and their respective determinants: duration,
   intensity, and the use of different campaign tools. Our findings show
   that only a combination of factors on the individual, party, and country
   level is able to explain significant amounts of the observed variance in
   each of the core components. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This article tries to reveal the recent debates revolving around the
   issue of migration in Europe, and claims that migration has recently
   become securitized and stigmatized in a way that prompts the
   autochthonous societies to generate a set of migrant-phobic attitudes.
   This work further argues that this kind of fear does not really have
   material sources; it is on the contrary an artificial fear fabricated by
   the conservative political elite who are likely to use the politics of
   fear as a form of governmentality to sustain their power. Hence, this
   work will specifically concentrate on the processes of othering migrant
   origin individuals as anti-citizens.},

Volume = {30},

Abstract = {Electoral rules and form of government have important economic effects,
   for example on taxation and public spending. However, there are no
   robust results in the literature when it comes to their effect on
   economic growth. This paper investigates whether electoral rules and
   form of government affects economic growth by applying panel data
   techniques on a very extensive dataset. There is no robust effect of
   presidentialism or parliamentarism on growth. However, there is very
   robust evidence for a positive, and quite substantial, effect of
   Proportional Representation (PR) electoral rules on economic growth.
   This is partly due to PR systems' propensity to generate broad-interest
   policies, like universal education spending, property rights protection
   and free-trade, rather than special interest economic policies. Also
   semi-proportional systems seem to enhance growth relative to
   plural-majoritarian systems. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Much of the academic literature that analyzes U.S. state-level
   restrictions on abortion focuses on parental involvement laws and the
   extent to which abortion is publicly funded through Medicaid. However,
   one shortcoming common to all of these studies is that they fail to
   analyze informed consent laws and other types of anti-abortion
   legislation that received constitutional protection through the U.S.
   Supreme Court's decision in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern
   Pennsylvania v. Casey (1992). In this study, a series of regressions on
   a comprehensive time series cross-sectional data set provides evidence
   that several types of state-level anti-abortion legislation result in
   statistically significant declines in both the abortion rate and the
   abortion ratio. Furthermore, a series of natural experiments provide
   further evidence that abortion restrictions are correlated with
   reductions in the incidence of abortion.},

   appeasement to extreme reactions by the Muslim community, such as the

   magnify the problem of admitting and imposing self-censorship. There is
   a great need to redefine what we call freedom of speech and make clear

Abstract = {Based on narrative approaches, the authors develop an empirical
   technique to gauge the match between stories told by political actors
   and voters and assess its effect on voting behavior. Even with other
   fundamental attitudinal and demographic factors held constant, they
   hypothesize that voters should prefer parties that hold and communicate
   similar national narratives. Using data gathered during the 2009
   elections to the Israeli Knesset, the authors gauge voter attitudes
   about fundamental national narratives in Israel and conduct a systematic
   analysis of parties' discourse in parliamentary speeches to gauge
   parties' stories. Controlling for demographics and ideology in a series
   of logistic regressions, the authors find that voting behavior for most
   parties is significantly affected by the narrative proximity between
   voters' stories and parties' stories.},

Abstract = {When and where might ethnic party outbidding occur? This article
   examines potential outbidding dynamics via a study of local elections in
   Romania, where the dominant Hungarian UDMR/RMDSz (Democratic Alliance of
   Hungarians in Romania) was recently challenged by a rival party, the MPP
   (Hungarian Citizens' Party). A comparison of election results is made
   across cities and counties that differ according to demographic
   characteristics. Two primary findings emerge. First, Hungarian unity in
   the form of the RMDSz remained strong except under enclave conditions -
   where the ethnic minority is the local majority. Outbidding is more
   likely to be a luxury of enclave regions, where fragmentation will not
   involve a loss of power to another ethnic group, as could happen to a
   local minority or with `split' demographics. Second, when
   majority-minority demographics are clear, cross-ethnic formal or
   informal coalitions are more likely to emerge. Cross-ethnic coalitions
   are rare under conditions of `split' demographics, which exhibit a logic
   of ethnic polarization.},

Abstract = {The Consejo Consultivo del Instituto de los Mexicanos en el Exterior
   (CC-IME) is a somewhat unusual transnational organization established
   and funded by the Mexican government in 2003 as a means of maintaining
   contact with and serving the Mexican diaspora of almost 12 million in
   the United States and Canada. The 56 Mexican consulates in the United
   States and Canada conduct elections (or sometimes appoint) around 120
   representatives for three-year terms to serve as an advisory council to
   represent the needs of the Mexican diaspora before the Mexican
   government and to strengthen the ties (especially economic and political
   ties) between the Mexican diaspora in Canada and the United States and
   the government of Mexico. Previous studies have described the history,
   purpose, and some of the programs initiated by the Mexican Foreign
   Ministry (SRE) and the CC-IME. The story of the CC-IME, however, is more
   than can be understood from the perspective of any one state. As a
   transnational organization at a particular time in history, its
   operation reflects the perspectives of a host of different entities.
   Using qualitative research methods and participant observation, this
   ongoing study employs Mahler and Pessar's geographies of power framework
   to identify and explore various power hierarchies and special political
   characteristics of CC-IME from a variety of perspectives.},

Abstract = {The Arctic is attracting a great amount of attention from the publishing
   world. This has to do with the consequences of climate change, the
   suspected riches, and the reverberations of Russia's underwater journey
   to the seabed at the North Pole. There is still a lack of basic
   analytical information needed to organise the various developments.
   There are also few innovative suggestions for a sustainable political,
   economic, social, and ecological development of the region.},

Abstract = {When is mobilization of group identity successful? Work on social
   movements suggests that frames that target group identity can mobilize
   groups. However, this work does not address when group mobilization
   using frames is likely to be successful. Recent work on source
   credibility finds that same-group sources are an important moderator of
   framing effects, and previous work on stakes of the decision shows that
   individuals in high stakes are more likely to participate than those in
   low stakes. I combine these two moderators of frames to generate
   predictions for when group sources are most likely to be credible. I
   test these predictions in the context of a public goods game laboratory
   experiment in which targeted frames are given to group members by
   sources that share their group identity and in which stakes of the
   decision are varied. The findings of this project have implications for
   political mobilization and campaigning based on group identities.},

Journal = {POLITIQUE EUROPEENNE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {33},
Number = {1},
Pages = {7-36},
Abstract = {The environmental policy of the European Union (EU) is a key domain for
   the analysis of European integration processes. However, existing
   studies on the subject, notably those concerned with Europeanization,
   have stressed differential impacts. Not only has European environmental
   policy varied in its impacts across member states, but its level of
   integration differs from one environmental issue to another. This
   special edition re-examines the scope of the EU environmental policy. It
   focuses on three themes crucial to debates on the greening of the EU and
   on the significance of policy developments, namely actor strategies,
   institutional factors, and the structuring of environmental issues. The
   articles presented here address the three themes by focusing on the
   French national case and offer perspectives which are innovative on both
   conceptual and methodological grounds. Each develops an original
   analysis, drawing mainly on public policy studies and/or sociological
   approaches. Thus the special edition as a whole offers alternative
   research strategies for the study of environmental policy in the EU.},

Title = {Government Monitoring and Political Participation in the United States:
   The Distinct Roles of Anger and Anxiety},
Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICS RESEARCH},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {39},
Number = {1},
Pages = {85-117},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The past decade has spurred interest in the potential connection between
   U.S. government monitoring and political activity. Interestingly, these
   recent studies demonstrate that rather than chilling political activity,
   government monitoring in the United States positively associates with
   political engagement. This article seeks to determine why, for ordinary
   Americans, government monitoring positively relates to political
   participation. We argue that the balance of discrete negative emotional
   reactions to government monitoring provides an answer. We propose that
   U.S. government monitoring generates more anger than anxiety.
   Furthermore, we suggest that anger about government monitoring will
   positively associate with political activity whereas anxiety about
   monitoring will negatively associate with political engagement. We find
   support for these hypotheses using data drawn from a unique probability
   sample survey of U.S. residents. The dominant and discrete reaction of
   anger about monitoring trumps the less common reaction of anxiety, which
   leads to a net positive association with political activity.},

   was able to target the Mau Mau insurgents in their remote strongholds
   without alienating the local population. The use of air power in the
   Kenyan campaign may well provide lessons for today.},

Journal = {POLITICKE VEDY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {14},
Number = {2},
Pages = {37-47},
Abstract = {Since the 1970s, neo-countrymen represent a population that constitutes
   itself as ``marginal{''}, according to the criteria of ``marginality{''}
   defined by Barel in 1982. In popular language they are also sometimes
   described as being in the situation of retreat or withdrawal from the
   society. Through their rediscovery of the countryman lifestyle and the
   reconstruction of the peculiar forms of solidarity, both through
   construction of their housing environment and the elaboration of
   communitarian activities, we observe that they rediscover the meaning of
   the social link lying in the heart of the citizenship. Effectively, it
   is by the social link that the citizenship itself is defined;
   nevertheless, in the case of the neo-countrymen its meaning is not
   identical as for the legislators and the majority of the population. In
   that case, the citizen participation of these individuals seems
   non-existent or seriously compromised because they are perceived to be
   refusing the collectivity; they are seen in favour of marginality,
   implicitly favouring specific country or region - a situation that
   Geertz characterises as the ``local{''} versus ``global{''} (1986), in
   this case the State and the nation.},

Volume = {13},

Abstract = {This article uses constitutional texts to explore the models of national
   identity which elites in European states have apparently wished to
   endorse. It analyses three types of constitutions - of constitutional
   monarchies, democratic republics, and former revolutionary communist
   states - to establish how the primary principle of legitimacy is
   identified, and how the concept of `the people' is understood. It
   concludes that these issues evoke a different response in the three
   types of constitution, suggesting a surprising survival of the
   implications of the monarchical-republican distinction, and a brief
   flowering of at least the principle of international proletarian
   solidarity in communist constitutions.},

Abstract = {When we are present at the 32nd. Anniversary of the Constitution, can be
   said that, on one hand, our constitution is no more a normative
   constitution, but a nominal constitution, with the terrible threat that
   it could become purely a semantic constitution, and, on the other hand,
   it's evident that it is not fulfilled in the whole territory and that it
   presents various problems, partly because the past of time. It is
   necessary to include new fundamental rights, to give a more adequate
   regulation to some of them, to modify some aspects of the electoral
   system and of the parliamentary organization, to modernize the
   succession to the crown, to enforce the unitary judicial power, and,
   specially, it's necessary to finish the design of the territorial
   organization of the state.},

   tradition. The second one is to identify the originality and radicalism

   theory he built innovates to confront the possibilities and potentials
   of human action with real situations. Inserted in this context, the
   political actions acquires a new meaning: instead of being conceived
   based on abstract moral paradigms, they are identified in social
   responsible acts of a political human been, the Prince.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL CRITICAL THOUGHT},

Volume = {1},
Number = {2},
Pages = {204-223},
Abstract = {If Proudhonism in the nineteenth century was, as Marx argued, a petty
   bourgeois ideology, this paper argues that the new communism of the
   commons propounded by Badiou, Hardt and Negri, and Zizek is a
   twenty-first-century avatar of it. It speaks not for what Poulantzas
   called the `traditional petty bourgeoisie', as Proudhon did, but for the
   `new petty bourgeoisie' of `nonproductive wage-earners', which has also
   lately styled itself the `creative class'. A failure to comprehend the
   dynamics of capitalist accumulation and a general antipathy to any
   general organization of labour in society, and thus to any serious
   politics, are common to both. In addition, the paper shows that the
   protection of the cultural commons, the core of the project, is but a
   programme aiming for the continued reproduction of the creative class
   within capitalism. It is also prey to a series of misunderstandings - of
   the concept of the commons itself, of contemporary capitalism whose
   dynamics forms the backdrop of their project and key economic and
   political ideas of Marx whose authority they seek to attach to their
   project.},

Volume = {3},

Abstract = {Given an increasingly globalized world connected via instant news
   sources, terrorism has emerged as a transnational concern. To determine
   the effect of terrorism on support for government retaliation, we
   randomly assigned 288 Peruvian and 586 US undergraduates to
   experimentally manipulated newsflashes of terrorist attacks that varied
   according to target (civilian, commercial, military), impact (high, low)
   and frequency of attack (first, latest in a series). A significant
   Target x Impact x Frequency x Gender x Country interaction emerged.
   Separate analyses by country demonstrated variability in Peruvians'
   retaliatory preferences and sensitivity to the economic costs of
   terrorism. Unlike pre-9/11 studies, US respondents did not appear to
   base their retaliatory preferences on the temporal dimension of
   terrorist conflict. We explain our findings in terms of the ecological
   context of each country and national narratives reflected in the schemas
   of its citizens, and identify their applied and research implications.},

Volume = {7},

Pages = {34-47},
Abstract = {Many women are considered viable candidates to hold political office but
   choose not to run for various reasons. One of those reasons is that they
   do not see the characteristics in themselves that they determine
   necessary to be a successful politician. For the past five years, the
   Intern Fellowship Program at Simmons College has matched young women
   with female state legislators in Massachusetts. This article will
   discuss how this internship program has changed the perception of the
   women that participate in the program; they now see themselves as
   potential political players, both at the state and national level.
   Through interviews and quantitative assessment of alums, I will
   demonstrate that this type of mentoring internship program is a
   successful way to increase the number of women in the political pipeline
   because of their post-graduation job and graduate school choices that in
   turn continues them on the pathway to political office.},

Abstract = {The United States has a divided social system in that both the public
   and private sectors provide citizens with benefits and services. The
   effects of political party control on public social policy are widely
   known. An area of study less understood is how partisanship influences
   private social benefits. I develop and test a theory that political
   parties' choice between indirect and direct social expenditures is
   primarily motivated by a desire to alter the balance between public and
   private power in society. First, I find no statistically conclusive
   evidence that Democratic control of the federal government results in
   higher levels of total social spending. Additionally, my results show
   that Republican control of the legislature results in a higher ratio of
   indirect to direct social spending. These results have implications for

Abstract = {This chapter analyzes the construction of secrecy under the current U.
   S. export control regime for dual-use technologies and discusses its
   application for two technologies: research on a class of semiconductors
   used in military and civilian applications and biotechnology research on
   select agents. We argue that the assignment of technologies and
   countries to categories controlled under the export regime is an
   exercise in creating secret knowledge, in which the broad category of
   ``the other'' is subdivided between those who are forbidden to know and
   those who are not (and thus implicitly are qualified to become a party
   to the secret). We draw attention to the social cost of errors made in
   applying these categories, and point to some remaining issues.},

Abstract = {The year 2010, in Austria, was shaped politically by the regional
   elections in Burgenland, Styria and Vienna. The SPO held the position of
   governor in all three states, tried to defend its majorities, and faced
   mainly the FPO as emerging competitor. The article presents selected
   findings of the corresponding election-day surveys and the voter
   transition analyses, interested in comparing trends in the states. By
   focusing on possible differences in the voting behavior of women and men
   and of younger and older voters a closer look is being taken on the
   voting and non-voting motives and an eventual personalisation. The
   results show an increasingly blurred gender and generation gap.
   Furthermore, a clear personalisation in voting motivation cannot be
   found. The conclusions imply a variety of challenges for parties
   concerning the coming next elections.},

   and proposes policy alternatives that the current government can pursue
   to ensure durable peace and development. The paper argues that bad
   governance accounted for the conflict. Therefore, if peace, security and
   development are to be attained, there is a need for the current
   government to adopt and implement four policy options: good governance,
   security sector reform, a long-term development approach, and capacity
   building at the national and local levels. Although the new President of
   Liberia has taken some critical steps towards implementing some of these
   policies, more work needs to be done to address corruption, and promote
   transparency, accountability, good governance and development if a
   relapse into conflict is to be avoided.},

Abstract = {Despite the growing availability and popularity of simulations and other
   active teaching techniques, many instructors may be deterred from using
   simulations because of the potentially high costs involved. Instructors
   could spend a preponderance of their time and resources developing and
   executing simulations, but such an approach is not necessary. Instead of
   investing a great deal of time and effort into running a complex
   simulation, I recommend developing low-intensity simulations, using
   three possible strategies: (1) using one's own scholarly research to
   develop simulations, (2) using current events as the basis for
   simulations, and (3) using student research to create simulations. These
   strategies provide a starting place for the professor who has held off
   on trying simulations before and practical information for the professor
   who is accomplished in using active learning techniques and wants to
   take the next step by designing his or her own simulation.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on a left-libertarian response to neo-liberalism
   that emerged in the 1990s. In particular, it examines the work of Hilary
   Wainwright, founding editor of Red Pepper magazine. To Wainwright, the
   popularity and resurgence of a `neo-liberal' or `new' right could, in
   part, be explained by its libertarian and anti-statist outlook-themes,
   she argued, that had been neglected by the left. Wainwright used the
   arguments of the right-wing thinker Friedrich Hayek as a springboard for
   her own, very different, arguments for a left-libertarian,
   movement-based form of participatory democracy. There are parallels in
   her work with older, pluralist arguments. However, Wainwright's
   pluralism faces many of the same challenges-particularly concerning the
   relationship between group and state-that earlier pluralist thinkers
   struggled to resolve.},

Title = {Socializing Homo Oeconomicus - On the Redefinition of Rational Action
   through Experimental Research},
Journal = {POLITISCHE VIERTELJAHRESSCHRIFT},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {52},
Number = {4},
Pages = {714-744},
Abstract = {Experimental economists have recently started to socialize the old homo
   oeconomicus by rigorously theorizing the role of social image and
   fairness in social action. Unfortunately, this intriguing development
   has not yet reached political science where most rational choice
   scholarship still rests on the assumption of narrowly self-interested
   economic man. By summarizing the latest findings of experimental
   research on social action, this article hopes to contribute to the
   ongoing debate about the merits of rational choice in political science
   in two ways. First, it illustrates that socializing the homo oeconomicus
   may solve prominent puzzles of earlier rational choice modeling while
   simultaneously maintaining the theoretical rigor of these models.
   Secondly, it underscores the added value of experimental work in
   political science.},

Abstract = {This article assesses the validity of the concept of `religious
   terrorism' and its consequences for research and policy practices. It
   explores the origins, assumptions and primary arguments of the term and
   subjects them to an analytical assessment. It argues that the
   distinctions typically drawn between `religious' and `secular' terrorism
   are problematic, both conceptually and empirically, and that the term is
   misleading in its typical assumptions about the motives, causes and
   behaviour of groups classified as `religious terrorist'. In particular,
   it shows that the behaviour of those thus labelled is so diverse, and
   often so indistinguishable from their `secular' counterparts, that the
   term has little meaning without further qualification, while
   simultaneously obscuring important aspects of both `religious' and
   `secular' violence. It then goes on to illustrate how the term, rooted
   in a particular historically situated understanding of religion and a
   particular set of power structures, serves as a disciplinary device to
   domesticate `political religion', delegitimising certain actors while
   legitimising a number of highly contentious counterterrorist practices
   designed to deal with those described as `religious terrorists'. The
   article ends with some suggestions for alternative ways to study the
   role of beliefs and institutional structures, religious or otherwise, in
   producing political violence.},

Pages = {191-210},
Abstract = {South Africa's 2009 elections were characterized by an increase in
   electoral participation in terms of registered voters and actual numbers
   of voters, a resurgence of support for the opposition, and a realignment
   within the opposition bloc in favour of the Democratic Alliance and the
   Congress of the People. In addition, the vote share of the governing
   African National Congress declined nationally for the first time since
   1994, with the party also losing support in eight of nine provinces.
   Despite this, the authors argue that the 2009 election results do not
   indicate the emergence of a viable opposition party that could seriously
   contest the ANC's electoral dominance in future elections primarily
   because voter perceptions of party images remain key to partisan
   support. Party images act as helpful cues for voters about whom and what
   parties stand for. Most importantly, these perceptions play a
   restrictive role, limiting the choice of parties for both partisan and
   independent voters. Until opposition parties are able and willing to
   reconstruct their party images and policy agendas they will fail to
   attract significant electoral support from key black African and poorer
   constituencies.},

Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {18},
Number = {1},
Pages = {75-99},
Abstract = {Pakistan's 1988 transition to democracy defies most of the conventional
   wisdom on democratization as well as the bulk of the literature on
   democratic transitions. This peculiar case can be understood as a case
   of `temporary democracy', in which democracy emerges as a short-term
   outcome that is not likely to be sustained. Pakistan's military leaders
   chose to democratize because of the high short-term costs of repression
   coupled with the low long-term costs of allowing democracy. The
   authoritarian elite agreed to allow democratization knowing that the
   prospects of democratic consolidation were dim. In this sense, the same
   factors that made the consolidation of Pakistan's democracy unlikely
   made the transition possible.},

Abstract = {The orthodox view is that neither the election campaign nor the
   activities of local Members of Parliament (MPs) has any effect on the
   final outcome of UK general elections. However, more recent research has
   suggested that both the election campaign and the activity of individual
   MPs has an effect. This article seeks to ascertain whether MPs believe
   that the Internet can help them gain votes. Data were collected from a
   questionnaire and interviews with MPs. The findings suggest that MPs
   believe that a Web site has an indirect rather than direct impact on
   voting behavior. However, MPs believe that regular e-newsletters between
   elections may increase their vote and that the use of private e-mail
   lists during an election helps mobilize supporters and volunteers.},

   These silences privilege the formal public-private sphere of civil

Abstract = {Macroeconometric models are built on astonishingly precarious grounds
   and yet are used by policy makers to project precision and certainty.
   Econometricians use lagged dependent variables, oadd factors,o and other

   integrity of the models. The reason for the unscientific nature of
   macroeconometric models is that, unlike the objects of controlled
   experimentation, real-world events are often unique and non-repeatable.
   Models that use repeatable events are poorly suited to accurate
   prediction or historical explanation.},

Abstract = {It is genuinely accepted that the withholding of sensitive information
   by the federal government, be it relating to intelligence, military or
   foreign policy matters, will invariably serve to preclude or minimize
   damage to our nation's well-being. However, often overlooked is the
   impact that official secrecy has upon the decision-making process
   employed by national leaders. This overview examines the harm that
   official government secrecy can inflict upon our U.S. national security,
   through the corrupting influence it has on national policy decisions.
   Using the Constitutional Convention of 1787 as an apt lesson, this
   overview goes on to examine the impact that official secrecy had on many
   of the post-9/11 decisions made by U.S. national leaders.},

Abstract = {In the article the authors explore the ratio of capitalism and ethics.
   They demonstrate that the moral collapse connected to the emergence and
   development of the capitalist world-system was in reality a mere
   appearance of increasingly growing sphere that was dominated by the
   principles of capitalist moral at the axiological level. The authors
   suppose that the moral collapse manifested itself in the permanent
   failure of efforts to rationally underpin ethical norms rather than in
   the total defeat of any moral or at least altruistic one. Having
   examined in details different attempts of moral compensation for
   capitalism from early to late Modern Age, V. Martyanov and L. Fishman
   conclude that even the most successful tries led to only temporary
   effects.},

Title = {The Influence of Tone, Target, and Issue Ownership on Political
   Advertising Effects in Primary Versus General Elections},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL MARKETING},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {10},
Number = {3},
Pages = {275-296},
Abstract = {The conventional wisdom in the literature about political advertising
   effects-e.g., going negative risks backlash, stick to issues your party
   owns-has been derived from studies of general elections. Much less
   attention has been paid to primary elections, in which a partisan
   audience may be receptive to attacks on the opposing party and may judge
   most issues to be handled better by their own party. This experiment (N
   = 223) sets out to investigate the roles of tone (positive versus
   comparative), target (none, primary opponent, or general election
   opponent), and issue ownership (party-owned issue or unowned issue) in
   responses to political advertising during primary versus general
   elections. As predicted, partisans in primary election conditions had
   lower ad and sponsoring candidate evaluations for comparative ads
   attacking a primary opponent than for positive ads or comparative ads
   attacking the eventual general election opponent, but there were no
   differences between the latter two. Independents in the general election
   conditions responded more positively to positive ads than comparative
   ads. Issue ownership had no main effects.},

Abstract = {This paper addresses the political identity of the far left
   organizations which took part in the violent struggle against the
   Brazilian civil-military dictatorship established in 1964. It focuses on
   these groups opposition to the traditional forms of strategy and
   organization of mainstream west left parties, in favor of pure military
   action. I conclude that their resistance to the theoretical aspects of
   the struggle for socialism in Brazil, which was a very important aspect
   of their predecessors identity, namely the Communist Brazilian Party
   (PCB) and the Revolutionary Marxist Organization (ORM-Polop), allowed
   some of them, later, to find a common field of political thought and
   identity along with other left segments that, in the late seventies,
   took part in the forming of the Worker's Party (PT).},

Abstract = {Self-Interest and Public Interest in Western Politics showed that the
   public, politicians, and bureaucrats are often public spirited. But this
   does not invalidate public-choice theory. Public-choice theory is an
   ideal type, not a claim that self-interest explains all political
   behavior. Instead, public-choice theory is useful in creating rules and
   institutions that guard against the worst case, which would be universal
   self-interestedness in politics. In contrast, the public-interest
   hypothesis is neither a comprehensive explanation of political behavior
   nor a sound basis for institutional design.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to analyze the current use of public diplomacy
   in foreign relations. It attempts to show how necessary public diplomacy
   strategy is for the formation of diplomatic relations. The first part of
   the study focuses on the analysis of changes in political communication
   in international relations. Presented are factors such as the
   transnationalisation or medialisation of foreign policy and the role of
   soft power in international relations. Then it presents a three
   dimensional model of public diplomacy that takes into account short-term
   and long-term goals.
   The main part of the text presents a change in the operation of today's
   foreign policy actors. This mainly concerns classical diplomacy, which
   has transformed its role, primarily by heavily engaging professional
   public affairs agencies and non-state actors in foreign policy.
   The article also cites examples from Europe and the United States of
   America of successful and unsuccessful strategies of public diplomacy.},

Abstract = {The armed conflict in Chiapas began in 1994 after the armed uprising of
   the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN). Until now the Mexican
   government do not recognize the existence of an armed conflict there,
   for what they call inter-ethnic violence that happens in different
   municipalities in Chiapas. This study aims at demonstrating that, first,
   the Mexican state of Chiapas has an armed conflict since the
   mid-nineties, which has intensified and transformed over sixteen years.
   It is in this transformation that have emerged paramilitary groups
   seeking to destabilize the state, generating dynamics of appropriation
   and control of territory through different practices such as forced
   displacements, selective assassinations and terror spread within
   populations who are the targets of their attacks (mainly community
   support of the Zapatista Army of National Liberation). This work studied
   the ``Peace and Justice{''} paramilitary group operating in different
   parts of the state of Chiapas, mainly in the Northern Zone. This
   case-study will look at the changes it has undergone Mexican
   democracy,which will be analyzed at two points: first, the failure of
   federal and Chiapas state to allow or endorse the creation of
   paramilitary groups and not to punish their actions; on the other, the
   consequences of the actions of such actors in democratic institutions,
   and democracy itself. Will seek to demonstrate that indeed both the
   permissiveness of the Mexican state and its complicity has weakened
   democracy in Mexico, since they are not able to manage conflict so that
   they do not degenerate into violence},

Abstract = {Based on a survey of former May-68 activists who enrolled their children
   in two experimental schools, this article examines the choice of
   appropriate methods to analyse the forms of participation to the events
   of May 68. A factorial analysis followed by classification reveals that
   the category of so-called ``sixty-eighters{''} encompasses a
   heterogeneous spectrum of profiles for participants who took part, in
   different ways, in ``the same{''} event. In a second stage, we confront
   the statistical approach to the qualitative data in order not only to
   enrich the former but also to highlight the limits of the statistical
   classification. Indeed, it cannot dissociate the dispositional variables
   relative to the life trajectories before May 68 from the situational
   variables relative to the political event itself. The articulation of
   statistical data and life-story interviews makes it possible to propose,
   as a conclusion, a classification that reintroduces the temporality of
   the events into that of life trajectories. In addition, the latter is
   more attentive to the forms of political socialization generated by the
   event.},

Abstract = {Principal economic and social changes have taken place during the last
   twenty years in Vietnam. They have been based on the reform Doi Moi
   bringing changes in economic area and subsequently influencing all
   aspects of the social life. The congress of Communist Party of Vietnam
   in 1986 is officially considered to be a beginning of the reform Doi
   Moi. During the following period, Vietnam economy achieved many
   successes, despite of complicated situation in the country itself and in
   the world. The basis of the economic changes is multi-sector
   socialist-oriented market economy. Private ownership is put on an equal
   footing with other forms of proprietary and this leads to forming of a
   new social class. The country has generally reached successes in the
   areas industrialization, public health and education. Poverty and
   malnutrition have been substantially eradicated. It may be stated that
   economical development markedly advance social and politic one in
   Vietnam. It is questionable when and how this disproportion will lead to
   fundamental social changes.},

Abstract = {In this article, I intend to analyse the notion of secondary
   socialization through a specific case study: the French firefighters.
   This work is based on an in-depth ethnographic inquiry, and I describe
   the different steps of this social and professional process. I aim to
   provide a better understanding of socialization by examining the role of
   institutions, the ``learning by doing{''} process, the incarnate
   intelligence and the representations of this universe. By reconstructing
   the practical logic of this social life, I show how a specific habitus -
   becoming a firefighter - is built day after day.},

Abstract = {How do Marx's definitions of religion as the ``opium of the people'' and
   as ``sigh of the oppressed creature'' relate to each other? How can we
   interpret that he leaves the young Hegelian topic of a ``critique of
   religion'' behind and transforms it into a critique of law, politics,
   and finally commodity ``fetishism''? This essay relocates religion in
   the framework of a theory of ideology. Following Antonio Gramsci, Ernst
   Bloch, and Pierre Bourdieu, Marxism has to reformulate its critique of
   religion as an analytical task to decipher social antagonisms and
   struggles in the religious fields.},

Abstract = {We use a multi-level modelling approach to estimate the effect of ethnic
   diversity on measures of generalized and strategic trust using data from
   a new survey in Britain with a sample size approaching 25,000
   individuals. In addition to the ethnic diversity of neighbourhoods, we
   incorporate a range of indicators of the socio-economic characteristics
   of individuals and the areas in which they live. Our results show no
   effect of ethnic diversity on generalized trust. There is a
   statistically significant association between diversity and a measure of
   strategic trust, but in substantive terms, the effect is trivial and
   dwarfed by the effects of economic deprivation and the social
   connectedness of individuals.},

Abstract = {Food is a source of sustenance, a cause for celebration, an inducement
   to temptation, a vehicle for power, an indicator of well-being, a
   catalyst for change and, above all, a life good. Along with other life
   goods such as potable water, clean air, adequate shelter and protective
   clothing, food is something we cannot live without. The global corporate
   food system, however, allows 800 million to go hungry, while an even
   larger number of people grow obese. Based in money-values, this food
   system promotes accumulation first and foremost, enriching a few while
   creating economic, social and environmental externalities that are
   destroying local economies, devastating individuals, families and
   communities and degrading the planet.
   What would a food system look like that was based in life-values,
   centred on the commons and anchored by social justice? This paper will
   focus on the creation of sustainable food systems, beginning with the
   crises of the global corporate food system and then moving to the heart
   of sustainable food systems-the civil commons.},

Abstract = {Changes in federal government relations with First Nations and Metis in
   Canada have been described as shifting over time, from fur trade
   colonialism, to welfare colonialism, to neoliberal partnerships.
   Acknowledging changes and continuities in Aboriginal peoples-state
   relations over time, this article examines the effects of recent
   policies that emphasize private-public partnerships for economic
   development on Indigenous communities in northern Alberta. We argue that
   while the term ;partnership' connotes equality, cooperation, and
   consensus, the actual workings of partnerships are anything but equal,
   and the effects include fragmentation, competition, and lack of overall
   accountability. These outcomes work against the needs and aspirations of
   Indigenous communities.},

Abstract = {The finagle point, the epsilon-core, and the yolk are all predictors of
   majority-rule decision-making in spatial voting models. These predictors
   each minimize a radius needed in some sense to alter preferences so as
   to achieve stability. Brauninger showed that the finagle radius is never
   smaller than the epsilon-core radius, and claimed that the finagle point
   is within the epsilon core. This article shows that the finagle radius
   is sandwiched in between the epsilon-core and yolk radii, and that there
   is a significant logical gap in Brauninger's proof that the finagle
   point is within the epsilon-core. This article also examines
   Brauninger's other conclusions in view of an inaccurate computation of
   the yolk, and shows that they are valid all the more so.},

Journal = {SECURITY AND HUMAN RIGHTS},
Year = {2011},

Abstract = {This article examines whether the Organization for Security and
   Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) would benefit from having formalized
   criteria for selecting candidates for the Chairmanship-in-Office (CiO).
   Currently, no such requirements exist. States voluntarily present their
   candidacy for chairmanship which is then endorsed or not by the other 55
   participating states. Throughout the OSCE's history, electing a CiO has
   never been controversial, until Kazakhstan submitted its candidacy in
   2006. Human rights defenders and some nations questioned Kazakhstan's
   ability to lead the OSCE due to its poor human rights record. This
   triggered a debate on whether any criteria for the CiO (can) exist. This
   article examines the current election system and the benefits that would
   flow from maintaining that system. The article compares the current
   system with two alternative scenarios and evaluates their advantages,
   disadvantages and possible consequences for the OSCE.},

Abstract = {A sizeable literature in political science considers the level of
   information citizens need to make informed policy choices, however,
   fewer studies examine the quality of information that is available to
   the public. While debate here has often characterized citizens as
   ``informed{''} or ``uninformed,{''} this article considers that the
   public may be mis-informed. Following Ansolabehere et al. (2005), I
   examine one source of mis-information - sampling bias in newspaper
   reporting of party finance, and the extent to which individuals'
   estimates of donations and expenditures follow what is reported in the
   press. The data for the project come from three sources: a content
   analysis of major newspapers, survey data generated by YouGov's online
   panel (N = 2,008), and donation/expenditure reports from the regulator,
   the Electoral Commission. Analysis of the data here show evidence of
   sampling bias with respect to press reports on the size and source of
   donations and the relative spending priorities of the three main
   parties. Moreover, although public knowledge of key aspects of party
   finance is low, press reports provide little opportunity for the public
   to learn about party finance.},

   article compares the plenary debate on the ratification of the Treaty of
   Lisbon to the proceedings to the Treaties of Maastricht and Nice. The
   analysis illustrates that although a pro-EU consensus persists, it was
   weakened when the new Left Party entered the Bundestag. Responding to
   this and to the intensified problem of `positive' (i.e.
   market-correcting) integration following Eastern enlargement, the Social
   Democrats have realigned their position towards a `social Europe', for
   the first time clearly distinguishing their position from that of the
   Christian Democrats.},

   sentiments and views are not limited to single nations but represent a
   European-wide phenomenon. The paper presents a research seminar at the

   regarding the emergence and the development of anti-Semitism in Europe
   from 1879, when the term itself was first coined, up to the First World
   War, i.e. the formative phase of anti-Semitism as a social and political
   movement. This seminar consists of eleven individual research projects
   regarding different European countries and regions. The paper describes
   the leading questions of this research seminar, presents its main
   objectives and intentions, determines the underlying term of
   anti-Semitism, and gives an overview of the individual studies.},

Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},

Volume = {34},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {97-121},
Abstract = {Studies on the European Parliament have largely overlooked the impact of
   the inter-institutional context on its internal organisation. This paper
   argues that the stronger legislative powers of the Parliament vis-a-vis
   the Council of Ministers under the co-decision than under the
   consultation procedure affect the intra-parliamentary allocation of
   different types of legislative report. The analysis of the period
   2004-07 shows that legislators from the centre-right party group
   coalition and loyal party group members are privileged in the allocation
   of co-decision reports. In contrast, legislators with outlying special
   interests and experts are given systematic access to drafting only
   consultation reports. The higher competition for co-decision versus
   consultation reports left unchecked by the formal EP rules has thus been
   exploited by party group leaders to promote group cohesion and
   coalition-building, producing clear winners and losers.},

Title = {One year after the June 2010 events in Kyrgyzstan: the possible
   implications for regional security},
Journal = {SECURITY AND HUMAN RIGHTS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Pages = {63+},
Abstract = {This article includes some ideas on the crisis that took place in Osh,
   Kyrgyzstan in June 2010. Apart from a brief summary of the events, it
   describes viewpoints of the main `actors' including the international
   organizations; it also seeks an answer to the question on what the
   reasons leading up to these tragic events were. Regarding possible
   sources of conflicts, including the factor of ethnic minorities, the
   question arises whether the various international mechanisms created for
   handling regional conflicts function properly, in a conducive way, and
   whether they can warn the international community of an evolving crisis
   and prevent conflicts. According to the facts, in the concrete case of
   the Osh crisis, the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities
   succeeded in fulfilling his task in the area of early warning; however,
   no concrete actions were taken by the above-mentioned `actors' in
   regional and international politics to prevent the conflict. This paper
   has no intention of dwelling on this issue as it was very adequately
   addressed by an earlier article written by Sabine Machl.
   The ethnic conflicts of 1990 and 2010 in Central Asia demonstrate the
   vulnerability of the region, which also faces some additional challenges
   in the field of security.
   This article does not intend to examine all the aspects of the Kyrgyz
   crisis. However, as some experts at the time of the Osh events
   explicitly mentioned, the possibility of the infiltration of militants
   from Afghanistan and their involvement in the clashes and as Afghanistan
   itself is a country, where about half of the population belong to
   various ethnic `minority' groups (Tajiks, Uzbeks, Hazaras, Turkmens,
   etc.), one cannot ignore the danger of the implication of the conflict
   going on in Afghanistan for its vicinity, including Central Asia.
   The awareness of this challenge was reflected in various ideas and
   suggestions (to address the Afghan crisis) emanating from these
   countries. The most comprehensive of these - according to the views of
   the author of this article - is the so called `6+ 3' initiative
   developed by Uzbekistan.
   One of the `messages' of this article should be that, at the present,
   stronger and more consistent as well as concerted efforts are needed to
   deal with evolving conflicts and crises in the broader region of Central
   and West Asia, where these potential conflicts may develop not only by
   themselves, in separate countries or `subregions', but they could
   include the danger of a `spillover' which may also effect other
   countries.},

Journal = {BRITISH POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {6},
Number = {4},
Pages = {408-429},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Alcohol issues have risen in political salience in Britain in recent
   years, but this is a policy area contested in complex ways. This article
   tells the rather convoluted story of the 2003 English and Welsh
   Licensing Act and relates it to some theories about the influence of
   ideas on the policy process. The policy originated as a regulation and
   trading one but was broadened out to fit into New Labour's modernisation
   agenda. The legislation soon became laden with expectations and
   forebodings, both political and social, that went far beyond its
   original remit and, once the media had latched on to it, became highly
   controversial with the accent placed upon `24 hour drinking'. The
   history of the legislation shows how the intellectual framing and
   departmental policy are intertwined and how Beland's idea of `road maps'
   being used by policy entrepreneurs has some resonance, but plays down
   the capacity of the media to divert or influence the policy discourse.

Abstract = {Candidate list positions have been shown to influence decision making
   when voters have limited candidate information. Here, a primacy
   advantage is observed owing to a greater number of positive arguments
   generated for early list candidates. The present study examined list
   position effects when an absence of information precludes such a
   confirmatory bias heuristic. We report the first large-scale
   low-information experimental election where candidate position is fully
   counterbalanced. Seven hundred and twenty participants voted in a mock
   election where the position of six fictitious and meaningless parties
   was counterbalanced across the electorate. Analysis by position revealed
   that significantly fewer votes were allocated to the terminal parties,
   and found preliminary evidence of an alphabetical bias. This positional
   bias was not present in a methodological replication using six genuine
   UK political parties. This suggests that in situations of pure guessing,
   the heuristic shifts from the primacy benefiting confirmatory bias to an
   alternative heuristic that prejudices the first and last parties. These
   findings suggest that while the UK general electoral process may be
   largely immune to positional prejudice, English local elections (in
   which there can be multiple candidates from the same party) and multiple
   preference ranking systems (Scottish Local Government and London Mayoral
   Elections) could be susceptible to both positional and alphabetical
   biases. British Politics (2011) 6, 479-490. doi:10.1057/bp.2011.26;

Abstract = {This article analyzes the relationship between U. S. state governance
   and policies designed to enhance educational expectations. It examines
   three policy areas: state participation in voluntary National Assessment
   of Educational Progress testing, state testing requirements for new
   teachers, and state high school graduation requirements in math and
   science. In general, it identifies associations between state
   institutional and political characteristics and the state policies under
   study. In particular, state policies that impose higher demands on local
   school districts are more likely to be present in states with more
   centralized control of their K-12 systems. Furthermore, state
   partisanship appears to suggest that Republicans favor policies that
   push power to lower levels of the U.S. intergovernmental system.},

Abstract = {Many studies report the ``wonders of aggregation{''} and that groups
   (often) yield better decisions than individuals. Can this ``wisdom of
   crowds{''}-effect be used to forecast elections? Forecasting models in
   first-past-the-post systems need to translate vote shares into seat
   shares by some formula; however, the seat-vote ratio alters from
   election to election. To circumvent this problem, this paper proposes
   citizen forecasting, which aggregates citizens' local expectations to
   directly forecast constituencies. Using data from the 2010 British
   Election Study, this paper finds (1) that groups are better forecasters
   than individuals, (2) that citizen forecasting correctly predicts a hung
   parliament, and (3) that marginality and group size are important
   predictors for ``getting it right{''}. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {In the age of migration, the inclusion of immigrants in national
   politics is crucial for democratic reasons, and because it increases the
   coordination and cooperation ability of society. The informal norms,
   values and beliefs of the political culture are one aspect of the
   institutional and discursive opportunity structures immigrants face as
   ethnic and religious minorities. This article analyses the Danish
   political culture with regard to the potential barriers it has for the
   inclusion of immigrants in national political life. It finds that the
   predominantly liberal, secular and republican character of the Danish
   political culture excludes certain kinds of cultural and religious
   identities and interests at the symbolic discursive level, while Danish
   political culture may in fact provide more openness at the practical and
   institutional level. However, the question of whether or not Danish
   political culture is able to deal adequately with cultural and religious
   diversity remains.},

Abstract = {From 2004 onwards, a second wave of lustration proposals emerged
   throughout Central and Eastern Europe, at a time when EU accession
   already started. Among the post-communist states, Poland, already an EU
   member state, extended the purpose of its previous lustration law in
   2006. The same year marked the heated debate over the drafting of a
   lustration law in Romania, where previous proposals on this issue were
   not validated by the Parliament. Sixteen years after the regime change
   in these countries, the assessment of the formal mechanisms to deal with
   the past permeated the public agenda in an attempt to answer the
   question of how much of the documented illegal activities committed
   during communism remained secret and purposefully uncovered. In this
   article, I scrutinize the lustration processes and debates up to 2008 in
   two countries from the region. Based on that evidence, I argue that the
   salience of the transitional justice controversies during the second
   wave of lustration proposals plays a symbolic function, rather than
   pursuing a consistent policy endeavor.},

Abstract = {Republicanism is an ancient self-government model. It arose in the Greek
   polls, surviving through the Middle Ages to the Renaissance. From then
   on it was supportive of the birth of liberalism, as seen in Locke's
   Second Treatise of Government. However, with the appearance of colonial
   assemblies in NorthAmerica, democracy became a new model for
   self-government which was better adapted to liberal ideas.
   Neo-republicanism, the political trend arising in the 80's of the 20(th)
   century, tries to develop an alternative to classical republicanism. It
   allows for design of public policies, but it can not function as its
   predecessor in relation to being a model for self-government, since in
   present times it is not possible to maintain values or status systems
   from ancient societies.},

Abstract = {``Civilian control of the military is a basic principle of the American
   Constitution{''}; so runs the commonplace. It is the thesis of this
   article that the cliche could hardly be more inaccurate, for actually
   the American Constitution in the twentieth century obstructs the
   achievement of civilian control. It is well known that civil supremacy
   was a major concern of the Framers. They provided for it in the only
   form in which they knew it. But civilian control in the eighteenth
   century is very different from civilian control in the twentieth
   century: the Constitution which was expertly designed to provide for it
   then, for this very reason, frustrates it now. In presenting this
   thesis, it is necessary: (1) to show how the meaning of civilian control
   has changed over the intervening years; (2) to describe the Framers'
   concept and show how it was embodied in the Constitution; and (3) to
   demonstrate how the provisions which they thought would guarantee it
   impair its effectiveness today.},

Abstract = {Markets, hierarchies, and networks are widely understood to be the three
   primary forms of social organization. In this article, we study the
   choice between these forms in a general, agent-based model (ABM) of
   cooperation. The organizational ecology is the product, an emergent
   property, of the set of choices made by agents contingent on their
   individual attributes and beliefs about the population of agents. This
   is one of the first attempts to theorize explicitly the choice between
   different organizational forms, especially networks and hierarchies, and
   certainly the first to do so in an ABM. The insights of the model are
   applied to current research on transnational networks, social capital,
   and the sources of hierarchy and especially autocracy.},

Abstract = {In this paper I contend that both Ernst Bloch's theory of Utopia and
   Jacques Derrida's interpretation of the messianic promise of Marxism
   contain an underappreciated emphasis on the concept of work that can act
   as a basis for a novel synthesis of the two perspectives. When both
   theories are interpreted through this lens, they may be seen as
   representing two ``moments'' of a flexible Utopian ``work'' that closely
   resembles Marx's understanding of unalienated labor. Such a synthesis
   would be practiced as the alternation of Derrida's negative and Bloch's
   positive ``Utopian work'' with individuals engaging in the diverse,
   developmental, and collective production of Utopian visions of the best
   society. This process closely mirrors the creative, artisan-like work
   that Marx envisioned as flourishing after the eradication of the
   division of labor. When individuals practice it, they may gain an
   appreciation for this fundamental Marxist value even while existing in
   alienated, capitalist society.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {73},
Number = {4},
Pages = {993-1010},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Empirical studies reach conflicting conclusions about the effect of
   repression on collective action. Extant theories cannot explain this
   variation in the efficacy of repression, in part because they do not
   account for the way in which social networks condition how individual
   behavior is aggregated into population levels of participation. Using a
   model in which the population is heterogeneous in interests and social
   influence, I demonstrate that the extent to which repression reduces
   participation, and the extent to which an angry backlash against
   repression increases participation, depends critically on the structure
   of the social network in place; this implies the need for greater
   empirical attention to network structure. To facilitate the model's
   empirical application, I focus on broad qualitative network types that
   require comparatively little data to identify and provide heuristics for
   how one might use qualitative network data to derive quantitative
   hypotheses on expected aggregate participation levels.},

Abstract = {Aristotle's discussion of political friendship points to perfect
   friendship and the possibility that the good citizen can be the good
   person. This conclusion is arrived at by reflection on three problems
   raised in Aristotle's analysis. First, citizen friendships of utility
   are the cause of civil strife. Second, there is a tension between
   citizen friendship in timocracy and justice. Although citizen friendship
   in a timocracy can aspire to perfect friendship, political justice
   requires kingship. Third, familial friendship, although natural, is more
   limited in scope than political friendship. This article concludes with
   Aristotle's discussion of conflicting obligations that opens up two
   grounds of natural friendship: relations to persons through body, and
   relations to persons who are virtuous. Virtue relations in timocracy
   allow citizen friendship to resemble perfect friendship.},

Title = {Inner Contradiction to Immigration Quagmire: A Response to Rogers Smith},
Journal = {PERSPECTIVES ON POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {9},

Pages = {559-562},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The question of how to understand and address longstanding-and at times
   violent-hostility toward Mexican immigrants in the United States remains
   pressing. In his essay, Rogers Smith attempts to describe a just
   immigration policy, one that could ease anti-immigrant conflict, based
   on obligations upon the U.S. government that arise from its coercive
   shaping of the social identities and aspirations of Mexican immigrants.
   Smith is correct to focus on the conflicts between intersecting and
   contradictory factors that affect identity formation among immigrants,
   but I argue that a focus on similar conflicts among those who hold
   strong anti-immigrant views suggests that such contradictions may also
   be animating anti-Mexican immigrant hostility. Among the most important
   of these may be those arising from the American dream-a formative
   narrative that encourages euphoria about socioeconomic possibilities but
   that cloaks underlying economic instabilities, exploitation, and
   widespread vulnerabilities. The pain of these contradictions, typically
   unacknowledged by those whom they affect, can spike in times of economic
   downturn, exciting anti-Mexican immigrant sentiments that provide an
   outlet for the rage and agony of unresolved conflict.},

Abstract = {This article examines the political economy of selective immigration
   policy in a model where decision makers are uncertain about the
   characteristics of migrants. The analysis focuses on two questions:
   first, how does a selective immigration policy affect the number of
   immigrants who are admitted by the receiving country; second, how does a
   selective immigration policy in one country affect immigration policies
   in other countries. We find (i) that countries with selective
   immigration policies ceteris paribus tend to admit more migrants than
   countries without such policies, and (ii) that neighbouring countries
   will follow each other in implementing selective immigration policies,
   i.e. there is diffusion. These theoretical findings are supported by
   evidence from an econometric panel analysis of immigration policies in
   15 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)
   countries in the period from 1980 to 2005.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to investigate the consequences of
   judicial campaign activity for the perceived legitimacy of the
   Pennsylvania judiciary. The authors find that politicized campaign ads
   do detract from court support, although they find practically no
   difference between traditional campaign ads (e.g., presenting
   endorsements from groups) and strong attack ads. But this finding must
   be understood within the context of the 2007 Pennsylvania election
   increasing court support for all respondents, even those exposed to the
   most politicized ad content. Being exposed to politicized ads seems to
   retard the benefits of elections but does not eliminate them.},

Abstract = {Although the European Union was an ingredient in the processes of
   democratisation and marketisation in Central and Eastern Europe in the
   two decades following the 1989 revolutions, recent scholarly
   contributions to the debate on EU conditionality and post-accession
   conditionality raise doubts about the transformative power of the
   European Union and the explanatory power of the rational incentives
   model. Nonetheless, the very process of joining the club has left an
   indelible mark on the quality and functioning of democracy in the
   region.

Abstract = {This article provides a brief outline of the main developments that
   affected the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) structure in 2008 and
   2009, considering both the Eastern Partnership and the Union for the
   Mediterranean. This analysis makes it clear that both new initiatives
   originated in a desire to distance the progress of the European Union
   (EU)'s relations with the Eastern European non-members and with the
   Mediterranean countries from the framework of the ENP, securing a
   positive change in the EU's engagement with the neighbourhood which the
   ENP failed to ensure. Although both attempts were not successful, the
   need to address the drawbacks of the new construct involving the ENP and
   the two new initiatives unable to solve any outstanding problems is
   absolutely clear. The article concludes with a call to reform the
   essence of the ENP which should replace the current approach of adding
   new layers of policy on top of the existing structures of unsound
   performance. A serious rethinking of the ENP is urgently required.

Abstract = {Ontario's Midwifery Act came into effect on January 1, 1994, at a time
   of radical health care restructuring, marked by hospital closures and
   staffing cuts. In addition, feminist backlash was rampant in the popular
   media. Given these conditions, some have suggested that midwifery
   legislation was implemented because it aligned with the government's
   cost-cutting initiatives, while others have suggested that the
   government was responding to the dissatisfaction with obstetric practice
   outlined by a well-organized lobby. While these factors were no doubt
   important in the passing of the legislation, I offer a more critical
   reading of the policy texts, suggesting that the legislation and its
   enabling regulations problematize not only costs or client satisfaction
   but also the knowledge of midwives and the women they serve. In framing
   the issue as one of public safety, the policy ensemble introduced a new
   form of birthing expert- the expert midwife-reimposing a hierarchical
   relationship in the birthing process, serving to reify medical science
   and to objectify birthing women. In so doing, the legislation
   potentially silences claims for both professional and reproductive
   autonomy.},

Volume = {9},

Abstract = {Recent research on the politics of contemporary policymaking has
   centered the contributions of diverse conservative forces. Conservatives
   are viewed as the chief proponents of marketizing reforms featuring
   retrenchment of social programs, privatization of social services,
   deregulation, and tax reduction, as well as of disciplining policies
   that impose more stringent behavioral requirements on beneficiaries,
   employ testing and reporting to monitor recipient performance, and
   impose sanctions for non-compliance. These developments are often viewed
   as fostering a less egalitarian politics, especially for historically
   disadvantaged groups.
   I examine the rise of standards, testing, accountability, and limited
   school choice policies in federal education policymaking, which are
   widely viewed as embodying the same conservative interests and
   ideologies that have shaped policymaking in other areas. Contrary to
   this conventional wisdom, I show that certain civil rights
   organizations, not conservative forces, provided much of the impetus for
   federal standards, testing, and accountability reforms, which they
   viewed as measures for raising the achievement of disadvantaged
   students. Tracing the origins and consequences of these policies, my
   research reveals that entrepreneurial progressives can achieve
   significant legislative successes that they believe will accomplish
   progressive objectives. However, these policy victories have yielded
   mixed substantive results, and they have also unleashed complex and
   unanticipated consequences.},

Abstract = {In committee deliberation, requiring a unanimous vote intuitively
   provides the strongest incentives for actors to share fully their
   opinions and private information. It is also believed that full
   revelation of (decision-relevant) information occurs when personal
   biases are made clear before deliberation. However, recent literature
   suggests that both intuitions are flawed. Austen-Smith and Feddersen
   propose a model in which the unanimity rule performs worse than other
   rules in promoting fully revealing deliberation, and uncertainty about
   individuals' preferences promotes full sharing of information. We extend
   this work by incorporating the possibility that individuals may provide
   verifiable evidence for their private information. Under this
   circumstance, we demonstrate that Austen-Smith and Feddersen's results
   are reversed. First, a unanimous voting rule performs better than any
   other, as unanimity is the only rule that always promotes fully
   revealing deliberation. Second, under fairly general conditions,
   uncertainty about individuals' preferences prevents full sharing of
   information.},

Abstract = {At the beginning of each parliamentary session, almost all European
   governments give a speech in which they present the government's policy
   priorities and legislative agenda for the year ahead. Despite the body
   of literature on governments in European parliamentary democracies,
   systematic research on these executive policy agendas is surprisingly
   limited. In this article the authors study the executive policy
   agendas-measured through the policy content of annual government
   speeches-over the past 50 years in three Western European countries: the
   United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Denmark. Contrary to the
   expectations derived from the well-established ``politics matters{''}
   approach, the analyses show that elections and change in partisan color
   have little effect on the executive issue agendas, except to a limited
   extent for the United Kingdom. In contrast, the authors demonstrate
   empirically how the policy agenda of governments responds to changes in
   public problems, and this affects how political parties define these
   problems as political issues. In other words, policy responsibility that
   follows from having government power seems much more important for
   governments' issue agendas than the partisan and institutional
   characteristics of governments.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this writing is to recapture the contributions of writers

   between literary views - comprehensive horizon that often inspires
   social scientists-and distictively sociological conceptualizations. To
   this end, we take a few sources from both fields, so as to discern the
   features of modern distance between freedom and organization and
   identify, at the same time, the conceptual knots of what might be called
   late modernity, issues that both sociologists and writers strive to
   elucidate.},

   Kurdistan
   Honour killing, moraly and socialy accepted, is rooted in a patriarchal
   tradition and deeply attached to the body and sexuality of the woman. In
   Kurdistan, other factors of this violence are: the tribal culture and
   the tribal values, the militarisation of society and the culture of
   violence, which is a legacy of the different wars. We can add to this
   computer science that has been used without the necessary change of
   mentalities. Hundreds of women organisations are fighting for the
   defense of their rights and are leading campaigns against the honour
   killings.},

Abstract = {Studies of mass political attitudes and behavior before the 1950s have
   been limited by a lack of high-quality, individual-level data.
   Fortunately, data from public opinion polls conducted during the late
   New Deal and World War II periods are available, although the many
   difficulties of working with these data have left them largely untouched
   for over 60 years. We compiled and produced readily usable computer
   files for over 400 public opinion polls undertaken between 1936 and 1945
   by the four major survey organizations active during that period. We
   also developed a series of weights to ameliorate the problems introduced
   by the quota-sampling procedures employed at the time. The corrected
   data files and weights were released in May 2011. In this article, we
   briefly discuss the data and weighting procedures and then present
   selected time series determined using questions that were repeated on 10
   or more surveys. The time series provide considerable leverage for
   understanding the dynamics of public opinion in one of the most
   volatile-and pivotaleras in American history.},

Abstract = {In the past, European election campaigns have been fought primarily at
   national level, organized and led by national parties. The European
   political parties had neither the financial nor the organizational means
   to lead pan-European election campaigns. The June 2009 elections,
   however, highlighted a different and potentially significant trend: new
   EU regulations provided for the direct financing of European political
   parties, allowing them to campaign directly in the elections. It is
   argued that these developments could lead to the Europeanization of
   European elections campaigns. This article applies the concept of
   Europeanization to the election campaigns of the Party of European
   Socialists and three of its member parties: the British Labour Party,
   the French Socialist Party and the German Social Democrats, creating an
   ideal-type model of Europeanization. It concludes that in the three
   cases Europeanization is still in its infancy.},

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {55},

Abstract = {The absence of a core means that a majority coalition can never choose a
   policy that will keep it safe from minority appeals to its pivotal
   members. In two dimensions, strategic minorities will always be able to
   offer pivotal voters attractive policy concessions. We argue that this
   instability of multidimensional politics explains why minorities raise
   wedge issues and how wedge issues result in partisan realignment in
   legislative politics. Applying agenda-constrained ideal point estimation
   techniques to immigration debates, we show that the Reagan
   coalition-pro-business and social conservatives-has been vulnerable on
   the wedge issue of immigration and that parties have switched their
   positions on immigration over the last three decades. We use the
   uncovered set as the best-fit theoretical solution concept in this
   legislative environment, to capture the limits of majority rule
   coalitional possibilities and policy change in the two-dimensional
   absence of a core.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL POLITICS},

Volume = {23},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {This paper reconsiders the discussion on ordinal utilities versus
   preference intensities in voting theory. It is shown by way of an
   example that arguments concerning observability and risk-attitudes that
   have been presented in favour of Arrow's Independence of Irrelevant
   Alternatives (IIA), and against utilitarian evaluation, fail due to
   strategic voting. The failure of these two arguments is then used to
   justify utilitarian evaluation of outcomes in voting. Given a
   utilitarian viewpoint, it is then argued that strategy-proofness is not
   normatively acceptable. Social choice theory is criticised not just by
   showing that some of its most important conditions are not normatively
   acceptable, but also by showing that the very idea of imposing condition
   on social choice function under the assumption of sincere behaviour does
   not make much sense because satisfying a condition does not quarantee
   that a voting rule actually has the properties that the condition
   confers to it under sincere behaviour. IIA, the binary intensity IIA,
   and monotonicity are used as illustrations of this phenomenon.},

Abstract = {Recent scholarship has outlined and debated theories of a culture war
   taking place within the United States, with religious traditionalists
   pitted against nonorthodox religious believers and nonbelievers. Some
   scholars and commentators contend that the American Left has contributed
   to this culture war through its hostility toward Americans of faith.
   This theory, which I call the Irreverent Left thesis, purports that such
   hostility has caused religious traditionalists to abandon the Democratic
   Party for the Republican Party, leading to Republican victories in
   national politics. This article examines whether the Left has become
   more hostile to religion. Using content analysis of American Left
   publications-The Nation, In These Times, and Mother Jones- I examine the
   attitudes of progressive elites from 1977 to 2000. Findings indicate
   that although the American Left has become more hostile toward religious
   faith, this hostility is more likely a result of the shifting partisan
   loyalties than a cause.},

Abstract = {The concept of Generalized War, which turned out to be essential for the
   organization of the Doctrine of National Security which was implemented
   in Latin America in the last third of the 20th century, is analyzed in
   this paper. This concept was built from the synthesis of two previous
   concepts: Carl Von Clausewitzs Absolute War and the Atomic Warfare of
   the Cold War. The theoretical mistakes, which are studied in the paper;
   the excessive valuation of the classic experts in war; and the forced
   interpretation of the political and social reality, justified the
   excesses of the National Securitys Regimes which damaged both the
   countries and the Armed Forces.},

Abstract = {In keeping with practices elsewhere in Europe, Higher Education
   Institutes (HEIs) in Ireland have in recent decades adopted access
   policies for non-traditional students (not recent school leavers). This
   paper assesses a particular initiative to facilitate access to HEIs to
   non-traditional students. However, due to the initiative's origins as a
   non-accredited certificate for asylum seekers and refugees, specific
   attention will be paid to the immigrant community. This paper assesses
   the details of a new programme in Irish politics and political
   leadership for non-traditional students in Ireland. It will present the
   curriculum and document the teaching strategies that were selected while
   exploring the role for universities and political science departments,
   in particular in facilitating integration. Student-centred learning
   provides the overarching framework for the curriculum. Three teaching
   approaches - KWL, service learning, and enquiry- or problem-based
   learning - have been selected as the pedagogical underpinnings of this
   Certificate programme. The paper explores all three approaches and
   provides examples of how these will be employed. Finally, this paper
   concludes with a discussion of how the programme could be adapted in
   other jurisdictions and its uses in integrating citizens from new
   communities across European democracies.},

Abstract = {The leading approaches to election forecasting have been statistical
   models, prediction markets, or vote intention polls. This paper explores
   a different, little used approach - citizen forecasting - a method never
   yet tried for the case of the United Kingdom. Citizen forecasting simply
   asks voters in a scientific pre-election survey who they think will win.
   This aggregated (averaged) result is then assessed for its accuracy in
   forecasting the overall election outcome. This assessment is carried out
   on UK general elections from 1951 to 2005, and then applied to 2010. We
   find, among other things, that generally speaking the majority of the
   electorate can foretell the winner in advance. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {The reflection of this article has to do with questioning the
   reductionist vision which has been in the center of the analysis about
   political decentralization and democracy in Latin America. Based on this
   goal, new research challenges have been proposed in order to have a
   better comprehension concerning the scope and limitations of this
   relationship throughout the different countries of this region. In doing
   so, a new objective appears in terms of adopting, with a better
   empirical evidence, those required decisions to improve the democratic
   quality of the Latin American municipalities.},

Journal = {FRENCH POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2},
Pages = {97-119},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Economic voting studies have been dominated by the classic
   reward-punishment paradigm, in which voters vote for the incumbent under
   good economic performance, but against under bad. This paradigm works
   well when the economic issue is a valence issue, such as prosperity.
   However, it leaves out positional economic voting, in which the voter's
   place in the economic structure influences policy preference, and thus
   party preference. More precisely, we suggest that the better the
   economic location of voters in terms of assets, high-risk assets in
   particular, the more they will vote right, because the right promises a
   better return on their investments. We demonstrate this effect in French
   presidential election data, from three national surveys - 1988, 1995 and
   2002. This assets effect well exceeds other economic effects tested, and
   does so under strong statistical controls.},

Abstract = {Improving access to potable water has become an increasingly urgent
   concern for developing nations in the current era of globalization.
   According to standard wisdom, if developing countries undertake certain
   domestic reforms, such as investing in infrastructure and engineering,
   then safe and clean drinking water will improve. This analysis uncovers,
   however, that in addition to such domestic efforts, one of the greatest
   factors affecting water uncertainty is, in fact, internationally
   induced: trade. Surprisingly, both scholars and practitioners have
   neglected the potential impacts of expanding trade on access to potable
   water. This analysis is the first large-N cross-national study of water
   that focuses on the interplay of trade and politics-both international
   and domestic-as the primary driving forces behind improvements in (or
   constraints to) water access. The author hypothesizes that growing
   export pressures are constraining drinkable water in poor countries, but
   a particular domestic condition can mitigate this effect: the existence
   of lower levels of income inequality. As the socioeconomic actors
   disadvantaged by openness, particularly in more equal countries, seek
   reparations for the growing threats to potable water, the adverse
   affects of trade on water may be averted. Empirical evidence from 77
   developing countries and case studies of Vietnam and India provide
   support for this hypothesis.},

Abstract = {This essay draws attention to the importance of Montesquieu's earliest
   and unpublished writings on liberty for our understanding of the famous
   eleventh book of the Spirit of the Laws. Montesquieu's investigation of
   the nature and preconditions of liberty, the author argues, was much
   more polemical than it is usually assumed. As an analysis of his
   notebooks shows, Montesquieu set out to wrest control over the concept
   of liberty from the republican admirers of classical antiquity, a
   faction that he believed to be dangerously populist and revolutionary.
   In order to do so, Montesquieu came up with a redefinition of the
   concept of liberty that allowed him to argue that monarchical subjects
   could be just as free as republican citizens. This conclusion has
   important implications not just for our understanding of Montesquieu's
   writings but also and more broadly for our understanding of the
   intellectual history of liberalism.},

Abstract = {Historically, Swiss identity was founded on beliefs in federalism,
   direct democracy and armed neutrality. Given continued popular support
   for autonomous self-defense in an era of transnational threats, it is
   worth examining whether a small economically interdependent state, such
   as Switzerland, is single-handedly capable of providing for its own
   security. To preview our conclusions, every facet of Switzerland's
   security, whether against military threats, terrorism or natural
   disasters, today benefits from substantial international inputs. At
   base, Switzerland's increasing security dependence has been driven by
   the following dynamics: 1) the general development of institutionalized
   international cooperation; 2) the evolving nature of the threats
   Switzerland faces; and 3) political efforts to ``securitize'' issues not
   hitherto considered as security problems. Because Swiss security
   dependence owes more to broad structural factors than deliberate
   choices, policymakers would be better off embracing this reality by
   proactively using international organizations to address transnational
   challenges.},

Abstract = {We argue that chambers have an incentive to create committees
   unrepresentative of themselves. In a bicameral setting, a committee
   within a chamber has two roles: as policy advisor for the parent
   chamber, and an additional role, less often recognized in the
   literature, as an agent for bargaining with the other chamber. In the
   former role, sound advice requires that the committee be representative
   of the chamber's preferences. In the latter role, a committee can be an
   effective bargaining agent if it is willing to reject proposals that the
   chamber cannot commit to reject. But this requires the committee to be
   unrepresentative of the chamber. Optimal committee design reflects a
   tension between the chamber's desire for a trustworthy (and therefore
   representative) advisor and a ``tough{''} (and therefore
   unrepresentative) bargaining agent. Thus intercameral interactions can
   affect optimal intracameral arrangements; therefore, unicameral theories
   of legislative organization may overlook important factors.},

Abstract = {Relations between poor people and the government that creates the
   Programa Bolsa Familia at Brazil may be summarized in two dimensions: 1)
   favor direct relationships without the intervention of collective action
   and 2) are distant relations in terms of type of interaction and
   communication between the authorities and beneficiaries. While there are
   instances of formal social control, operation of the program makes
   minimal intermediation and highly institutional and civic organizations
   have little room to act and to represent the beneficiaries of Bolsa
   Familia in institutionalized interfaces. Direct links generate positive
   effect low levels of political patronage vote buying and coercion, but
   also generate unintended effects such as the lack of program operation,
   difficulty to defend themselves collectively by irregularities and
   create an active citizenry},

Abstract = {Forgetting violence and injustice was long seen as a condition for
   sustainable peace after a war or civil war. But the amnesty clause is
   only realistic where certain rules of war were upheld or were at least
   not systematically abused. The First World War already lies beyond its
   field of application, the National Socialists' war of annihilation all
   the more. Wherever people cannot forget, only remembrance remains.
   Remembrance, however, stands in an indissoluble and paradoxical
   relationship with forgetting: only what is previously known - remembered
   - can actively be forgotten afterwards.},

Abstract = {The main points of the Latin American political culture and mentality
   and especially of its areas with a minor degree of modernization arise
   from colonial times. They have suffered of course many alterations; the
   most important one has been caused by the modernization process in the
   second half of the 20th century. But the leading features of that
   culture are still alive: authoritarianism, paternalism and centralism,
   on the one side, and the inefficient functioning of the state
   bureaucracy, on the other. The present populism is nourished from the
   preservation of this political culture. Its broad acceptation is due to
   the conservation of those features seen now as people's own. Actual
   theories tend to strengthen this situation. In the political field
   populism can bring in a return of nationalist and collectivist behaviour
   patterns and of political proceedings, which are characterized by
   caudillismo, charismatic attraction, irrationalism and authoritarian
   hierarchies.},

Abstract = {Since tenure decisions concern the award of an employment guarantee, the
   burden of proof ought to rest on the candidate; in cases of doubt, the
   vote should be negative. However, a number of corrosive tendencies often
   weaken the strict application of this principle. To counteract these
   tendencies, this article advocates a strategy of pre-commitment to
   fairly objective standards and reliance on the professional judgments of
   a variety of anonymous outside experts, as reflected in a candidate's
   success in the double-blind peer review process.},

Abstract = {This article presents an analytical platform for discussing and
   analyzing administrative reforms in terms of democracy. First, we
   present the democratic theory positions represented by output democracy
   and input democracy. These two positions are used to classify different
   types of reform. The second explanatory approach on democracy and
   reforms is transformative, and it applies a mixture of external
   features, domestic administrative culture, and polity features to
   understand variations in the democratic aspects of public sector
   reforms. Central issues are whether these reforms can be seen as
   alternatives or whether they complement each other in terms of layering
   processes. Third, we take a broad overview of New Public Management
   (NPM) and post-NPM reforms and carry out an in-depth analysis of a new
   administrative policy report by the Norwegian centre-left government.
   Finally, we discuss briefly the broader comparative implications of our
   findings.},

Abstract = {Do White voters use candidate race as a voting cue in biracial electoral
   contests? We argue that the answer to this question depends on the level
   of political knowledge and information that voters have rather than on
   their attitudes toward minorities. Our analyses of precinct- and
   individual-level data show that White voters who are likely to be
   informed about candidates vote less often for the Democratic party when
   the candidate is Black, whereas vote choices of White voters who are
   unlikely to be informed about candidates are unaffected by candidate
   race.},

Abstract = {In this article, prospect theory helps shed light on an underdeveloped
   topic in political science: the management strategies of presidential
   campaigns. In particular, prospect theory is used to understand critical
   decisions made by the campaigns of Edward Kennedy, Jimmy Carter, Ronald
   Reagan, and George H. W. Bush during three critical junctures of the
   1980 presidential primary season. Prospect theory's central finding-that
   individuals are risk averse when facing gains and risk acceptant when
   facing losses-provides a systematic and empirically grounded explanation
   for seemingly puzzling decisions made by each campaign. In a broad
   sense, this essay begins the process of developing a general perspective
   on presidential campaign management.},

Abstract = {Conventional wisdom on party systems in advanced industrial democracies
   holds that modern electorates are dealigned and that social cleavages no
   longer structure party politics. Recent work on class cleavages has
   challenged this stylized fact. The analysis performed here extends this
   criticism to the religious-secular cleavage. Using path analysis and
   comparing the current electorates of the United States, Germany, and
   Great Britain with the early 1960s, this paper demonstrates that the
   religious-secular cleavage remains or has become a significant predictor
   of conservative vote choice. While the effects of the religious-secular
   cleavage on vote choice have become largely indirect, the total of the
   direct and indirect effects is substantial and equivalent to the effects
   of class and status. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {One of prominent traits for the time of globalization is information
   inflation and knowledge explosion. On one hand, human knows the nature
   more agreeably and the knowledge of nature tends to be more specific.
   Most are known. On the other hand, human understand the society more
   contrarily and the knowledge of society tends to be more confusing. Most
   are unknown. When and even before we are engaged in solving these
   globalization issues, it is extremely necessary to review and sequence
   human known knowledge and hope-to-know knowledge. In this paper, the
   author makes a comparative analysis of the unbalanced development of two
   kinds of knowledge systems at the time of globalization, and proposes a
   wish: promote human progresses and create a beautiful future by driving
   the balanced development of two kinds of knowledge systems.},

Abstract = {The surface area covered by Arctic sea ice and Arctic sea ice volume are
   both receding. This is in part a consequence of the current warm phase
   of the long-term, natural Atlantic multidecadal oscillation.
   Anthropogenic warming and changed wind systems could accelerate the
   decrease in Arctic sea ice. But the transition of the Atlantic
   multidecadal oscillation to a cooler phase is also conceivable. As a
   result, Arctic sea ice could recover. Even a reversal of the warming
   trend is conceivable. In scientific terms, it remains unclear how long
   the present warm phase of the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation will
   last. The decrease in Arctic sea ice will greatly influence atmospheric
   and oceanic circulatory systems. The expected changes would also affect
   the climate in Europe.},

Abstract = {During the East-West conflict, the Arctic became one of the world's most
   militarised regions. Strategic submarines cruised the north polar sea.
   Long-range bombers and intercontinental missiles, whose routes would
   have led over the North Pole, were to see to nuclear deterrence. Today,
   there is a chance to establish a nuclear-free zone in the Arctic. The
   Antarctic Treaty offers a model for demilitarisation. The establishment
   of nuclear-free zones in other regions of the world made it possible
   that nuclear states do not have to take the initiative. Lessons are also
   to be learned from other nuclear-free zones. If civil society exerts
   pressure, and countries without nuclear weapons lead the way, the United
   States and Russia could follow.},

Abstract = {This paper argues that while critical realist insights are important for
   heterodoxy, any engagement with the economic mainstream must remain
   faithful to Bhaskar's original formulation with its explicit focus on
   `ideology critique'. The article proceeds by distinguishing Bhaskar's
   more Marxian-inspired realism from the broadly heterodox variety of the
   `critical realism in economics' (CRE) project. It then highlights the
   weaknesses of the CRE critique of the economic mainstream before
   positing an alternative critique in terms of ideology.},

Abstract = {International interest in the Arctic is growing due to the regional
   consequences of climate change. In parts of the Arctic, the most
   significant warming of the last half century is to be observed. The
   melting of the sea ice could facilitate the extraction of mineral
   resources and open up new shipping routes. But the Arctic is more than
   an economic space. It is a highly fragile ecological system and home to
   numerous indigenous peoples. Arctic and sub-arctic zones make up a fifth
   of mainland Russia. Russia is one of the region's most important
   countries and has considerable influence on whether the ecological and
   economic interests in the Arctic are settled by cooperation or
   confrontation.},

Abstract = {This paper focuses on the process of coalition formation in presidential
   systems. It shows that party positions and institutions influence the
   formation of government coalitions. We argue that presidents will tend
   to include parties positioned close to their policy positions in their
   cabinets, and will be more inclined to do it when relative institutional
   authority is more advantageous to congress. We corroborate our arguments
   with data from 13 presidential countries in the Americas.},

Title = {Xenophobia and Civil Society: Durban's Structured Social Divisions},
Journal = {POLITIKON},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {38},
Number = {1},
Pages = {59-83},
Abstract = {Xenophobia in Durban was of a lower intensity than in South Africa's
   other two main metropolises, Johannesburg and Cape Town, in the 2008-10
   period, and yet was just as durable, with incidents continuing to
   reflect underlying social antagonism. The roots of the conflict are, we
   argue, to be found in the material processes of `uneven and combined
   development' that are too rarely tackled in the public or policy
   spheres. These processes have been difficult for researchers and
   critical civil society forces to comprehend and counteract because they
   are structural in form. In the context of an overall economic crisis and
   rising inequality and urban poverty, these processes include a glutted
   labour market, housing shortages, township retail competition, highly
   gendered cultural differences, and apparently intractable regional
   geopolitical tensions. These root-cause pressures continueas will
   xenophobiabecause short of a national political shift in power and
   interests, they are extremely difficult to resolve. As a result, civil
   society will continue band-aiding the problems when they surface as
   social crises, or be compelled to generate much more explicit politics
   of regional solidarity, including in Durban, whose port and traditions
   of community politics already offer examples of the kinds of alliances
   required in future.},

Journal = {POLITIX},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {24},
Number = {95},
Pages = {47+},
Abstract = {How a certain economic reality is made, strengthened, and spread? This
   article examines the problem through the situation of the French General
   Planning Commissariat in the late 1960's, which at that time hold a key
   place in the politico-administrative space. However, given the force
   accorded to the market and the external constraint, this institution is
   more and more questioned. In this context, a new macroeconomic model
   called ``FIFI{''}, developed by a group of economists at the INSEE
   (Institut national de la statistique et des etudes economiques),
   introduces some displacements regarding the making of economic policies
   and their leanings. The model has been designed to provide a picture of
   the French economy in 1975 if no decisions were taken, in order to
   identify future the problems which could arise from the trends and to
   determine the solutions which could be recommended. As it is an
   instrument that attributes causality (between various entities such as
   wages, unemployment or the external constraint), the FIFI model tends to
   displace the type of imputations on which the participants of the Plan
   rely on, especially trade unions. Hence, these economic metrologies not
   only produce a reality, made of numbers and relatively independent; they
   also destabilize the political forms that are explicitly based on
   values.},

Title = {Accountability for Intervention: Negotiating Civilian Protection
   Dilemmas with Respect to Economic Community of West African States and
   African Union Interventions},
Journal = {AFRICAN SECURITY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {4},
Number = {2},
Pages = {81-99},
Abstract = {African states have been confronted with myriad challenges, especially
   in the areas of peace and security. As a result of the perceived
   reluctance or inability of the international community, specifically the
   United Nations, to intervene in a timely fashion in Africa's conflicts,
   regional and subregional organizations in Africa have assumed a greater
   role in conflict prevention, management, resolution, and peacekeeping in
   Africa. Notably, the Economic Community of West African States and the
   African Union have intervened in various African conflicts with either
   retrospective or prior endorsement by the UN Security Council to protect
   civilians from the adverse effects of conflicts. However, interventions
   by these African institutions have sometimes had unintended
   consequences. In this paper we discuss some of the dilemmas and
   challenges that arise during the use of force as a last resort for
   civilian protection in Africa. We argue that the use of force as a last
   resort for humanitarian intervention by African regional and subregional
   organizations for protecting civilians from mass atrocities often
   results in positive as well as negative unintended consequences for both
   interveners and civilians. However, for multiple reasons, such as the
   lack of political will, loopholes in the judicial systems of troop
   contributing countries, and resource constraints, interveners are rarely
   held accountable for their actions that constitute violations against
   the very civilians whose protection provided the basis and rationale for
   such interventions in the first place.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE EDUCATION},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {7},

Abstract = {To make a difference in their communities, students need to develop the
   ``knowledge, skills, values, and motivation to make that difference''
   (Ehrlich 2000, p.vi). Taking advantage of Iowa's role in the 2008
   presidential nominations, I designed three ``civic learning'' projects:
   a collaborative fact- checking weblog, a nonpartisan voter guide on
   policy issues, and a student- led voter registration drive. I then
   tracked the classes' scores on pre-and postcourse measures of civic
   skills and attitudes, comparing the results to courses without civic
   projects. I found that the projects greatly improved students' skills
   and attitudes related to civic engagement. Students who did the fact-
   checking research made gains in their analysis and presentation skills.
   Students who compiled the voter guides improved their analysis skills,
   civic participation skills, and also became more aware of their biases.
   Students who participated in voter registration became more confident
   leaders and more positive about the value of volunteering. This
   experiment shows that integrating civic learning projects into courses
   can help students develop skills and attitudes that foster political
   engagement.},

Pages = {183+},
Abstract = {Industrial disputes against restructuring projects are often intense. To
   understand the construction of these forms of resistance, we rely on
   life histories conducted with thirty-five union activists who led the
   struggle against restructuring projects. In a situation of high tension
   with important issues in terms of control by the activist, of duration
   of the mobilization, of potential differences on the aims of the
   struggle, but also of ways to reconcile personal and activist lives for
   the leader himself, it appears that open and hidden actions, collective
   and individual actions are articulated to organize resistance. This
   organization is based on the constitution of a network, on interaction
   devices with employees, and on a small team of confident persons. This
   raises finally the question of individual and contextual factors as they
   seem to favor the emergence of these resources.},

Abstract = {This article tries to sum up the findings of the country articles and
   put them into a comparative perspective. The major finding is one of
   great diversity among prevailing career patterns in multi-level
   polities. This in itself is considered an advance over frequent
   assumptions about career patterns based on the US case alone. Looking
   for causal explanations the article discards some institutional
   hypotheses. It therefore calls for more empirical research on
   institutional configurations, the time sequence in which institutions
   have emerged historically, and the perception and interpretation of
   institutional arrangements by politicians.},

Journal = {ANALELE UNIVERSITATII BUCURESTI-STIINTE POLITICE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {13},

Abstract = {Favoring the return of refugees and of Internally Displaced Persons
   (IDPs) to their pre-war homes is one of the cornerstones of the 1995
   Dayton Peace Agreements which put an end to the conflict in Bosnia and
   Herzegovina. The policy's objective was to reverse the ethnic cleansing
   perpetrated by warring parties, and to allow individuals and families to
   restart their lives as soon as possible (a common assumption being that
   refugees are in a time and psychological limbo). Based on ethnographic
   data collected over four years in the post-war period, I will show that
   return is a dynamic and multi-directional process, with complex
   individual and collective parameters. The decision to return is neither
   uniform nor universal; it is a personal response to fear, trauma,
   experience in exile or in displacement, and one's ability to adjust to a
   post-war environment with new constraints. In this perspective, my
   purpose in this article is to underscore how qualitative research
   methods allow the emergence of a social reality largely downplayed (or
   ignored) by political and institutional actors.},

Volume = {9},

Abstract = {When surveying the cosmopolitan literature one is often struck by the
   ease with which the state is rendered morally and empirically otiose and
   by resulting ambiguities about the role states could play in creating a
   cosmopolitan condition. In response to these ambiguities, the purpose of
   this article is to examine some recent cosmopolitan arguments and to see
   what answers, if any, they have for bridging the gap between
   cosmopolitan theory and state practice. By doing so, this article will
   map out the recent relationship between cosmopolitanism and the state
   while also suggesting that cosmopolitans should reconsider a research
   agenda based on the idea of responsible cosmopolitan states as a means
   to create stronger links between cosmopolitan theory and contemporary
   international practice.},

Abstract = {The aim of the article is to analyze the causes behind the electoral
   success of the Sweden Democrats, the radical right-wing populist party
   in Sweden that gained parliamentary representation in the 2010
   elections. The article argues that the causes of its success should be
   looked for not only in favourable political conditions (e.g. the
   continuing saliency of the immigration issue, growing electoral
   volatility and decreasing partisan identification), but above all in the
   party's strategy - a new master frame, the politicization of the
   immigration issue, and the strengthening of the party's organization.
   The Sweden Democrats have moderated their party program and, to a large
   extent, rid themselves of the stigma that resulted from their origins
   and their connection to neo-Nazi movements. They have also skilfully
   used media attention and succeeded in politicizing their major issue -
   immigration. Another reason for their success lies in their
   establishment of party apparatus at the municipal and regional levels.},

Abstract = {For more than two decades, the Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Zizek has
   been `exploding' the world of academy with a reflection that aims to
   present the possibility of a `truly political act' that constructs its
   own conditions of possibility in the way of event. This is an act that
   would apparently be ``impossible{''} to imagine in a given situation but
   that it would be nonetheless present as possibility, in the
   inconsistency that would characterize any symbolic register. This
   article seeks to trace the genealogy of such an act which Zizek has
   conceived as inscribed in a given situation, but radically new at the
   same time. In this regard, it is stated that the Zizekian act is
   inseparable from a materialist ontology of an `All-non-All' or an
   inconsistent all, defended by Zizek. Hence, the features of the act that
   this article identifies: its ``impossibility{''}, the traversal of
   fantasy and its militant subjective constitution, only become
   intelligible when they are interpreted in view of this materialist
   ontology. There would be the key that would permit to decipher the main
   premises of the radical political act (and its polemic theoretical and
   political derivates). This article ends by reflecting on the normative
   consequences that a radical political act, in this way conceived, would
   have to a general notion of democracy.},

Title = {Rethinking Terrorist Safe Havens: Beyond a State-Centric Approach},
Journal = {CIVIL WARS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {13},
Number = {4},
Pages = {396-413},
Abstract = {Over the last decade, the term safe haven has stirred controversy both
   in the political arena as well as in the academic literature. Several
   authors have emphasised the imprecise and commonly ill-conceived use of
   this terminology. This article intends to provide a fresh analytical
   framework to better understand the notion of terrorist safe haven.
   Rejecting the orthodox state-centric approach that envisions terrorist
   safe havens solely in their static and territorial dimensions, we focus
   rather on the social dynamics that characterise these spaces. We contend
   that although they might appear socially fragmented, these geographical
   areas are ruled by alternative modes of governance that impose a form of
   social order regulating interactions among actors. We use the concept of
   `social space' to capture the framework in which social interactions
   between local actors are taking place. While we recognise that the
   social order that governs a given social space imposes constraints for
   actors, we contend that it can be subjected to internal contestation,
   opening a series of opportunities for transnational terrorist networks.
   We then try to highlight how terrorist groups might take advantage of
   these internal dynamics and create new ones to ensnare some local actors
   into forming alliances with them. This article addresses several case
   studies to further illustrate the theoretical discussion. Finally, we
   conclude with a discussion of the importance of interpersonal
   relationships between local and transnational actors. While this article
   proposes a preliminary analysis of the question, it opens up new
   research avenues in conceptualising why and how some regions have come
   to attract transnational terrorist groups.},

   Party Organisation?},
Journal = {GERMAN POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {20},

Pages = {469-485},
Abstract = {Chancellor Angela Merkel's independence from her own Christian
   Democratic Union (CDU) during the second Grand Coalition (2005-09) can
   be seen as consistent with broader trends toward presidentialism and
   personalised politics. Both would suggest that any publicly popular
   chief executive who seems likely to win it vital voter support can
   expect broad latitude from a party's dominant coalition while in office.
   Yet there was also an important organisational dimension to Merkel's
   chancellorship. Parties like her CDU - with a divided dominant coalition
   and ever more unstable relations among its factions - would be poorly
   positioned to constrain a leader to begin with. Thus, as chancellor,
   Merkel rarely had to fear unified dissent in her own ranks when shaping
   policy compromises with the Social Democrats (SPD).},

Abstract = {What are researchers doing today when they study social movements? How
   to stir up sociological imagination in the light of a threefold
   threatening routinisation - of research objects, of interpretation
   patterns and of methodologies? We are not bent here in promoting any
   kind of ``methodologism{''}, nor do we intend to advocate ``one best
   methodological way{''} to study mobilizations, for this would be to
   disregard knowledge aims that are specific to each and every research.
   We do not promote any methodological hardening, nor do we engage in the
   promotion of any standard empirical approach to study social movements.
   Our paper and the special issue as a whole rather stick back to the
   principle of social science unity, this being for us the only way to
   open up new questions without neglecting current research endeavors.
   Studying and making sense of mobilizations anew is what researchers in
   this issue invite us to do, particularly by suggesting to better look at
   how mobilizations take place within time, space, and social order
   frameworks.},

Abstract = {The question of how we know when censorship occurred has several sides.
   Problems of evidence of censorship do not only arise from practical
   obstacles, but also from its very nature as a knowledge-related
   phenomenon. Scarcity and abundance of information about censorship may
   be determined by the extent of the censors' success or by uneven
   research efforts. These factors often make it complicated to demarcate
   censorship from similar restrictions and to identify patterns and trends
   in the relationship between power and freedom. The present chapter looks
   into this epistemological problem by mapping the set of concepts
   governing and surrounding censorship in the particular field of history.
   It draws up a mini-dictionary with definitions of 26 key concepts
   related to, larger than, and different from the censorship of history.
   As these definitions are interrelated, the set in its entirety forms a
   taxonomy.},

   irreconcilable ideological and social systemic anti-Americanism. But it
   was at this time that Communist construction enterprises\_and architects
   oriented themselves on American models with regard to technical
   construction and antique-like architectural ornamentation.},

Abstract = {Kosovo currently seems to be caught in an impasse, which is going beyond
   the mere status issue and has to do with its capacity to function as a

   the EU in this regard. It is questioning the assumption that the EU
   would be the best suited actor to promote those reforms, and wonders

Abstract = {This paper uses exogenous variation in electoral rules to test the
   predictions of strategic voting models and the causal validity of
   Duverger's Law. Exploiting a regression discontinuity design in the
   assignment of single-ballot and dual-ballot (runoff) plurality systems
   in Brazilian mayoral races, the results indicate that single-ballot
   plurality rule causes voters to desert third placed candidates and vote
   for the top two vote getters. The effects are stronger in close
   elections and cannot be explained by differences in the number of
   candidates, as well as their party affiliation and observable
   characteristics.},

Abstract = {In this article, we sketch out a materialist account of the systematic
   connections between capitalism and democracy, and assess, with reference
   to Britain and Germany, the impact of the current economic crisis on the
   scope of democratic decision-making. In our view, the infrastructure of
   class-based political representation is being removed, which means that
   political strategies taking on board subaltern demands are being blocked
   systematically. The result is a state of elective autocracy: governments
   adopt `empty-handed' class political strategies centred on (a)
   legitimising cuts to state expenditure by invoking fear of fiscal and
   economic crises, and (b) disciplining immigrant groups that purportedly
   hold illiberal values.},

Title = {Civil Society and Competitive Authoritarianism in Malaysia},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CIVIL SOCIETY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-21},
Abstract = {This article looks at the development of civil society in Malaysia under
   competitive authoritarian rule. It focuses on three main questions: What
   role does civil society play under competitive authoritarian rule? Can
   it successfully challenge authoritarianism? Or does the existence of a
   civil society actually strengthen the stability of the authoritarian
   order? In order to provide answers to these questions, the concept of
   historical institutionalism will be applied. Thereby, institutional
   legacies which have been and still are of great influence on the
   structures and functions of Malaysian civil society will be identified.
   This study shows that the structures and functions of Malaysian civil
   society changed significantly over the last five decades. Furthermore,
   this article argues that civil society groups are increasingly emerging
   as challengers to the autocratic elites. Nevertheless, the analysis
   indicates that the institutional framework of competitive
   authoritarianism heavily restricts civic engagement and the
   establishment of civic associations. However, the use of coercion and
   co- optation is restricted due to the regime's competitive character,
   thus producing a structurally, functionally and operatively limited
   civil society.},

Abstract = {Before the establishment in the early 1800s of France's Surete Nationale
   and England's Scotland Yard, the detection of crimes was generally
   regarded as supernatural work, but the rise of modern science allowed
   mere mortals to systematize and categorize events-and thus to solve
   crimes. Reducing the amount of crime, however, did not reduce the fear
   of crime, which actually grew in the late-nineteenth century as the
   result of globalization and media sensationalism. Literary detectives
   offered an imaginary cure for an imaginary disease. Sherlock Holmes, the
   most famous literary detective, retained many of the characteristics
   that earlier ages had attributed to superhuman ``detectives{''}; a
   wondrous and a social being, he nonetheless was able to reassure an
   anxious public that even the most heinous crimes could be solved. His
   ability to calm the fears of the globalizing Victorian era was an early
   version of what later became a proliferation of imaginary characters
   serving similar public functions.},

Abstract = {Marcel Gauchet's theory of democracy focuses on the secularization of
   Western societies and the emergence of ``autonomy{''} in them-Weber's
   ``disenchantment of the world.{''} The nineteenth-century liberalism
   that resulted failed to generate a sense of collective purpose that
   could fill the gap left by the retreat of religion. Totalitarian
   ideologies achieved this by harnessing the passions unleashed by World
   War I, but at the cost of radicalization. Conversely, the (unexpected
   and lasting) post-1945 ``social state{''} set the groundwork for modern
   individualism and established new legitimacy for the regulatory and
   protective nation-state, conceptually bonded directly with its
   voter-citizens. Democracy is thus impossible to disentangle from social
   democracy-regardless of its actual effectiveness. If Gauchet is right,
   the left's embrace of ``voice{''} over ``exit{''} mixes a deep insight
   with flawed prescriptions, as it overlooks the national nature of the
   experience of citizenship, whereas classical liberals favoring the
   ``exit{''} option risk undermining the core of the democratic compact.},

   considerations and the citizenship dilemma},
Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {15},
Number = {6-7},
Pages = {643-658},
Abstract = {Issues about migrant rights and protection are raised in cases of return
   migration when the country that migrants return to prohibits dual
   citizenship although the migrant has naturalised elsewhere. This article
   explores the politics of membership and rights faced by former citizens
   returning to reside in the society they had left. Returning Mainland
   Chinese migrants with Canadian citizenship status have to navigate
   China's dual citizenship restriction and the impacts on their Chinese
   hukou status that confers residency, employment and social rights. This
   analysis also keeps in view their relationship with the country in which
   they have naturalised and left, namely Canada. Migrants shuttling
   between the two countries face a citizenship dilemma as they have
   limited rights in China whereas their status as Canadian citizens living
   abroad simultaneously removes them from some rights provided by the
   Canadian state. This paper thus introduces new and pressing questions
   about citizenship in the light of return migration trends.},

Abstract = {The focus of this paper is on the justificatory basis of democracy. The
   paper operates on two levels, theoretical and historical. Onthe
   theoretical level the author claims that many of the arguments put
   forward to justify democracy, such as that formulated by Dahl in
   `Democracy and its Critics' based on his two principles of equality,
   although not without merit, suffer certain crucial weaknesses and do
   not, in fact, get at the real basis of the belief in the unique
   legitimacy of democracy. He goes on to argue that this legitimacy is
   grounded not simply in the positive egalitarian consequences expected
   from democracy, but rather is to be found in the moral autonomy of the
   human being. Further, he claims, this moral autonomy is itself rooted in
   what the author calls the Cartesian autonomy of reason. On the
   historical level he claims that, while Descartes was himself extremely
   conservative with regard to orthodox Christian belief and traditional
   structures of political authority, many self-styled followers of
   Descartes saw the autonomy of reason as implying a radical rejection of
   all `external' authority, first in respect of religious belief, but
   also, then, with respect to the secular authority. The result was that
   within what Jonathan Israel refers to as the `Radical Enlightenment',
   there developed as early as the mid-seventeenth century a tradition of
   liberal and democratic radicalism, based explicitly on the Cartesian
   autonomy of reason and what was referred to as the `freedom to
   philosophise'. The author illustrates this with a brief account of the
   Dutch radical thinker Franciscus Van den Enden. He argues that if we
   posit moral autonomy as the basis of democratic legitimacy, this
   privileges one particular conception of democracy, namely deliberative
   democracy, as its paradigmatic form. Throughout the whole argument he
   gives a central role to the autonomy of reason as, in particular, it
   began to sweep across Europe with the influence of Cartesianism. It is
   possible that there are older egalitarian roots to modern democratic
   ideology or that democratic authority is grounded on democracy's
   epistemic properties. The author looks at these claims towards the end
   of the paper and concludes that the autonomy of the moral agent as based
   itself on the autonomy of human reason is the most plausible basis of
   the unique legitimacy of democracy.},

Abstract = {Traced in the article are the fundamentals of geopolitics: of the
   subdiscipline's prehistory, of the classical period of its development
   and of its contemporaneity. The author presents comparison between
   different classical and between different modern national schools,
   compares the best known ideas, concepts and theories and comes to the
   conclusion that notwithstanding the continuation of the classical
   tradition. the modern geopolitics displays quite a few fresh new
   features preconditioned first of all by the alteration of the structure
   of the world, of the international political climate and by the
   inventing of the weapons of mass destruction.},

Abstract = {The coming back of the citizenship principle into the political debate
   is mainly the result of a crisis situation that is caracterized by the
   loss of benchmarks. The concept of citizenship is highlighted today as
   being particularly relevant to federate ideological and political issues
   that mark the last decades. Citizenship should encourage us to initiate
   a more indepth reflection on the basic values that holds the community
   of citizens together, on the legal and institutionnal tools that are
   requested to carry out this exercice effectively and on how to take this
   concept into consideration in the dynamic of the societies both at the

Title = {Security Sector Reform in authoritarian regimes: The OSCE experience of
   police assistance programming in Central Asia},
Journal = {SECURITY AND HUMAN RIGHTS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {22},
Number = {2},
Pages = {103+},
Abstract = {Security sector reform - including police reform -has been an important
   element in international programmes in many post-conflict and so-called
   `fragile' states. In Central Asian states - mostly ruled by
   authoritarian regimes - the OSCE has been engaged in a variety of
   programmes to help reform the police, which have often been accused of
   abuses of human rights. There has been a significant police assistance
   programme in Kyrgyzstan, and smaller initiatives and activities have
   been implemented in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and
   Tajikistan. Most of these initiatives have failed to achieve their
   objectives; in certain cases they may have had a negative impact on the
   OSCE's credibility in the region as an organization that promotes a
   comprehensive view of security, including attention to human rights and
   civil liberties. The article suggests that external assistance to the
   security sector in authoritarian political systems poses particularly
   difficult challenges, if there is no parallel process of political
   democratisation. In addition, a complex relationship between state
   security forces and organised crime poses additional challenges to
   police reform programmes. The article suggests that the OSCE might
   usefully review its policies to improve its effectiveness in this area
   and to ensure that its approach remains consistent with its basic
   principles.},

Title = {Reconceptualising Electoral Reform},
Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {34},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {437-455},
Abstract = {This article delineates the three waves of development in the study of
   electoral reform: the systematic description and consequences of
   electoral systems; the analysis of major reform and its political
   consequences; and a more comprehensive approach to the study of
   electoral reform. It seeks to achieve two goals. The first is to shift
   attention away from the political consequences of electoral change and
   toward what takes place before the passage of reform. Beyond delineating
   what electoral reform is, the authors ask: Why does it occur? Who
   initiates the electoral reform? When, and where, does it succeed or fail
   to pass the necessary obstacles? How should we study it? They therefore
   want to analyse the determinants of electoral reform. Their second goal
   is to elaborate an agenda for future research in electoral change, and
   they do so by discussing both the reconceptualisation and the
   methodology of electoral reform research.},

Abstract = {Intended as an introduction, this article aims to highlight some of the
   lessons that stem from the different contributions that compose this
   issue on the ``politics of economization{''}. Referring to the paradox
   that is underlying this particular form of politization, we draw
   attention on three analytical figures that are found in all the
   presented studies, though at varying degrees and through different
   formulas. According to this initial inventory, we address the politics
   of economization following three dimensions: (1) in the first dimension
   they should be understood as a bypassing of politics; (2) in the second
   dimension it is necessary to understand them in their opposition to
   politics; (3) in the third dimension they are best understood as
   politics that are not spelled out as such. These three dimensions are
   referred to the concepts of ``subpolitics{''}, ``anti-politics{''} and
   ``quasi-politics{''}; we propose a definition for each of these
   dimensions.},

Abstract = {The article aims to contribute to the debate on the constitutionality of
   the Statute of Autonomy for Catalonia in force since late 2006. First,
   it examines the situation created by the lodgement of a significant
   number of direct appeals of unconstitutionality, among which stands out
   the general and massive appeal lodged by more than 50 MPs of the Popular
   Party in the Congress, who exercised the plea of unconstitutionality
   that the Spanish Constitution of 1978 confers upon the parliamentary
   minority in the opposition. Second, the article discusses the main
   implications of the Constitutional Court's judgment on the
   aforementioned appeals (STC 31/2010, hereinafter ``the judgment{''})
   from the standpoint of the constitutional doctrine, as well as from the
   standpoint of the coherence of this statement with the interpretive case
   law accumulated over the 30 years of development of the so called
   ``constitutional block{''}. Third, the piece of writing includes some
   comments on the impact of the decision upon the political and
   institutional circle around the Constitutional Court, most notably in
   the current context of arguments around the so called Statutes of
   Autonomy of ``last generation (from 2006, and thereaftee). ``
   Finally, the author reflects on the impact that the doctrinal argument,
   raised around the Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia, along with the
   judgement by the Constitutional Court, might cause on the prestige,
   reputation and functional authority of the `` supreme interpreter{''} of
   the Constitution itself (namely, the Constitutional Court). The
   conclusive paradox is described from the certainty that, although both
   Catalonia and its Statute of Autonomy could resist and overcome the
   stress test which would be brought about by the case before the
   Constitutional Court, there was ground for an even greater concern about
   the survival of the Constitutional Court's reputation, in order to
   continue its unique task as the guardian of the constitutional order.},

Title = {How do Five American Political Science Textbooks Deal with the Economic
   Dimension?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE EDUCATION},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Pages = {79-94},
Abstract = {Politics and economics interact. As a consequence, political science
   textbooks must often relate to the economic dimension-implicitly or
   explicitly. But we know very little about how these textbooks relate to
   economics. Are they merely unreflective customers of neoclassical
   economics or do they strive for a cross-disciplinary approach? An
   analysis of five American textbooks identifies two very different and
   concurrent interactions between politics and economics. The first is a
   theoretically conceived market economy in which market forces
   independently drive growth and create equilibrium, where politics has a
   rather secluded role. The second is the actually existing mixed economy,
   characterized by increased inequality, economic concentration, power,
   and environmental problems, influenced by a state forced to regulate.
   The problems of operating with such a dichotomy- and possible solutions
   to it-are being explored in the article.},

   the Statutes of second generation partnerships of the Comunidades
   Autonomas with the state, other regions and the European Union, and the
   interpretation that the STC 31/2010, in relation to the Statute of
   Catalonia, has made these developments. First, it explains the statutory
   recognition of bilateralism, compatible with multilateralism. The other
   new feature has been the recognition of the participation of the
   Autonomous Communities in the State's decisions and the appointment of
   state organs. The Constitutional Court has considered a version of the
   principle of collaboration. It is shown that the STC 31/2010 in this
   area has remained almost untouched innovations in the new Statute of
   Autonomy.},

Abstract = {In this paper, a theoretical- conceptual approach to civil society in
   the debate in Venezuela since the enactment of the Venezuelan
   Constitution of 1999 (CRBV, 1999). The term civil society is polysemic,
   complex and caters to different criteria, different ideas and different
   approaches, whether broad or restrictive, this depends on the author and
   the connotation of its own that is granted at the end, and the context
   in which is, but as the Soriano (1999), so there is no conceptual
   clarity. In response to the objectives proposed in this research,
   defines the concept from a brief reflection on the content and meaning
   of this category in the contemporary debate. Initially, it examines the
   theoretical and conceptual contemporary references general, then, is
   this particular theoretical approach to the discussion that is held to
   the inner in Venezuela by scholars of the subject and the formal legal
   treatment given to civil society in the 1999 Constitution, documents and
   interviews that are interpreted through hermeneutics.},

Title = {The quality of civil society in post-communist Eastern Germany: a
   case-study of voluntary associations in Leipzig},
Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {18},
Number = {3},
Pages = {731-750},
Abstract = {Quantitative data show the weakness of civil society in the
   post-communist countries of East-Central Europe by using such indicators
   as membership in voluntary associations. Building on this data, this
   research offers an in-depth case-study of voluntary associations in the
   Eastern German city of Leipzig in order to examine the quality of the
   existing civil society. Due to structures put in place by the local
   government to encourage citizen input in policy decisions and widespread
   democratic participation both before and after the fall of communism,
   Leipzig presents an interesting case-study in assessing the vibrancy of
   civil society, and thus democracy, in a post-communist city that appears
   to embrace ideals of citizen participation. The study, based on data
   from 23 qualitative interviews with members of citizen associations,
   local parliamentarians and city officials, explores three main issues
   that are found in the theoretical literature on associations and civil
   society: the development of civic competence; the creation of a public

   qualitative nature of this study offers a more nuanced assessment of
   civil society in Eastern Germany than the quantitative data allow. I
   conclude that there are clear deficits but also strengths in the
   development of civil society.},

Title = {Party Preferences and Electoral Reform: How Time in Government Affects
   the Likelihood of Supporting Electoral Change},
Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {34},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {568-586},
Abstract = {Most of the literature asserts that political parties rationally define
   their preference for electoral reform with respect to their possible
   gains and the balance of power between and within parties. Other
   scholars moderate this rationality, underlining the role of the
   uncertainty inherent to any change in the electoral system. This article
   shows how risk and expected gains interact. Through an analysis of the
   preferences of 84 parties in 13 different electoral reform debates, it
   shows that risk impedes parties from supporting even advantageous
   change. However, it also points out that not all parties are equally
   sensitive to risk. Parties that are dissatisfied with the current system
   are more willing to favour a reform from which they expect gains. In
   other words, dissatisfaction makes parties more seat-maximising.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to take the negative and positive
   perspectives of what is known in the literature dedicated to producing
   interpretations of Brazil as Iberism, through a reading of its mars in
   the work of Francisco Jose de Oliveira Vianna. The research aims at
   clarifying the outlook of the Iberist political practice, whose
   conservative submission by the rule of reality, moves liberalism into
   the future. The goal is to dissociate it from the deterministic
   character with which it is often associated, attempting to provide an
   understanding of the so called Iberian option highlighting its
   characteristic of choice.},
