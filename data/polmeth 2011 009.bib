Volume = {23},

Pages = {75-88},
Abstract = {The creation of formal regional cooperation in Southeast Asia is
   generally attributed to initiatives that came from countries in the
   region. In particular, the creation of the Association of Southeast
   Asian Nations (ASEAN) was a direct result of the Malaysian-Indonesian
   talks that ended Confrontation. Indeed, at the time many Asian leaders
   denied that ASEAN was the result of an outside idea or action. However,
   this position ignores the importance of Western financial aid in the
   establishment and subsequent success of ASEAN, as well as the various
   policy positions Western countries had taken since the end of the Second
   World War. This article argues that Southeast Asian regional cooperation
   was influenced by both Western and Asian policy and its development
   reflected the economic and political transformation of the Southeast
   Asian landscape that was taking shape at the time.},

Journal = {CRITICAL STUDIES ON TERRORISM},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {4},
Number = {3},
Pages = {421-429},
Abstract = {This article considers the relationship between counterterrorist
   security agencies and universities in the United Kingdom. Normally, the
   two would rarely come into contact. However, with recent government
   demand that more be done to deal with the threat of radicalisation on
   campuses, an increased link has developed between security agencies and
   universities. But when such agencies engage with universities, their
   activities must be challenged and limited by the latter. Universities
   have an important role in acting as a check and a balance to the often
   draconian mindsets of those charged with `national security'. But
   today's neo-liberal universities, conscious of their corporate images,
   may not adopt such a role. They may even end up becoming an actual
   partner in counterterrorist activity that can then, unchecked, generate
   the very radicalisation that they are supposed to help prevent.},

Abstract = {The territorial competition constitutes a reality, since the place of
   residence represents a resource and a decisive challenge in every stage

   enclose the persons in a predefined paths. In this aspect, this article
   wants to analyze the reality of the urban segregation in France that
   concerns all the society, which most visible symptoms are the rich and
   poor neighborhoods as well as the immigrant ghettos, and his reasons,
   with the emburguesamiento of the society, the selectivity of the
   residential mobility and the strategies of avoidance. In front of this
   situation, the public administrations have elaborated and implemented a
   few policies centred on the territory: the social housings, the
   duty-free zones and the zones of priority education, which have failed.
   Opposite to the lacks of these policies, it is necessary to reorientate
   and to concentrate the public action both in the infancy and in the
   adult young persons.},

Title = {Benedict Spinoza on the Naturalness of Democracy},
Journal = {CANADIAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},

Volume = {5},

Abstract = {Benedict Spinoza is arguably the first important political philosopher
   to endorse democracy as the best government. He does so primarily on the
   basis of the claim that it is the most natural regime. However, there
   are features of Spinoza's argument that complicate efforts to interpret
   his understanding of the naturalness of democracy, especially (i) the
   tension between his claims about the naturalness and rationality of
   democracy; and (ii) uncertainty about Spinoza's attitude toward the
   natural end or goal of political life. This study argues that Spinoza's
   claims about the naturalness of democracy are only fully intelligible in
   light of the connection between his metaphysics, on the one hand, and
   his conception of political right, on the other. We conclude that
   Spinoza believed the naturalness, and hence superiority, of democracy
   rests on its capacity to promote a formative purpose that includes both
   the perfection of social construction in the state and the intellectual
   and moral development of individuals.},

Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {18},

Pages = {655-681},
Abstract = {This article explores the problems facing opposition political parties
   in Russia. In order to conceptualize the conditions in which opposition
   parties operate and which determine the strategies they adopt, the
   concept of dominant party systems is used as an analytical framework.
   Ideological flexibility, access to administrative resources, and the
   ability to mobilize key socio-economic groups (key factors in the
   maintenance of one-party domination) are all features associated with
   Russia's `dominant' party, United Russia. It is argued that, whilst
   Russia is not a dominant party system along the lines of those which
   existed in Mexico and Japan, there are sufficient commonalities with
   such systems, in terms of the problems facing opposition political
   parties as to make comparison a useful exercise. The optimum strategies
   for opposition parties in dominant party systems (activist recruitment,
   ideological positioning and coalition-building) are identified and it is
   argued that these are all areas which Russian opposition parties need to
   address if they are to successfully challenge the regime and the `party
   of power', United Russia.},

Abstract = {Senators increasingly use obstructive tactics to stall or kill

   obstruction by focusing on blue slipping behavior. We find that extreme
   members who do not belong to the president's party are most likely to
   employ negative blue slips. Thus, as moderate senators continue to be
   replaced by more extreme members, senators will increasingly use
   obstructive tactics.},

Abstract = {The passage of a restrictive immigration law in Arizona in 2010
   rekindled an old debate in the United States on immigration policy and
   the role of federalism. Despite periodic constitutional controversies,
   scholars of federalism and U. S. state politics have not adequately
   explained variation in state-level policy making on immigration. The
   authors explore pressures leading to state immigration policy innovation
   and adoption in the United States. The article evaluates factors leading
   to the introduction and adoption of two types of policies: those
   dictating the cultural and economic incorporation of immigrants and
   those attempting to control their flow and settlement. Factors such as
   fiscal federalism, ethnic contact, and ethnic threat generate incentives
   for states to pass such laws. The authors compiled a comprehensive data
   set of state immigration laws from the past decade to explain how
   factors commonly associated with national immigration policy
   development-economic conditions, rates of immigration, demographics,
   party control, and political institutions-influence state-level
   immigration policy activity.},

Abstract = {Competing theoretical claims exist in the literature on the effect of
   proportionality on political trust. To date, empirical studies yielded
   mixed results. In this paper, we examine a curvilinear effect of the
   proportionality of election outcomes on political trust using data from
   the European Social Survey (2006-2009). The findings show that political
   trust is indeed highest in countries with very proportional as well as
   in countries with very disproportional election outcomes and lowest in
   countries that fall in between. Election outcomes that are more fully
   inclusive and those that provide more accountability can both lead to
   higher levels of political trust. Next to the proportionality of the
   translation of votes into seats, this study investigates a broad range
   of election outcomes that are associated with (dis)proportionality i.e.
   the effect of the number of parties in elections, parliament and
   government, voting for the winning or losing party under different
   levels of proportionality and the clarity of responsibility. (C) 2011

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the current functions of Medellin's councilpersons,
   in the context of the transformations in municipal administration, with
   the addition of organizational principles derived from the new public
   management. First, the theoretical background is introduced, i.e, the
   new public management and its implementation in Colombia and Medellin.
   Secondly, the local political context since the 80's is described with a
   special focus on the municipal Council. Thirdly, reference is made to
   the functions of the councilpersons, from their actions and strategies,
   identifying two trends: the traditional functions and management
   functions. Finally, using the evidence gathered as a basis, the
   contribution of these functions to the restructuring of the role of the
   councilpersons is discussed.},

Abstract = {This essay offers an interpretation of Kant's republicanism in light of
   the problem of political judgment. Kant is sometimes thought to base his
   conception of law on an idea of sovereignty drawn from Hobbes and
   Rousseau, which would leave little room for popular contestation of the
   state. In this essay, I reconstruct Kant's account of the rule of law by
   bringing out the importance of his theory of judgment. I argue that for
   Kant the civil condition is ultimately characterized by a contest
   between the judgment of the sovereign and the judgment of the people,
   which corresponds to the determinative and reflective employments of
   political judgment, respectively. On this view, popular sovereignty is
   ultimately located in the people's power to judge politically and
   contest publicly the state.},

Abstract = {The debt crisis in the Euro zone has caused the governments of several
   European Union countries to collapse. In Slovakia, Prime Minister Iveta
   Radicova failed because one of four coalition parties refused to agree
   to financial aid for Greece. The opposition seized the opportunity to
   exploit the European multi-level system. Just two days after the vote,
   in which it rejected the rescue package and thus forced early elections,
   the opposition then voted for the expansion of the bailout on a second
   ballot.},

Abstract = {The article discusses some aspects of continuity and change in Croatian
   society. The first part, entitled ``A Synoptic View of the Croatian
   Society Today{''}, gives a bird's-eye-view of the Croatian society -its
   social structure, dominant values, main repetitive processes:
   cooperation, competition, conflict, and main processes of social change:
   modernization and re-traditionalization. It shows the simultaneous
   effect of forces of continuity and tendencies to change. The second
   part, entitled ``Dominant Values of Croatian Society{''}, presents
   dominant values on three levels of centeredness: individual
   (individualism and utilitarianism), national (the ``heroic codex{''})
   and societal (radical egalitarianism, authoritarianism and solidarity).
   The war has not introduced significant changes into the value system,
   apart from a more prominent and generalized ``heroic codex{''}and
   solidarity.},

Abstract = {The ubiquity of data in the twenty-first century provides unprecedented
   opportunities for social science research, but it also creates troubling
   possibilities for privacy violations. The emerging field of statistical
   disclosure control (SDC) studies how data collectors and analysts can
   find an optimal solution to balancing privacy protection and data
   utility. This article introduces SDC to readers in the applied
   political. science research community and outlines its implications for
   analyzing individual-level data. The vocabulary of SDC is introduced and
   is followed with a discussion emphasizing just how easy it is to break
   almost any release of supposedly ``anonymized{''} data. The article then
   describes how SDC measures almost always destroy the ability of
   researchers to accurately analyze complex survey data. These results are
   in conflict with increasing trends toward greater transparency in the
   social sciences. A discussion of the future of SDC concludes the
   article.},

Abstract = {Scholars have argued that there is a broad gender gap in support for the
   long-ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in Japan. We uncover strong
   evidence that age, rather than gender, along with rural or urban
   location, serves as the most critical determinant of party support.
   Through logistic regression, propensity score matching and simulation
   techniques applied to four large-scale datasets; we demonstrate that age
   effects are consistent but slowly diminishing across cohorts between the
   mid-1970s and the early 2000s. As Japanese women and men age, they come
   to support the LDP at similar rates controlling for education, income
   and other demographic factors. We argue that this age gap is a result of
   socialization and redistribution and not educational levels or
   socio-economic status, as is often suggested.},

Abstract = {When the United States moved to an all-volunteer force (AVF) in 1973,
   the military was forced to compete in the national labor market without
   the cushion of conscription or draft-motivated volunteers. The Army,
   which needed to attract more than 20,000 recruits each month, turned to
   market research and advertising, began internal reform, and offered new
   benefits, portraying military service as opportunity rather than
   obligation. The turn to the labor market had political implications. As
   women and African Americans joined the military in unprecedented
   numbers, the Army served as a site of social experimentation, directly
   confronting the social change movements of the 1960s or 1970s and their
   legacies. Because an AVF requires high reenlistment rates and
   family-oriented benefits help retain soldiers, army dependents have come
   to far exceed army members, with implications for deployment, morale,
   and cost. And defining military service as labor market opportunity
   rather than citizen's obligation is a critical shift in political
   definitions of citizenship.},

Abstract = {Although there is no more iconic, stalwart, and eloquent defender of
   liberty and representative democracy than J. S. Mill, he sometimes
   endorses nondemocratic forms of governance. This article explains the
   reasons behind this seeming aberration and shows that Mill actually has
   complex and nuanced views of the transition from nondemocratic to
   democratic government, including the comprehensive and parallel
   material, cultural, institutional, and character reforms that must
   occur, and the mechanism by which they will be enacted. Namely, an
   enlightened despot must cultivate democratic virtues such as obedience,
   industriousness, spirit of nationality, and resistance to tyranny in the
   population and simultaneously prepare the way for his own demise and
   secure his own legitimacy by transitioning to the rule of law. This
   challenges recent scholarship that paints Mill's nondemocratic views as
   crudely and uncritically imperialist, because it fails to recognize and
   engage seriously with his sophisticated (if ultimately problematic)
   theory of individual and institutional development under enlightened
   colonialism.},

Abstract = {The resurgence of American civil-military relations scholarship over the
   past twenty years has been led by political scientists from the subfield
   of International Relations and American military sociologists. Samuel
   Huntington's seminal work, The Soldier and the State (1957), laid the
   foundation for considering civil-military affairs as a major influence
   on sound strategic policy. By recommending autonomy for a separate
   sphere of military operations, it also threw down the gauntlet for
   structuring a cohesive society that could encompass both liberal values
   and the military profession. To this point the political science
   subfield of American Politics has remained aloof from the fray. Were
   American Politics to engage civil-military relations in earnest, there
   would likely follow an important recasting of civil-military relations
   scholarship, with greater emphasis on the fluidity of institutional
   patterns and the kind of political concessions required from all
   parties-executive, legislative, and military-to maintain healthy
   civil-military relations under the Constitutional separation of powers.},

   exploring the philosophical issues concerning what `the market' entails
   or means for society, it then considers how liberals represent
   globalization and whether the liberal vision of `the market' is
   fracturing. Finally, it turns to the potential spaces for alternative
   forms or types of market activity designed to promote progressive social
   and economic outcomes.},

Abstract = {Previous studies examining the relationship between the media and the UK
   Parliament have emphasised a decline in the quantity and quality of
   media coverage of the House of Commons from the late 1980s onwards.
   However, such studies have focused primarily on the reporting of
   parliamentary debates in the Commons Chamber. Comparatively little
   attention has been paid to media coverage of select committees since the
   modern system was established in 1979. By using an extensive content
   analysis of 1217 newspaper articles published between 1987 and 2007, and
   holding interviews with people closely associated with committees, this
   research sheds light on quantitative trends in select committee coverage
   over two decades and provides further knowledge about the types of
   committees that receive coverage and why.},

   with a literature review of organizational politics and its implications
   to the implementation of ERP systems. The Political Strategies Framework
   which categorizes different ePolitics strategies in the cases is
   introduced. The framework is applied in the later sections of the paper
   to case study data from two companies, one in the US and one in Italy,
   that both implemented a SAP Enterprise Planning Systems (ERP) with very
   different outcomes. The discussion highlights the political dynamics in
   each case and the way in which the framework can help us understand
   these differences. The conclusion section discusses the differences
   between the political dynamics in each case and the implications from
   the findings to broader issues of research on ERP implementation and

Abstract = {International migration is one of the policy areas that Turkey has to
   accomodate in the EU accession process. For this reason, formation of
   policies towards international migrants, including providing them
   international protection, will stand first on the list of the Turkish
   public administration in the coming years. ``Draft Law on Foreigners and
   International Protection{''}, prepared in 2010, is the key indicator of
   this attitude. This study evaluates the changes which will be occured in
   Turkish public administration system through examining the draft
   proposal within the context of the Europeanization. The article
   empahizes the difficulties encountered during the approval and
   implementation process of the first unique law of international
   migration in Turkey, as well as expected transformation of the Turkish
   administrative system.},

Abstract = {The MHP won 13 percent of the vote in the June 2011 elections, which
   guaranteed it 52 seats in parliament. Ever since the 1960s, the MHP has
   operated with a vague party identity that amalgamated different, even
   contradictory, elements such as Islam, folk nationalism, secularism,
   militarism, Kemalism, statism, and even Ottomanism. However, the serious
   issues that are challenging Turkish politics today, such as
   civilian-military relations, the Ergenekon trial, Islam in the public
   sphere, the Kurdish question, the crisis of the presidential election,
   or the 2010 referendum, have made a nebulous discourse operationally
   impossible. This paper argues that the recent political polarization
   between the AK Party and the CHP put an end to the MHP's strategy and
   discourse of traditional obscurantism, causing in these last elections
   this party's unimpressive electoral performance.},

Abstract = {Causal inference and the logic of historical explanation are grounded in
   temporality. Yet the relationship between causal analysis and aspects of
   temporality, such as duration, tempo, acceleration, and timing, is often
   less clear. Using examples from analyses of institutional change and
   postcommunist regime transitions, the author argues that aspects of
   temporality allow us to predict which causal mechanisms can unfold and
   to differentiate causal sequences. Explicitly specifying the role of
   temporality can thus improve scholars' understanding of political
   mechanisms, sequences, and the processes they constitute.},

Abstract = {Constitutional courts play an increasing role in policymaking and the
   concepts of comparative politics. Traditionally, research has focused on
   the Judicialization hypothesis for European courts. This article argues
   that there is a major research gap regarding justices' preferences,
   intra- and inter-institutional rules and that it is necessary to move
   beyond the Judicialization hypothesis to integrate courts in concepts of
   comparative politics. It outlines four theoretical and methodological
   challenges for future research on constitutional courts.},

Title = {Realist-normative power Europe? Explaining EU policies toward Lebanon
   from an IR perspective},
Journal = {COMPARATIVE EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4-5, SI},
Pages = {562-580},
Month = {SEP-DEC},
Abstract = {This article seeks to explain the relationship between the European
   Union (EU) and one of its Middle Eastern neighbors: Lebanon. By
   conducting an in-depth empirical single case study and engaging in
   competitive theory testing, this article shows that the EU in Lebanon
   behaves at the same time as a normative and a realist power. This
   article challenges both the scholarship on the EU that sees the EU as a
   normative power as well as scholarship that focuses on structural
   neorealism to explain the EU's role in its neighborhood. This article
   adopts an approach that is different from the mainstream approaches in
   two ways. First, it focuses on the entire set of policies that the EU
   has implemented or not in Lebanon. Second, it provides an in-depth case
   study centered on the interaction between the EU and Lebanon, while also
   looking at the regional dynamics and at the domestic tensions within
   Lebanon. By doing so, it shows that the EU is a `realist-normative'
   power in the specific case of Lebanon. Thus, these two frameworks are a
   false dichotomy and the argument shall be tested on other cases to make
   it generalizable. This suggests that the constructivist-realist divide
   coexists in practice. Comparative European Politics (2011) 9, 562 580.

Abstract = {Controversies over Mexican immigrants and undocumented aliens in Arizona
   and elsewhere show the need for fresh approaches to immigration. The
   ``principle of constituted identities{''} holds that the more a
   government has coercively constituted the identities of non-citizens in
   ways that have made having certain relationships to it fundamental to
   their capacities to lead free and meaningful lives, the greater the
   obligations that government has to facilitate those relationships-all
   else being equal. The U.S. has coercively constituted the identities of
   many persons of Mexican descent, inside and outside its boundaries, in
   ways that have fostered aspirations for dual economic, cultural, and
   political ``citizenships.{''} It has also shaped the identities, values,
   and interests of many whites in immigrant-receiving states in ways that
   make Mexican immigrants seem threatening, even as it has made those
   states pay most of the costs of absorbing immigrants. In consequence,
   the U. S. should adopt policies that give priority to Mexicans in
   immigration and that facilitate dual citizenships, while providing more
   aid to immigrant-receiving states.},

Abstract = {This article examines the electoral presence of women in federal,
   provincial and municipal governments. It casts doubt on the notion of a
   municipal advantage-a prevalent theme in the women in politics
   literature-and suggests, instead, that female legislators are
   increasingly present in roughly equivalent proportions across all three
   levels of government. Unlike prior analyses that have tended to focus on
   a limited number of provinces, a distinct time period or a select group
   of larger urban centres, this article uses longitudinal data that
   encompass all provinces and territories, as well as nearly all of
   Canada's 3750 municipalities. The findings demonstrate that female
   legislators often find greater electoral success at the higher levels of
   government but that the proportion of women elected rarely exceeds 25
   per cent at any level. The article thus challenges a pervasive theme in
   the literature on women in politics.},

   the social needs? Which is the relation between social welfare,
   demercantilization and justiciability of social rights? Higher level of
   activism in social rights, is a solution to the lack of access of the
   population to the goods and social services? Is this a way to break the
   barriers to canalize unsatisfied social demands in the public agenda?
   The current movement in favor of justiciablity social rights tends, in
   some cases, to emphasize the elimination of its differences with civil
   and political rights. Likewise, the incapability of the classic
   democratic institutions to face issues linked with poverty, inequality
   and exclusion is the argument that urges to affected groups to demand
   the judicial intervention in those cases of lack of access to goods and
   social services. Under these premises, we first propose to aknowledge,
   the conceptual specificity of ESCR. Secondly, we raise critical
   approaches on justiciability of the social rights. A further objective
   is to establish common issues between the collective provision of
   satisfactores and to the conditions of political and legal demands
   concerning about individual rights.},

Abstract = {China's profile in the nuclear nonproliferation regime is changing at a
   crucial time. The regime is under considerable internal and external
   strain as a result of eroding international support and trends in
   vertical and horizontal nuclear proliferation. While China's
   nonproliferation agenda and approach differ in some respects from those
   of other key actors, the gap separating China from the established
   drivers of efforts to address horizontal nuclear proliferation in terms
   of the objectives, institutions, and approach of the nonproliferation
   regime is diminishing, and there is considerable potential for China to
   contribute to the capacity of the regime to adapt to changing
   requirements. The Asia-Pacific region features both as the area of
   greatest nonproliferation concern to China and as the area where
   proliferation concerns are most likely to spur the further qualitative
   development of Chinese nonproliferation policy.},

Abstract = {The mathematics model of economic variables has been applied by relative
   success in the last years (Markowich, 2007), especially for the wealth
   (Chukwu, 1998) and using differential equations (Zhang, 2005). In
   (Chukwu, 2003) one applied for the above mentioned modeling the
   differential equation in partial derivatives. The wealth or for such
   effects there was defined as the sum of direct investment in the economy
   of the republic + capital goods + the product of population used by
   wages + the quotient of the quantification of the managerial skills
   divided between the population. This paper presents a proposal to model
   somehow the level of economic growth that can be obtained from proper
   management of commercial operciones through the FTA with the EU.},

Abstract = {The relationship between median citizen opinion on the left-right
   dimension, as measured in the Eurobarometer and European Electoral
   Studies series of surveys, and the left-right positions of governments
   in West European democracies is explored to gain a fuller understanding
   of how and to what extent median opinion may influence what governments
   subsequently set out to do. The analysis allows for the possibility that
   measurement may not be equivalent across countries and surveys, that the
   data may contain significant dynamic effects, and that different
   countries may exhibit different relationships between the two variables.
   The analyses show that changes in the citizen median generally produce
   larger changes in government position, the size depending mainly on the
   proportionality of the electoral system.},

Abstract = {Since the Civil War, the president's party has lost seats in the U.S.
   House of Representatives in all but three midterm election cycles. Many
   attribute this pattern to ``balancing{''} by moderate voters who prefer
   a Democratic Congress when Republicans control the White House, and vice
   versa. Although a number of scholars have tested the balancing
   hypothesis, the debate remains unsettled. We argue that the U.S. states
   provide an excellent way to analyze the issue further. Similar to the
   national government, states feature an executive and (in most cases) a
   bicameral legislature whose members come up for election in both
   gubernatorial and state midterm years. If voters balance, one should
   observe such behavior in state elections when an executive's
   partisanship is known and a legislative choice is necessary. We examine
   state legislative elections from 1978 to 2009 and find evidence
   consistent with the balancing hypothesis.},

Abstract = {This exploratory research note theorises about and tests the factors
   that have affected legislative productivity in France from 1960 to 2007.
   The empirical model accounts for intra-parliamentary dynamics such as
   the parties' ideological placement on a left-right scale, the
   government's seat strength, coalition governments and intensity of
   opposition to the majority in the National Assembly. The model also
   considers features unique to the Fifth Republic, such as judicial review
   of bills by the Constitutional Council and presidents' `sacking' of
   prime ministers. External factors include strikes and social movements,
   as well as prime ministers' and presidents' job approval that are
   posited to impact lawmaking. The results of the analysis suggest how the
   model developed in this research may be extended to future analyses of
   parliamentary activity in the Fifth Republic.},

Abstract = {Differences in the number of seats that similar vote shares can deliver
   make some votes more marginal than others. In multi-member district
   systems, high-marginal-return votes are very volatile and research has
   assumed that parties do not go after them. This paper rejects this
   assumption, introducing a theory of marginal vote seeking across
   multi-member districts. By leveraging a novel mathematical algorithm and
   a cross sectional data set, we find evidence that parties seek marginal
   votes in these systems despite their volatility. In the case of the
   poverty alleviation programs used here, their use to attempt to secure
   marginal votes overwhelms the program's poverty alleviation goals.
   Estimates suggest that a district's share of a program's budget can
   increase by as much as 8\% simply because of this district's likelihood
   of delivering marginal votes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {The polarization of the political and social environment over the past
   four decades has provided citizens with clearer cues about how their
   core political predispositions (e.g., group interests, core values, and
   party identification) relate to their issue opinions. A robust and
   ongoing scholarly debate has involved the different ways in which the
   more polarized environment affects mass opinion. Using heteroskedastic
   regression, this paper examines the effect of the increasingly polarized
   environment on the variability of citizens' policy opinions. We find
   that citizens today base their policy preferences more closely upon
   their core political predispositions than in the past. In addition, the
   predicted error variances also allow us to directly compare two types of
   mass polarization-issue distance versus issue consistency-to determine
   the independent effects each has on changes in the distribution of mass
   opinion.},

Abstract = {Currently, a total of twenty-eight states are challenging the
   constitutionality of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
   (PPACA) in federal court. Their principal claims are that the PPACA's
   regulation of the states violates their independent sovereignty, and
   that the Act's minimum coverage requirement exceeds Congress's
   enumerated powers. This litigation is immensely important, as it
   concerns a hugely significant statute and raises fundamental questions
   of constitutional federalism. This article offers a detailed description
   of the claims raised by the states and analyzes their plausibility under
   current law. It then addresses the likelihood that the Supreme Court
   will ultimately sustain the states' arguments and invalidate the PPACA.},

Abstract = {The relationship between Turkey (and its predecessor, the Ottoman
   Empire) and Europe has been long, often tense or openly hostile, and is
   in some senses fundamental to the identities and development of each;
   this relationship also adds a considerable burden of suspicion to
   Turkey's current aim of joining the European Union (EU). This essay
   examines these propositions by providing an account of the history of
   the relationship and of Europe's recent, conditional approach to Turkish
   accession to the EU. While accepting that much remains to he done at the
   institutional level to bring Turkey into alignment with EU norms, this
   paper argues that Turkish accession is a historic opportunity for Europe
   that it should not squander. Despite mixed signals, further development
   of Turkey's democracy along the path to Europe is the most likely
   course. The story is not ``never-ending{''}, but the end will not come
   quickly.},

Abstract = {Employing a critical race methodology focused on the notion of law as a
   hegemonic form of truth telling, I examine the findings and
   recommendations of the commission Of inquiry into the death of Neil
   Stonechild to show how certain stories were told (or not) through legal
   narratives, and how, in such a judicial forum, specific narratives were
   framed as more legitimate than others. This forum reproduces colonial
   assumptions of the Aboriginal ``other,{''} as deserving less priority in
   the realm of justice-and. the Aboriginal voice as illegitimate compared
   to legal actors, thereby weakening notions of equal access to justice in
   Canada. I argue that the Neil Stonechild inquiry, while important, falls
   short in advancing justice by failing to address underlying racial
   factors and motivations, thereby providing an incomplete picture of what
   happened. As a consequence, the dominant mythology of Canada as a
   non-racist nation remains unchallenged, to the detriment of meaningful
   social change.},

Abstract = {The mass media are assigned an important role in political campaigns on
   popular votes. This article asks how the press communicates political
   issues to citizens during referendum campaigns, and whether some minimal
   criteria for successful public deliberation are met. The press coverage
   of all 24 ballot votes on welfare state issues from 1995 to 2004 in
   Switzerland is examined, distinguishing seven criteria to judge how news
   coverage compares to idealized notions of the media's role in the
   democratic process: coverage intensity, time for public deliberation,
   balance in media coverage, source independence and inclusiveness,
   substantive coverage, and spatial homogeneity. The results of our
   quantitative analysis suggest that the press does fulfil these normative
   requirements to a reasonable extent and that fears about biased or
   deceitful media treatment of ballot issues are not well-founded.
   However, some potential for optimizing the coverage of referendum
   campaigns by the Swiss press does exist.},

Abstract = {In view of the impossibility of going through, case by case, the
   millions of annual tax payments concerning the most important taxable
   activities, citizens are faced with the responsibility of knowing,
   interpreting and applying the complex, ever-changing and even, at times,
   deficient tax regulations. This reduction in administrative activity
   should be compensated for by maximising the responsibilities of
   informing and assisting taxpayers. For this reason, and taking into
   account that information and communication are basic obligations, it
   would seem evident that they constitute one of the administrative areas
   most susceptible to transformation by the incorporation of Information
   and Communication Technologies. This in much the same way as it is
   possible to consider that the consequences of the incorporation of the
   new media have proved to be a turning point.},

Abstract = {Presidential character affects decision making. It influences cognition,
   deliberation, and judgment. It also contributes to beliefs and
   interpersonal relations that shape the process and product of
   presidential decision-making process. President Obama's decisions on the
   war in Afghanistan and health care reform made during his first 13
   months in office are consistent with his general character orientation,
   basic beliefs, and operating style, although they show different
   dominant attributes. The Afghanistan decision reflects Obama's incisive,
   calculating, consensus-oriented style; it also demonstrates his need to
   fight back when he feels threatened. His health care decision in the
   aftermath of the 2010 Senate election in Massachusetts shows his
   determination, perseverance, and political skills; it also indicates his
   willingness to go the extra mile when he personalizes an issue.},

Abstract = {Governments often extol the policy refining functions of second

   balance these policy refinement functions with their ability to pass
   legislation in the second chamber. I examine government defeats in the

   likelihood of defeat. Using an original dataset, I find that strong veto
   authority creates incentives for governments to act strategically to
   avoid defeats (even when facing a friendly chamber), while opposition
   majorities and a weaker ability to sanction members who deviate from
   their party's position increase the likelihood of defeat.},

Volume = {50},

Abstract = {This article challenges the common assumption that the European Union
   (EU) has little power over taxation. Based on a comprehensive analysis
   of EU tax legislation and European Court of Justice (ECJ) tax
   jurisprudence from 1958 to 2007, the article shows that the EU exerts
   considerable regulatory control over the Member States' taxing power and
   imposes tighter constraints on Member State taxes than the American
   federal government imposes on American state taxation. These findings
   contradict the standard account of the EU as a regulatory polity that
   specialises in apolitical issues of market creation and leaves control
   of highly politicised core functions of government (defence, taxation,
   social security, education, etc.) to the Member States; despite strong
   treaty safeguards, national tax autonomy is undermined by EU regulation.},

Abstract = {Political competition lies at the core of representative democracy. Yet,
   uncompetitive elections and uncontested races are widespread in the
   United States, particularly at the state level. In this article, we
   analyze the consequences of uncontested elections on lawmaking activity.
   Our primary hypothesis is that legislators who run unopposed are less
   active lawmakers than those who were selected through competitive
   elections. Studying roll-call vote participation and bill introduction
   and enactment for most of the U.S. states for 1999-2000, we find that
   state legislators elected in unopposed elections perform more poorly
   compared to their colleagues elected in competitive contests.},

Abstract = {In this work, the author develops and explains a set of economic models
   under the decision theoretic framework to conceptualize the requisite
   levels of investment in the defense against cyber terrorism. This paper
   begins with a naive model of cyber defense, on which the author
   progressively implements aspects of layered defense and domain
   conditionality to investigate practicable investment levels for
   countering cyber terrorism related risks. The proposed model
   characterizes the minimum budget below which a defending nation cannot
   feasibly contemplate to deploy more than one layer of defense against
   cyber terrorism. Beyond budgetary considerations, the paper also
   calculates the relative technological capabilities that the defending
   nation must possess to deploy a detection regime behind the first layer
   of protection regime. Finally, the author calculates and presents the
   optimal bifurcation of budget between the prevention and detection
   regimes should the defending nation possesses adequate funds to deploy
   layered defense in cyber terrorism.},

Abstract = {We report on majority voting experiments where subjects are randomly
   assigned identities in common with a candidate. However, subjects
   sometimes receive a financial incentive from voting contrary to their
   identity. We vary the size of the incentive as well as information
   voters have about the advantage of the incentive. We find that subjects
   are influenced by their assigned identities, and the effect is stronger
   when voters have less information. Nevertheless, financial incentives
   reduce this influence when voters have full information. Our results
   suggest that identity may have an important affect on voter choices in
   elections where incentives or information are low.},

Abstract = {A successful reform of any system of governance must be well informed of
   the system's own functional logic. In the context of its
   democratization, this article explores whether the institutional
   arrangement of the European Union has developed or behaves more like a
   presidential than a parliamentary system. Building on that, the authors
   re-examine the opportunities and feasibility of realizing that model as
   a step towards more democracy in European governance.},

Volume = {41},

Abstract = {This study evaluates the extent of party-system extremism in thirty-one
   electoral democracies as a function of electoral-system proportionality.
   It uses data from the Comparative Studies of Electoral Systems project
   to estimate the extent of party-system compactness or dispersion across
   polities and to determine whether more proportional systems foster
   greater ideological divergence among parties. Electoral system
   characteristics most associated with party-system compactness in the
   ideological space are investigated. The empirics show that more
   proportional systems support greater ideological dispersion, while less
   proportional systems encourage parties to cluster nearer the centre of
   the electoral space. This finding is maintained in several sub-samples
   of national elections and does not depend on the inclusion of highly
   majoritarian systems (such as the United Kingdom).},

Abstract = {Considering a candidacy for public office involves pondering the
   courageous step of going before an electorate and facing potential
   examination, scrutiny, and rejection. Anyone who contemplates running
   for office, therefore, must answer a series of questions. Is the time
   right to inject my family into the political arena? Where am I in terms
   of my professional goals? Do I know enough about the issues and the
   political system to run for office? Am I in sync with my potential
   constituents on the issues that matter most? Have electoral gatekeepers
   indicated support for my foray into politics? Do I really want to take
   part in a political process that is so often associated with
   self-interest, corruption, and cynicism? In short, a variety of
   personal, professional, and political circumstances-circumstances that
   often change over time-undoubtedly affect the extent to which someone

Abstract = {Despite ample evidence of preelection volatility in vote intentions in
   new democracies, scholars of comparative politics remain skeptical that
   campaigns affect election outcomes. Research on the United States
   provides a theoretical rationale for campaign effects, but shows little
   of it in practice in presidential elections because candidates' media
   investments are about equal and voters' accumulated political knowledge
   and partisan attachments make them resistant to persuasive messages. I
   vary these parameters by examining a new democracy where voters' weaker
   partisan attachments and lower levels of political information magnify
   the effects of candidates' asymmetric media investments to create large
   persuasion effects. The findings have implications for the
   generalizability of campaign effects theory to new democracies, the
   development of mass partisanship, candidate advertising strategies, and
   the specific outcome of Mexico's hotly contested 2006 presidential
   election. Data come primarily from the Mexico 2006 Panel Study.},

Abstract = {The stakes of political conflict involve contending values and issue
   definitions as well as policy. Welfare reform was the most important
   change in American domestic policy since civil rights. Its significance
   hinges crucially on how participants understood the issue, but existing
   research fails to resolve what their perceptions were. Most accounts
   suggest that welfare reform was an ideological contest concerning the
   proper scope of government, but there are other views. This study gauges
   the welfare agenda rigorously by coding speakers in congressional
   hearings on the basis of how they framed the issue and the position they
   took on it during the six chief episodes of welfare reform that occurred
   between 1962 and 1996. The reform efforts aroused four distinct
   divisions. Over time, positions moved rightward, but more important, the
   dominant issue changed: The ideological debate about government was
   overtaken by a more practical debate about how to manage welfare. This
   is the first study to track the substantive meaning of any issue in
   Congress over an extended period of time using hearing witnesses and a
   preset analytic scheme.},

Abstract = {Drawing upon our voter survey, recent election results, voter roll-off,
   and campaign finances, this study's findings join an expanding body of
   research that questions the shift away from partisan to nonpartisan
   judicial elections. Specifically, this article examines voter
   information about and voter participation in North Carolina's appellate
   races in light of its move to nonpartisan elections combined with
   mandated distribution of voter guides. Some findings were expected: the
   voter guides were well received, party affiliation remained important in
   these races, and voter roll-off increased significantly. Competition did
   not appear to affect roll-off in the races analyzed in this article. The
   most surprising finding was that a strong majority of our survey
   respondents wanted candidates' party affiliation back on the ballot,
   even though surveys have cited strong public support for
   ``nonpartisan{''} judicial elections.},

Abstract = {Two views on the impact of church-state relations on civil society draw
   competing conclusions. According to the first view, state support of
   religion encourages faith-based social capital by providing vital
   resources for religious organizations. In contrast, the competing view
   holds that state support of religion crowds out religious civic
   engagement, as responsibilities are transferred from citizens to the
   state. Based on a sample of twenty-four European countries and combining
   a wide range of church-state indicators with survey data, it is evident
   that state support of religion does not foster faith-based social
   capital. Rather, overwhelming evidence shows that government involvement
   in religion weakens religious membership, volunteering, and donations.},

Abstract = {Why do we witness variation in the level of judicial attention to rights
   litigation across countries and over time? Traditional explanations
   emphasize the constitutional recognition of rights, judicial leadership,
   and the development in society of a sophisticated ``support structure
   for legal mobilization,{''} as key covariates of these phenomena. Yet,
   there is a dearth of quantitative empirical analyses that evaluate these
   explanations comparatively and actually test their relative influence on
   trends of rights litigation and protection. Perhaps the most important
   lacuna in this regard is an assessment of the influence of institutional
   conditions and modifications in bringing about or facilitating the
   transformation of the rights scene. To contribute to closing this gap,
   this article empirically assesses the short and long term impacts of
   ideology, support structure, and institutional protection on changes in
   the presence of rights litigation in the dockets of the High Courts of
   several democracies with Common Law systems. To this purpose, we perform
   time-series analyses on data from the High Courts Judicial Database and
   the Spaeth U.S. Supreme Court Database. Our analyses indicate that once
   one properly models temporal effects, increasing support structures do
   not influence increases in rights litigation. Rather, specific
   institutional changes and ideological influences play a significant role
   in the High Courts' attention to individual rights.},

Abstract = {Newly independent Republic of Moldova joined the World Bank and the IMF
   in 1992. The World Bank designated it a `middle income' country, a
   status it retained for Bretton Woods lending until 1997. The middle
   income designation implied that the government of Moldova was not
   eligible for concessionary finance from the multilateral and major
   bilateral development agencies. After demonstrating that assigning
   middle income status to Moldova was a mistake, this article investigates
   the consequences. A simple procedure is used for calculating
   counterfactual scenarios of Moldova being assigned low income status in
   the early 1990s. The counterfactual scenarios suggest that the
   development and welfare costs of the mistake were extremely high: a much
   greater fall in income per capita than would otherwise have been the
   case, with associated increases in headcount poverty and lower life
   expectancy. Had Moldova been designated a low income country in the
   early 1990s, by the mid-2000s it would have been a middle income country
   instead of the poorest in Europe.},

Abstract = {The authors show that the number of lobbyists active in a given issue
   area is driven not only by social mobilizations and economic trends but
   also by government activity. The effect of government spending is
   smaller than that of congressional interest as reflected in the number
   of hearings. Much lobbying is in response to regulations, not budgets.
   The authors augment their analysis by considering indicators of
   presidential activities. In areas where the president is traditionally
   active, presidential activity is shown to divert lobbying away from
   Congress, reducing overall lobbying levels. The authors find strong
   support for the congressional demand model of lobbying.},

Abstract = {For decades, political scientists have been asking how political
   jurisdictions are formed and reshaped. Nevertheless, studies of local
   government jurisdictional formation are few and often plagued with
   endogeneity since the formation of jurisdictions cannot be separated
   from sorting effects. In this article, the unique case of the Danish
   structural reform is utilised to overcome endogeneity due to
   migration-related sorting by studying patterns of municipal
   amalgamations. In the recent Danish reform, 239 of 271 municipal
   entities were forced to amalgamate simultaneously, while who actually
   amalgamated with whom was left entirely to negotiations between the
   respective municipalities. Applying logistical regression to a dataset
   where the unit of analysis is dyads of municipalities allows the
   construction of a relational model for estimating the effect of
   different political and societal variables on the likelihood of
   amalgamation. Societal connectedness, population size and geography are
   important predictors of amalgamation patterns, while political and
   economic homogeneity between municipalities does not appear to matter
   much.},

Abstract = {Although scholars have long been interested in how context shapes racial
   attitudes, research in this area has fallen short of a consensus.
   Instead, the results span a wide range, with some studies finding that
   racial understanding is promoted by intergroup contact whereas others
   claim that racial and ethnic outgroups are perceived as a threat to
   economic and political interests. These varying results arise from
   research rooted in different conceptualizations of context. Our analysis
   is unique in the attention we pay to the measure of context for our
   particular data set. Employing a sociodemographic definition of
   neighborhood social context, we find that contextual socioeconomic
   status plays a critical role in mediating the effects of intergroup
   contact on racial attitudes. These contacts are more likely to produce
   racial harmony in high-status neighborhoods than in neighborhoods marked
   by low income and low levels of education.},

Abstract = {Increasing politicization in EU member states about European issues can
   be expected to strengthen the impact of attitudes towards Europe on vote
   choice in European Parliament (EP) elections. At the same time this
   impact is likely to vary between voters and contexts as a function of
   political information. This study explores the role of political
   information in explaining individual and contextual heterogeneity in the
   degree of EU issue voting. Using a two-step hierarchical estimation
   procedure to explore both individual and contextual variation, we show
   that while EU issue voting in the 2009 EP elections is only slightly
   more pronounced among the politically sophisticated, it is clearly more
   extensive in contexts that provide higher levels of political
   information on European matters. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Although previous studies have concluded that, in comparative terms,
   Portuguese citizens exhibit low levels of social, value and partisan
   left-right attitude anchoring, the truth is that the items used in these
   studies are rather limited. Moreover, the meaning attributed by voters
   to each ideological camp was never studied. This study seeks to overcome
   these limitations. The article reiterates that in a comparative
   perspective, Portugal does exhibit low levels of left-right attitude
   anchoring. This is the point of departure of the article and also, it is
   argued, a good reason to try to further understand this case and extract
   from it inferences about similar cases. One of this study's major
   findings is that the meanings attributed to the left-right divide are
   not clear and structured; moreover, this lack of clarity is positively
   correlated with low levels of media exposure, education and left-right
   self-placement. Although the article tests hypotheses about how
   different groups (manual workers versus other social classes; older
   versus younger cohorts; post-materialists versus other value groups)
   might give different meanings to the left-right divide, the major
   finding is that media exposure and education are in any case the crucial
   factors explaining the more or less structured meanings for ideological
   conflicts. Comparative European Polities (2011) 9, 145-167.

Abstract = {In 1993, after 38 years of single-party control, more than 20\% of
   Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) House of Representatives
   members left the party to form new alternatives and create an anti-LDP
   coalition government. However, despite substantial popular support, the
   new parties attracted few subnational politicians. The effect of this
   lack of subnational party switching was substantial since the relatively
   small pool of subnational defectors meant that the new parties had
   difficulty forming the strong subnational bases of support that would
   help them to compete with the LDP in the future. In this paper, we
   consider why so few subnational politicians were willing to switch to
   these new party alternatives. Using case studies and conditional logit
   analysis of party affiliation pattern among prefectural assembly members
   in Japan, we find that party switching was most common among subnational
   politicians who had powerful patrons who had also left the LDP and had
   maintained especially good access to central government largesse. We
   also find that subnational politicians from urban areas, which depend
   less upon central government pork, were considerably less likely to
   switch parties, than their rural counterparts. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {The timing of message delivery in political campaigns is a key component
   of strategy. Yet studies that examine the impact of message timing on
   political behavior are surprisingly rare. Although one recent study
   finds that appeals delivered closer to Election Day will be most
   effective (Nickerson, American Journal of Political Science
   51(2):269-282, 2007), methodological considerations render this
   conclusion tentative and suggest the impact of message timing remains an
   open question. In this paper I report the results of a randomized field
   experiment designed to compare the mobilization effects of nonpartisan
   messages delivered via commercial phone banks at different points during
   a campaign cycle. The results of the experiment, conducted during the
   November 2005 municipal elections in Rochester, New York, suggest calls
   delivered early on during a campaign cycle can also be effective.},

Journal = {STATE POLITICS \& POLICY QUARTERLY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Over the past 30 years, the U.S. states have increased their
   participation as amici curiae significantly, in addition to winning more
   of their cases as direct parties. However, little attention has been
   paid to the factors that cause amici participation rates to vary among
   the states. The author examines the decision of state attorneys general
   (AGs) to initiate or join amicus curiae briefs in all 253 U.S. Supreme
   Court criminal procedure cases from 1990 through 2001. He hypothesizes
   that AGs are motivated largely by their own policy preferences and by
   their motivation to get reelected. Because amicus briefs are not
   particularly high-profile policy tools, reelection motivations ought to
   be demonstrated through responsiveness to elites in state government.
   The findings provide less support for this idea and more support for the
   idea that state AGs follow their own policy preferences through amicus
   participation.},

Abstract = {The corporate offensive was the main driving force in the neoliberal
   transformation of Mexico as it was in the United States and Canada. But
   in Mexico the corporate power bloc had to change the political order to
   achieve its hegemonic aspirations and desired policy changes. While the
   top bourgeoisie have been able to achieve more direct control of the
   state, they have not been able to establish a stable system of
   domination. The rise of bourgeois hegemony in Mexico is fragile. But the
   working class has not yet been able to find its voice and break free of
   the bonds of Mexico's old statelinked unions or state system of labour
   repression in general. However, the on-going hardships imposed by
   neoliberalism, the fragile legitimacy of the new political regime, and
   the surviving popular traditions of revolutionary struggle point to a
   renewal of a class-based popular fight-back sooner rather than later.},

Abstract = {This article examines intersectional praxis via a focus on what
   constitutes relevant axes of difference. The author argues that a
   discussion of relevance should focus on two important issues: (1) which
   categories are of analytic importance and (2) those categories that
   activists consider relevant. This approach allows for activist debates
   over the most important social divisions in society while establishing
   some minimal number of axes that must be included to qualify activism as
   intersectional. In the Uruguayan case, gender and class constitute
   minimally important axes of difference; however, race and, less
   centrally, sexuality and ability constitute central points of debate.},

Abstract = {Why, when faced with similar conditions of weakening central control, do
   some institutions of state security fragment into autonomous agents of
   organized violence whereas others cohere around coercive rent seeking
   without challenging the central government? Focusing on Tajikistan and
   Uzbekistan, this article explains these divergent state security
   outcomes as a consequence of resource concentrations and patronage
   pressures that influence the political elites who leverage local offices
   of state security. The article finds that privatizing violence within
   state apparatuses of Tajikistan and Uzbekistan took very different forms
   in the 1990s.},

Title = {The Externalities of Strong Social Capital: Post-Tsunami Recovery in
   Southeast India},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CIVIL SOCIETY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Pages = {81-99},
Abstract = {Much research has implied that social capital functions as an
   unqualified `public good', enhancing governance, economic performance,
   and quality-of-life. Scholars of disaster have extended this concept to
   posit that social capital provides non-excludable benefits to whole
   communities after major crises. Using qualitative methods to analyse
   data from villages in Tamil Nadu, India following the 2004 Indian Ocean
   tsunami, this article demonstrates that high levels of social capital
   simultaneously provided strong benefits and equally strong negative
   externalities, especially to those already on the periphery of society.
   In these villages, high levels of social capital reduced barriers to
   collective action for members of the uur panchayats (hamlet councils)
   and parish councils, speeding up their recovery and connecting them to
   aid organizations, but at the same time reinforced obstacles to recovery
   for women, Dalits, migrants, and Muslims. These localized findings have
   important implications for academic studies of social capital and policy
   formation for future disasters and recovery schemes.},

Volume = {31},
Number = {2},
Pages = {227-245},
Abstract = {The popularity of the concept of `hegemony' in political analysis has
   been as extensive as the criticism of its implications. For example, its
   assumption of a necessary homogenization of the normative space and its
   neglect to the resistance processes underlying any apparent consensus.
   This article seeks to interpret the concept in such a way that it
   responds to these objections and, additionally, that it can be
   operationalized as a model for understanding processes of formation,
   expansion and destruction of consensus in modern societies. In order to
   do this, it relies on a comprehension of political action as a kind of
   communication based on arguments, aimed at obtaining a majority
   recognition, but whose effectiveness which can be shown through some
   concepts of argumentation theory is always gradual and fragmentary.},

   Multilevel Model of Internal Political Efficacy},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {73},
Number = {1},
Pages = {216-231},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Some roots of political inequality are planted early in life through
   linked disparities in individual background and sense of political
   agency and efficacy. Education often exacerbates these early political
   advantages. This article uses data from a study of undergraduates to
   examine whether some types of political learning can promote a sense of
   political confidence equitably boosting efficacy for all without making
   the ``political haves{''} come out farther ahead. Multilevel analysis
   examines the role of their socioeconomic status, civic resources, and
   sociopolitical learning for internal efficacy achievement. The findings
   identify sociopolitical learning mechanisms that differently interact
   with individual background to contribute to political efficacy and
   political equality: experiences in a politically active community,
   acquiring skills for political action, engaging in political discourse,
   and inclusion in collaborative pluralist contexts. These aspects of
   political learning can enhance efficacy and reduce the influence of
   largely unchosen political advantages, creating an alternative pathway
   to political empowerment.},

Abstract = {The aim of the paper is the analysis of the determinants for support of
   economic and social policy in Austria. Emphasis was placed on the role
   of the determinants self-interest, ideology and knowledge. Especially
   the consideration and analysis of the role of knowledge is the main
   novelty of this study. On the basis of a representative survey of the
   Austrian population the results of the study clearly indicate that
   self-interest is the main driving force for support. Dependent on
   individual levels of knowledge the relevance of self-interest is
   expressed by subjective utility or by political ideologies. Persons with
   a high level of knowledge base their decision predominantly on the
   expected utility while persons with a lower level of knowledge base
   their decision predominantly upon ideological positions.},

Abstract = {This article examines the ideational dimension of federalism and its
   consequences for the analysis of policy development. With this objective
   in mind, the article offers an explanation for Canada's rejection of the
   two main aspects of the `Australian model' of equalisation: the
   assessment of expenditure needs and the existence of an arms-length
   commission to determine payments. As argued, the ideological prevalence
   of provincial autonomy in Canada explains why federal officials opted to
   reject the `Australian model' as they prepared to establish the
   country's program and why subsequent reforms never introduced a
   needs-assessment dimension or created an arms-length agency to
   administer equalisation. At the theoretical level, this article shows
   how ideational factors can shape policy outcomes.},

Abstract = {Neoliberal policies generated the conditions for the Great Recession, an
   economic downturn that hit the housing and construction industries

   openings for states and localities to criminalize and make visible the
   unauthorized where they live, work, and move about in their everyday
   lives. This increasing criminalization of the undocumented in both labor
   markets and civil society creates new risks and vulnerabilities to
   deportation, making it more difficult and dangerous for the unauthorized
   to continue to live in and work in the shadows of the global cities,
   rural farms, and slaughterhouses of the United States.},

Abstract = {This article summarizes a study on the social conditions of low-incomers
   in the province of Salzburg. In addition to a structural analysis of all
   employments with a maximum monthly gross income of Euro 1500 that were
   reported to the ``Salzburger Gebietskrankenkasse{''} in 2007, a
   representative survey of low-incomers was carried out on the basis of
   telephone interviews. Finally, in-depth interviews with ten persons were
   completed. The results are also relevant for the political level: in
   Salzburg - depending on the definition of the term of low-incomers -
   between 20 and 50 percent of all employees are so-called low-incomers.
   These figures show that this does not only represent a marginal
   phenomenon, but is an issue that concerns mainstream society.},

Abstract = {Is liberalism adaptable enough to the ecological agenda to deal
   satisfactorily with the challenges of anthropogenic climate change while
   leaving its normative foundations intact? Compatibilists answer yes;
   incompatibilists say no. Comparing such answers, this article argues
   that it is not discrete liberal principles which impede adapatability,
   so much as the constructivist model (exemplified in Rawls) of what
   counts as a valid normative principle. Constructivism has both normative
   and ontological variants, each with a realist counterpart. I argue that
   normative constructivism in the Rawlsian mode, whatever its strengths
   elsewhere, is markedly ill-equipped to deal with the particular
   normative challenges posed by climate change - and that that these
   doubts holds regardless of which stance is adopted as its ontological
   corollary.},

Title = {The Politics of Regulation: From New Institutionalism to New Governance},
Booktitle = {ANNUAL REVIEW OF POLITICAL SCIENCE, VOL 14},
Series = {Annual Review of Political Science},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {14},
Pages = {107-129},
Abstract = {The study of the politics of regulation has followed two distinct paths
   in recent years. ``New institutionalism{''} research has focused
   primarily on the policy-making process, particularly the interplay
   between regulators who implement policy) and their political principals
   (who attempt to control regulators' activity). In contrast, ``new
   governance{''} scholarship has focused on strategies other than
   traditional ``command-and-control{''} regulation that can encourage
   compliance with socially valued norms of behavior. Although these two
   lines of research approach highly distinct facets of regulation and have
   developed largely independently of each other, they exhibit a generally
   unacknowledged and extensive overlap in their theoretical structure and
   associated results. In this article, we compare these two approaches to
   regulatory politics. For each, we discuss how the interactions of key
   actors are conceptualized, consider the types of regulatory mechanisms
   used to manage behavior, and examine the breadth of outcomes that flow
   from these controls. We suggest that greater acknowledgment of the
   commonalities in the two approaches can advance each approach, even if
   they continue to be pursued separately, and can also help generate
   important synthetic avenues for further research.},

Pages = {171-193},
Abstract = {Liberalism faces a tension between its commitment to minimal
   interference with individual liberty and the urgent need for strong
   collective action on global climate change. This paper attempts to
   resolve that tension. It does so on the one hand by defending an
   expanded model of collective moral responsibility, according to which a
   set of individuals can be responsible, qua `putative group', for harm
   resulting from the predictable aggregation of their individual acts. On
   the other, it defends a collectivized version of the harm principle. The
   claim is that the collectivized principle pushes the burden of argument,
   against coercively enforced measures to curtail climate change and
   compensate its victims, onto the global elite collectively responsible
   for environmental harms. Some such potential arguments are briefly
   considered and rejected.},

Journal = {QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Abstract = {Arrangements by which politically connected firms receive economic
   favors are a common feature around the world, but little is known of the
   form or effects of influence in business government relationships. We
   present a simple model in which influence requires firms to provide
   goods of political value in exchange for economic privileges. We argue
   that political influence improves the business environment for selected
   firms, but restricts their ability to fire workers. Under these
   conditions, if political influence primarily lowers fixed costs over
   variable costs, then favored firms will be less likely to invest and
   their productivity will suffer, even if they earn higher profits than
   non-influential firms. We rely on the World Bank's Enterprise Surveys of
   approximately 8000 firms in 40 developing countries, and control for a
   number of biases present in the data. We find that influential firms
   benefit from lower administrative and regulatory barriers (including
   bribe taxes), greater pricing power, and easier access to credit. But
   these firms also provide politically valuable benefits to incumbents
   through bloated payrolls and greater tax payments. Finally, these firms
   are worse-performing than their non-influential counterparts. Our
   results highlight a potential channel by which cronyism leads to
   persistent underdevelopment.},

Journal = {POLITOLOGICKY CASOPIS-CZECH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2011},
Number = {3},
Pages = {300-323},
Abstract = {The aim of this article is to analyse the efforts made by the OSCE to
   contribute to the political settlement of the Transdniestran conflict.
   As the OSCE is one of the mediators in this conflict, the article begins
   by considering theories of international mediation and explains the
   factors that influence the success or failure of mediation efforts.
   Following this theoretical part, the article continues with an analysis
   of these factors with respect to the conflict in Transdniestria. It
   deals with the nature of the Transdniestrian conflict and its causes,
   describes the parties involved, explains the historical background of
   the conflict, and analyses its international context, i.e. the role of
   third parties. The following chapter focuses on the nature of the
   mediator (i.e. the OSCE) and its mediation activities, and attempts to
   explain the OSCE's mediation efforts. The article concludes that the
   absence of a political settlement to the conflict results from a
   combination of factors that are both embedded in the nature of the
   conflict and in the nature of the mediator.},

Title = {Public Fund Assignment through Project Evaluation},
Journal = {REGIONAL AND FEDERAL STUDIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {21},
Number = {3},
Pages = {355-374},
Abstract = {Public funds are allocated increasingly through dynamic mechanisms, such
   as project selection, and less through allocation formulas. While
   costly, potential benefits of project selection include better projects,
   less corruption and better targeted allocations. We challenge these
   benefits theoretically and test our arguments empirically by assessing
   an explanatory model of fund assignment. Our specific context involves
   the Polish 2004-06 Interregional Operational Programmes, with regions in
   charge of distributing European Union Structural Funds. Results suggest
   assignment to be largely captured by an easy-to-measure variable,
   population size. Assignment further seems to somewhat contradict overall
   programme purposes, potentially feeding intra-regional inequality.
   Co-payment requirements are a likely explanation. These results
   challenge the three arguments in favour of project selection. On the
   other hand, further results support arguments in favour of project
   selection. While our proxy for personal links between assigning and
   receiving entities shows a significant result, it explains very little.
   Moreover, we did not find any impact of political ties. Overall the
   picture is mixed and our research is restricted to only three potential
   benefits of project selection.},

Abstract = {In this article, I show how members of an assembly form voting blocs
   strategically to coordinate their votes and affect the policy outcome
   chosen by the assembly. In a repeated voting game, permanent voting
   blocs form in equilibrium. These permanent voting blocs act as
   endogenous political parties that exercise party discipline. In a
   stylized assembly I prove that the equilibrium parties must be two small
   polarized voting blocs, one at each side of the ideological divide.},

Title = {Transgovernmental networks as catalysts for democratic change? EU
   functional cooperation with Arab authoritarian regimes and socialization
   of involved state officials into democratic governance},
Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {18},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {1001-1025},
Abstract = {With the European Neighbourhood Policy, the European Union (EU)
   intensified functional cooperation in a wide range of sectors. This
   contribution investigates whether this kind of transnational exchange
   can trigger subtle processes of democratization. It argues that third
   state officials become acquainted with democratic governance by
   participating in transgovernmental policy networks implementing
   functional cooperation between state administrations of established
   democracies and authoritarian regimes. In this vein, it enriches the
   governance model of democracy promotion by adding a new level, the
   microlevel of democratic socialization. Empirically, the argument is
   tested taking two Twinning projects that the EU has set up in Morocco,
   that is, the projects on competition policy and on the environment. The
   conclusion is that in some non-politicized policy fields, such as the
   environment, EU transgovernmental policy networks can successfully yield
   processes of democratic socialization in the context of a stable
   authoritarian regime, like that in Morocco.},

Journal = {TEORIA Y REALIDAD CONSTITUCIONAL},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {27},
Pages = {239-290},
Abstract = {The effects of STC 31/2010 are approached mainly by means of the study
   of the general effects of the sentences of the Constitutional Court.
   Within the conclusions it has been of particular importance to take into
   account that the Statute of Autonomy is a head-norm of an own normative
   system, so that the nullity as well as the interpretation in conformity
   with the Constitution of its provisions implies a mandate susceptible of
   being examined as a specific binding effect of the sentences of the
   Constitutional Court. In this sense, it is capable to cause consequences
   for identical provisions of other legal norms that are in a relationship
   of dependence on and of hierarchical inferiority with those provisions
   of the Statute of Autonomy declared unconstitutional. Besides, the
   findings of the sentence may have even interpretive character for
   similar or identical provisions of the Statutes of other Autonomous
   Communities. Thus the consequences of the sentence are notably of
   interpretative character for other legal provisions; however, a direct
   enforcement would apply to the provisions of another legal norm declared
   unconstitutional due to the lack of conformity with the Constitution
   deriving from the main proceedings.},

Volume = {4},

Abstract = {Neo-Orientalism is a means of articulating a subordinating discourse
   regarding populations and societies associated with Islam. This article
   argues that the labelling of Chechens and Chechen society as `desperate'
   is another way of upholding the neo-Orientalist frame. About 2876
   articles on the Chechen conflict culled from the Lexis-Nexis database
   were coded for the language of `desperation'. A majority of these
   articles linked desperation to either `radical' Islam or gender
   dynamics/women's participation in the conflict. Thus, this article
   argues that the Russian-Chechen conflict is framed by the media to
   uphold a neo-Orientalist gaze, in which the language of desperation
   plays a key role, in order to delegitimise any cause the Chechens may
   have for fighting.},

Abstract = {In this research note we present the characteristics of twenty-six
   congressional electoral campaigns during the 2009 Chilean national
   elections and then use them to create a typology of campaign types for
   incumbents and challengers. The evidence was collected through
   participant observation and in-depth interviewing with key actors in
   each district. The statistical and Boolean analysis of these data yields
   the following results: different campaign profiles exist among
   incumbents and challengers; incumbents are the most successful
   candidates; higher amounts of electoral expenses increase the odds to
   win the district's seat; there is a generalized decrease in the use of
   party-symbols in campaigns.},

Abstract = {Fostering sustainable mobility is considered a pre-eminent goal for the
   future development of cities. Within ``Smart City{''} scenarios Advanced
   Traveller Information Systems (ATIS) are envisioned as tools that are
   expected to enhance more environment-friendly mobility behavior. But:
   Whether AT IS can meet these expectations has not been investigated
   systematically yet. As a result, the transdisciplinary research project
   ``ITS works{''} examined the impact of travel information acquisition on
   mobility behavior using the example of a new multi-modal traveller
   information system for the Vienna region called AnachB.at. While a
   Delphi study explored how ICTs like ATIS shall be socially and
   technologically embedded in the future, a ``test-setting{''} was
   implemented to gain insight into the users' perspectives. The results
   demonstrate on what terms ATIS can affect mobility behavior.},

   Power},
Journal = {POLITIKON},

Volume = {38},

Pages = {275-294},
Abstract = {Despite Zimbabwe's economic and political system having been in freefall
   since 2000, by the elections of 2008, and even now in 2011, the
   country's president, Robert Mugabe, still managed (and manages) to rally
   support from portions of the population. The opposition Movement for
   Democratic Change garnered much international and domestic support, but
   it took until February 2009 to get Mugabe to share power. Puzzling too
   for Western observers was the reluctance of African states, especially
   South Africa, to push Mugabe to abide by democratic norms until late in
   the game, threatening new initiatives by the African Union and in
   southern Africa. This article explores the strategies that Mugabe used
   until a few years ago to play foreign and domestic actors and contexts
   off each other in order to maintain total control. The need for an
   approach that bridges the domestic-foreign policy theoretical divide is
   illustrated by how such an approach can deepen our understanding of the
   Zimbabwe case.},

Abstract = {The Netherlands is often considered an extreme example of individualism
   and multiculturalism, two factors that many politicians and social
   scientists consider to be the main causes for the alleged decline in
   citizenship. In this paper, we examine Dutch citizens' conceptions of
   citizenship to test these negative expectations. We found the fear that
   a modern, individualistic, and diverse citizenry only care for their own
   rights to be misplaced; citizens were willing to exert effort to uphold
   the society they live in. Their efforts, however, were conditional upon
   returns in terms of a responsive government and in improvements to their
   individual lives. Communitarian, local, and rather submissive notions of
   citizenship were deeply shared - with a liberal twist among many
   migrants. We also found that `nationalist' republican notions of
   citizenship awaken latent uncertainties and divisions among citizens
   rather than creating `new' unity. This imagination of citizenship leaves
   Dutch society wanting for the deliberative, political elements of
   citizenship.},

Abstract = {Four decades ago, Gerald Kramer showed that economic conditions affect
   electoral outcomes. Some researchers took this to mean that voters were
   self-interested, voting their ``pocketbooks,{''} while others, such as
   Leif Lewin, took it to mean that voters were sociotropic, motivated by
   the public interest-and therefore altruistic. It is important, however,
   to avoid conflating sociotropic voters with altruistic ones. Voters
   might be voting in favor of politicians or parties that they think will
   further the public interest as an indirect route to furthering their own
   interests, as members of the public. More research, perhaps conducted
   using novel methodologies, is needed in order to settle the extent to
   which voters are motivated by self-interest or by the public interest.},

Pages = {3-18},
Abstract = {This article explores one of the key dimensions of EU actorness -
   external recognition. First, it analyzes the four fundamental dimensions
   of EU actorness (recognition, legitimacy, framing, and attractiveness)
   and shows in what ways recognition is linked to the three other aspects
   of actorness. Second, our text tackles the four dilemmas related to the
   debate about the EU's external recognition. These dilemmas include the
   source of recognition (external vs. internal); the conditions of
   recognition (material vs. formal); the nature of recognition
   (voluntaristic vs. non-voluntaristic); and the extent of recognition
   (comprehensive vs. partial or issue-related). Finally, the article draws
   some theoretical conclusions from this debate.},

Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},

Volume = {18},

Pages = {910-931},
Abstract = {This contribution assesses the effectiveness of the European Union's
   (EU's) efforts to promote democracy in Turkey through strategies of
   political conditionality (leverage) and via the cultivation of Turkish
   civil society (linkage). Testing various hypotheses about leverage and
   linkage, it finds that the EU's efforts, particularly those emphasizing
   conditionality, were far more effective from 2000 to 2005, prior to the
   beginning of accession talks with Turkey. Since that period, ambiguities
   about conditionality and whether Turkey will be able to gain admission,
   as well as internal political developments in Turkey, have slowed
   political reform in Turkey. Examination of the Turkish case, therefore,
   shows both the possibilities and constraints of EU democracy promotion
   via linkage and leverage.},

   that present/ display a high migratory index. Region with a greater
   number of homes with feminine headquarters, altered through the high
   indexes of marginalization and violation to the rights of the woman,
   panorama that create no favorable situations for the width of this
   population, and an increasing feminine migratory flow. This migratory
   modality conditions maternity, carried out by the migrant female leader
   of home. The form to implement the maternal care, defined like `` remote
   maternity{''}, on the part of the home female leaders, allows us to
   enter to the knowledge of the transnational families.},

   of the German Constitutional Court's Judgment on the Lisbon Treaty},
Journal = {REGIONAL AND FEDERAL STUDIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Pages = {73-90},
Abstract = {In its judgment on the Treaty of Lisbon, the Federal Constitutional
   Court of Germany stated that in establishing a European Federation the
   European Parliament by reason of its composition would not be a
   sufficient subject of democratic legitimization and that, in the event
   of the foundation of a European Federation, Germany would have to enact
   a new constitution by referendum. The article investigates these
   statements by analyzing the Court's understanding of an ``association of
   sovereign national states{''} ({''}Staatenverbund{''}), the EU as a
   supranational body, the notions of `constitutional identity' and
   `sovereignty', the requirements for democratic representation in the EU,
   the new categorization of EU competences and the needs for their
   delimitation. In the final part of the article the judicial prospects
   for a European Federation are examined and such prospects are found not
   to be a `mission impossible'.},

Title = {Unilateral and Multilateral Military Intervention: Effects on Stability
   and Security},
Journal = {DEMOCRACY \& SECURITY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {7},
Number = {3},
Pages = {227-257},
Abstract = {The success rate of military intervention has traditionally been judged
   by its ability to end conflict and/or serve intervener security
   interests. However, contemporary military intervention in troubled or
   collapsing states is often intended not only to increase security but
   also to establish conditions in which political reform or reconstruction
   can proceed. Judging the success of intervention therefore means
   isolating and measuring its impact on internal change. Scholars and
   policymakers have staked many assumptions on the belief that the
   motivation and form of military intervention might improve conditions
   for peacebuilding over time. Among these are expectations that
   multilateral interventions undertaken for purposes of social
   reconstruction and reform might be the best hopes for security and
   long-term stability. The data tested here generally give reason for
   pause in such assumptions. Our findings only slightly support neoliberal
   arguments and assumptions about the superiority of multilateral or
   neutral interventions in promoting postintervention peace, reform, and
   stability. Rather, our findings indicate that regardless of type of
   intervener, target state governance, physical quality of life, and
   economic growth are not much impacted by intervention.},

Abstract = {Operation Pedro Pan was a 1960s clandestine program resulting in the
   transport of more than 14,000 Cuban children to the United States. Based
   on the rumor that children would be taken from their parents if they
   remained in Cuba, Operation Pedro Pan serves as an example of U.S.
   government secrecy and propaganda. In this chapter, the authors examine
   the research efforts of former Pedro Pan children such as Maria de los
   Angeles Torres, and Yvonne M. Conde to uncover the stories of their
   transport to the United States, as well as relevant theories on
   government secrecy articulated by scholars such as Blanche Wiesen Cook
   and Carl J. Friedrich.},

Title = {Collective Mobilizations at the Cinema: Analyzing Films from Production
   to Reception},
Journal = {POLITIX},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {24},
Number = {93},
Pages = {47+},
Abstract = {Based on a field survey dealing with the ``social cinema{''} category in
   France in the years 19902000 and by mobilizing some cases of films
   featuring mobilizations, this article proposes to study under what
   conditions and how films can be a material for researchers in social
   sciences. Like other more traditional materials and despite the
   proximity of view between the artistic and the scientific fields, films
   (whether documentary or fiction films) are not providing direct access
   to the ``real{''}. In order to constitute them in sources, the
   researcher has to combine internal and external analysis, to link their
   conditions of production and of reception. Beyond this methodological
   proposal, cinema taken as an object (and not only as a source) can be
   the place of mobilizations and can open an heuristic field of researches
   to work on collective action and to study activists' know-how in a new
   perspective. Indeed ``social films{''} from production to reception are
   the subject of multiple appropriations which can correspond to a process
   of politicization.},

   and procedural dimensions of the patterns of exportation of democratic
   governance to the Maghreb region. In this way, it questions their bases.
   First, this reflection evidences the conceptual elasticity of the term
   ``democratic governance{''}. Secondly, it draws attention about the
   interpretative versatility of the implementation of democratic
   government Finally, it criticizes the viability of the mainstream
   theoretical premises on the mechanism that are expected to promote
   democratic materialization of governance in this region.},

Abstract = {Instrumentalism about moral compromise in politics appears inconsistent
   with accepting both the existence of non-instrumental or principled
   reasons for moral compromise in close personal friendships and a rich
   ideal of civic friendship. Using a robust conception of political
   reconciliation during democratic transitions as an example of civic
   friendship, I argue that all three claims are compatible. Spouses have
   principled reasons for compromise because they commit to sharing
   responsibility for their joint success as partners in life, and not
   because their relationship involves strong affective attitudes of
   goodwill, solidarity, trust, and the like. Since shared responsibility
   for ends is an inappropriate element in the political relationship
   between citizens, the members of a divided society may manifest the
   constitutive attitudes of political reconciliation without any
   commitment to principled reasons for moral compromise.},

Abstract = {This analysis maps the deepening global crisis and the principles of its
   resolution by life-value analysis and method. Received theories of
   economics and justice and modern rights doctrines are shown to have no
   ground in life value and to be incapable of recognizing universal life
   goods and the rising threats to them. In response to this system failure
   at theoretical and operational levels, the unifying nature and measure
   of life value are defined to provide the long-missing basis for
   understanding the common interest, human rights and social justice-that
   is, the universal life necessities of humanity across cultures and the
   evolving civil commons infrastructures to ensure them. In contrast, the
   treaty-imposed corporate rights system miscalled ``globalization{''} is
   structured to predate life means and support systems at all levels with
   no accountability beyond itself. Only the logic of life value, human
   rights and life-protective law, it is concluded, can comprehend or
   govern this inherently life-blind and cumulatively eco-genocidal regime.},

Abstract = {In the theory of modernization, it is comparative improvement of the
   conditions of life of the population that is considered the main
   criterion of modernization success. The author of the article turns the
   reader's attention to certain real modernization in Russia in the late
   18th to the early 20th centuries, revealed rather recently (by
   historians). He also exploits analytical data illustrating the rise of
   the living standards in Russia - the well-being of the population that
   went on growing cyclically within the period of 120 years from the end
   of the 18th century up to the First world war. As is proved in the
   article, the early 20th century Russian revolutions were not called
   forth by the country's having entered a general permanent crisis after
   the Great reforms of the 1860s - they occurred, instead, because the
   society had not coped by the time with the problems generated by the
   accelerated modernization.},

Abstract = {In the article the author looks into the theoretical prospects of
   socialist utopia rebirth as the so called horizon line that is
   impossible to cross, but easy to see as if it were reachable. The author
   shows that post-Fordism capitalizing and alienating nonmaterial labor
   has become a real problem for the radical negation in the framework of
   neo-Marxist utopia since under such conditions any social alternative is
   in danger of becoming a part of the capitalist reality. Such
   disciplinary power of the modern capitalist logic generates rejection of
   the political action as it is rather than a protest. In this situation
   radical Marxist utopia comes down to the affective negation that cannot
   become a subject to reflection. Its creators and proponents do not want
   to find themselves in the capitalist present, aspiring in their
   expectations into the future that will not grow out of the modern
   capitalism and will never be capitalism in principle.},

Abstract = {The paper argues that there is a fundamental tension in the work of
   Martha Nussbaum between its implicit materialist foundations in what
   John McMurtry calls life-value, and her political liberalism. The
   genuinely universal values of life-requirement satisfaction and human
   capability development that form the core of Nussbaum's ethics cannot be
   fully and coherently realized, I will argue, within the framework of
   liberal-capitalist society, whose surface problems she criticizes but
   whose depth social dynamics and normative justifications her work leaves
   intact. The problems particular to Nussbaum's position are of general
   importance in so far as they expose the structural limitations of
   liberalism as a critical social theory.},

Journal = {OSTERREICHISCHE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR POLITIKWISSENSCHAFT},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {40},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {Socio-economic change, massive membership losses, and since the BAWAG
   crisis, financial problems pose specific challenges to Austrian trade
   unions. Although the institutional anchoring of Austrian unions in the
   national sociopolitical system is still largely intact, we argue that
   they face a twofold membership and financial crisis which in turn
   affects their organizing strategies. We propose a conceptual model of
   two dominant union identities, social partnership unionism and social
   movement unionism, each entailing different power resources and
   strategic options. We use an empirical study of two unions in the
   construction sector to test the plausibility of this model and develop
   it further. The results show that while no comprehensive strategic
   change has taken place, an opening towards the model of social movement
   unionism is taking place.},

Journal = {ASIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1},
Pages = {96-120},
Abstract = {Since 1987 there have been six coups altogether in Fiji. The article
   examines the reactive and transformative nature of the Republic of Fiji
   Military Forces, hereafter referred to as Fiji military, and coups and
   their impact on the small multi-cultural country of 850,000 people. The
   coups in Fiji have to be seen in the light of the two separate but
   related developments, namely the historical dynamic interplay between
   politics and ethnicity and secondly, how the military itself has evolved
   as a state institution and how it perceived its role in the modern state
   system. Although the military is modelled along the lines of a
   praetorian institution, its perceived role has often shifted from being
   guardian of indigenous Fijian interests to protector of the multi-ethnic
   state. The interventionist tendency of the military was largely in
   response to the way in which the interplay between politics and
   ethnicity had played a part in creating discord and tension. All the six
   coups in Fiji were linked and need to be understood in relation to each
   other. The 2006 coup was the most politically transformative as some of
   the most powerful institutions were weakened and reconfigured and a new
   order created under the guise of a `clean-up campaign'.},

Abstract = {The procedures for reforming the Constitutions of the cantons are set
   within a unique constitutional model. This reduces the State to the
   minimum necessary for the citizens to have direct participation in
   forming the general will. The Swiss federal system assumes (rather than
   constrains) the sovereignty of the cantons, ensuring that their
   normative will can be efficacious outside their own territory. This
   accords the cantons a degree of autonomy to reform their own
   Constitution that, in conjunction with the institutions for direct
   democracy, enables their citizens to exercise continuous power to shape
   the Constitution.},

Abstract = {The present article analyzes the influence that variables such as
   parent's educational level of attainment or occupation, level of income
   associated to the family's area of residence, or kind of school (private
   vs. state-run) might have on academic performance. The thesis presented
   states that these factors could account for the differenciated cognitive
   and perceptive schemata (habitus) that children develop to meet ``the
   educational challenge{''}. To demonstrate such relations, statistical
   procedures are used. The data tested here has been collected from the
   average results that different schools taking part in CDI exam obtained
   in 2008 in the region of Madrid. This exam is held every academic year
   and organized by Consejeria de Educacion de Madrid (Madrid Office of
   Education) to evaluate if pupils under test match the official academic
   level required for the grade they are in. Our perspective is further
   different than that which only tends to stress psicological factors as
   the main explanatory cause, and which underlies the dominant discourses
   in education.},

Abstract = {Over the last 60 years the idea of human dignity has become increasingly
   prominent in the political discourse on human rights. In United Nations
   documents, for instance, human dignity is currently presented as the
   justification for human rights. In this paper I shall argue that the
   contemporary way in which human dignity is thought to ground human
   rights is very different from the way human dignity has been understood
   traditionally. My aim is to contrast the contemporary paradigm of
   dignity to a different one that has been prominent historically from
   Cicero onwards. My conclusion is that if one wants to use the
   contemporary conception of dignity, one cannot refer to the history of
   philosophy for support of this conception, and if one wants to use this
   history in support, one would have to employ a different conception of
   dignity that uses a different pattern of thought.},

   Medical Sociology},
Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {48},

Pages = {249-258},
Abstract = {A major domain of recent research in health or medical sociology is
   concerned with social determinants of health, and more specifically with
   the explanation of social inequalities in health. Substantial input to
   this research was provided by European medical sociologists and social
   epidemiologists. In this article, I give a short review of the current
   state of art in explaining the social gradient of health, pointing to
   five complementary approaches: social selection, health care provision,
   early life deprivation, unhealthy lifestyles, and material and
   psychosocial stressors/resources in adult life. This latter explanation
   is discussed in more detail with regard to health-adverse working and
   employment conditions. New scientific evidence on the influence of poor
   quality of work on physical and mental health is presented, with
   particular reference to two sociological models of stressful work,
   demand-control and effort-reward imbalance. Moreover, their contribution
   towards explaining unequal adult health is discussed in the frame of two
   hypotheses, the mediation and the effect modification hypothesis. In
   conclusion, substantial sociological input and progress of the
   sub-specialty of health or medical sociology was achieved in recent
   past, and this new knowledge is already being applied in various
   contexts of health and social policy.},

Abstract = {This essay disputes one of the central claims in Jeremy Waldron's God,
   Locke, and Equality (2002), that being the claim that Locke's arguments
   about species in An Essay Concerning Human Understanding undercut his
   assertions about the equality of the human species as a matter of
   natural law in Two Treatises of Government. It argues, firstly, and pace
   Waldron, that Locke's view of natural law is foundational to his view of
   man, not vice versa, and, secondly, that Two Treatises is written in an
   idiom different from Locke's philosophical writings, such that directly
   transposing the ideas discussed in one idiom to the other is as confused
   as it is confusing. After providing a new account of the relationship
   between Locke's philosophy and his views of morality, politics and
   religion, the essay concludes that Waldron fails to grasp the style and
   structure of Locke's thinking, and so cumulatively misunderstands and
   distorts Locke's views about moral identity, toleration, religion and
   politics alike.},

Abstract = {This article argues that the `rule of law' has become a central goal in
   popular struggles the world over, and it is citizenship struggles which
   infuse the rule of law with substantive, as against a thin procedural,
   meaning. This is especially true in post-colonial societies like India,
   with a tradition of inherited colonial law designed for subject-hood
   rather than citizenship, growing inequality which affects both the
   enactment and interpretation of law, and the violation of law by those
   who are meant to protect it. Demanding implementation of existing laws,
   breaking laws that are patently unjust whether through armed struggle or
   non-violent social movements, or seeking to change laws in favour of new
   and more democratic laws, are all major avenues by means of which people
   express their aspirations as citizens. However, law's mutually
   constitutive relation with social practice means that people enter into
   political and legal negotiations already constituted as certain kinds of
   legal subjects, which constrains their imagination in certain ways.},

Journal = {CONTEMPORARY POLITICS},

Volume = {17},

Pages = {201-215},
Abstract = {This article aims to examine how the structural transformations in both
   materialistic and ideational contexts, symbolised by declining US
   influence and growing Chinese voices, has influenced Japan, a key US
   ally in the region and China's regional competitor. Based on a
   neo-classical realist framework which stresses the need to analyse
   domestic political processes, this article sheds light on the influence
   of these structural transformations on Japan's efforts to formulate its
   new growth strategies by rearranging policy priorities and engaging in
   regional and international collaborations. Since the crisis took place
   during a period which saw the demise of Liberal Democratic Party's
   five-decade rule and the advent of the Democratic Party of Japan
   government, the article analyses to what extent the economic stimulus
   programmes ( launched by both old and new governments, respectively)
   differed and assesses how they have been effective in terms of
   stimulating domestic demands. The article also highlights Japan's
   efforts under the crisis-led structural transformations to involve fast
   growing Asian economies in its new growth strategy and to engage in the
   regional financial cooperation including the Chiang Mai Initiative
   Multilateralisation.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the effects of majoritarian formulas on the
   effective number of candidates in the elections for president (absolute
   majority) and mayor (relative majority) in Chile. Although, in theory,
   greater fragmentation with the absolute majority system with run-off
   voting would be expected, the authors demonstrate that, in the case of
   Chile, precisely the opposite is observed. Fragmentation is greater in
   the relative majority system. This is explained by the lower entry and
   information costs that exist in mayoral elections with respect to
   presidential ones. We support this hypothesis with a time series
   statistical model (cross-sectional time series regression model). We use
   electoral data added to the communal level for the 2004 and 2008
   municipal elections, and for the 1999 and 2005 presidential elections.},

Abstract = {The negotiating group of developing countries, the G77, is one of the
   most important institutions in global climate governance. This article
   analyses the cohesiveness of, and internal tension within, the G77
   coalition by using the politics of climate change as the empirical
   window. The study examines four arenas of UN-based deliberations on
   climate change in the years 2007-2010; the Security Council, the
   Commission on Sustainable Development, the General Assembly and the
   United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). We argue
   that these deliberations, once they reached the top of the international
   political agenda in 2007, and ever since, have posed deeper challenges
   to the G77 coalition than ever before. While developing country
   interests are both converging and diverging, the increasingly
   conflicting interests, as well as the very slowly eroding common
   identity, are creating increasingly unified subgroups in the G77. The
   G77 is highly unlikely to break up formally, but how functional it will
   be as a bloc in the forthcoming climate change negotiations remains an
   open question.},

Abstract = {Lower transaction costs have shifted voter registration activities
   online and away from traditional modes of outreach. Downloading forms
   may impose higher transaction costs than traditional outreach for some
   people and thereby decrease electoral participation. A randomized,
   controlled experiment tested this hypothesis by encouraging treatment
   participants via e-mail to use online voter registration tools. The
   treatment group was 0.3 percentage points less likely to be registered
   to vote after the election. A follow-up experiment sent reminders via
   text message to randomly selected people who had downloaded registration
   forms. The treatment increased rates of registration by 4 percentage
   points, suggesting that reminders can ameliorate many of the negative
   effects of directing people to downloadable online registration forms.},

   been trying to weaken ties between Turkey and NATO, as well as
   Turkish-American cooperation. The revolutionary events in Syria since
   March 2011 have recently brought about divergence between Moscow and
   Ankara - however, the divergence may very well remain contained.},

Abstract = {This article examines the extent to which race and ethnicity affect
   mobility to leadership positions within Congress. The authors utilize
   survival analysis to examine the rate at which legislators attained
   committee leadership positions between the 101st and 108th Congresses.
   The results show that black legislators attain leadership positions
   faster than white legislators. This may be because of the tendency for
   black members of Congress (MCs) to sit on less prestigious committees
   than white MCs, which creates greater opportunity for institutional
   promotion. Ethnicity, on the other hand, does not matter to mobility as
   Latinos acquire leadership positions at the same rate as non-Latino
   legislators.},

Abstract = {Created in 2003 by the unification of four earlier initiatives, Bolsa
   Familia currently provides cash transfers to 13 million people and
   supports more than one-third of the children that go to primary school
   in Brazil. This article extends and expands previous reviews on the
   origins, development and impact of the programme. The authors consider
   the political and economic dimensions in their evaluation of Bolsa
   Familia's contribution to the reduction of poverty and inequality. They
   argue that Bolsa Familia's ultimate impact will partly depend on a
   reduction of inequalities in public provision of health and education,
   which in turn may require a more active political role for the poor.},

Abstract = {Several Canadian provinces partially fund private education through
   statistical formulas. This article draws on various studies in the area
   of political economy in order to link provincial educational grants to
   factors not explicitly comprised in the formulas. More specifically,
   organizational and electoral variables are expected to have an impact on
   the amount of provincial grants received by private school authorities.
   Quantile regression analysis shows that Catholic and Protestant private
   schools are somewhat favoured by the existing system of grants.
   Likewise, membership in the main provincial interest group and electoral
   competition are beneficial to private school authorities.},

Abstract = {This article examines the role of society and culture in shaping the
   opportunity structure and ambition formation of female gubernatorial
   candidates in all 50 states over a 40-year period. Using a new data set
   consisting of every woman who entered a gubernatorial primary from 1978
   to 2008, the author analyzes how cultural factors and historical
   legacies-including the percentage of women in the workforce, higher
   education, and statewide elective offices-influence the opportunity
   structure and ambition formation of female candidates. The author argues
   that the female sociopolitical subculture within individual states
   heavily influences whether or not female candidates will enter and win
   their respective primaries and general elections. Rather than assuming
   that individual characteristics are the primary determinants of ambition
   formation, this research implies that it is necessary to analyze the
   political behavior within cultural contexts.},

Abstract = {The article provides an analysis of youth values in Croatia in the
   socialist and post-socialist periods, comparing them with values of
   older citizens and of the political elite. The comparative analysis is
   based on data obtained through four empirical investigations conducted
   in 1986, 1999 and 2004. The results show that the predominant youth
   values remain stable, with minor oscillations in rank. The aspects in
   which the young are different from the older citizens are a broader
   variety of interests, a greater acceptance of post-materialistic values,
   and a lesser acceptance of traditional and political values. It is also
   shown that the optimism of youth is constantly on a high level, as well
   as their satisfaction with life, which is more pronounced than with
   older citizens. In all analyzed segments the political elite is
   noticeably different from both above-mentioned groups. The overall
   findings confirm that the acceptance of observed values varies depending
   on the social-political context, and the age and social status of the
   respondents. Since the scope of the variations is limited, the author
   concludes that this analysis gives one more confirmation of the relative
   stability of values, and of the fact that they are transmitted from
   generation to generation in a way which does not endanger social
   continuity.},

Abstract = {The 2008-2009 worldwide economic crisis serves as a backdrop to this
   study of the dynamics of citizens' economic expectations. Economic
   expectations are identified as crucial for a range of political
   attitudes. This study is the first to consider how information affects
   evaluations in times of a severe crisis, as prior research of
   information effects on economic evaluations took place in more stable
   economic times. It links citizens' news exposure and the content of
   economic news coverage with changes in prospective economic assessments.
   Drawing on a three-wave panel study and on a media content analysis
   between the panel waves, we thus provide a dynamic assessment of media
   influences on changes in economic evaluations. The results demonstrate
   that media exposure strongly affected expectations regarding the future
   development of the national economic situation, while being largely
   unrelated to personal economic expectations. We furthermore show that
   media dependency increases the magnitude of the media effect. We discuss
   the disconnect between personal and national economic evaluations with
   regard to mass-mediated economic information. Acta Politica (2011) 46,

Abstract = {We present a visual method for assessing the predictive power of models
   with binary outcomes. This technique allows the analyst to evaluate
   model fit based upon the models' ability to consistently match
   high-probability predictions to actual occurrences of the event of
   interest, and low-probability predictions to nonoccurrences of the event
   of interest. Unlike existing methods for assessing predictive power for
   logit and probit models such as Percent Correctly Predicted statistics,
   Brier scores, and the ROC plot, our ``separation plot{''} has the
   advantage of producing a visual display that is informative and easy to
   explain to a general audience, while also remaining insensitive to the
   often arbitrary probability thresholds that are used to distinguish
   between predicted events and nonevents. We demonstrate the effectiveness
   of this technique in building predictive models in a number of different
   areas of political research.},

Abstract = {Voters in elections under plurality rule face relatively straightforward
   incentives. In proportional representation systems, voters face more
   complex incentives as electoral outcomes don't translate as directly
   into policy outcomes as in plurality rule elections. A common approach
   is to assume electoral outcomes translate into policy as a vote-weighted
   average of all party platforms. However, most of the world's
   legislatures are majoritarian institutions, and elections in PR systems
   are generally followed by a process of coalition formation. Results
   obtained using this assumption are not robust to the introduction of
   even minimal forms of majoritarianism. Incentives to engage in strategic
   voting depend on considerations about the coalitions that may form after
   the election, and the voters' equilibrium strategies are shaped by
   policy balancing and the postelectoral coalition bargaining situation,
   including considerations about who will be appointed the formateur.},

Abstract = {The Mohalla Committees of Mumbai are a civil society initiative for the
   management of conflict. On December 6, 1992, a Hindu mob destroyed a
   400-year-old mosque in Ayodhya in North India. Muslims all over India
   staged protests, and communal riots broke out in various parts of the
   country, including Mumbai. Not only was there a loss of harmony between
   Hindus and Muslims in the city, but also a loss of faith by the Muslims
   in the police. A people-centered mechanism with the objective of
   communal harmony, the Mohalla Committees in Mumbai strived to restore
   peace and to open channels of communication between the police and
   citizens. Women played a key role in the process of confidence building.
   This article is a study of the proactive role played by women in
   continuing the process of reconciliation and peace building.},

Abstract = {In 2010 an important package of reforms was agreed to the British
   parliament, following a report by a new Select Committee on Reform of
   the House of Commons, chaired by Labour MP Tony Wright. The reforms
   changed the way in which select committee members and chairs are chosen,
   removing patronage powers from party whips and instead moving to a
   system of election. They also created a new category of `backbench
   business', for approximately one day per sitting week, to be scheduled
   by a new Backbench Business Committee: thus significantly reducing the
   government's hold over the Commons agenda. This article explores the
   background to these reforms, their likely effects, and crucially how
   they came to be agreed by the famously executive-dominated House of
   Commons.},

Abstract = {Recent studies of the legislative process have put forward a number of
   plausible hypotheses regarding the distribution of agenda-setting power.
   These hypotheses have guided scholars in identifying those conflicts and
   actors that are crucial to explaining legislative change and the wording
   of legislation. However, this has not yet led to a better understanding
   of the choice of specific agenda-setting rules. Why does the cabinet in
   some parliamentary democracies enjoy an undisputed role, while in others
   the parliament continues to play the role of co-protagonist? This
   article attempts to answer this question by looking at some well-known
   features of party systems. It is argued that in pivotal party systems,
   with limited government alternation, it is much more difficult to
   strengthen the government vis-a-vis the parliament. One factor prevents
   the procedural and institutional predominance of the cabinet under these
   circumstances: the lack of opportunities for, and expectations of, large
   and controversial policy change.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN UNION POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {12},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {In this article we seek to understand whether, how and under what
   conditions political parties publicly articulate matters of European
   integration and encourage contestation over Europe. Based on a content
   analysis of parties' televised advertising spots during the 2009
   European Parliament (EP) election campaign in six countries (Bulgaria,
   the Czech Republic, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, the United
   Kingdom), we find evidence that European Union (EU) issues and actors
   are more prominent on the campaign agenda in countries with many
   Eurosceptic parties. Eurosceptic and non-Eurosceptic parties co-orient
   themselves towards each other in their EU articulation. Finally,
   contestation over Europe exists in the realm of identity politics:
   right-wing fringe parties (and in some countries also mainstream
   parties) characterize the EU as a threat to national sovereignty and
   identity, whereas left-wing mobilization against the EU on economic
   matters is hardly visible. Regarding the two politicization dimensions -
   EU articulation and contestation - we show that party campaigns cannot
   be described as purely second-order national contests any more. Instead,
   the strategic party mobilization model seems to better characterize the
   2009 EP campaigns.},

Abstract = {Lately, the North Caucasus has become a major attraction point due to a
   great number of events and the worrisome trend in the region, with a big
   impact on the Russian Federation, on the one hand, and on the Wider
   Black Sea Region, on the other, as well as on the overall fight against
   terrorism. The themes surrounding this subject are various. One goal of
   this study is to supply a base of evolving information, ideas, and
   theories to give support to the evaluation of the situation in the North
   Caucasus and to provide a starting point for any projections regarding
   the area as well as larger themes defining the complexity of the region.
   The other goal is to foresee, based on these qualitative theories and
   trends, where this road is heading; in which way the current situation
   will evolve; and to what extent it will remain a local issue or it will
   affect the entire region.},

Abstract = {When the chambers of a bicameral legislature must negotiate to reach a
   decision outcome, the bargaining strength of each side is affected by
   the composition of its negotiating delegations. We examine some of the
   implications of this proposition for legislative negotiations between
   the European Parliament (EP) and the Council of Ministers. We develop
   and test hypotheses on how the bargaining success of the EP is affected
   by the choice of its chief negotiator, the rapporteur. Our findings
   support the argument that negotiators in a bicameral setting play a
   `two-level game', where bargaining strength is shaped by the degree to
   which negotiators can credibly claim to be constrained by their parent
   chamber.},

Abstract = {It has become the new truth of our age that the western world we have
   known is fast losing its pre-eminence to be replaced by a new
   international system shaped by China and increasingly determined by the
   economic rise of Asia. This at least is how many economists, historians
   and students of world politics are now viewing the future of the larger
   international system. This essay does not dispute some self-evident
   economic facts nor assume that the world will look the same in 50 years
   time as it does now. It does, however, question the idea that there is a
   power shift in the making and that the West and the United States are in
   steep decline. The world has a long way to go before we begin to live in
   a `post-western' world.},

Abstract = {This paper uses the empirical implications of theoretical models (EITM)
   framework to examine the consequences of the asymmetric diffusion of
   expectations. In the spirit of the traditional two-step flow model of
   communication, less-informed agents learn the expectations of
   more-informed agents. We find that when there is misinterpretation in
   the information acquisition process, a boomerang effect exists. In this
   equilibrium the less-informed agents' forecasts confound those of
   more-informed agents. We apply the EITM approach to a key economic
   variable known to have a relation to economic fluctuations - inflation
   expectations. Using surveyed inflation expectations data for the period,
   1978-2000, we find the boomerang effect exists. One implication of this
   finding pertains to economic policy and economic volatility: because
   policymakers have more information than the public, the boomerang effect
   can lead policymakers to make inaccurate forecasts of economic
   conditions and conduct erroneous policies which contribute to economic
   instability. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This article uses data from the 2008 Cooperative Congressional Election
   Study to explain weak support for public financing of congressional
   campaigns. Previous studies lack theory to explain variation in support
   and use a flawed measure of the dependent variable. We argue that low
   support reflects a failure resulting from a collective action dilemma.
   Citizens desire a campaign finance system that weans politicians from
   private donors, but are unwilling to pay a small amount in taxes to
   support public financing. In contrast to conventional wisdom, we show
   that support for public financing is highest among those perceived to
   benefit the most from the current system. Our results suggest that most
   Americans would rather not pay for politics, and that reform proposals
   must avoid incurring transparent costs on individual citizens to pay for
   reform. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Sweden is no longer a negative, exceptional case regarding the presence
   of radical right-wing populist parties. The Sweden Democrats has
   continually grown stronger, and in 2010 they won seats in the Swedish
   parliament. However, their electoral support varies considerably across
   Sweden. This study analyses their electoral support in 290 Swedish
   municipalities in order to explain this variance. Support is found for
   the social marginality hypothesis: electoral support for the Sweden
   Democrats tends to be negatively correlated with the average level of
   education and with the Gross Regional Product per capita, and positively
   correlated with the unemployment rate. The ethnic competition
   hypothesis, that there is a positive correlation between the proportion
   of immigrants and electoral support of the Sweden Democrats, is also
   supported.},

Abstract = {Priming is often mentioned in studies of media effects in Britain, yet
   empirical tests of its extent and nature are lacking: most evidence of
   priming effects is from the United States. Moreover, research on British
   elections concludes that the media have little impact on the public's
   perceptions of issues, including in the 2005 election. In this paper we
   argue that priming by the British media has been misconceived and thus
   not studied adequately. We demonstrate that the issue of the war in Iraq
   was primed by media coverage in 2005, both as a consequence of the
   volume of coverage of the issue and its tone. The influence of Iraq was
   not just long-term, via its impact on confidence in the Labour
   government or Tony Blair's reputation, but was also affected by media
   coverage during the campaign. We also demonstrate that the media's
   coverage of Iraq in 2005 influenced voters' evaluations of Blair by
   polarizing consumers of the same news. Finally, we find slightly more of
   an impact of the tone of coverage of Iraq in 2005 but it is moderated by
   the editorial stance of the newspaper-the editorial stance of British
   newspapers still seems to matter, suggesting that the dealignment of the
   British press has not eliminated the influence of reading a newspaper
   that endorses a party, no matter how qualified that endorsement may be.

Abstract = {This article seeks to understand how immigrants' premigration political
   socialization experiences shape their views of the new polity, the
   extent to which this imported socialization affects their degree of
   postmigration political engagement, and how long the content of
   immigrants' political suitcases remains consequential during their civic
   lives in America. The author offers tests utilizing unique survey data
   of Mexican immigrants residing in the United States. Results reveal that
   attachment to a Mexican political party heightens the prospects for
   political engagement in the American context, and trust in the Mexican
   government corresponds with trust in the U.S. government.},

   Leningrad on Solianoi pereulok have no idea of the site's dramatic
   history. Already during the Wehrmacht's siege, the first exhibition came
   into being right after the winter of hunger in 1942. From this emerged a
   museum, which enjoyed a great deal of popularity before it was closed in
   the wake of the ``Leningrad Affair{''} during the period of late
   Stalinsim. Most of the exhibits were destroyed. Only during Perestroika
   was the blockade museum founded again. Now a new permanent exhibition is
   to recall one of the greatest tragedies of the Second World War.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on how the ability to speak and read English
   affects Latino citizens' participation in U.S. elections, and evaluates
   the extent to which this language barrier might be overcome by living in
   a community with a relatively large Latino population and having access
   to registration materials and ballots in Spanish. Using data primarily
   from the Pew Hispanic Center, we find that the inability to speak and
   read English hinders registration and turnout among Latino citizens.
   While the language barrier to turnout is mitigated by several factors,
   the barrier to registration is more intractable. These results have
   implications for researchers and practitioners interested in the
   political participation of this increasingly prominent group. In
   particular, understanding the role of English proficiency is a critical
   first step in thinking about policy prescriptions that will bring into
   the political process a growing number of Latino citizens, particularly
   those with limited English skills.},

Abstract = {The objective of this investigation is to evaluate the Environmentalist
   Recycling Project EVEREST through the meanings bestowed on it by the
   Marite community. The strategies used in the project are described,
   community participation is characterized, and the changes obtained
   through execution of the environmental project are identified. The
   research uses the hermeneutic-dialectic method, since it permits
   interpreting meanings about the project coming from the beneficiaries
   and members of the Marite community. Information-gathering techniques
   and instruments were semi-structured interviews with five social
   subjects and participant observation. The conclusions point toward
   fortifying the Environmentalist Recycling Project EVEREST, since it is a
   successful community experience that should be extended to other
   communities in the Maracaibo Municipality, Zulia. This project has
   generated changes in the community, demonstrating to the inhabitants an
   environmentalist culture through recycling as an alternative for viable
   development and improving the quality of life.},

Abstract = {Using data from two recent surveys, we analyze the relationship between
   Big Five personality traits and political participation. We examine
   forms of participation that differ in domain (local politics vs.
   national campaigns) as well as in the amount of conflict involved,
   whether they are likely to yield instrumental benefits, and whether they
   are likely to be viewed as a duty-characteristics that may affect the
   relationships between dispositional personality traits and political
   activity. We find relationships between personality traits and: (1) both
   self-reported and actual turnout (measured using administrative
   records), (2) overreporting of turnout, and (3) a variety of other modes
   of participation. The effect of personality on political participation
   is often comparable to the effects of factors that are central in
   earlier models of turnout, such as education and income. Consistent with
   our theoretical expectations, these relationships vary depending on
   personality-relevant characteristics of each participatory act.},

Abstract = {This article argues that instructors should introduce students to
   abstract concepts only after they have provided concrete illustrations
   of them. The advantages of working from the concrete to the abstract are
   twofold: (1) students have an easier time conceptualizing abstractions
   from within a particular context, and (2) such a context provides them
   with a greater motivation to do so. In an effort to mirror the
   pedagogical approach I defend, I begin by reviewing the manner in which
   Plato introduces the concept of justice to his readers in Book I of the
   Republic. I then examine the common model of teaching abstract concepts,
   demonstrate how an effective alternative differs from this model, and
   review the education theories that support the alternative model.},

Title = {The Spatial Approach to the Party Mandate},
Journal = {PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {64},
Number = {3},
Pages = {425-447},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This article applies spatial theory to the question of the party
   mandate. The party mandate model provides a system of linkage between
   citizens preferences and parliamentary and governmental politics.
   Existing approaches to the party mandate focus on parties' governmental
   mandate: do parties enact their pledges? Instead, the spatial approach
   looks at the representative aspect of the party mandate: how parties
   represent in parliament. This allows a more inclusive analysis of
   parties' mandates as well as an evaluation of opposition parties'
   records. The spatial approach is connected to Pitkins idea that
   representation is an oinstitutionalised arrangement'. Thus, it focuses
   on the congruence of the electoral and parliamentary party competition
   rather than the record of individual parties. Analysis of recent
   elections and parliaments in the UK and the Netherlands reveals that the
   spatial approach offers the ability to analyse different political
   systems and can uncover differences between government and opposition
   and front- and backbenchers. Contrary to the findings of earlier
   studies, this study reveals that the party mandate model does not only
   apply to government parties and to Westminster style democracies.},

Abstract = {The phenomenon of urban riots reappeared in France in the late 1970s, it
   took root in the 1990s, and in 2005 it experienced an unprecedent
   generalization. It continues locally since then. With few exceptions, it
   is always triggered by the death of young people in connection with a
   police operation. This article provides a summary of research on urban
   riots conducted in France in recent years and aims at drawing a
   comprehensive framework for the analysis of this phenomenon by
   articulating its economic, social and political dimensions. It
   highlights the process of ghettoization, the failures of state
   regulation and the lack of political representation of slum dwellers. It
   finally analyzes the riots as a ``basic form of political protest.{''}},

Abstract = {Twenty years after the collapse of communism, a rough consensus in the
   literature on postcommunist politics is that the past matters. Many
   questions remain, however, about exactly how, when, and why the past
   matters, especially in terms of political values and behavior. An
   original theoretical framework facilitates the consideration of the
   effect of communist-era legacies on postcommunist political values and
   behavior. The framework includes a set of mechanisms by which these
   effects can be transmitted and a set of particular values and behaviors
   whose legacy effects may be particularly important. Illustrating its
   utility, the framework is applied to an examination of the issue of
   trust in political parties.},

Journal = {POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {63},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {79-105},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This article examines the theory and practice of government formation,
   with particular reference to the experience of New Zealand since the
   introduction of the mixed member proportional (MMP) system in the
   mid-1990s. As predicted by coalition theory, virtually all the
   coalitions and related multi-party governance arrangements under MMP
   have been ideologically connected. But contrary to certain theories,
   they have not all been minimum-winning in nature. Moreover, by
   international standards, some aspects of government formation under MMP
   have been highly unusual. These include the negotiation of many
   different types of formal inter-party agreements and novel multi-party
   governance arrangements, most notably the adoption of very flexible
   approaches to the management of inter-party dissent. The unusual
   bargaining outcomes, it is argued, can be attributed to the flexible
   nature of New Zealand's constitutional arrangements (including the
   accommodating institutional rules which govern inter-party bargaining),
   a pragmatic political culture, a party system characterized by a degree
   of multi-dimensionality, and the complex parliamentary arithmetic which
   followed several MMP elections. Whether the recent models of multi-party
   governance will become enduring features of New Zealand politics remains
   unclear.},

Abstract = {There is a growing literature on how natural resources affect both
   economic performance and political regimes. In this article the authors
   add to this literature by focusing on how natural resource wealth
   affects the incentives of governments to uphold contracts with foreign
   investors across all sectors. They argue that although all states suffer
   reputation costs from reneging on contracts, governments in
   natural-resource-dependent economies are less sensitive to these costs,
   leading to a greater probability of expropriation and contract disputes.
   Specifically, leaders weigh the benefits of reneging on contracts with
   investors against the reputation costs of openly violating agreements
   with firms. The authors' theoretical model predicts a positive
   association between resource wealth and expropriation. Using a data set
   from the political risk insurance industry, the authors show that
   resource dependent economies have much higher levels of political risk.},

Abstract = {Coalition theory is central to our understanding of the nexus between
   party system development, party government composition and the
   relationship between the executive and legislature. I argue that
   government formation is crucial for understanding the life cycle of
   party government. I consider the relations between parties in parliament
   and parties in government as principal-agent relations, signifying the
   indirect character of representative governance. The study of
   (coalition) government should not be a one-shot game and not be
   conducted without taking into account its contextual variation or the
   time dimension: the coalition praxis to form a new government is not
   only a post-electoral `game' conducted within parliament and government
   between parties, but also a serious exercise by parties to translate
   policy preferences into a viable agreement that honours, by and large,
   the voters' choices. The comparative analysis of 17 established
   parliamentary democracies after 1990 serves to illustrate these points.},

Abstract = {By 2007, Romania and Bulgaria registered the slowest progress in terms
   of transparency, accountability and rule enforcement among Central and
   Eastern European candidate countries. This article reviews the impact of
   EU political conditionality since the 1993 Europe Agreements. It relies
   upon primary data to examine the variation of corruption trends between
   1993 and 2007 in the context of EU led reforms. This article argues that
   national elite tactics of window dressing and backtracking led to little
   change in terms of effective democracy. This article finds that reforms
   due to Enlargement-led Europeanization had not impacted upon public
   perception on corruption during the pre-accession period.},

Abstract = {It is widely held that contemporary globalization is bringing about the
   decline of the nation-state. This article questions this assumption,
   using a historical perspective to make the case that it is only in the
   wake of the global transformations since 1989 that the principle of
   national self-determination has truly had the opportunity to come into
   its own. It is precisely the supranational structures associated with
   contemporary globalization that have the potential to facilitate
   political independence for small nations without the attendant
   geopolitical and economic vulnerabilities that condemned such
   undertakings to catastrophic failure in earlier eras. Despite the
   dangers and abuses historically associated with the nation-state, the
   alternative of unbounded political communities carries even greater
   potential risks.},

Abstract = {Turkey and Russia have been engaged in what amounts to bargaining over
   the realization of a range of energy projects, which demarcate the
   contours of a grand energy package. Russia is keen to secure Turkey's
   backing for its flagship South Stream gas pipeline project and this
   could give Ankara leverage in its negotiations with Moscow. The Russian
   authorities are also interested in the possibility of constructing an
   oil refinery and gas liquefaction plant at Ceyhan, building gas storage
   units in central Anatolia, and acquiring stakes in Turkey's gas
   distribution network. Turkish energy officials have been seeking to
   secure Moscow's firm support for the Samsun-Ceyhan oil pipeline project.
   The Turkish State Pipeline Corporation (BOTAS) is hoping for the easing
   of take-or-pay obligations from Gazprom and wants to import Russian gas
   at a cheaper price. Turkish energy officials have also sought re-export
   rights for Russian gas delivered to the Turkish market.},

Journal = {COMPARATIVE POLITICS},

Volume = {43},
Number = {3},
Pages = {271+},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The core idea inspiring democracy is to empower people. To measure
   democracy in ways that capture its empowering nature, one must focus on
   popular rights and take into account rule of law as a state quality that
   makes these rights effective. Based on this premise, an index of
   ``effective democracy,{''} tested for 150 states, best represents the
   empowering nature of democracy because it most clearly captures
   democracy's embedding in empowering conditions in the wider society.
   Effective democracy is shown to be most firmly embedded in (a)
   empowering socioeconomic conditions that make people capable of
   practicing democracy and (b) empowering sociocultural conditions that
   make them willing to do so. People empowerment appears to be a unity of
   empowering societal conditions and empowering regime characteristics.},

Abstract = {This study attempts to explain the mechanism through which the Brazilian
   president manages to govern in Brazil amidst a non majority
   parliamentary scenario with a highly fragmented party system, rising
   numbers of switchers, an ostensible lack of discipline of the political
   parties members, and a precarious party coalition. If the Brazilian
   political system has not yet fallen into an institutional paralysis of
   governability it is due to the ability of the Executive branch to obtain
   support from certain parliamentary coalitions and succeeding thereof to
   outdo actors with veto power, attempting to hinder relations between the
   Executive and the Legislative branches},

Abstract = {In Japan, electoral campaigning in plurality districts often appears
   strangely ineffective to observers. In their explanations, political
   scientists have so far fallen back on the proximate cause, namely the
   strict Public Office Election Law (Koshoku senkyoho), claiming that it
   is this law that prohibits different and more effective campaigning.
   This study, however, is based on the assumption that such an explanation
   could be insufficient since even those campaign tactics legally allowed
   are often executed and/or selected in an apparently ineffective way in
   terms of their appeal to voters. Especially when looked at from the
   perspective of structural learning theory, which assumes that actors
   adapt their behavior within stable structures by learning what works
   well and what does not, these observations invite further investigation.
   As a first step, participant observation was used to identify types of
   apparently ineffective campaigning. In the second step, these types were
   discussed in qualitative interviews with candidates and other
   practitioners. The results show that next to appealing to voters there
   are other campaign goals that can determine the choice of electoral
   instruments: motivating campaign staffers, maintaining good working
   relationships with external helpers, presenting political convictions
   and personal determination. This explains part of the assumed
   ineffectiveness, but not all of it. When seen through the lens of
   structural learning theory research findings suggest that the lack of
   clear feedback regarding the impact of campaign activities on voters
   inhibits the learning processes of candidates. In combination with
   constraints regarding time, place and/or resources, these factors shape
   election campaigning to a considerable degree. Consequently, this study
   suggests that explanations need to take more factors into account than
   just the Public Office Election Law in order to solve the puzzle of
   ineffective campaigning in Japan.},

Abstract = {Using a Marxian class analysis of Wal-Mart and its workers, this article
   analyzes the term exploitation and its often incorrect usage. Given
   their roles within this merchant capitalist enterprise, Wal-Mart workers
   are frequently heralded by scholars and activists as the poster children
   of ``exploitation.'' This is a misconception. Uncovered here are the
   specific class and nonclass positions that Wal-Mart and its workers
   occupy, which determine whether the workers are indeed exploited in the
   Marxian sense of the term. The intention is to demonstrate and suggest
   possible alliances between Wal-Mart workers and other groups that might
   enable them to improve their working conditions and attain a more
   democratic workplace.},

Abstract = {Work on bureaucratic representation suggests that minority citizens
   benefit when the programs that serve them are administered by
   bureaucrats with similar characteristics. This literature has not
   sufficiently dealt with the long-standing concern that minority benefits
   may come at the expense of citizens from other groups, which some
   critics argue makes representative bureaucracy irreconcilable with
   democratic values. This article suggests distributional equity as a
   potential moderator of bureaucratic representation and as a potential
   source of reconciliation. It tests for the effects of representation
   under different distributional conditions in a policy area in which
   outcomes approach a zero-sum game. Analyses of a nationally
   representative sample of public organizations find a relationship
   between bureaucratic representation and citizen outcomes only in those
   instances where program benefits are being inequitably distributed to
   the relevant group. The article concludes with a discussion of the
   significance of these findings for the democratic legitimacy of
   representative bureaucracy.},

Abstract = {Are subnational political elites, such as governors, capable of
   affecting the voting behavior of national representatives even in the
   face of high legislative discipline? We address this question by
   estimating the exogenous causal effect of gubernatorial influence on the
   voting behavior of national legislators in Mexico, where constitutional
   provisions guarantee that the political survival times of governors and
   legislators are fixed and known ex ante and where we can thus know
   precisely which legislators will leave congress before their state
   governor's term has expired. We posit that such legislators will be more
   willing to represent gubernatorial preferences because they expect the
   governor to find them employment upon finishing their stay in congress.
   We find that governors whose terms end after the term of the national
   assembly are able to systematically increase the voting cohesion of
   legislators from their own party and state and that these effects are
   substantively important.},

Abstract = {Using quasi-experimental evidence from close elections, Lee et al.
   (2004) - henceforth LMB - argue competition for voters in U.S. House
   elections does not affect policy positions, as incumbent Senate
   candidates do not vote more extremely if elected than non-incumbents.
   Despite stronger electoral competition and greater legislative
   independence, similar results, shown here, hold for the Senate. Yet, the
   hypothesis that voters do not affect policies conflicts with how
   Senators moderate their positions prior to their next election.
   LMB-style estimates appear to be biased downwards as junior members of
   Congress prefer to vote more extremely than senior members,
   independently of their electoral strength. Corrected estimates are more
   favorable to the hypothesis that candidates moderate their policy
   choices in response to electoral competition. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Telephone surveys have been a principle means of learning about the
   attitudes and behaviors of citizens and voters. The single mode
   telephone survey, however, is increasingly threatened by rising costs,
   the declining use of landline telephones, and declining participation
   rates. One solution to these problems has been the introduction of
   mixed-mode surveys. However, such designs are relatively new and
   questions about their representativeness and the intricacies of the
   methodology remain. We report on the representativeness of a post
   election mixed-mode (Internet and mail) survey design of 2006 general
   election voters. We compare sample respondent means to sample frame
   means on key demographic characteristics and examine how mail and
   Internet respondents differed in terms of attitudes, behaviors and
   demographics. We find that overall the Internet respondents were
   representative of the population and that respondent choice of mode did
   not influence item response. We conclude that mixed-mode designs may
   allow researchers to ask important questions about political behavior
   from their desktops.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {10},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {This article offers the central argument that universalisms - defined as
   narratives of identity and role-playing in International Relations (IR)
   - depict different roles and identities for the United States and the
   European Union (EU). On the one hand, America's universalism depicts the
   democratic city upon a hill that leads in the world by example and with
   power, hard and soft. On the other, Europe's universalism is a utopia
   (an ideal plan) and a fragile balance between supranationalism and
   inter-governmentalism, putting forward consensual but ambiguous notions
   of `civilian' and `normative' power. Despite ample evidence of its
   international primacy and potential, the EU insists on keeping a low
   profile in IR. As a result of these trends, the rhetoric of the West and
   common values on the basis of transatlantic relations are clearly
   undermined.},

Abstract = {This essay examines the reaction of the Gerald Ford administration to
   the deepening recession of the mid-1970s and the unprecedented
   challenges of stagflation. This includes an analysis of the
   decision-making process within the White House, the administration's
   relationship with Congress, and the abandonment of almost 40 years of
   Keynesian orthodoxy that would see President Ford introduce a new
   conservative economic agenda as he sought to adapt traditional
   Republican economics to deal with new economic circumstances. In short,
   I argue that Ford was far more than the ``accidental{''} or
   ``caretaker{''} president that popular history recalls.},

Abstract = {Istanbul has been one of the key places both where the neoliberal
   hegemonia project has been constructed and the impacts of these policies
   have been felt strongly since the beginning of the 1980s. While the land
   speculation which is one of the popular rent seeking and distributing
   activities of the neoliberal era has become the key urban policy, the
   central government altered the administrative structure of large cities,
   relaxed the planning system, and increased the revenues of the
   municipalities. The urban transformation has been accelareted during the
   construction of the neoliberal hegemonia project between 1983-1992 and
   the resurgent of this project between 2002-2010. When this project lost
   its pace due to political and financial instabilities between 1992-2002,
   the spatial transformation of the city has also slowed down. These mega
   urban projects have redesined the housing and working areas of social
   classes.},

Abstract = {To predict the electoral fate of the new cohort of indigenous-based
   political parties in Latin America, and the impacts on their respective
   party systems, we need to understand their prospects for consolidation.
   The central task of this article is to determine whether indigenous
   peoples' parties are developing solid party roots in society or if they
   are merely benefiting from a protest vote against the system. The study
   of political party consolidation requires an examination of local level
   successes and failures. Based on a quantitative analysis of municipal
   election results in Ecuador (1996-2004) and Bolivia (1999-2004), the
   author finds mixed support for indigenous party consolidation. Clearly,
   the governing indigenous-based Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) party in
   Bolivia has solidified its base of support. Ecuador's indigenous-based
   Pachakutik (MUPP) party, however, has lost its support at the national
   level, though it continues to make impressive gains at the local level.
   As such, it represents a case of incomplete consolidation.},

Abstract = {This study is a cross-national comparative content analysis of the
   broadsheet press coverage of EU Common Foreign and Security issues
   (n=1453) focusing on the presence of indicators of a European Public
   Sphere. Specifically, we investigated the visibility of Common Foreign
   and Security Policy (CFSP) stories, featuring actors, the tone of
   coverage and the presence of `risk' and `opportunity' frames. We found
   that CFSP was more visible in broadsheets during key events. In terms of
   actors in the news, coverage was primarily Europeanized. When
   evaluative, CFSP news had a distinctive, positive dimension, especially
   with reference to the European Union (EU) as an entity. CFSP issues were
   more frequently framed in terms of `opportunity' rather than in terms of
   `risk'. Our findings suggest that the news coverage of CFSP is truly
   different from the coverage of EU affairs in general. Implications for
   the formation of public opinion and the legitimacy of CFSP are
   discussed. Comparative European Politics (2011) 9, 52-75.

Volume = {10},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This article discusses left-libertarian justifications of basic income.
   The basic income policy is designed to decouple income from employment
   in the monetized economy by allowing the individual to access, on a
   regular stipulated basis, a grant that is independent of her ability and
   willingness to work for remuneration. This article attempts to amend an
   important failure with respect to the way in which the concept of real
   freedom has been treated in Van Parijs' pioneering defense of the
   universal grant. Van Parijs' defense of basic income does not pay
   substantial attention to the freedom that work-lovers would gain from
   the opportunity to opt out of work, which the grant would facilitate if
   sufficiently generous. Van Parijs' justification of basic income is
   incomplete in terms of the value it places on the opportunity to enjoy
   freedom from employment from the purview of every member of society, not
   only those that will, or might, decide to lead a life (partially)
   outside of work. The article develops the argument that such failure
   results from the fact that Van Parijs' conception of freedom is centered
   on the importance of actual or potential preference satisfaction as
   opposed to non-agent-centered reasons. Contemporary Political Theory

Abstract = {Research on term limits suggests that they have substantial consequences
   for the power of legislatures vis-a-vis the executive and interest

   the actual power of relevant state actors. We contribute to this
   research by examining the effect of term limits on the influence of
   institutional actors conditional on the existing political power
   structure in a state. The inclusion of controls for the direct and
   moderating effect of actual institutional power suggests some
   significant extensions of previous findings regarding the institutional
   effects of term limits.},

Pages = {543-554},
Abstract = {The `referendum autonomico{''}, that is, the appeal to the opinion of
   the electorate in the Autonomous Communities (CCAA), has gained
   notoriety in recent times as a result of its legal treatment in the two
   CCAA certainly most significant: Pais Vasco and Cataluna. In its
   consultative form, both of them have been declared unconstitutional, but
   not, in the case of Cataluna, as referred to mandatory statutory reform.
   This paper analyzes the two decisions of the Constitutional Court about
   the matter, with a critical view of the second one, and notes the
   tendency to breach the order, at least in its most literal and therefore
   more logical, for the consultative referendum desired by the Communities
   because of its obvious political significance.},

Abstract = {This article empirically investigates relationships between voter
   fractionalisation and economic inequality, measured by the Gini
   coefficient of income inequality and a new index of fractionalisation
   developed for this study. Our main findings are as follows. States with
   high income inequality have less voter fractionalisation. States with
   higher GDP per capita have more voter fractionalisation. States with
   high election thresholds for parliamentary representation have less
   voter fractionalisation. Eastern European states and states with high
   unemployment rates have more voter fractionalisation. States with
   greater ethnic fractionalisation have less voter fractionalisation.
   Fractionalisation has been greater in recent decades (2000s and 1990s)
   than earlier decades (1980s).},

Abstract = {Since the 1960s Spain has suffered a terrorist campaign by ETA, a group
   that has espoused an ethnonationalist ideology with which it has
   justified terrorism in pursuit of its aims. ETA's campaign has also been
   marked by an international dimension. The international environment
   inspired many activists, and ETA has attempted to develop an
   international network of political and operational support throughout
   its campaign. International perceptions of ETA's violence have also
   decisively influenced its campaign in parallel with the evolution of the
   most recent wave of international terrorism. Therefore, this article
   will analyze the international sphere's influence upon ETA's strategy.},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {A number of recent studies have documented weakening ties between social
   democratic parties and trade unions. This article is concerned with the
   effects of weakening party-union ties on policymaking. In many classic
   studies of corporatism it has been argued that this mode of policymaking
   depends on strong ties between social democratic parties and trade
   unions. In this article, we argue, in contrast, that strong party-union
   ties are potentially detrimental to corporatism, because in a polarized
   political environment unions may be tempted to exert political influence
   via political allies instead of bargaining with their counterparts. In
   order to evaluate this argument empirically, we present a detailed
   analysis of two countries with strong corporatist traditions (Denmark
   and Sweden) from the 1970s to the 1990s.},

Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {48},
Number = {3},
Pages = {501-518},
Abstract = {Spain is a country with no immediate historical connection to the
   Holocaust. However, in recent years discussions about the Holocaust have
   gained a more significant presence in Spain's public life. This
   irruption of the Holocaust in the spheres of politics, education and
   culture can be explained as a consequence of political and institutional
   convergence with Europe as well as of the growing debate over the memory
   of the crimes of the Franco dictatorship. Using as its basis theories of
   cosmopolitan and transnationalized memories (Levy y Sznaider 2002,
   Jeffrey Alexander 2002, Huyssen 2002), this paper approaches the memory,
   or the memories, of the Holocaust in Spain. The globalized significance
   of the Holocaust permits different groups to define their own traumatic
   experiences by creating parallels with the Holocaust, it allows
   projections and comparisons of different types, and triggers significant
   resistances and rejections. This essay also argues that the unfortunate
   historical link to everything related to Jews in Spain, the effects of
   which are still present, shapes the ways the Holocaust is remembered in
   contemporary Spain.},

   in Armenia},
Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {529-542},
Abstract = {Using the example of the right to housing, this article addresses the
   ways in which the practice of social citizenship, including popular
   claims and expectations and actual state provisions, has changed in
   post-Soviet Armenia. It examines the claims of Armenian refugees from
   Azerbaijan to state-provided permanent housing, which they consider the
   key condition for becoming `citizens' and `locals' in Armenia, and the
   Armenian state's solutions to the housing issue following the collapse
   of the Soviet Union. It demonstrates how the Soviet-era housing policy
   has left its mark on current notions and practices of social citizenship
   in Armenia. Even though social rights in general have decreased, notions
   of social citizenship are still present not only in the expectations and
   claims of needy refugees and citizens without housing but also in the
   state's acknowledgement of responsibility for its citizens' welfare (
   though currently providing only for those in extreme need), and in the
   equalising effect, the state housing programme has had for the majority
   of refugees who participated in it.},

Title = {Confidence in the Judiciary: Comparing the Independence and Legitimacy
   of Judicial Systems},
Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {34},
Number = {2},
Pages = {317-345},
Abstract = {This contribution investigates the determinants of judicial confidence.
   It argues that this is the decisive source of legitimacy for the third
   branch. Fairness and impartiality, i.e. the independence of the
   judiciary, are paramount in fostering citizens' confidence in the
   justice system. Through several multilevel analyses, the study tests
   whether judicial independence promotes the development of an
   individual's confidence in the justice system. The results show that
   judicial independence has a positive impact on the development of
   individual trust. However, public beliefs about the trustworthiness of
   judicial institutions do not seem to originate from constitutional rules
   (de jure independence) but from actual events and real life experiences
   (de facto independence).},

Abstract = {In a seminal article, Cox (1990) suggested that electoral systems with
   larger district magnitudes provide incentives for parties to advocate
   more extreme policy positions. In this article, we put this proposition
   to the test. Informed by recent advances in spatial models of party
   competition, we introduce a design that embeds the effect of electoral
   rules in the utility function of voters. We then estimate the
   equilibrium location of parties as the weight voters attach to the
   expected distribution of seats and votes changes. Our model predicts
   that electoral rules affect large and small parties in different ways.
   We find centripetal effects only for parties that are favorably biased
   by electoral rules. By contrast, smaller parties see their vote share
   decline and are pushed toward more extreme equilibrium positions.
   Evidence from 13 parliamentary democracies supports model predictions.
   Along with testing the incentives provided by electoral rules, results
   carry implications for the strategies of vote-maximizing parties and for
   the role of small parties in multiparty competition.},

Abstract = {Measuring support for democracy in societies where democratic
   institutions do not exist or do not function well is a challenge faced
   by many researchers around the world. In societies moving either toward
   or away from democracy, the very meaning of `democracy' is often in
   question and institutions and practices that go by the label of
   `democratic' may vary widely from accepted norms. As a result,
   respondents are likely to interpret survey questions on democratic
   concepts in unpredictable ways. This article examines some of the ways
   respondents in non-democratic or imperfectly democratic countries may
   misinterpret the meaning of survey questions and consequently how their
   answers may mislead researchers. Previous research has focused on
   problems with abstract concepts like `democracy'. Evidence presented
   here - from interviews with Russians - shows that the problem is broader
   and covers more kinds of questions than previously thought. A strong
   potential for miscommunication also exists with more concrete questions
   about institutions and values, forced choices that encourage respondents
   to change the meaning of questions, and questions about trust in
   institutions.},

Abstract = {This article examines the causes of the financial and economic crisis in
   the Republic of Ireland. It first reviews the crisis in advanced
   capitalist democracies and then situates the Irish case in this context.
   In the section thereafter, it relates existing narratives and other
   evidence to the different theoretical explanations surveyed by Bernhagen
   and Chari (in this issue) in order to identify the most useful
   approaches to explaining the Irish crisis. It concludes that
   explanations focusing on the role of mass preferences and varieties of
   capitalism do not aid our efforts to understand the causes of the crisis
   or how it unfolded. By contrast, an explanation focusing on the role of
   lobbying is of some value, as are analyses of elite integration and the
   structural dependence of the Irish state on a thriving financial and
   property market. The article closes with lessons to be drawn from the
   study, with a particular emphasis on future policy responses and
   remedies.},

Abstract = {The Italian party system has recently been characterized by the
   formation and splits of pre-electoral coalitions. Different broad
   pre-electoral coalitions, which were set up in the scope of the 2006
   national elections, disintegrated for the 2008 electoral campaign. This
   explorative study looks at the policy position of the main party
   coalitions regarding state involvement and social issues in the 2006
   election campaign and their respective partners in the 2008 campaign. As
   such, we investigate where different parties that belonged to the same
   coalition in the previous election locate themselves after
   disintegration with respect to state involvement in economy and social
   policy dimensions. Using the computerized method Wordscores, we find
   mixed results with major coalition parties staying closest to the
   coalition's position on one issue but moving away from the coalition's
   position on the other issue. Minor leftist parties clearly look for a
   niche position after disintegration, whereas different patterns may be
   observed among the rightist minor parties. Acta Politica (2011) 46,

Abstract = {The advancing pace of women's entrepreneurial activity across the globe
   is a promising trend to fuel economic development and social progress
   (Fitzsimons \& O'Gorman, 2005). Analysis of the reasons why women start
   a new business, the choice of product/service, and industry sector
   highlight the home-based female entrepreneur. These entrepreneurs
   constitutes a segment referred to as the mompreneurs-mothers who
   establish a business operated from home. Thus, although mompreneurs gain
   benefits of operating their business from home, they also experience
   additional challenges. One such issue is their dependence on ICT. To
   succeed and grow, mompreneurs' businesses must use ICT as a backbone for
   the business in an integrated manner. In this article, the author
   examines the adoption and application of ICT in the mompreneur business,
   as well as the challenges encountered in its effective use. A specific
   emphasis is placed on the issue of ICT and its use by the mompreneur in
   undertaking business transactions and as a means of facilitating small
   firm growth.},

Abstract = {With the adoption of the European neighbourhood policy (ENP) in 2003,
   the European Union (EU) for the first time introduced benchmarking
   procedures in the realm of democracy promotion, while also establishing
   the principles of `positive conditionality' and differentiation. In
   order to exploit its full potential, however, this strategy must be able
   to define how political development can effectively be measured and
   monitored, along with the benchmarks chosen for this purpose. Applying
   insights of democratic and transition theories to the Action Plans
   concluded with Jordan and Tunisia, the contribution shows that the ENP
   suffers from the absence of analytical depth as far as concepts and
   processes of democratization are concerned, along with an arbitrary and
   largely useless selection of pseudo-benchmarks. While undermining the
   effectiveness of the leverage model of democratization policies, the
   EU's lack of clarity and determination seriously contradicts the
   declared objectives of its democracy promotion policy.},

Abstract = {The crisis in the Catholic clergy in the 1960s-70s has been interpreted
   as a consequence of the generational differentiation of socialization
   ways from the sacerdotal institution. This article reviews this
   interpretation and proposes to think the generation conflict not only as
   the outcome of a generational habitus' struggle, but also as a specific
   battle arena erected by actors explicitly claiming generational
   interests. Indeed, a generation is not merely the product of a specific
   socialization way, it is a social group built out of speeches and
   practices of actors who seize this identification category for
   mobilization purposes. From the example of the Dominican Province of
   France, this article shows how the habitus of clergymen differentiate in
   the 1960s and 1970s, and then how the Order will be plunged into crisis
   in the name of the ``Youngs{''} by a generation of Dominicans accessing
   to leading positions and considering the May 68 uprising as an occasion
   to implement the reforms they wished for.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the development of a tenuous Iraqi national
   identity since the creation of the Iraqi state in 1920. Informed by the
   ideas of Anthony D. Smith, Benedict Anderson and Eric Hobsbawm, it
   argues that various political actors in Iraq have sought to reshape
   historical memory and thus forge a national identity. Despite many
   setbacks and a long series of authoritarian regimes seeking to
   appropriate Iraqiness for their own political purposes, and recently the
   threat from Kurdish irredentism, this article nevertheless contends that
   an Iraqi cultural `ethnicity' has been created over the past nine
   decades.},

Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},

Volume = {15},

Pages = {881-895},
Abstract = {Using diverse conceptualisations of citizenship, this article analyses
   the effect of the accumulation of civic and political assets on the
   transformation of citizenship values among Argentine migrants to Spain
   and returnees. Focusing on the transnational spaces, this article
   analyses important civic and political capabilities accumulated by a
   group of migrants and explores the impact of the assets accumulated in
   the transnational context. This research uses data drawn from 19
   Argentine immigrants to Barcelona and 30 Argentine returnees from the
   cities of Madrid, Barcelona and Palma de Mallorca. Findings indicate
   that the migratory experience generated gains in the civic and political
   capabilities of this group of migrants and returnees and that living in
   Spain promoted the development of a more responsible, analytical and, in
   some cases, active citizenship. As holders of `multiple-perspectives',
   interviewees were in a privileged position to critically analyse both
   the sending and receiving societies. Moreover, respondents implemented a
   number of practices acquired in the host society, in their home society,
   although this transfer generally remained at an individual level.},

Abstract = {This paper is concerned with two senses of disowning in the context of
   climate change and human modification of nature generally. In one of
   these senses disowning is something to be encouraged; but in the other
   sense discussed here, disowning is to be discouraged. Both raise
   problems for liberal theory. There is no space here to do little more
   than indicate some of these problems; consequently the paper is mainly
   negative and critical in tone. Although I focus mainly on the other
   sense, I begin in the first part of the paper with the kind of disowning
   to be discouraged. This is the tendency to deny, or ignore, the
   responsibility we have for - and in that way `disown' - the world we are
   in fact in the process of making including its climatic component. The
   other sense of disowning I go on to discuss mainly in relation to
   Hegel's account of property.},

Journal = {AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {46},

Pages = {617-632},
Abstract = {This article examines the relationship between public opinion and
   foreign policy making in Australia by turning to the findings of a
   national survey of Australian public opinion on the Israel-Palestine
   conflict. The survey findings suggest that the Australian government's
   policy on the Israel-Palestine conflict is inconsistent with public
   opinion, and such disparity is explained here in terms of the lack of
   public attachment to the conflict, the limited media and the absence of
   any notable public advocacy for policy change. This explanation is
   informed by in-depth interviews conducted with current and former
   members of parliament and senior public servants. The article also
   explores the implications of the survey's findings in relation to the
   significant political changes taking place across the Middle East
   region. It suggests that these events may be creating an impetus for
   policy change that endorses Palestinian self-determination, for which
   there is significant support among the Australian public.},

Pages = {374-389},
Abstract = {It is virtually an article of faith for politicians and lawmakers in
   common law countries that there must be ``one law for all.{''} For these
   people, equality under the law means that all people must be treated in
   exactly the same way by the legal system, regardless of differences in
   cultural background or religious belief Among neighboring countries in
   Southeast Asia, this is not the case. Legal pluralism exists in
   Malaysia, with a formal system of Shari'a for Muslims and a separate
   system of Shari'a courts. Additionally, native courts exist to resolve
   problems relating to members of indigenous communities. In Indonesia,
   Shari'a courts exist alongside the civil courts to hear family law and
   inheritance matters relating to Muslims. In some areas of Indonesia,
   broader Shari'a laws and regulations have been introduced. Islamic
   finance flourishes in both countries with its own structures and
   regulations. Adat (customary) rules also continue to exist alongside the
   formal legal system. Thailand and the Philippines also have multiethnic
   and multireligious populations and at least some recognition of
   pluralism in their legal systems. Legal pluralism is not without its
   difficulties. There have been problems of jurisdiction, difficulties in
   deciding whether a person belongs in a particular category subject to a
   certain law, and questions of what to do when a person evinces a desire
   to leave a category and what to do with cases involving persons from two
   or more different legal categories. Despite these problems it can be
   argued that in Malaysia, at least, legal pluralism works reasonably
   well. This article examines the origin of legal pluralism in Malaysia,
   Indonesia, and Thailand and outlines ways in which governments have
   sought to deal with the challenges it presents.},

Abstract = {This paper uses Sayyid's concept of Eurocentrism to analyse
   neoconservative media discourse following the September 11 attacks.
   Using predicate analysis on articles from The Weekly Standard magazine,
   this study aims to determine how neoconservative writers created a
   Muslim subjectivity following the attacks in order to make certain
   courses of action appear necessary and inevitable. Four subject
   positions emerged from the analysis: passive Muslims, active Muslims,
   the passive West, and the active West. By containing and controlling the
   representation of `Islam' and `Muslims' through these binaries,
   neoconservatives endeavoured to stabilise the identities of the players
   in the `war on terrorism', and in doing so, advanced a Eurocentric
   discourse that attempted to re-centre the West as the vehicle of human
   progress, with America as its natural leader. This paper concludes that
   basing the `war on terror' entirely around identities effectively made
   Eurocentrism (and Islamism) self-reinforcing, as the successful
   restriction of identities precluded challenges to the neoconservative
   discourse from any position other than a `Muslim' subjectivity.},

Abstract = {The article sheds light on the activity of ETA - one of the oldest
   radical nationalist terrorist organizations in the Western Europe. The
   author elaborates on the sources of Basque radical nationalism and
   reasons for ETA formation, its ideological-political attitudes, strategy
   and tactics, main stages of its activity. The main focus is on
   unraveling psychology of terrorism. The article indicates that ETA
   entered the second decade of the 21st century at its weakest state ever.
   The author concludes that regardless of the future destiny of this
   organization, the rough confrontation between the Spanish central power
   and radical Basque nationalists will remain, but from now on it will be
   developing within the constitutional-legal framework.},

Title = {`Miniature Campaigns' in Comparison: The German Televised Debates,
   2002-09},
Journal = {GERMAN POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Pages = {75-91},
Abstract = {Given that US-style televised debates were held for the third time in a
   row in a German federal election campaign, it seems fair to say that
   they have become an institutionalised feature of German campaigns.
   Although a number of studies have analysed (single) German debates,
   comparative work covering the full set of debates is still lacking. The
   aim of this paper is to reveal patterns and trends in a) debate
   exposure, b) the evaluation of the candidates' debate performances and
   c) debate effects. To this purpose, a pooled data set for the 2002, 2005
   and 2009 debates is analysed. Consistent evidence is found that
   cognitive as well as partisan mobilisation increases the probability of
   watching debates. Concerning the impact of debates, it is found that
   debate exposure has a mobilising effect - especially among those less
   interested in politics. In addition, we find a considerable impact of
   debates on party choice - with the effects reflecting patterns of
   `reinforcement' as well as `conversion'. The greatest debate effects can
   be observed for independent voters. Given these results, televised
   debates are not only an institutionalised feature of German campaigns,
   but also a powerful and hence possibly decisive one.},

Abstract = {Democracy is usually identified with openness, order and pluralism and
   thus peace. Yet, everywhere, from the political convulsions that bring
   it into being to the wars that aim to extend it, democracy is violent.
   Usually this violence is seen as accidental or forced upon democracy.
   The aim of this paper is to argue that the violence of democracy springs
   from its inextricable if denied relationship to revolution, the drive to
   re-found the political order properly and definitively. Through a
   reading of Derrida's account of the relationship between violence and
   justice in Walter Benjamin, violence is identified as the unstable
   founding moment which democracy must both pass through in order to
   emerge and also endlessly recall in its drive to both expand and
   complete its mission.

Abstract = {Considered in the article is the philosophical conception of
   ``deliberative policy{''}, elaborated by adepts of discursive ethics in
   German philosophy: J.Habermas and K.-O.Apel. The author of the article
   is rendering the history of the concept, its basic conceptual aspects
   and the very normative approach, within which the theory of deliberative
   policy appeared. That is followed by the conclusion that the conception
   of deliberative policy presents a topical stage of the social
   communication development and of democracy evolution.},

Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {33},
Number = {4},
Pages = {413-427},
Abstract = {During the Great Recession, debates concerning Franklin D. Roosevelt's
   New Deal have focused on stimulus packages: were the New Deal packages
   effective and by corollary, given the current economic crisis, what can
   we learn from the past? While the stimulus programs of the New Deal Era
   were an important element, more significant were the set of political
   commitments that forged the basis for a new and more democratic
   political economy as well as a transformation in the meaning of
   liberalism. The New Deal regime of political economic commitments,
   lasting from roughly 1932 until the late 1970s was a democratic
   interlude compared with the laissez-faire and managerial liberal regimes
   that prevailed for most of the fifty years before the New Deal and the
   neoliberal regime of the past thirty years since. Under the New Deal
   regime there were more labor rights, less Supreme Court intervention in
   the economy, more public accountability in the structure of financial
   institutions driving the political economy, and a more equitable
   distribution of wealth. The nature of the institutional response offered
   by the New Deal and the vision proposed by FDR's Economic Bill of Rights
   is important. The greatest crisis of political economy since the 1930s
   cannot be remedied by mere changes in policy. Institutional change must
   be addressed.},

Title = {Cashing in on climate change: political theory and global emissions
   trading},
Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {14},
Number = {2},
Pages = {259-279},
Abstract = {Global climate change raises profound questions for social and political
   theorists. The human impacts of climate change are sufficiently broad,
   and generally adverse, to threaten the rights and freedoms of existing
   and future members of all countries. These impacts will also exacerbate
   inequalities between rich and poor countries despite the limited role of
   the latter in their origins. Responding to these impacts will require
   the implementation of environmental and social policies that are both
   environmentally effective and consistent with the equality and liberty
   of populations to which they are applied. This article considers whether
   global emissions trading, namely, the creation of a global market for
   tradable allowances conferring the right to emit a certain amount of
   greenhouse gas over a specified time period, is normatively defensible
   from a liberal egalitarian perspective. After a brief review of the
   theory and practice of emissions trading, a number of normative
   objections to the international trade in emissions allowances are
   analysed. These objections appeal to one, or a combination, of two
   claims. First, emissions trading schemes are likely to produce
   undesirable outcomes, such as environmental neglect, in the further
   future. I call these `instrumental objections'. Second, emissions
   trading schemes violate non-consequential norms of justice and fairness.
   I call these `intrinsic objections'. It is argued that, when combined,
   instrumental and intrinsic objections indicate that instituting a global
   network of emissions trading schemes, as envisioned by a number of
   parties to the Kyoto Protocol and Copenhagen Accord, would be
   illegitimate in absence of significant procedural and consequential
   safeguards.},

   inter-confessional relations at the city and republic level, S.
   Peregudov comes to the conclusion that none of the solutions to the
   existing ethno-confessional controversies in Russia that are offered
   today will lead to a desired outcome, but they can exacerbate the
   situation. According to his conclusion, elaboration of a functioning
   strategy of inter-ethnic agreement given today's political reality is
   possible only within the framework of a constructive dialogue between
   the champions of the idea of the renewed Russian great power statehood
   and proponents of different models of multiculturalism.},

Abstract = {Economics presents capitalism as a harmonious society made coherent by a

   that view, showing how economists structured their abstract theory in
   terms of transactions in order to eliminate any consideration of the
   conflicts and contradictions within capitalism. To make this point, the
   article includes examples, such as the United States Federal Reserve's
   efforts to strangle economic growth to keep wages in check, the
   performance of development states, and the repeated bankruptcies of US
   railroads during the nineteenth century.},

   alternative vision of pragmatism, indirect approach and strategic
   manoeuvre. Though outwardly an appealing view, particularly in today's
   era, it does contain within it crucial deficiencies. Regardless, Liddell
   Hart's undisputable legacy has been sparking and framing the rich debate

Journal = {CIVIL WARS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {13},
Number = {4},
Pages = {414-436},
Abstract = {Although the Lebanon of post 2005 is similar in many respects to the
   Lebanon of the 1950s and 1970s, this article demonstrates that between
   2005 and 2011 the country was in less danger of the outbreak of civil
   war than in 1958 or in 1975. The political circumstances that prevailed
   in 1958 and in 1975 had made the outbreak of a civil war in the interest
   of political actors. The introduction of some of the reforms introduced
   by the Taif Accord since 2005 made many actors more likely to use
   constitutional methods to resolve conflicts. When these methods failed,
   the protests were either peaceful or violent, but over short periods of
   time. On many occasions these protests brought the country to the brink
   of civil war. Nevertheless, these protests did not escalate into
   large-scale or long-term communal militant violence. This was not
   because of a sense of war weariness but because of the influence of the
   prevailing political circumstances that made the outbreak a civil war
   appear to be a strategic error.},

   example},
Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {499-512},
Abstract = {Increasingly, struggles in the name of citizenship inspire and catch the
   imagination and support of individuals and groups found in a variety of
   locales within a nation as well as transnational spaces. At the same
   time, their consequences may be quite different from the assumptions and
   dreams of those involved in perpetuating and imagining these struggles.
   To analyse how new social citizenship claims can embolden and channel
   struggles in particular directions with varied results - the promise and
   perils of citizenship more broadly - I suggest that one should pay
   attention to the promulgators of such visions of citizenship, the
   techniques of promoting their claims and the cultural politics and
   political economies of belonging in the locales of mobilization. Drawing
   on an ethnographic example of a farm labour struggle in the late 1990s
   in Zimbabwe, I explore the importance of attending to wider shifts in
   the political importance of citizenship as well as its entanglement in
   particular localities. Through examining how farm workers are situated
   through such struggles, I show the promise and limits of citizenship in
   addressing social justice concerns of a group historically marginalized
   through racialized, classed and gendered processes.},

   China},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CIVIL SOCIETY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Pages = {101-118},
Abstract = {This article examines the Chinese scholarly discourse about promoting
   civil society, constructing urban and rural communities, and
   transferring social service provision to society. It finds that this
   discourse treats two separate models as if they were one. The civil
   society model stresses freedom to organize for advancing the aims that
   participants share. The community building model emphasizes community
   governance and empowerment. Together, these two models expect both the
   state and society to strengthen their presence in the same communal
   space. These two models have theoretical inconsistencies, but these
   inconsistencies disappear if civil society is understood in the very
   narrow terms of the ` small government, big society' model in which the
   state wants to reduce its own economic burdens in social service
   production. It is thus likely that in China civil society either remains
   secondary to the state-initiated channels of social and political
   participation in communities, or takes place mainly on the regional or
   national scope in which civil society organizations no longer compete
   with communal ones.},

Abstract = {The article aims to explain why, despite not having joined as a member
   of the European integration process, Norway has decided to strengthen
   cooperation with the European Union on issues related to post-Cold War
   international security. The central argument indicates that, though the
   state shares a set of values and principles with the bloc's member
   countries, the preservation of autonomy in relation to other European
   countries was one of the consolidated elements in the construction of
   its international identity. However, given the challenges to
   international security after the end of the bipolar world, Norway has
   shown interest in cooperating more with the bloc, but this has not
   changed substantially its Atlanticist identity in the security area.},

Abstract = {Scholars find that political elites are badly polarized over a large
   range of policy issues, but they tend to agree that the mass public is
   much more ambivalent. The abortion war in particular is regarded as one
   in which millions of ambivalent citizens are caught in the crossfire of
   polarized activists. Yet even abortion activists struggle to escape the
   very ambivalent sentiments that plague ordinary Americans. These common
   sentiments even exert a moderating influence on both movements in ways
   that are consistent with the preferences of the American public. They
   also suggest that liberalism may be mired in permanent conflict and
   ambivalence over the scope of basic human rights.},

Abstract = {This article is about a modern public sector steel plant in the state of
   Orissa and its promise to set standards for post-colonial India's
   citizenry at large. These steel plants were to provide their workforces
   with superior social and economic citizenship rights, which in turn were
   to serve as exemplary industrial relations for the industrialising
   nation. The steel plants were also intended to forge multi-ethnic
   workforces into exemplary Indian citizens by transcending their manifold
   ethnic differences. The trajectory of the public sector steel plant in
   the town of Rourkela confirms that enhanced social and economic
   citizenship rights detached public sector steel workforces from labour
   at large and produced a `labour aristocracy'. The trajectory,
   furthermore, reveals how in Rourkela policies designed to accommodate
   ethnic differences constantly recreated these differences and hampered
   the access of large sections of the local population to these enhanced
   social and economic citizenship rights.},

Volume = {18},
Number = {3},
Pages = {823-846},
Abstract = {The viability of the thesis that liberalization and democracy foster
   peace, security and development is at stake. The main critique is that
   more liberties and elections lead to more conflict and abuses of power.
   There are three principal responses to this critique. The liberal
   argument calls for improving the democratic institutions; the
   institutions first thesis prioritizes strengthening the rule of law and
   state capacity over democracy; whilst the transformation argument
   proposes using fledgling democracy to foster gradually more favourable
   relations of power and popular capacity towards more substantial
   democracy. This article analyses the relevance of these theses to the
   remarkable dynamics of peace-building in Aceh, from the introduction of
   Indonesian democracy in 1998, the impact of the tsunami in 2004 and the
   Helsinki peace agreement in 2005 to the general elections in 2009. The
   study concludes that the liberal argument is congruous with the
   democratic opportunities for peace, while the institutions first and the
   transformation arguments give prominence to the dynamics that made
   peace-building possible but also difficult. While the institutions first
   argument responds to these difficulties by resorting to power sharing,
   the transformation thesis proposes more citizen participation coupled
   with interest and issue group representation.},

Abstract = {This article evaluates China's role in Africa. Its objective is to
   determine the possible benefits and drawbacks for the continent of
   China's engagement, and to establish whether there might be wider global
   implications. The focus of inquiry in the African context falls on the
   specifics of the ways in which China does business on the continent.
   This is contrasted with the West, whose engagement with Africa has been
   vastly different both historically and in business practice. The aim is
   to assess which of the two approaches might hold more promise for
   Africa's development. In the wider context, of particular interest are
   the origins and the essence of the multilateral component of the current
   Chinese foreign policy, which holds the potential to effect a change in
   the global balance of power, especially in the context of the Great
   Recession. The discussion is set within a historical context.},

Abstract = {From its foundation in 1911 the EEDF (Eclaireuses et Eclaireurs de
   France) movement has been officially fostering a citizenship education
   project matching a normative model inherited from the French Third
   Republic. EEDF is thus a site to understand the main features of the
   French citizenship education arena. First and foremost this volunteer
   group stands at the core of a childhood policy, a field that has been
   progressively institutionalized and nationalized during the twentieth
   century. An ethnography of daily practices implemented within this
   policy framework brings to the fore the symbolic importance of the
   nation-state as the horizon in citizenship education. In this volunteer
   sector, individuals have internalized narratives about the decline of
   state and publicness. The daily work of this group reproduces some of
   the evolutions of public action in a shifting landscape: especially the
   increase in security claims and tensions over group identity.
   Citizenship as an indigenous resource is not mobilized in any innovative
   or `new' form. It sticks to a mere orthodox (conservative)
   understanding: conventional political participation and dedication to a
   consensual conception of the collectivity and common good. This
   anthropological case study of citizenship questions the relevance of
   using citizenship as a concept to address political subjectivity and
   collective commitments in the French context.},

Abstract = {This article takes the point of view of the irrelevance of the debate
   about whether or not Spain is a federal state. Spain is a regional State
   with peculiar characteristics, but share many traits with the federal
   states and one of them is to establish the participation of the
   Autonomous Communities within the central organs of the State. In this
   sense, the article analyses the participation of the Autonomous
   Communities in the Senate, the regional legislative initiative before
   the Cortes Generales and the proposal of the Parliaments of the
   Autonomous Communities in the Senate election of the judges of the
   Constitutional Court (unconstitutional for the author, although accepted
   by the Constitutional Court). It also criticizes of the regional
   Councils of the Judiciary, not constitutionally provided but established
   in some Statutes of autonomy.},

Abstract = {The Niger Delta region of Nigeria has been engulfed by oil-related
   conflict for over two decades now, and concerns pertaining to Nigeria's
   national security, economic stability, and global energy security have
   been brought to the fore of global discourse. This paper reflects on the
   character and dynamics of oil turbulence and in particular the
   transformation of the conflict from a community protest against oil
   industry operations to insurgency and the counterinsurgent responses by
   state security forces. The article indentifies the availability of arms,
   endemic corruption, state violence, patterns of corporate practice, and
   the politics of oil revenue distribution as central to the origins of
   the contemporary crisis. The paper interrogates the amnesty program and
   draws attention to incomplete disarmament, poor post amnesty
   rehabilitation, and political contradictions as possible threats to its
   success.},

Abstract = {In the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Citizens United v.
   Federal Election Commission, supporters of campaign finance reform
   argued that American politics would soon be awash in corporate cash and
   that public policy outcomes would reflect the desires of big business.
   Using event study methodology to isolate the effect of Citizens United
   on firms' stock prices, this article finds that the financial markets
   did not share this view. Rather, key events in the case did not
   significantly affect the share prices of those large firms heavily
   engaged in and sensitive to politics, suggesting that investors expected
   the decision to have no effect on political and policy outcomes of
   concern to corporate America.},

Abstract = {Germany, Great Britain and France stated their interests in Central Asia
   immediately after the disintegration of USSR. In 1994 and 1995 the
   policies of the leading European countries towards Central Asia stressed
   the restraining of Russia's neo-imperial ambitions in the post-soviet
   space and the support of economic independence of Central Asian states.
   As of late 1990s the regional policies prioritized fighting the drug
   threat and after September 11, 2001 -the terrorism threat. The article
   reveals specific interests and country priorities of the leading
   European states in Central Asia and the differences in the gen-eral
   approach to the region and in the actual policies including the amounts
   of resources spent. The author argues that Germany occupies the most
   solid place in Central Asia due to a set of political, economic,
   military and humanitarian interests, though in general the regional
   policies of Germany, Great Britain and France lack any particular
   interests and standpoints, that could hinder the formation of the joint
   EU policy in the region.},

   this area, the current study extends the literature in at least three
   ways: (1) it is one of the first studies that investigates the problem
   of a potential sample selection bias-as a result of the fact that
   countries taken up in the analysis are not randomly sampled from all
   countries in the world; (2) it considers third-country effects that
   follow from the fact that China's relation with any two countries is
   affected by the relation between these countries themselves; and (3) it
   tests the impact of five political arrangements simultaneously, which is
   more comprehensive than any former study. By using data as to 78 of
   China's trade partners over the 1950-2002 period, this study provides
   empirical evidence for the hypotheses that the establishment of
   diplomatic relations, cooperation, visits of heads of states and
   political system similarity are associated with greater trade flows. The
   hypothesis that member countries of a Preferential Trading Agreement
   have had smaller trade flows with China, which is no member of any of
   these Preferential Trading Agreements, is not supported by the results.},

Abstract = {The paper examines determinants of electoral entry and success of ethnic
   minority parties in central and eastern Europe. The application of a
   hierarchical selection model shows that the strategic entry of minority
   parties depends on their expected electoral success due both to observed
   and unobserved factors. Drawing on formal models of electoral entry, the
   electoral success of new (or niche) parties is expected to be influenced
   by the costs of entry (determined by electoral thresholds) and the
   potential for electoral support. The latter depends on the reactions of
   political competitors and electoral demand, measured here as the size of
   ethnic groups and the saliency of ethnic issues. In line with these
   expectations, parties only run if they can expect electoral support
   sufficient to pass the electoral threshold. This finding would have been
   overlooked by a naive model of electoral success which does not take
   self-selection into account. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The Political Ecology of Opinion in Big-Donor Neighborhoods},
Journal = {POLITICAL BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {33},
Number = {4},
Pages = {565-600},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Major campaign donors are highly concentrated geographically. A relative
   handful of neighborhoods accounts for the bulk of all money contributed
   to political campaigns. Public opinion in these elite neighborhoods is
   very different from that in the country as a whole and in low-donor
   areas. On a number of prominent political issues, the prevailing
   viewpoint in high-donor neighborhoods can be characterized as
   cosmopolitan and libertarian, rather than populist or moralistic.
   Merging Federal Election Commission contribution data with three recent
   large-scale national surveys, we find that these opinion differences are
   not solely the result of big-donor areas' high concentration of wealthy
   and educated individuals. Instead, these neighborhoods have a
   distinctive political ecology that likely reinforces and intensifies
   biases in opinion. Given that these locales are the origin for the
   lion's share of campaign donations, they may steer the national
   political agenda in unrepresentative directions.},

   promoting the use of this resource related to the objectives of
   development Goals, MGs, as proposed by the United Nations Development
   Programme, UNDP. Data is also provided regarding the broadband in
   Mexico, availability of factors support the view that there exists a
   digital division in this area and the absence of public policies
   consider it a factor of development. Working together explains beyond
   broadband access and positioned as a key player in processes of
   technological appropriation that encourage social and cultural changes.},

Abstract = {The ``axis-shift{''} discussions on Turkish foreign policy activism over
   the last couple of years have attracted remarkable international
   attention. Some pundits have attempted to place Turkey's increasing
   relations with its neighbors within the context of an ideological and
   identical reshuffling of Turkish foreign policy principles. While
   finding the ``shift of axis{''} argument a rather crude
   characterization, the paper nevertheless argues that there are subtle
   shifts in Turkish foreign policy orientation. In this context, the paper
   aims to identify both the elements of continuity and rupture in the
   style and behavior of Turkish foreign policy. In fact, there are solid
   political economy fundamentals and legitimate reasons for Turkey to
   pursue a multi-dimensional and more assertive foreign policy in the
   emerging multi-polar world system. However, the present paper underlines
   that Turkey's multi-dimensional foreign policy activism with no firm
   axis may have potentially counterproductive consequences regarding
   Turkey's long-term national interests as well as its ability to play a
   stabilizing role as a pro-active and benign regional power.},

Abstract = {The U.S. military's ``don't ask, don't tell{''} (DADT) policy has been
   controversial since its adoption in 1993. The policy has been criticized
   as discriminatory for tolerating or fostering homophobic attitudes and
   behavior, and as detrimental to military effectiveness. This article
   examines the results of recent votes in the U.S. Congress to repeal DADT
   to identify factors that may predict members' votes on morality issues,
   such as DADT. Our results demonstrate that the members' political
   ideology and the political party preference of the members' home
   district or state are strong predictors of how the members voted on
   repeal of DADT. For members of the House of Representatives, freshmen
   members were more likely than their colleagues to vote in ways that
   coincided with the political preferences of their home district.},

   regime of Saddam Hussein. They both used the multilateralism to
   establish economic sanctions, no-fly zones and inspection programs on

Abstract = {English political thought of century XVII became a basic element in the
   transition to modern politics perspectives, and one of its essential
   marks the developing of the civic conscience. The modern civic
   conscience did not articulate exclusively from a language tradition, and
   it has articulated from a series of discursive traditions that had
   appeared with the dissolution of the government. The present work has as
   focus the analysis of these languages; we will start analyzing the
   language of the right, and the elements in this language that had
   contributed for the development of the civic conscience. In second to
   place, we will analyze the English apocalyptic thought and the type of
   political action support from this. Finally, we will analyze the
   language of the republicanism and its relations with the previous
   languages, particularly with the language of the right.},

Abstract = {Populism is an enduring feature of Latin American electoral democracies.
   Within the past decade, scholars have witnessed the political ascendancy
   of populist politicians from both the left and right of the ideological
   spectrum. This naturally raises the question as to why populism has
   proven resilient in some Latin American democracies, whereas in others
   political forces have remained relatively moderate and
   institutionalized. This article argues that this phenomenon can be
   explained by varying levels of public trust in the traditional political
   institutions of liberal democracy across the region. Specifically, where
   public trust in political institutions is low, voters will be attracted
   to candidates who portray themselves as radical ``outsiders,{''}
   crusading against the established political order. This hypothesis is
   tested on a new data set of 48 presidential elections, across 18 Latin
   American countries, between the years 1996 and 2008. The statistical
   results provide strong support for this argument.},

Abstract = {Although authoritarian regimes assert control over electoral processes,
   election returns can yield valuable information about dissent. Using
   election data from two votes in Azerbaijan, this article assesses
   hypotheses about the sources of antiregime results. The analysis
   indicates that dissenting votes may be produced by a combination of
   elite interference at the national and local levels, and through the
   expression of citizen preferences under the conditions of a limited
   choice set. Although results must be interpreted with care,
   authoritarian elections may provide useful insights into hidden elite
   conflict and/or citizen grievances. The approach to assessing dissenting
   votes described in the article not only yields information about
   Azerbaijan's internal politics but also could be applied to elections in
   other electoral authoritarian states.},

Abstract = {The literature on authoritarian institutions points to nationwide
   elections as a mechanism for learning about the preferences of citizens.
   In using elections in this way, however, authoritarians face a trade-off
   between gathering reliable information and guaranteeing electoral
   victory. In this article, we explore how single-party regimes manage
   this trade-off and the particular types of information available to
   them. Using candidate-level data from Vietnam, we demonstrate that
   single-party regimes, in particular, forsake information on overall
   regime support and strength of opposition in favor of information on the
   popularity of local notables and the compliance of local officials with
   central mandates. In addition, we show that ex ante electioneering is
   less risky than ex post fraud at achieving these goals.},

Abstract = {Democracy is about including those who are potentially affected by
   collective decisions in making those decisions. For this reason,
   contemporary democratic theory primarily assumes membership combined
   with effective voice. An alternative to voice is exit: Dissatisfied
   members may choose to leave a group rather than voice their displeasure.
   Rights and capacities for exit can function as low-cost, effective
   empowerments, particularly for those without voice. But because
   contemporary democratic theory often dismisses exit as appropriate only
   for economic markets, the democratic potentials of exit have rarely been
   theorized. Exit-based empowerments should be as central to the design
   and integrity of democracy as distributions of votes and voice, long
   considered its key structural features. When they are integrated into
   other democratic devices, exit-based empowerments should generate and
   widely distribute usable powers for those who need them most, evoke
   responsiveness from elites, induce voice, discipline monopoly, and
   underwrite vibrant and pluralistic societies.},

Abstract = {In 2002 the Scottish National Party (SNP) produced a Constitution for
   Scotland, to be adopted by the people in a referendum upon achieving
   independence. This Constitution proposed a range of novel devices, such
   as fixed-term Parliaments, unicameralism, proportional representation,
   the election of the Prime Minister by Parliament and judicial review of
   the constitutionality of legislation, which were alien to the
   Westminster Model-although some of these proposals had already been
   incorporated into the devolved institutions created by the Scotland Act,
   1998. This paper provides a detailed analysis of the provisions of the
   SNP's draft Constitution, from a political rather than legal
   perspective, focusing on the relationships between Parliament, the
   Government, the Head of State and the people. The extent to which the
   draft Constitution represents a rejection of the Westminster model is
   assessed, and the technical shortcomings of the draft Constitution are
   highlighted. The paper concludes with some recommendations for changes
   to the SNP's draft Constitution which could improve the overall design.},

   Identification in Ireland},
Journal = {PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {64},
Number = {4},
Pages = {585-611},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This article analyses the effects of gender, generation and party
   support towards a greater inclusion of women in politics in the Republic
   of Ireland and Northern Ireland. It explores attitudes on this issue
   using the same question in the Irish National Election Study and the
   Northern Ireland Life and Times Survey. The article documents a
   consistent gender gap in both polities that persists across the
   generations, despite controls for socio-demographic factors. It also
   reveals an unexpected generational effect that we explain as the
   enduring legacy of politicisation to women's rights during the 1970s.
   Support among party identifiers for more women in politics follows
   predictable lines, yet gender and generational patterns persist. The
   gender gap and generational patterns found in the two polities on the
   island provide reason for concern among those committed to gender
   equality in representation.},

Abstract = {Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Russia has changed
   fundamentally. During Perestroika, civil society exploded. Since then,
   non-governmental organisations and initiatives have been steady in their
   engagement on the one hand; on the other hand, they are weak and exposed
   to the political climate. Co-operation between NGOs and the state in
   times of a de facto ban on politics is only possible if the illusion of
   the ``unpolitical{''} activity of NGOs is maintained. Now, many
   representatives of civil society see themselves at a fork in the road.
   The renunciation of a fundamental modernization of the economy and
   politics that accompanies Vladimir Putin's return to the presidency will
   have consequences for civil-society.},

Abstract = {Fabio Viti, From slavery to dependency in Africa
   Even after the end of slavery, the African social context is still
   deeply marked by relations of personal dependence. They surface in
   unpaid communal and familial work, a renitence to make use of wage
   labour, and the spread of unpaid employment (for instance
   apprenticeship). A convergence of several different factors resulted in
   generalized long-term devaluation of the work and efforts of producers,
   who never acquired a real status as workers. This picture is not the
   result of an unlikely revival of slavery; it is rather the effect of a
   wholesale failure in developing wage work and the persistence of
   pre-modern forms of personal dependence.},

Abstract = {The literature is divided as to how ethnicity affects wartime patterns
   of violence in civil wars. This article conducts an assessment of the
   relative impact of two competing explanations for violence in Bosnia's
   civil war. One account of this conflict attributes violence to the
   intentions of ethnic groups to create ethnically homogenous territories,
   thus advocating a macro territorial explanation where the origin of
   violence is external to the locations it is perpetrated at. Competing
   theories, however, describe violence in Bosnia as a result of local
   ethnic resentment and fear that were activated once the war had started.
   Results from spatial regression provide evidence for violence ``from
   above{''} and ``from below,{''} showing that there is evidence for both
   macro- and microeffects of ethnicity on violence. In addition, I
   estimate a finite mixture model that is able to tell where and under
   which conditions the respective mechanisms apply best.},

Abstract = {In 2007, the U.S. Senate moved into permanent session to stop President
   George W. Bush from making recess appointments. This article examines
   this episode. We argue that Congress is only able to effectively check
   presidential unilateral powers when the president's use of such powers
   creates high political costs for a sufficient number of members such
   that congressional collective action is possible. Using case studies and
   multivariate analysis, we show that Bush used recess appointments far
   more than his predecessors, creating high political costs for Senate
   Democrats and driving them to find an innovative way to check the power
   of the president.},

Abstract = {There is considerable evidence that local campaign activity is
   positively related both to a party's constituency level vote share and
   to voter participation rates. In this article we consider the degree of
   variance of local campaign intensity at the constituency level in the
   Liberal and New Democratic parties in the 2008 Canadian federal election
   and consider the variables that may explain this variance. Utilizing
   data collected through a post-election mail-back survey of candidates,
   we find significant variance in local campaign activity and identify six
   factors that influence it. These are an objective measure of the local
   candidate's chance for victory in the constituency, the candidate's
   subjective view of their chances, whether the candidate was challenged
   for the local nomination, how involved the candidate is in his/her local
   community, whether the candidate contested the prior election and
   whether party notables from outside the constituency campaigned in the
   riding.},

Abstract = {The development towards a `Europe of the Regions' is accompanied by a
   complex system of cooperation and interdependence between the different
   levels of policy-making. In this article, we ask how European
   integration affects the party composition of regional governments. We
   argue that the European Union (EU) classification system of regions -
   the `Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics' (NUTS) -
   establishes incentives to form similar coalition governments among
   regions that belong to the same NUTS area. We test our argument by
   analysing government formation in the Czech regions and thus in one EU
   member state whose regions benefit financially from EU structural
   policy. The results show that there is empirical evidence to support our
   main hypotheses: even when controlling for variables that reflect
   standard coalition theories and for patterns of party competition in the
   national sphere, we find that coalitions are more likely to form if the
   respective parties are also part of the government in the regions that
   belong to the same NUTS area.},

Abstract = {The emergence of new concerns at national, regional and global levels on
   the sustainability of security in the Middle East and North Africa
   (MENA) has been followed by development of new paradigms for tackling
   instability and insecurity at home, as well as, at our immediate
   neighborhood and at international arena. As for the Middle East, it
   seems that NATO has joined the regional countries to address pressing
   issues such as home security, human security, marine security, energy
   security, environmental security, terrorism; WMDs, missile defense, etc.
   as issues of common concern. However, despite its enterprises for the
   Mediterranean, the `Istanbul Cooperation Initiative (ICI)', and its
   substantive reliance on its public diplomacy apparatus to convince the
   regional countries to accept this approach and facilitate NATO's
   incursion in management of regional security, there are hard evidences
   and certain facts indicating that as far as this approach is not
   inclusive and grass-root, it will be doomed to failure.},

Abstract = {Recent years have seen a shift in methodological emphasis from the
   observable properties of a sample to its unobservable properties, that
   is, judgments about the process by which the data were generated.
   Considerations of research design have moved front and center. This
   article attempts to bridge discussions of experimental and
   quasi-experimental data and of quantitative and qualitative approaches,
   so as to provide a unified framework for understanding research design
   in causal analysis. Specifically, the author argues that all research
   designs aim to satisfy certain fundamental criteria, applicable across
   methods and across fields. These criteria are understood as desirable,
   ceteris paribus, and as matters of degree. The implications of this
   framework for methodological standards in the social sciences are taken
   up in the final section of the article. There, the author argues for a
   best-possible standard of proof that judges overall methodological
   adequacy in light of other possible research designs that might be
   applied to a particular research question.},

Abstract = {The Comparative Manifestos Project (CMP) offers data on party policy
   positions based on a coding scheme of 56 categories. To what extent can
   we replicate the CMP coding results by using computerized topical coding
   of digitalised manifestos? Both human and computer coding have a number
   of strengths and weaknesses so that the combination of strengths could
   help to arrive at both valid and reliable party policy placements, in
   particular the measurement of policy movements over time. More than 1500
   digitalised party manifestos in 20 democracies in the period 1960-2009
   are re-coded with a computerized CMP-compatible coding scheme in order
   to assess the differences with human coding using exactly the same issue
   categories and the same left-right scale.
   The analysis shows that it is possible to use computer coding in order
   to locate the potential weakness of the human coding and the other way
   around. It also illustrates that the validity and reliability of policy
   placements is a function of the conceptualisation and operationalisation
   of issues, of the size of documents and of scale construction.
   Computerized cross-validation of the CMP-coding results offers a new and
   powerful tool to assess its reliability. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {This study expands the literature by examining how the relationship
   between ethnic/cultural, civic, and liberal conceptions of American
   national identity shapes attitudes toward immigrants. Using two
   crosssectional datasets, an ordinal logit model, and predicted
   probability scenarios, I find that an unequal balance (i.e., strong
   favoring of one or more dimensions at the expense of the others) of
   these three different dimensions of national identity results in
   extremely negative or positive attitudes toward immigrants, while those
   that hold moderate levels of these three elements of identity are likely
   to express neutral-to-positive attitudes. I argue that it is the balance
   between these dimensions that is important in shaping individual
   attitudes toward immigrants, making it essential to determine not just
   individual support for each dimension of national identity but the
   support of each dimension vis-a-vis each other.},

Abstract = {In this reply to Jane Mansbridge's ``Clarifying the Concept of
   Representation{''} in this issue (American Political Science Review
   2011). I argue that our main disagreements are conceptual, and are
   traceable to the attempt to treat the concept of representation as a
   ``single highly complex concept{''} as Hanna Pitkin once put it.
   Instead, I argue, it would be more useful to develop the various
   concepts that emphasize the underlying forms of representation. Against
   the view that empirical regularity should guide concept formation, I
   suggest that the failure to find instances of the cases I conceptualize
   is not itself a reason to reject them. Instead, I argue in favor of
   concepts that emphasize one side or other of a relationship, rather than
   treating both sides simultaneously, defending the view that
   ``promissory{''} and ``anticipatory{''} may usefully describe the
   activity of ``representing{''} but ought to emphasize only one side of
   the representative-voter relationship. I also explain why adding
   substantive accounts of representation to any of Mansbridge's modifying
   concepts dilutes their practical value. I conclude by indicating the
   importance of developing concepts that stretch beyond the democratic
   contexts that feature prominently in her response.},

Abstract = {Why do MPs devote attention to some issues while ignoring others? The
   question of the issue content of parliamentary activities has been
   neglected in previous research. The authors use longitudinal data on
   parliamentary questioning in Belgium and Denmark, two similar European
   democracies. The analyses show that the questioning behavior of MPs is
   structured according to clear patterns. Opposition parties ask more
   questions in general. MPs tend to focus on the issues the government
   parties have put forward as being important. Furthermore, MPs ask more
   questions about issues the media have paid attention to and about issues
   their party cares about and identifies with. In their questioning,
   opposition MPs are more strongly influenced by issue ownership and media
   coverage. The Belgian and Danish MPs follow largely the same pattern.},

Abstract = {How does the Prime Minister organize her government so that she can
   implement her policy agenda? In our model, a Prime Minister appoints
   individuals to her cabinet, allocates their portfolios, and assigns
   their policy tasks-that is, she decides the relevant jurisdiction of
   departments and the type of proposals a minister can make. Upon
   appointment, ministers obtain expertise on policies specific to their
   jurisdiction and strategically communicate this information to the Prime
   Minister before a policy is implemented. Assignment allows the Prime
   Minister to implement her agenda even when she is constrained to appoint
   ministers whose policy preferences are far from her own. A Prime
   Minister weakly prefers a diverse cabinet. In equilibrium, the Prime
   Minister is indifferent between delegating policy or implementing policy
   herself.},

Title = {The lobby regulation element of the European Transparency Initiative:
   Between liberal and deliberative models of democracy},
Journal = {COMPARATIVE EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {9},
Number = {3},
Pages = {317-343},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The EU's dependence upon exchanges with organised civil society as a
   proxy for popular participation makes its procedures for participatory
   governance critical for input legitimacy. The most recent of these is
   the European Transparency Initiative (ETI). The article examines the
   development of the lobby regulation element of the ETI, the detail of
   its operation and the concepts upon which it is founded, in order to
   consider its potential to contribute to wider goals of participatory
   legitimacy. The main energies devoted to creating the initiative were
   spent in the struggle to get it established, with relatively less
   attention given to the implications of operational issues involved in
   registration. Although transparency is the main focus, a legacy of
   predecessor initiatives on interest group representativeness, primarily
   spatial in concern, remain embedded in the scheme, which place
   limitations on advocacy-based groups. An alternative regulatory device
   to representativeness is that of accountability, which can be
   accommodated within the EU's existing framework of liberal democracy
   with elements of deliberative overtones, and of which traces can be
   found in the Code of Conduct associated with the registration scheme.

Journal = {COMPARATIVE EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {9},
Number = {3},
Pages = {344-366},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Why did the services directive proposed by Internal Market Commissioner
   Frits Bolkestein lead to such virulent reactions in France? This article
   examines several potential explanations focusing on political economy,
   public opinion and the timing of events. While all of these elements
   contribute to the difficult political context, they are insufficient to
   explain the importance of the backlash against the directive in France.
   We therefore focus on party politics and argue that political elites had
   an interest in exploiting the directive in the context of a leadership
   crisis within the French socialist party. The case study bears lessons
   about the domestic potency of European policy issues: they can pose a
   real challenge to centrist parties, which have insufficiently addressed
   them in their party platforms. Comparative European Politics (2011) 9,

   works is a socially relevant theme combined with an innovative style.
   Roman Senchin's Eltyshevy, Aleksandr Ilichevskii's Pers, German
   Sadulaev's Shalinskii reid, Margarita Chemlin's Klotsvog, and Vladimir
   Sorokin's Metel' could endure, reach readers at home and abroad, and
   perhaps even find their way into the history of Russian literature.},

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {55},
Number = {3},
Pages = {710-723},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {While the role of religion in the public life of contemporary liberal
   democracies constitutes a significant and ongoing topic of debate in
   political theory, scholars have thus far stopped short of addressing the
   root of this contentious issue in the apparent contradiction between
   self-ownership and Divine ownership. I argue that a hitherto unnoticed
   and persuasive means of resolving this contradiction is implicit in the
   thought of John Locke. In fact, one of the more controversial issues in
   recent Lockean scholarship concerns the manner in which Locke's
   assertions of human self-ownership cohere with his prominent theological
   commitments. These two sides of Locke's thought may be reconciled, and a
   potential pathway through the liberal democratic dilemma illumined, by
   elaborating upon a sophisticated theory of ownership that is implicitly
   present in Locke's Two Treatises of Government and his An Essay
   Concerning Human Understanding.},

Abstract = {Did African American voters-drawn to the polls by Barack Obama in
   2008-cast their ballots for him and then vote to ban gay marriage in
   Florida, causing Amendment 2 to pass? Using original survey and
   county-level data, we find the linkage fails to hold. While they tend to
   be less supportive of marriage equality than whites, black surge voters
   in Florida were only slightly more likely to support a ban on gay
   marriage than other likely voters. In addition, we show that although
   counties that experienced large numbers of black surge voters did
   exhibit more support for Obama, they were no more supportive of
   Amendment 2 than other counties. Finally, we demonstrate that black
   voters were not responsible for carrying Florida's gay marriage ban to
   passage, as it would have met and surpassed a 60-percent threshold even
   in their absence.},

Abstract = {The importance of information and communication technologies (ICTs) is
   deduced from the multiple actions realized via electronic data
   transmission and storage media, which range from commercial operations
   between individuals to contracting and/or procedures with the State.
   Nevertheless, uncertainty arises among those who intervene in an
   electronic contract and even those who access government Web sites,
   regarding the existence and scope of protection and juridical efficcay
   for the information handled. The general aim of this investigation is to
   determine the protection or guardianship the Venezuelan State offers for
   electronic transactions through its legislative power, which permits
   renewing confidence in this growing mode for carrying out the needs of
   those who access ITCs. Adocumentary bibliographical study was performed
   applying juridical hermeneutics, which made it possible to demonstrate
   that the State has developed a set of standards to guarantee use of the
   electronic media; however, only when society has been educated and
   technological platforms have been created to assign an electronic
   signature with its associated certificate to every citizen, will it be
   possible to materialize the technological progress foreseen in this
   legislation.},

Abstract = {We examine Machiavelli's critical appropriation of Augustine's analysis
   of Rome's decline and fall in order to understand his own interpretation
   of Rome and the lessons it offers for a successful republic. If
   Machiavelli's departure from Augustine is obvious, as seen for example
   in his exculpation of Romulus for the fratricide Augustine condemns,
   equally illuminating is what Machiavelli borrows from him. For
   Augustine, Romulus' fratricide discloses the limits of pagan virtue and
   politics and reveals that the civic republican view of an early virtuous
   republic is nostalgic if not impossible. Machiavelli agrees with
   Augustine about the character of Rome, yet embraces the ambitious and
   acquisitive politics Augustine rebuffs. Machiavelli not only excuses
   Romulus' fratricide in ``ordering{''} Rome, but makes it the archetypal
   act that must be repeated through ``reordering{''} to sustain the state
   against the perennial problem of corruption. We thereby address two of
   the primary issues in Machiavelli scholarship-the character of his
   republicanism and the nature and extent of his innovation with regard to
   his ancient sources-and suggest that the ``civic republican{''} or
   ``neo-Roman{''} interpretation of Machiavelli is incorrect in its
   conclusions concerning his republicanism as well as his relationship to
   his ancient sources.},

Abstract = {The Deepwater Horizon oil spill was accompanied by intergovernmental
   blame casting and criticisms similar to that of Hurricane Katrina. The
   federal response was often viewed as slow, state officials were unsure
   of their role, and local officials complained that they were not
   adequately consulted. However, natural and oil pollution disasters have
   relief and regulatory regimes based on doctrines different from those
   governing natural disasters. This article discusses those doctrines one
   of which is characterized by ``shared power{''}; the other reflects
   greater federal direction. The balance of national and state powers
   inherent in federalism can also lead to confusion and delay in disaster
   response, particularly when there are overlapping laws and programs and
   unrealistic state and local expectations.},

Abstract = {Current policy developments to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are
   falling behind ecological change. The prevalent policy response to
   mitigate climate change is based on carbon trading mechanisms, which
   after the 2010 U.S. House of Representatives election and the Cancun
   climate negotiations, face an uncertain future. After losing its
   political majority in congress, the Obama Administration has also lost
   its ability to implement a national cap and trade system in the United
   States. The inability of climate negotiators to cement clear GHG
   reduction targets and a firm commitment for a second period for the
   Kyoto Protocol (KP) in Cancun means that the longevity and widespread
   applicability of existing carbon trading mechanisms will remain in doubt
   until the next United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
   (UNFCCC) negotiations in Durban, South Africa, at the end of 2011. These
   recent developments provide impetus to explore additional strategies to
   help achieve climate mitigation and the decarbonization of the energy
   systems of the Americas. Specifically, this article analyzes the
   feasibility of implementing new collaborative agreements such as the
   ``California-Chile Partnership for the 21st Century{''} to advance
   domestic implementation of renewable energy (RE) initiatives. This
   article also examines the potential role that new organizations such as
   the International Renewable EnergyAgency (IRENA) can play in enhancing
   local capacity and policy development in Latin America.},

Abstract = {The way Kosovo is achieving independence has been welcomed with
   antithetical opinions in the international community, especially with
   respect to international law. This paper attempts to shed light on the
   legal trajectory which brought Kosovo on the way to statehood. After
   determining that Kosovo has not, prima facie, any positive right to
   independence, its de facto statehood is contrasted with a few doctrines
   that could contribute to support it, namely self-determination, remedial
   secession theory, and international dispositive powers. The analysis
   finds that Kosovo independence might be legally justifiable under a
   collective recognition theory, possibly supported with remedial
   arguments. Having further enquired over the effectiveness and the
   legitimacy of its independent status (statehood criteria), this article
   contends that such turn of developments in Kosovo is better explained
   through more genuine political reasoning. The validity of independence
   as a solution is not debated in itself, but on the basis of the whole
   process the negative effects of reaching such outcome by the way of a
   one-sided decision are discussed.},

Abstract = {The slow and jobless economic recovery, the midterm elections and the
   passage of healthcare reform legislation dominated the political
   landscape in 2010. The growing momentum behind federal deficit reduction
   and budget cuts provided a stark juxtaposition to the previously active
   federal role in stimulating the economy. Consequently, state and local
   budgets face significant belt-tightening. The cross-cutting impacts of
   these and other significant federal and state policy changes are
   expected to affect future cost sharing in government programs, place a
   higher burden on state and local governments over the long term and
   influence the balance of intergovernmental relations. Many of the
   important developments in politics, policy, and law during 2010-2011 are
   more notable for their potential future impact as opposed to immediate
   impact on American federalism.},

Abstract = {Authoritarian rule in China is now permeated by a wide variety of
   deliberative practices. These practices combine authoritarian
   concentrations of power with deliberative influence, producing the
   apparent anomaly of authoritarian deliberation. Although deliberation is
   usually associated with democracy, they are distinct phenomena.
   Democracy involves the inclusion of individuals in matters that affect
   them through distributions of empowerments such as votes and rights.
   Deliberation is a mode of communication involving persuasion-based
   influence. Combinations of non-inclusive power and deliberative
   influence-authoritarian deliberation-are readily identifiable in China,
   probably reflecting failures of command authoritarianism under the
   conditions of complexity and pluralism produced by market-oriented
   development. The concept of authoritarian deliberation frames two
   possible trajectories of political development in China: the increasing
   use of deliberative practices stabilizes and strengthens authoritarian
   rule, or deliberative practices serve as a leading edge of
   democratization.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to cast light on the role of think-tanks in policy
   making during the New Labour era. It assesses the extent to which the
   Labour government under Tony Blair, in its first term in office, made
   use of policy expertise from think-tanks to shape its social policy
   agenda. This policy field is appropriate for scrutiny because of its
   centrality in relation to New Labour's core values and policy agenda.
   Moreover, Blair's term in office during this period has been referred to
   as `government by think-tanks', leading a number of political scientists
   to ask whether think-tanks as private, government-external institutions
   actually `make a difference'. The article is based on interviews with
   analysts from think-tanks, civil servants and politicians, as well as
   analysis of key documents. The article concludes that Labour, once in
   government, made little use of those think-tanks, which had supported
   the party modernisers in opposition. With the party in government, the
   civil service emerged as the most important actor in the design of
   social policy. A further important finding is that think-tank
   involvement - or the lack of it - in the policy process offers insights
   into broader changes in the British state. British Politics (2011) 6,

Abstract = {The vigor which has characterized the Turkish approach to the Western
   Balkans since the end of the Cold War has transformed the country into
   an important regional actor from its previous position as a distant
   neighbor that showed little interest. Although Turkey and the Western
   Balkan countries have in the meanwhile achieved the most intensive
   relationship since the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, Turkey has not
   yet displayed the economic capacity and political weight that could make
   it compete with the magnetism of the European Union for Western Balkan
   countries. Turkish cultural influence, although significantly widened in
   the lust few years, particularly through investments in educational
   institutions, is mostly limited to the Muslim population in the region.
   While potential EU membership remains the most important driver for the
   political elites in the region, the stalled EU membership prospects of
   both Turkey and the countries of the region might change this in the
   future.},

Abstract = {This article examines a tension within liberal theory by comparing the
   ideas of liberal virtue in the political theories of Michael Oakeshott
   and William Galston. On the one hand, liberal society is pluralistic,
   that is, individuals are free to pursue a variety of ends and purposes.
   Liberals also argue that liberalism requires a bond of shared
   characteristics to sustain social unity. Working through the conceptual
   paradigm of poststructuralism, I argue that Galston fails to resolve
   this problem as he constructs a liberal individuality that is
   `normalized' or defined by conformist standards. Oakeshott, conversely,
   describes a non-normalizing liberalism in which individuals are linked
   by a common bond of virtue. I argue that these different outcomes spring
   from the fact that Galston justifies liberal freedom on the basis of
   `instrumentality' or outcome-orientated considerations, whereas
   Oakeshott links liberalism with the value of non-instrumentality, or the
   intrinsic value of acting. Contemporary Political Theory (2011) 10,

Abstract = {Why did some political parties in the EU member states support and
   others oppose a facultative referendum on the Constitutional Treaty? The
   authors argue that electoral competition played a major role in
   determining how parties positioned themselves with respect to the
   desirability of a referendum. Parties that expected electoral gains
   supported and those that expected electoral losses opposed a referendum.
   The hypotheses that the authors derive from this argument draw attention
   to variables such as public support for the treaty, the closeness of the
   next elections, party size, and public demand for a referendum. An
   original data set that comprises the positions of 176 parties on whether
   to submit the Constitutional Treaty to a referendum allows the authors
   to examine these hypotheses empirically. Using a multilevel logistic
   regression model, they find support for their argument, even when
   controlling for party ideology and institutional constraints.},

Volume = {3},

Abstract = {This article examines contemporary Vietnamese politics and argues that
   many opportunities remain for political rethinking. It examines
   linguistic arguments that point to a perpetuation of traditional
   Communist ideas in two crucial areas-village elections and the treatment
   of ``policy.{''} It then juxtaposes this formal conservatism with two
   areas of tension. First, problems exist in addressing important policy
   questions related to rural development, poverty, and participation.
   These suggest that without major rethinking of fundamental political
   issues, such problems are increasingly hard to address. Second, it
   examines the context of formal politics, looking at evidence for
   successful contestation over leadership positions in villages and the
   rise of informal farmers' groups. Both have often led local officials to
   simple toleration and accommodation rather than exploitation of such
   trends to assist their own repositioning in ways that could gain them
   popular political support. Again, such trends highlight the void in
   formal political rethinking. Both of these areas of tension create
   considerable difficulties for donors and external partners, whose
   approaches are often premised upon both a familiar policy-driven role
   for the state in development and ignorance of local political processes.},

Abstract = {This article calls on the need for scholarly studies to compare and
   contrast the failure of neo-liberal policies in Eastern Europe and the
   Balkans in the 1990s in view of the sovereign debt crises in the
   periphery states of the EU today. It explores the way(s) in which
   ``shock therapy{''} financial statecraft in former Yugoslavia and
   elsewhere did not alleviate the debt problem but, quite the opposite,
   augmented it. The international mechanism in operation in the past, as
   well as today, has not been and is not real development, modernisation
   and growth of the countries that suffer from the debt fetter, but rather
   much-needed depletion of their resources earmarked for the developed
   capitalist metropolises. This is even more pronounced today vis-a-vis
   the decline of the Euro-Atlantic socio-economic system and the rise of
   the ``global East{''} (China, India, Brazil, Russia, South Africa,
   Indonesia, Turkey). The way to recovery for the periphery, as the case
   of a number of Eastern European and Latin American states shows, is
   stimulation of domestic demand via Keynesian instruments while moving
   away from financialisation and neo-liberal engineering.},

Title = {Lost in translation: Centripetal individualism and the classical concept

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY},

Volume = {10},
Number = {2},
Pages = {156-176},

Abstract = {The article argues that by the 17th century, despite the increased
   intellectual exchanges of the time, two different kind of individualism
   were developing across the Channel one labeled here as `centripetal',
   the other one as `centrifugal'. On the French side, one witnesses a
   focus on forum internum, as the only site of uniqueness and
   authenticity. On the British side, the emphasis switched to forum
   externum and the equality of wills. The article explores the
   consequences of these different self-apprehensions of the individual in
   terms of different understandings of political representation. I claim
   that, despite today's general consensus, representing `the people' was
   not naturally assimilated with an ascending theory of representation.
   `The people', understood as a whole, was apprehended in France as still
   higher than its representatives - kings, Estates, or Parlements. The
   idea of individuals willingly delegating their rights and/or authority
   to a representative remained for more than a century a peculiar British
   development. The consequences of this ascending understanding of
   representation are to be seriously reevaluated.},

Abstract = {Mega-events present a special venue for the practice of risk management.
   This article analyses the management of security risks in the case of
   two sporting mega-events, the London 2012 Olympic Games and the FIFA
   2006 World Cup in Germany. To what extent do strategies and practices of
   risk management resemble each other across events? And what explains
   similarities or differences in the tools of risk management observed in
   each of these cases? First, this article explores three theoretical
   explanations for the choice of particular policy tools or instruments.
   Second, it introduces the tools of government approach as a means of
   conducting a direct comparative analysis of risk management across
   political and organizational settings and over time. The tools used for
   security risk management at the two mega-events are then compared and
   the different logics of tool choice are evaluated. This analytical
   approach offers a basis for future comparative inquiry into tools of
   risk management used in public and private organizations. The empirical
   findings highlight the particular importance of national political
   systems in influencing tool choice.},

Abstract = {During the twentieth century, the countries of Central America were
   characterized by remarkably different political regimes:
   military-authoritarianism in Guatemala and El Salvador, progressive
   democracy in Costa Rica and traditional-authoritarianism in Honduras and
   Nicaragua. This article explains these contrasting regime outcomes by
   exploring the agrarian and state-building reforms pursued by political
   leaders during the nineteenth-and early twentieth century liberal reform
   period. Based on differences in the transformation of state and class
   structures, three types of liberalism are identified: radical liberalism
   in Guatemala and El Salvador, reformist liberalism in Costa Rica and
   aborted liberalism in Honduras and Nicaragua. It is argued that these
   types of liberalism set the Central American countries on contrasting
   paths of political development, culminating in diverse regime outcomes},

Abstract = {In the first decades of the twentieth century, the United States
   transformed itself from a commercial republic into a major international
   actor and acquired its first overseas colonies and dependencies. This
   article investigates the role of public-private partnerships between
   American state officials and American financiers in the management and
   expansion of American empire. Confronted with tepid support from
   Congress for further imperial expansion and development, colonial
   bureaucrats looked to investment bankers to accomplish goals for which
   they lacked the financial capacity and political support to achieve
   independently. These partnerships were soon formalized as ``Dollar
   Diplomacy,{''} an arrangement that would govern America's imperial
   strategy in the Caribbean. This article highlights two theoretical
   processes: (1) the downstream effects of congressional delegation
   decisions and their role in motivating institutional adaptations, and
   (2) the formation of public-private partnerships as an alternative means
   of state development, and the unique pitfalls of this approach. To
   illustrate these mechanisms, this article presents historical
   narratives, based largely on archival research, on the emergence of this
   Dollar Diplomacy partnership in the formal American colonies, the spread
   of this system of imperialism to the Caribbean, and its partial collapse
   during the early Wilson administration.},

Abstract = {The mantra of ``evidence-based policy{''} is continuing to gain ground,
   with calls for public policy to be informed by scientific evidence.
   However, in many areas of public policy the role of evidence and science
   is highly contested. This is amply demonstrated in the area of illegal
   drugs policy. Illegal drugs policy, concerned with governments'
   approaches to controlling the sale and use of drugs such as heroin,
   cocaine, and cannabis, is a highly contested area, and hence a fruitful
   case example of the complexity of policy. The features of illicit drug
   policy explored in this paper are: government actors, which span
   multiple departments; political ambivalence and multiple stakeholders
   outside government; community attitudes and a high media profile. These
   features need to be taken into account in understanding the relationship
   between policy and research evidence. In this context, the role of
   research evidence can be fraught. Examination of a number of current
   `hot topics' in drug policy demonstrates the variety of ways in which
   evidence is used in drug policy processes.},

Abstract = {The Rule of Law and its principles are part of the German constitutional
   law and form the basis of the European Union, regardless of any
   divergence in their interpretation among the member states. The Rule of
   Law is a central standard of comparison for the existence and function
   of statehood on an international level, specifically the obligation to
   comply with the law, the separation of powers, the right to a fair and
   effective trial before independent courts and the protection of human
   rights. The Rule of Law is a necessary condition for the ability of
   democracy to function and as well as for a lasting economic development.
   It is tied to cultural requirements that lie outside the law. The
   normative-cultural dimension of human rights imposes partial limits on
   the practical enforcement of the claim for the universality of human
   rights as an element of globalization.},

Journal = {BRITISH POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Individual prime ministers' personalities, leadership styles and
   political skills matter and make a difference. It is important to
   develop ways of understanding and analysing the components of
   prime-ministerial leadership and personal style and skills within a
   framework permitting comparison, generalisation and evaluation. The
   article argues that some of the most influential accounts of the US
   presidency should be explored to assess their potential for enhancing
   our understanding of British prime ministers and the premiership.
   Drawing upon Fred Greenstein's influential analysis of The Presidential
   Difference, the article evaluates Gordon Brown's leadership style and
   skills under six headings: (1) proficiency as a public communicator, (2)
   organisational capacity, (3) political skills, (4) policy vision, (5)
   cognitive style and (6) emotional intelligence. Overall, Brown can be
   seen as someone not well-equipped for the highest office, in terms of
   the key leadership abilities, characteristics and skills that Greenstein
   identifies. This does not mean that he was bound to fail and to go down
   to electoral defeat. But in the situation he and the Labour government
   were in after 2007, it made it very much harder to be successful.

Abstract = {This study examines the influence of constitutional clauses which either
   establish religions (EOR) or separation of religion and state (SRAS)-on
   state religion policy as measured by the Religion and State (RAS)
   dataset's religious legislation variable for 166 states. The results
   show that, even when controlling for structural factors which have been
   shown to influence the level of religious legislation, constitutional
   clauses have a significant impact. However, this influence is small
   compared to structural factors and is limited to the presence or absence
   of EOR and SRAS clauses. The specific wording of these clauses has
   minimal, if any, impact on legislation. This study also finds that
   religious legislation is ubiquitous even in states with SRAS clauses in
   their constitutions.},

Abstract = {This article examines the current state of affairs in the Black Sea
   region by examining Ukrainian foreign policy and its implications on
   regional security. The focus is on Ukraine's security dilemmas and
   regional priorities, which have gone through drastic changes after the
   country's 2010 presidential elections. In order to meet Russian
   interests in the Black Sea region, the new Ukrainian government recently
   took some dramatic decisions. Among them, which were scandalously
   adopted by the Ukrainian parliament, was the president's decision to
   refuse integration into NATO and to extend stationing of the Russian
   Black Sea Fleet in the Crimea. These and other issues are discussed in
   the article, and possible future scenarios in regional politics between
   the regional powers and the USA, EU, and NATO are also examined. The
   success of the European security architecture depends on the extent to
   which the regional and global powers can work to establish a functioning
   security system in the Black Sea region.},

Abstract = {After seven waves of European Parliament elections and European Union
   enlargement to 27 states, the time is ripe to analyse the temporal
   robustness of the second-order model. We pool all the elections in a
   single evaluation and also look at election-by-election variations. We
   analyse changes in party performance over time in all EU states as well
   as in the `original 10', to see whether any cross-time changes are
   driven by the changing composition of the EU. We also look for
   pan-European trends in each election, as a way identifying `European
   effects' distinct from second-order effects. There are few consistent
   winners and losers, although socialist parties performed worse in the
   last three elections than their size and government status would
   predict. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This article critically examines the 1983 British Columbia (BC)
   Solidarity experience, a period that marked the first comprehensive
   neoliberal policy revolution in Canada. It also marked the launch of an
   extensive movement of extra-parliamentary resistance to neoliberal
   attempts to undo social and economic gains achieved during the period of
   Keynesian consensus. The character of this progressive movement of trade
   unions, social groups and civil society was however limited to
   ``defensive defiance{''}. A number of questions are posed such as: What
   was the nature of the resistance to neoliberalism in BC in 1983, and to
   what extent did it succeed? Leftist analysts hotly debated these
   questions at the time, and a review in hindsight of their views is
   instructive. And to what degree have the neoliberal agenda and strategy
   and tactics changed in the ensuing years? Our review in this article
   suggests both a remarkable continuity and some fundamental changes.
   Analysis of these events therefore remains historically relevant to
   those concerned with pan-Canadian political trends.},

Volume = {44},

Abstract = {How do citizens in developing countries access public services? Scholars
   study this question by emphasizing the role of government, measuring
   government performance as household access to public services, such as
   clean water and sanitation. However, the authors argue that the state
   does not hold a monopoly on provision of such utilities: Citizens in
   developing countries often turn to nonstate providers for basic
   utilities. In Mexico, the authors find that direct money transfers from
   migrants, known as remittances, are used to provide household access to
   public services. The statistical analysis across Mexico's 2,438
   municipalities demonstrates that citizens improve their own access. The
   results also contribute new evidence to the literature on remittances
   and development by offering a micro-level explanation for how
   remittances affect both the availability and the source of basic
   utilities. The findings suggest that the measures scholars typically
   associate with government performance may in fact capture nonstate
   provision of basic utilities.},

Title = {Opting Out of an Ever Closer Union: The Integration Doxa and the
   Management of Sovereignty},
Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {34},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1092-1113},
Abstract = {How is sovereignty managed in the EU? This article investigates the
   relationship between sovereignty and European integration through the
   prism of national opt-outs from EU treaties, addressing an apparent
   contradiction in contemporary European governance: the contrasting
   processes of integration and differentiation. On the one hand, European
   integration is increasing as states transfer sovereign competencies to
   the EU. On the other hand, we see a multitude of differentiation
   processes through which member states choose to disengage from the EU
   polity by negotiating exemptions or derogations. Drawing on Pierre
   Bourdieu's political sociology, the article argues that to understand
   how sovereignty is interpreted and exercised in the EU, it is necessary
   to focus not only on the constitutive and regulative dimensions of
   sovereignty, but equally on the practice dimension. This entails an
   exploration of how sovereignty claims are managed in a particular social
   setting. Rather than seeing opt-outs as classic instruments of
   international law, accentuating the member states' unchanged
   sovereignty, the article argues that the management of the British and
   Danish opt-outs quite paradoxically expresses the strength of the doxa
   of European integration, i.e. the notion of `an ever closer union'.},

Abstract = {Based on original interview material, this article addresses the
   organization of unofficial economic activities within the Congolese
   (Democratic Republic of the Congo) police force. In contrast to dominant
   assumptions in security sector reform discourses in the Democratic
   Republic of the Congo, in which property violations tend to be portrayed
   as disorganized, ad-hoc activities, following from irregular and
   insufficient salaries, the article shows how property violations are
   highly organized with large portions flowing upward in the chain of
   command. However, the article also argues for the need to go beyond
   one-dimensional notions of ``unrestrained predation{''} and simplistic
   dichotomies between civilians (victims) and police/military (predators).
   Furthermore, it argues for a more contextual analysis in which the core
   security sector institutions are situated more firmly in the political
   and economic context in which they operate.},

Journal = {POLITIX},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {24},
Number = {94},
Pages = {9+},
Abstract = {This article provides a theoretical reflection on the sociological uses
   of the category of discrimination, paying close attention to its
   relationship with the law. The article promotes a cautious and reflexive
   approach to the notion of discrimination, fully weighing the
   consequences of what a category so heavily marked by law does to the
   sociological analysis of power relations and social inequality. After
   examining the legal framework of discrimination, the article presents
   sociological appropriations of the notion, more specifically in the US
   and in France. These theoretical reflections, in turn, illuminate the
   presentation of the sociological literature on anti-discrimination law
   on both sides of the Atlantic.},

Abstract = {On the basis of the analysis of the situation in the Post-Soviet Siberia
   and Far East the authors show that inconsistencies in the migrant
   policies conducted at different levels are in no small measure caused by
   the fact that these levels target at distinct public fears and social
   interests. They conclude that de facto the migrant policy conducted at
   regions is not anywhere near the federal one or the more or less
   consolidated regional system of migration regulating measures. Almost
   each actor implements his own ``migration policy{''} that is constructed
   according to his own private interests. As a result, there is a
   ``sum{''} of weakly interconnected ``migration policies{''} that only
   nominally fit the Procrustean bed of the federal legislation. Such
   situation allows for the creation of an illusion of being within the
   legal space while in fact pushing the corresponding activity into the
   sphere of informal practices.},

Abstract = {This article examines the detention and deportation of time-served
   foreign-national prisoners in England and Wales. Drawing on penal policy
   and interviews with staff and detainees in prisons and immigration
   removal centres, it critically assesses the growing interdependence of
   the UK Border Agency and HM Prison Service. While the removal of failed
   asylum seekers has generated widespread concern and activism, the
   deportation of foreign ex-prisoners is rarely noted. The foreign
   offender, it seems, has few advocates. For anyone interested in
   immigration control, however, the treatment of foreign-national
   prisoners, both during and after their sentence, is compelling. On the
   one hand, they reveal a wider and deeper border, one that includes penal
   institutions located within the nation-state. Along these lines, the
   absence of citizenship enables harsher and longer punishments, as
   ex-prisoners may be held for considerable periods of time post-sentence
   due to their complex immigration cases. On the other hand, however, the
   treatment of foreign ex-prisoners is not uncontested - prison employees
   and staff within the immigration estate express concern at their
   treatment under Immigration Act powers. In short, this article suggests
   that the detention and deportation of foreign ex-prisoners raise a
   number of troubling questions about both the nature of governance and
   the limits of the liberal project of inclusion in late-modern Britain.},

   workers against abuse. To what extent this approach has achieved social

   migrant activism in Hong Kong, this paper shows the limitation of rights
   in the migrant experience at the same time as it shows how a new
   paradigm based on the Capabilities Approach could provide a more
   appropriate framework from which to achieve social justice for the

Abstract = {The connection between past and present politics manifests itself most
   obviously in the constitution. Diverging trajectories of constitutional
   evolution usually depart from a `constitutional moment' and, therefore,
   are causally tied to formative events that take place early in a
   historical sequence. And yet, while the historical nature of the
   constitution is often acknowledged, studies rigorously applying a
   historical-institutionalist framework to the study of constitutional
   change in federal systems have been few and far between. This article
   probes the value of historical institutionalism for investigating and
   explaining both the origins and patterns of constitutional change in
   federal systems. It taps into three strands within the
   historical-institutionalist literature and asks what each can contribute
   to the analysis of constitutional change in federal systems.},

Abstract = {From 1995 to 2000, transnationally active, New Zealand non-governmental
   organisations and individuals influenced New Zealand nuclear disarmament
   policy in significant and sometimes pivotal ways. During this period,
   New Zealand emerged as a global norm leader, experiencing the zenith of
   its influence on international nuclear disarmament diplomacy. As such,
   the NGO activity examined here also had significant downstream effects
   on international political, legal and normative developments. This
   article broadens the body of empirical data on the work of transnational
   disarmament advocacy. Its findings reinforce and deepen constructivist
   understandings about the importance of non-traditional actors and
   ideational factors such as norms, identity, and ethics in the conduct of
   international relations.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL CRITICAL THOUGHT},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {1},
Number = {3},
Pages = {305-323},
Abstract = {This article analyses the differentia specifica (specific difference) of
   the Post-Soviet School of Critical Marxism in the areas of the
   methodology and philosophy of history and of the sociopolitical process.
   Among the main characteristics of the school, the authors stress the
   importance assigned to the `new' dialectic of the `sunset', genesis and
   transformation of socio-economic systems. Typical of this process are
   (1) non-linear evolution (or involution), including the dialectical
   unity of reforms and counter-reforms, revolutions and
   counter-revolutions; (2) the decline of objective basic determination
   and growth of the role of subjective factors; (3) the multi-scenario
   character of transformations, and so on. Also analysed are the
   contradictions, limits and potential of the social creativity of free
   association, in contrast to `activism'. The authors also provide a
   detailed account of Marxist studies in post-Soviet Russia, and show the
   place occupied by their school within this area.},

Abstract = {In this paper the field of medical sociology in Mexico during the last
   30 years is analyzed. First, a description is made of the three founding
   schools in this country: a) the tradition of medical anthropology, based
   on the National School of Anthropology and History, the Institute of
   Anthropological Research (National Autonomous University of Mexico), and
   the Center of Research and Graduate Studies in Social Anthropology; b)
   the tradition of social medicine, prompted by the Metropolitan
   Autonomous University (Xochimilco) since the creation of the Masters in
   Social Medicine in 1975; and c) the sociology of public health, prompted
   by the National Institute of Public Health since its foundation in 1987.
   Then, the article presents a brief review of the main contributions of
   each school, as well as of the main academic debates between each other
   (which, in turn, helped to define the area of influence of each one of
   them). Afterwards, the main achievements of the ``second generation{''}
   of Mexican medical sociologists are described. A distinction is made
   between theoretical, methodological and empirical contributions. Among
   the later, this article focuses on reproductive health, violence against
   women, subjectivity and health, and health policy, medical practice and
   health services utilization.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on proving some of the earlier published hypotheses
   that criticized the possibility applying the electoral bonus (bonus
   seats) to elections to the Chamber of Deputies in the Czech Republic.
   The results of the Czech parliamentary elections held at the very end of
   May 2010 provide some empirical data for this analysis and help to prove
   that the mechanism of the electoral bonus is not useful in the Czech
   political system. The main reasons for this claim are the hypotheses
   that the electoral bonus should not reinforce the position of the
   government coalition and that it erodes the will of the people, whose
   votes in fact count towards the bonus seat(s) of another party (namely
   that party which receives the electoral bonus).},

Abstract = {The couple is one of the most significant categories of the way that
   mentalities, social behavior, patterns or practices of everyday life are
   being redefined in the post-communist period in Romania.
   Starting from a brief presentation of the state of knowledge about the
   couple in the Romanian secondary literature, the article focuses on a
   double deconstruction.
   First, the author shows that, nowadays, the couple is a discursive
   category, especially visible through the demographic, legal and also
   political discourse.
   Then, life couple is an object of study in the field of political
   sciences that can provide insights into the overall functioning of the
   social and political life in the present period of transition.},

Pages = {695-709},
Abstract = {This article suggests reframing the study of migrant women's mothering
   from a question of integration to an engagement with citizenship.
   Drawing on research with Polish migrants to the UK, it illustrates how
   migrant mothers and children construct complex belongings, referencing
   local, national (UK and Polish), transnational and supra-national levels
   of belonging. Migrant mothers' sense of ethnic distinctness goes hand in
   hand with universalistic discourses of belonging. The notion of
   competent mothering is a key aspect constituting the migrant mothers'
   narratives of `good citizenship'. Their narratives challenge the
   devaluing of their mothering practices as migrants, negotiating not only
   national but also class and racialized identities so that the figure of
   the well-educated Polish child symbolizes legitimate mobility and
   belonging. The article concludes by developing elements of a research
   agenda on migrant women's mothering as a citizenship practice.},

Series = {Research in Social Problems and Public Policy},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {19},
Pages = {247-276},
Abstract = {The Nationwide Suspicious Activity Reporting Initiative (NSI) is the
   focal point of the Information Sharing Environment (ISE), a radical
   reformulation of policies governing government intelligence activities
   within US borders. In the wake of the September 11th attacks,
   long-standing informational norms for the production, use, and
   circulation of domestic intelligence records containing personal
   information are being replaced with far less restrictive norms, altering
   a status quo that had been in effect since mid-1970s. Although the NSI
   represents an unprecedented expansion of human resources dedicated to
   the collection and production of domestic intelligence, it is not well
   known in privacy advocacy community. This chapter considers these and
   other terms in the context of relevant US law and policy, including the
   Privacy Act of 1974, the E-Government Act of 2002, Executive Order
   12333, and 28 CFR Part 23. In addition to describing the federal
   (ISE-SAR) standard, the chapter examines the critical role of guidance
   in the logic of suspicious activity report (SAR) production, and the
   problematic role finished ISE-SARs seem to play in the matrix of federal
   and state-level watch lists. The program, if not properly regulated,
   could pose a considerable threat to personal privacy and the life
   chances and self- determination of all US persons. The chapter considers
   this threat in terms of Nissenbaum's (2010) ``contextual integrity,'' a
   theory of context-relative informational norms.},

Abstract = {This contribution relies on the narration of the stories of Valquiria,
   Maria and Marcela, three women living in Sao Paulo's suburbs, to explore
   citizenship in contemporary Brazil. Based on ethnographic research
   conducted between 2005 and 2009, the text is organised in three parts.
   In the first one, the author justifies his choice of analysis categories
   and briefly discusses relationships between politics and violence, so as
   to give the context of the discussion. The second part is dedicated to
   the description and discussion of the three types of violence that
   affect Marcela, Maria and Valquiria in their personal trajectories. In
   the third part the radically distinct connections between these three
   stories and the established political world are presented, linking this
   difference with experiences of violence.},

Volume = {33},

Pages = {169-188},
Abstract = {Since being forced to resign his high-ranking post at the World Bank in
   2000 for publicly dissenting from neoliberal ideas, Joseph Stiglitz has
   become a global policy celebrity, celebrated as the ``Rebel Within.
   ``While much has been said about his neo-Keynesian policy framework,
   little has been done to explore the political significance of his iconic
   status as a renowned ``citizen-bureaucrat.{''} Yet, Stiglitz's iconic
   image in many ways has had a greater political impact than his policy
   ideas. In a world in which government and corporate bureaucracies
   increasingly squeeze out alternative visions, the citizen-bureaucrat
   suggests that space still exists within these unwieldy bureaucracies for
   the independent-thinker to put forward a rebellious agenda. Through an
   assessment of Stiglitz's policy career, this article argues that the
   image of the citizen-bureaucrat is, to a large extent, an ideological
   fantasy that masks a more uncomfortable political reality: that the
   available options for the ``good bureaucrat{''} in today's neoliberal
   era, far from expanding, are more narrow than ever before.},

   GLOBALISATION: FROM QUIXOTIC CHOICES TO PRAGMATIC BOON FOR EU CITIZENS},
Journal = {POLITICKE VEDY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {14},
Number = {2},
Pages = {64-74},
Abstract = {The citizenship as a socio-legal issue will be addressed regarding the
   capacity of the international system to identify the values of the
   citizens within their community. The crucial issue becomes to localize
   global problems in order to make these more palatable to people, and to
   possibly reinforce any sentiment of belonging. At the same time, the
   construction of a ``Europeanised level{''} in the realm of European
   Media Services industry in the globalisation is subject to regional
   changes and technological disrupting logistics relating to citizenship.
   The solution of globalising local problems as theories (glocal) becomes
   quite old-fashioned, and above all a social contract based on structures
   definitely remedies democratic deficit in pushy and quixotic ways. Its
   implementation has remained patchy in many respects, and needs to be
   adjusted and strengthened. In that respect, the notion of ``cultural
   diversity{''} widely promoted by the European Union as a common good -
   may be useful to formulate public policies relevant to developing
   creative industry as well as promoting EU people values. Citizenship
   should adhere to both the economic vision of global public goods and the
   ethical vision of the common good. Nonetheless, the wizard institutional
   machinery willing to promote a ``knowledge economy{''} in a globalised
   information society may remain only wishful-thinking if media literacy
   is not utilised as a boon in a modern public sphere.},
