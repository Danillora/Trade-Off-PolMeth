Pages = {95-116},
Abstract = {This article examines how the non-party `Yes Campaign' orchestrated the
   successful passage of the 1998 referendum for the Good Friday Agreement
   in Northern Ireland. It argues that the Campaign's use of strategies
   based upon the tenets of prospect theory - focusing on the risks of
   failure rather than the benefits of success - had numerous impacts
   throughout the six-week campaign, ultimately resulting in the
   referendum's passage with enough unionist support to insulate the
   Agreement from some degree of criticism. The article does this by
   tracing the Campaign's main themes and the narratives surrounding their
   use by the Campaign itself, by other pro-agreement individuals and
   parties and by their reflection in voter choices and rationales for
   supporting the Agreement. More than 200 documents were analyzed, largely
   focusing on news accounts, but also including books, journal articles,
   websites, images and interviews with key players in the Campaign.},

Abstract = {State terrorism is a form of terrorism which sometimes occurs when
   governments implement neoliberal policies lacking widespread support.
   From 2001 to 2010, the Philippines experienced a wave of assassinations
   implemented to destroy the infrastructure of the New People's Army, a
   Maoist group engaged in warfare against the state. These killings,
   reminiscent of the Phoenix Program in Vietnam, were initiated to
   eliminate the articulation of a counter-hegemonic project. In studying
   terrorism, it is essential to examine terrorism carried out by the
   states. Terrorism must not be confined to acts committed by non-state
   groups acting against the neoliberal order.},

Title = {Can Compactness Constrain the Gerrymander?},
Journal = {IRISH POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {26},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {513-520},
Abstract = {Gerrymandering - the manipulation of electoral boundaries to maximize
   constituency wins - is often seen as a pathology of democratic systems.
   A commonly cited cure is to require that electoral constituencies have a
   `compact' shape. But how much of a constraint does compactness in fact
   place on would-be gerrymanderers? The author operationalizes compactness
   as a convexity constraint and applies a theorem of Kaneko, Kano and
   Suzuki to the two-party situation to show that for any population
   distribution a gerrymanderer can always create equal ( population)-sized
   convex constituencies that translate a margin of k voters into a margin
   of at least k constituency wins. Thus, even with a small margin a
   majority party can win all constituencies. In addition, it is shown that
   there always exists some population distribution such that all divisions
   into equal-sized convex constituencies translate a margin of k voters
   into a margin of exactly k constituencies. Thus, a convexity constraint
   can sometimes prevent a gerrymanderer from generating any wins for a
   minority party. These results clarify that the heart of the problem with
   outcomes that deviate from proportionality in single member constituency
   systems is not the manner in which constituencies are drawn but the mode
   of preference aggregation.},

Title = {A Conceptual Framework for Major, Minor, and Technical Electoral Reform},

Abstract = {This article advances the study of electoral reform by conceptualising
   major, minor and technical reforms. To do so it treats electoral reform
   as a two-level concept and defines both the scope and the degree of
   reform. The scope is expanded by introducing fivedimensions of reform.
   Regarding the degree of electoral reform, an ordinal scale iscreated
   featuring major, minor and technical reform. The advantage of this
   conceptualisation is that it allows for a more adequate case selection.
   The second part ofthe study assesses the empirical applicability of the
   framework by examining one minor electoral reform in the Netherlands,
   the 1997 legislation on preferential voting. This allows an assessment
   of whether existing theories on major reform are also applicable to the
   study of minor reform. It is concluded that the current theories on
   major reform are not `one-size-fits-all' theories, but apply only
   partially to minor reform.},

Abstract = {Critical terrorism studies (CTS) claims to engage with Frankfurt School
   critical theory to provide a critique of terrorism discourse and to
   develop an emancipatory project. This article argues that CTS makes very

   relations. It also takes an overly discursive approach that fails to
   properly engage with terrorism as a social relation. This piece suggests
   how CTS might make more use of a historical materialism approach
   underpinned by a realist philosophy.},

Title = {A Difficult Dialogue: Statements of Compatibility and the Victorian
   Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities Act},
Journal = {AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {46},
Number = {2},
Pages = {257-279},
Abstract = {As a `third-wave' Bill of Rights, the Victorian Charter of Human Rights
   and Responsibilities Act is premised on the twin goals of creating a
   `culture of rights' within the bureaucracy and the emergence of a
   rights-based dialogue between Cabinet and the Parliament of Victoria
   through statements of compatibility. The first objective has been
   advanced through a revised policy process within the bureaucracy, but a
   dialogic engagement between Parliament and the Cabinet has yet to emerge
   in a substantive way. A number of factors account for this modest
   parliamentary dialogue: first, the functioning of a statutory Bill of
   Rights in a moderately sized Parliament with a strong partisan
   orientation; second, the general reluctance of the Cabinet to alter
   legislation once introduced into Parliament despite compatibility
   disagreements identified by the Scrutiny of Acts and Regulations
   Committee; and finally, the approach by both the Cabinet and
   backbenchers to statements of compatibility that limit their ability to
   facilitate rights-based parliamentary scrutiny. This article explores
   the contemporary difficulties of a parliamentary dialogue emerging in
   Victoria that are, in large part, the result of an unintended tension
   between pre-introduction scrutiny by the bureaucracy on behalf of the
   Cabinet, and secondly, the weakness of post-introduction scrutiny
   facilitated by Scrutiny of Acts and Regulations Committee via statements
   of compatibility.},

Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-21},
Abstract = {This article contributes to the critical engagement with luck
   egalitarianism by advancing two arguments. Firstly, it questions the
   cogency of the dichotomies - e.g., luck/choice, person/circumstance,
   agency/structure - and the accompanying moral ideal of pure voluntarism.
   This makes it difficult for luck egalitarianism to dissect appropriately
   the inequalities embedded in social relations, such as social networks
   and involuntary associations, in which voluntariness and contingency as
   well as agency and structure are intertwined. Secondly, it suggests that
   the relational approach, which has been developed, inter alia, in the
   empirical study of inequality, provides a morally and practically
   adequate perspective on egalitarian justice. The relational approach
   achieves this by converging upon those in-between social relations that
   are irreducible to the macro-level structure and to microlevel agency.
   Moreover, a relationally sensitive perspective on inequality can adeptly
   respond to the difficulties that luck-egalitarian theories encounter.},

Journal = {GERMAN POLITICS},

Volume = {20},
Number = {4},
Pages = {506-526},
Abstract = {Do minimum wages reduce in-work poverty and wage inequality? Or can
   alternative policies do better? Germany suffers from high unemployment
   among low-skilled workers and rising wage dispersion at the lower end of
   the wage distribution. We analyse the impact on employment, wage
   inequality, public expenditure, and incomes of poor households of three
   different policy options currently being discussed in Germany: a
   statutory minimum wage, a combination of minimum wages and wage
   subsidies, and pure wage subsidies to low-paid workers. In doing so, we
   distinguish between perfectly competitive and monopsonistic labour
   markets. We find that a minimum wage of EUR 7.50 would cost between
   410,000 and 840,000 low-paid jobs, increasing the fiscal burden, while
   only moderately raising the income of poor households. With pure wage
   subsidies, the government can always ensure more favourable employment
   effects. Combining a minimum wage with a wage subsidy turns out to be
   extremely costly and inferior to wage subsidies in all respects.},

Title = {Horizontal Coordination, Government Performance and National Planning:
   The Possibilities and Limits of the South African State},
Journal = {POLITIKON},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {38},
Number = {3},
Pages = {343-365},
Abstract = {This article examines the centrality of inter-departmental coordination
   (horizontal coordination) in resolving complex cross-sectoral policy
   issues. It is also concerned with the link between horizontal
   coordination and improved governmental performance and national
   planning. Attaining all of these objectives is not easy for modern
   states. In South Africa, attempts at such horizontal coordination and
   planning have not been very successful. The failure in 1996 of the
   Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) Office is a case in
   point. More recent developments in the Presidency have seen the
   establishment of a National Planning Commission which is tasked with the
   responsibility of establishing long-term planning, inter-departmental
   coordination and policy integration. In addition, a new department has
   been established within the Presidency-the Department of Performance
   Monitoring and Evaluation (DPME)-which has a mandate to ensure the
   greater realisation of government's service delivery objectives. To
   achieve this, the DPME will deploy a strong `sectoral' focus requiring
   high-level horizontal coordination across all participating departments
   within the sector. This article highlights some of the competencies that

   concludes by questioning whether the South African government has the
   necessary institutional capabilities to see these horizontal
   coordination initiatives successfully through.},

Pages = {230-253},
Abstract = {The term crisis is commonly used in intellectual rhetoric, in scientific
   articles, by people in everyday contexts, and especially in public
   speeches by politicians. Since references to crisis (rhetoric of crisis)
   have a particular resonance in the political sphere, a better
   understanding of this concept is much needed.
   The aim of this article is to bring the term crisis into the context of
   political theory. This will be done via reference to the works of Carl
   Schmitt, Michael Walzer and Classical Realists such as Hans Morgenthau
   and Michael Williams. The term crisis will be characterized as part of
   an illocutionary speech act which signifies ``politicization{''}; this
   means moving an issue from its ``ordinary sphere{''} to the political
   sphere. On the basis of this contextualization, several models of crisis
   in the political sphere will be constructed.},

Volume = {3},
Number = {2},
Pages = {3-41},
Abstract = {During each electoral period, the strategic interaction between voters
   and political elites determines the number of viable candidates in a
   district. In this paper, we implement a hierarchical seemingly unrelated
   regression model to explain electoral coordination at the district level
   in Uruguay as a function of district magnitude, previous electoral
   outcomes and electoral regime. Elections in this country are
   particularly useful to test for institutional effects on the
   coordination process due to the large variations in district magnitude,
   to the simultaneity of presidential and legislative races held under
   different rules, and to the reforms implemented during the period under
   consideration. We find that district magnitude and electoral history
   heuristics have substantial effects on the number of competing and
   voted-for parties and lists. Our modeling approach uncovers important
   interaction-effects between the demand and supply side of the political
   market that were often overlooked in previous research.},

Abstract = {Co-financing political programmes between different administrative
   levels opens the door for principal-agent situations. The lower
   administrative level may have an incentive to overspend and to modify
   the nature of the programme. These challenges are empirically tested for
   a co-financed Swiss programme that supports agri-environmental networks.
   For ten cantons, the legal implementation of federal requirements was
   examined and interviews were carried out and evaluated. It was concluded
   that a clearly defined framework established by the upper-level
   administration and a limited share of the budget provided by the upper
   level sets incentives to comply and disincentives for opportunistic
   behaviour.},

Title = {Partisan Identification and Attitudes to Big Versus Small Government in
   Australia: Evidence from the ISSP},
Journal = {AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {46},
Number = {2},
Pages = {243-256},
Abstract = {In Australian politics, Labor has traditionally been thought of as the
   party of big government and the Liberals the party of small government.
   Drawing from evidence from the 1985, 1990, 1996 and 2007 International
   Social Survey Programme (ISSP) Role of Government surveys, this article
   examines public opinion in relation to the role of government and how
   public attitudes towards government differ according to party
   identification. It is reasonable to expect that Labor Party identifiers
   would be more supportive of big government, but there is little
   empirical evidence to support this expectation. This article shows that
   citizens' attitudes still accord with the Labor-Liberal/big-small
   government dichotomy and shows partisan identification to have an
   enduring effect on attitudes towards the role of government, net of
   other factors.
   The central issue of public policy is the appropriate role of government
   in a capitalist society. It is a question about the relationship between
   politics and markets, or how much and in what way governments should
   intervene in economic processes. It is the broader question about the
   relationship between state and society, or how much governments should
   intervene in the lives of individuals not as economic agents but as
   citizens (Fenna 2004, 37).},

   this thesis, the paper proposes, based on a specific vision about the
   consistency of social life, two alternative hypotheses to account for
   what is defined as extreme manifestations of violence. On the one hand,
   the hypothesis of forms of violence produced by subjectivity in the
   context of modern condition. On the other hand, the hypothesis of
   increased collective energies that destabilize institutions.},

Abstract = {In 1978, Deng Xiaoping declared that China's future depended on gaige
   kaifang (reform and opening up to the West). By any standard, China has
   reformed its economic system and prospered handsomely by integrating
   into the world economy. With less fanfare, China has taken steps to
   restructure its political system and committed substantial resources to
   harmonizing relations with its neighbors. Given these changes, China's
   insular tradition, and Communist government, this article considers how
   the country's reemergence has impacted the teaching of international
   relations (IR) at Chinese universities. Using primary and secondary
   sources, including university Web sites written in Chinese and English,
   and about a dozen semi-structured interviews conducted in Beijing and
   Xi' an, this study concludes that although China has become actively
   engaged in IR and the internationalization of universities is evident,
   the government has yet to endorse fully the importance of IR as a
   discipline, and universities have not systematically adopted the
   theoretical toolbox developed outside of China to describe, explain, and
   predict behavior in IR.},

Abstract = {In spatial models of electoral competition, candidate quality is
   typically modeled as valence, a measure of general appeal assumed to be
   constant across voters. This paper introduces and formally models an
   alternative conception of candidate quality according to which
   candidates differ in their effectiveness, or likelihood of changing
   policy from the status quo. Although more effective candidates are
   electorally favored, voters' benefits from effectiveness are contingent
   on their policy preferences. The effectiveness model shares many
   qualitative features with the valence model, but adds several testable
   implications related to the position of the status quo and gives rise to
   non-monotonic voting. When valence and effectiveness are combined,
   valence dominates effectiveness in determining the winner if and only if
   the status quo policy is sufficiently close to the political center.},

Abstract = {The proclaimed success of the Northern Ireland peace process (NPP) has
   made it a model for other divided regions. Simultaneously, debate has
   arisen over the exact merits of the peace process and whether it can
   really be seen as a triumph of intercommunal accommodation. In this
   article I analyze what lessons the NPP may provide for modes of
   international peacebuilding based on the triadic structure of
   democratization, neoliberalism, and civil society development. I argue
   that the NPP should be seen as anomalous or an outlier to the common
   discourse of international peacebuilding as defined by the liberal
   peace.},

Abstract = {Although the state of Israel is a democracy, military censorship has
   been in use since its establishment in 1948 and is still imposed. The
   chapter analyzes the theoretical and practical grounds for military
   censorship in Israel based on an agreement between relevant parties: the
   government, the army, the media, and the public. Analysis of Israeli
   military censorship reveals that military censorship is not necessarily
   the enemy of the media and the public's right to know. On the contrary
   and paradoxically, we show that in Israel's case, military censorship
   not only performs its task of preventing the publication of information
   that threatens the national security, at times it sustains the country's
   freedom of the press, freedom of information, and the public's right to
   know.},

Abstract = {Instead of modern society, which is now repelled as totalizing, there
   emerges a pluralistic and flexible field of groups. In this framework,
   the public is placed at the intermediate between the social and the
   individual and is interpreted as a collective. As, however, its momentum
   is extracted from the political coexistence of monological
   micro-collectivities, it appears to be missing a public quality that
   concerns the dimension of the whole and consequently proves to be weak
   against the discrete absorbing mechanisms of the capitalistic economy
   and the private interest. It is precisely this positioning of private
   and public as opposing and mutually threatening forces that invalidates
   the dynamic of collective space and deprives it of a democratic quality.
   In contrast, in a framework of a dialogical confrontational space
   publicity evolves in a social condition which places the
   individual-within-society and the private-within-the-public. Such a
   dialogical space is democratic as both political and social.},

Journal = {POLITICKE VEDY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {14},

Pages = {48-63},
Abstract = {Immediately after gaining independence Ukraine started a nation-building
   project that could be considered fairly inclusive. In the hope to boost
   a national identity, it granted citizenship to all those living on its
   soil in 1991 so to positively impact the feeling of belonging to a
   ``people of Ukraine{''} (as counter-posed to the ``Ukrainian people{''}.
   With citizenship as a prerequisite, the nation-building project was
   intended to match the nation with the state in order to make all
   Ukrainian citizens part of the Ukrainian nation, intended in civic
   terms. This paper distinguishes itself from the literature on
   nation-building by two interpretative frameworks. First, it complicates
   the discourse on nation-building by showing that the effect of
   nation-building policies on citizens is not as direct as literature
   suggests. By doing so, it questions the nature of nation-building as an
   elite-driven process and suggests that people have a major role in the
   renegotiation of a nation-building project.},

Abstract = {This article describes social structural inequities in the academy that
   contribute to gender imbalances in faculty service demands, which can
   slow women's career advancement. The author criticizes as ill-considered
   and ineffective the popular notion that the solution rests with
   individual female faculty, who should ``just say no{''} to service.
   Instead, she proposes structural and cultural solutions to this systemic
   problem, including a revaluation of faculty labor required to maintain
   the day-to-day operation of institutions of higher learning and
   research.},

Journal = {OSTERREICHISCHE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR POLITIKWISSENSCHAFT},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {40},
Number = {1},
Pages = {49+},
Abstract = {The article deals with the postulate of irony within the theoretical
   debates on democracy. Vantage point of the argument is the
   disappointment immanent to democracy. The current discussion about
   post-democracy depicts the manifest shortcomings of established
   democracies triggering frustration. The inevitability of disappointment
   is being traced back to the divergent strands and models of democracy.
   Since they compete with each other and struggle with internal dilemmas
   respectively they do not accomplish a consensual and stable foundation
   of the democratic rule. Conflicts between and internal dilemmas of
   models of democracy are explored in a comparison of the cosmopolitan
   strand of the debate and the agonistic pluralism. In view of the
   immanent potential for disappointment, the postulate of irony and its
   renaissance is discussed as a governmental requirement for the limited
   alienation of the political subject and for the committed distance to
   democracy. Since irony is not entirely determined in its emancipative or
   regressive character, the institutional embedding of the governmental
   requirement becomes crucial. Referring to the dual concept of social
   justice by Fraser, the argument accentuates that irony should be framed
   by rules supporting recognition and redistribution.},

Abstract = {The English constitutional evolution in the XIXth century was
   characterized by its enormous adjustment capacity to a changeable
   situation stimulated by the economic development, leading the State to
   progressively abandon the ``laisser faire{''} and take on more socially
   active duties, recognizing the economical-political power held by the
   new emerging powers, and concurrently extending the right of suffrage;
   in this way a permanent system of adjustment was establish between the
   political order and the new interests of the most powerful groups.
   However the extension of the right of suffrage was neither associated
   with a redistribution of the wealth, nor with a radical change in the
   structures of political domination; it's the beginning of an evolution
   that, throughout the XIXth and the XXth century, will ultimately provoke
   the mutation in the conception of political representation.},

   determining whether a particular time period is natural continuation of
   the previous one or should be interpreted as a qualitatively new one.
   Having applied the suggested tools on the example of Eltsin and Putin's
   stages of the country's development, G. Satarov comes to the conclusion
   that due to the drastic growth in numbers of the borrowed negative
   properties, blocking of positive tendencies, and existence of
   independent filters that are responsible for such selection, Putin's
   stage should be viewed as a rather autonomous time period in the Russian
   history.},

Abstract = {This paper provides a model of indirect lobbying where special interest
   groups try to influence policy outcomes by targeting voters.
   Specifically, competing lobbies engage in influence activities to affect
   the information that a (possibly biased) media outlet collects on the
   public value of approving/rejecting a policy proposal. The media outlet
   acts as a filter between lobbies and voters. It has to decide what to
   communicate to voters based on the information it collects and its own
   idiosyncratic bias. The results show that the higher the idiosyncratic
   bias of the media outlet, the lower the lobbies' incentives to spend
   resources on influence activities. Conversely, the lower the cost of
   engaging in influence activities for lobbies, the higher the probability
   of news-slanting by the media outlet. Moreover, the more voters care

Title = {Intentioned Recession: An Ideologically Driven Re-Structuring},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {33},
Number = {4},
Pages = {445-464},
Abstract = {Viewing broad middle class economic losses from the Great Recession as
   an accident leads many to imagine that a return to pre-recession
   policies and practices will restore this group's economic prosperity.
   Another perspective views these losses as part of a larger pattern of
   economic and political disenfranchisement directed toward the American
   middle class. To the extent that those who benefit from an event might
   be recognized as having a hand in its creation, insight into the values
   and beliefs held by this recession's beneficiaries may prove useful in
   designing policy changes needed to stem or reverse the continued
   enactment of these wider goals. This paper offers that insight: using
   responses to an original survey administered to faculty at major
   research universities across the United States in 2008-2009, certain
   values and beliefs held by academics across many departments and
   disciplines may be observed. Three interdependent elements pertaining to
   citizen democracy including population well-being, tolerance of contest
   and dissent, and citizen controlled majority rule are explored. The flip
   side of each-support and justification for hierarchy and inequality,
   intolerance of dissent, and valuing business dominance and power over
   citizen democracy-are often found in business operations today.
   Academics in business schools show stronger support for these latter
   values than do faculty in other fields; as business has emerged as a
   clear beneficiary from the Great Recession, this ideology may usefully
   serve as a reverse guide to policy change if greater equality in
   population well-being, and increased citizen-controlled democracy, are
   desired.},

Abstract = {This article details the argument for the economic origins of the
   secessionist challenge posed by Indonesia's four resource-rich regions.
   The desire of rich regions to retain their own wealth conflicts with the
   national goal of sharing social welfare for equitable development across
   the country. The grievances of relative deprivation and aspiration to
   inequality were related to the distribution of resource rent by the
   autocratic regime of Suharto. Democratic transition opened up political
   space in which the resource-rich regions addressed their grievances,
   pushing the country to the edge of disintegration. The main policy
   response to the problem was decentralisation as part of the overall
   democratisation process. The policy has been successful so far in
   achieving its political objective; however, in the long run, people of
   the rich regions may be disillusioned because there is a risk that the
   supposed economic benefits of decentralisation may not materialise.},

   Reduction of Statelessness. And yet there are almost 5 million refugees
   and internally displaced persons in the OSCE area. The crisis in North
   Africa and the Middle East is creating a vast new displacement
   challenge, including for OSCE participating States. What are the legal
   and policy gaps in terms of protection? And what steps are the OSCE and
   the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) taking to
   tackle the problem of IDPs, refugees and statelessness in the OSCE?},

   Islam, Alevis and Non-Muslim Minorities},
Journal = {AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {46},
Number = {3},
Pages = {407-423},
Abstract = {Since Turkey's application for membership of the European Union (EU) in
   1987, the EU has itself been a structural component of Turkey's
   political transformation. The European impact intensified after Turkey
   was granted the status of an official candidate at the EU's Helsinki
   Summit in 1999. Since then, Turkey has issued a series of reform
   packages with the aim of starting accession negotiations, which began in
   October 2005. These reforms have initiated a democratic regime that is
   structurally different from its predecessors in terms of its definition
   of political community, national identity and the territorial structure
   of the state. Among many other aspects of the current political
   transformation such as the resolution of the Kurdish problem and
   administrative reform, this article concentrates on how the European
   impact, which I label Europeanisation, has influenced state-religion
   relations in Turkey. Europeanisation has three major mechanisms that
   influence actors, institutions, ideas and interests in varying ways:
   institutional compliance, changing opportunity structures, and the
   framing of domestic beliefs and expectations. The article concentrates
   on how these mechanisms operate in the creation of a new regulatory
   framework of religion in Turkey.},

Abstract = {How does a campaign for higher office affect legislators' behavior on
   the floor of the House? I argue that legislators with progressive
   ambition have incentives to demonstrate policy specialization; however,
   these incentives are mitigated when ambitious legislators campaign for
   higher office. I develop a measure of policy specialization from floor
   speeches and test hypotheses with data from the careers of five classes
   of representatives in the U.S. House. Results show that higher
   office-seekers demonstrate greater specialization, except when they run
   for higher office.},

Abstract = {Behavioral economics has become an important part of the economics
   profession. As a subfield, it tries to make sense of persistent
   violations of the standard model for economics. The major classes of
   violations involve social preferences (taking the well-being of others
   into account), time discounting (inconsistencies in valuing present and
   future commodities), and context (the effects of framing). Other
   violations involve well-known psychological heuristics such as
   overconfidence, constraints on strategic reasoning, emotions, and status
   differentials. These concepts are discussed in separate sections, and
   key experimental and empirical studies are noted.},

Title = {Reconsidering the slaughter bench of history: genocide, theodicy, and
   the philosophy of history},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GENOCIDE RESEARCH},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {85-105},
Abstract = {This essay examines the philosophy of history in the aftermath of the
   twentieth century. It argues that the philosophy of history has been
   both a catalyst and a victim of genocide. On the one hand, theories
   about the fated course of human development have been used to
   rationalize and justify imperialist, genocidal actions, especially
   insofar as they often placed the peoples and nations on the supposed
   right or wrong side of an imagined world-historical trajectory. On the
   other hand, the philosophy of history eventually collapsed under-and was
   delegitimized by-the weight of the last century's mounting catastrophes.
   The essay opens by briefly outlining the relationship between theodicy,
   universal history, and empire in the works of Immanuel Kant, G.W.F.
   Hegel, and Martin Heidegger before turning to the writings of a number
   of emigre intellectuals who came to criticize their respective
   philosophies of history in the wake of the Second World War. Thinkers
   such as Theodor Adorno, Hannah Arendt, Walter Benjamin, Carl G. Hempel,
   Karl Lowith, Leo Strauss, and Eric Voegelin either abandoned or sought
   to rewrite the philosophy of history in light of what they viewed not as
   progress, but as world-historical calamity. For contemporary
   intellectuals engaged in debates about the meaning and effects of
   modernization, globalization, and development, these writings remain
   necessary points of reference. The essay concludes by suggesting that if
   the philosophy of history is to be of any help in ongoing attempts to
   understand and confront contemporary genocide, then we must first
   reconsider its historical complicity with genocidal ideology.},

Journal = {STATE POLITICS \& POLICY QUARTERLY},

Volume = {11},
Number = {4},
Pages = {440-459},

Abstract = {How does the demand for lobbying reflected by government policy activity
   influence the use of lobbying strategies and tactics? The authors
   examine this question by assessing how the complexity of the policy
   space affects the political action committee (PAC) system. They
   hypothesize that the complexity of the policy space indirectly affects
   the size and activity of the PAC system through its direct effect on
   interest organization density. The authors test this hypothesis within
   the health sector using a unique data set that connects individual
   interest organizations registered to lobby U. S. state legislatures with
   active PACs in the state. It appears that social, economic, and
   political measures of policy space complexity influence the size of the
   lobbying community, which in turn influences the size and activity of
   the PAC community.},

   Ernesto Guevara's so called ``continental{''} political project.
   Paradoxically, few elements concerning this subject that might enable

   speakers, if even rusted and worn out, buzzed clearly and intelligibly
   for the most part. They had been located in old sound archives; after
   the events of 20 years past, they had been gathered up when the country
   elected a new form of government. Who would have thought that they would

Abstract = {Memory wars in Asia still revolve around Japan. Much has been discussed
   on the so-called kyokasho mondai (history textbook controversies), yet,
   not much has been explored on the domestic social function of history
   textbooks per se. Emphasizing creators of history narratives (and their
   production), the field tends to overlook the audience, or, receivers in
   the process. In this article, by referring to the original interviews
   with Japanese college students, I question the very assumption of the
   creator-receiver connection. How are history textbooks perceived as a
   source for promoting Japanese people's underlying historical
   consciousness? How have they been utilized in schools? Are they useful?
   If so, how? If not, why? I argue that in the case of Japan, how people
   reflect upon history issues is not necessarily the function of school
   history textbooks as often assumed, making a strong case for the
   importance of receivers in the analysis of public discourse.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to explore the role played by media and
   political campaigns in university student voters. This exploratory
   research is done of a transversal nature by the collection of primary
   data using personal surveys. The results are: the low affinity partisan
   in academics and the role of forums, debates and activities to promote
   participation in political campaigns. In conclusion, Internet and social
   networks do not change conducts in a university student abstention but
   lead to more activity in individuals who are politically participative,
   which have been identified with partisan ideologies who are
   ideologically towards the identification of individual candidates.},

Abstract = {Robert Putnam's work suggests social capital is compatible with social
   equality, while Rodney Hero argues the two are inversely related. Hero
   and Putnam, however, are limited in their arguments because they have
   only cross-sectional data and their theoretical arguments imply dynamic
   relationships over time. We create a state-level social capital index
   and a measure of racial diversity that varies over time and across
   states. We use multivariate models to determine whether social capital
   or racial diversity better predicts levels of policy equity. We find
   that social capital detrimentally affects policy equity and racial
   diversity is positively associated with policy equity.},

Abstract = {Hungary bears a share of responsibility for the Holocaust of Hungarian
   Jews. It was Hungarians who deported 437,000 Jewish fellow citizens
   within a few weeks in 1944. One in three victims at Auschwitz was a
   Hungarian Jew. This is well-known. But Hungary's historical
   responsibility has not become a part of its history culture. Now
   remembrance of the Holocaust faces the risk of being sidelined. The
   current government is preoccupied by communist crimes in its history
   policy. The new constitution provides a view of history that implicitly
   acquits Hungary of any responsibility.},

Abstract = {One of the most striking characteristics of the contemporary Senate is
   the regular transfers of party control, with six shifts in the majority
   between 1980 and 2007. Continual uncertainty about future control of the
   chamber has important consequences for congressional incentives. In this
   environment, senators have adapted their behavior and institution to
   more effectively contest Senate control. These adaptations include: the
   rise of ``message politics{''} and the growing size, significance, and
   outreach capabilities of party committees and leadership staffs.},

Abstract = {In January 2008, the Toronto District School Board (TDSB) voted to
   establish Afrocentric education. Earlier proposals dating back to the
   early 1990s, however, garnered little response from the board. Why was
   the TDSB suddenly more amenable to the idea? We argue that the death of
   Jordan Manners acted as a focusing event that triggered concern
   regarding school safety and the challenges facing Black youth in
   Toronto, altering the policy climate and opening a window of opportunity
   for change. This analysis furthers conceptualizations of the connections
   between focusing events, policy entrepreneurs, the viability of
   alternative proposals, and the catalysts that facilitate policy change.},

Journal = {GLOBAL SOCIAL POLICY},

Volume = {11},

Abstract = {The manner in which open economies in a globalized world shape social
   policy development is highly disputed, as is the impact of the current
   financial crisis on social policy. One argument is that globalization
   and economic austerity force social policy dismantling. Alternatively,
   it is proposed that open economies-facing greater volatility, especially
   during crisis-push for greater social protection. Using the examples of
   Botswana and Mauritius, two open middle-income countries, this article
   suggests that, in fact, both arguments may be correct. The impact of
   globalization and economic crisis depends on the character of the
   welfare system already in place and the organized interests underpinning
   it. In Botswana a main social policy thrust is to increase efficiency in
   spending, whereas issues of job security and compensation are more
   prevalent in Mauritius. The findings imply that divergence across
   welfare systems persists and that, even in crisis, countries often use
   tried social policy solutions.},

   plantations. These concessions have resulted in significant alterations
   of landscapes and ecological processes, greatly reduced local access to
   resources through enclosing common areas, and have ultimately led to
   massive changes in the livelihoods of large numbers of mainly indigenous
   peoples living near these concessions. Many have lost their agricultural
   and forest lands, or conditions of production, making it difficult to
   maintain their former semi-subsistence livelihoods, and thus compelling
   many to take up employment on the same plantations that displaced them,
   despite frequently having to work for low wages and under poor
   conditions. Using two case studies involving large economic land
   concessions in southern Laos, I argue that applying the theoretical
   concept of primitive accumulation is useful for better understanding the
   political processes and motivations of government officials, including
   justifications for the rural dispossession that is occurring in a
   nominally `socialist' country.},

Abstract = {Koreans have worked hard to improve the quality of their democracy. They
   have promoted the rule of law, accountability, control of corruption,
   freedom, and responsiveness, and made an effort to make government more
   effective. They are also committed to economic freedom. In relation to
   the rule of law, significant attention has been devoted to reducing
   terrorism and violence, making government more effective, and enhancing
   regulatory quality. However, with regard to accountability, control of
   corruption, and transparency, Korea has still a long way to go. The
   analysis of democratization and improvements in the quality of democracy
   to date suggest that Korea has adapted to the changing economic
   environment and is sustaining its economic growth. This has been
   accompanied by social and economic polarization and a consequent demand
   for more and better welfare services.},

Abstract = {Recent trends of mass-level euroscepticism seriously challenge Deutsch's
   transactionalist theory that increased transnational interactions
   trigger support for further political integration. While transnational
   interactions have indeed proliferated, public support for European
   integration has diminished. This article aims to solve this puzzle by
   arguing that transnational interaction is highly stratified across
   society. Its impact on EU support therefore only applies to a small
   portion of the public. The rest of the population not only fails to be
   prompted to support the integration process, but may see it as a threat
   to their realm. This is even more the case as, parallel to European
   integration, global trends of integration create tensions in national
   societies. The following hypotheses are proposed: first, the more
   transnational an individual, the less she or he is prone to be
   eurosceptical; and second, this effect is more pronounced in countries
   that are more globalised. A multilevel ordinal logit analysis of survey
   data from the 2006 Eurobarometer wave 65.1 confirms these hypotheses.},

Abstract = {The Coalition government's plans for reform are meant to transform the
   NHS into a more privately run, competitive system, raising the question
   as to whether or not the NHS is likely to resemble the US capitalist
   healthcare industry. The US system will be examined for comparative
   purposes, followed by an analysis of how far earlier reforms under
   Conservative and New Labour governments have moved the NHS in that
   direction. The implications of the White Paper proposals are analysed to
   determine the degree to which the NHS is destined to become a
   commodity-producing industry. The tentative conclusion is that while
   secondary care will be similar in many ways to the US hospital industry,
   state funding remains a barrier to complete transformation, and what is
   likely to emerge is a hybrid system in which competition, consolidation,
   and pressure on the workforce all increase.},

Volume = {48},
Number = {2},
Pages = {159-185},

Abstract = {The essay discusses the orientations for preventing the slide toward
   apartheid States. Beginning with the phenomenology of present mass
   displacements, it asks: are non-citizens people, and what are the limits
   of popular sovereignty? Is freedom possible if a good part of denizens
   is a partly free group? Five concatenated axioms are posed: that 1/ the
   right to hospitality (eventually, citizenship) is a central human
   right); 2/ each State - or analogous community - should give all its
   denizens the maximum possible of citizen rights; 3/ our value focus
   ought to be on immigrant policy and on integration; 4/ the status of
   ``unfree labourers{''} refuses the principle of ``one person, one
   vote{''}; 5/ ``no taxation without representation.{''} The long-run
   alternative is wars and terrorism or civil cohabitation. This would
   include a foreign economical policy of ``co-development{''}, and no
   participation in wars (except in a present aggression against Europe).
   If capitalism today condemns a growing majority of humans to
   psycho-physical misery and premature death, then we may be facing
   apartheid and global civil wars.},

Abstract = {Recent theories of political development have emphasized redistributive
   demands as the main drivers of democratic transitions and consolidation.
   The authors employ Cox duration models to evaluate a number of economic,
   institutionalist, and sociological theories of regime transition, using
   global data from 1970 to 1999. This study suggests that demands for
   redistribution are insufficient explanators of political transitions.
   The authors find that transitions to democracy depend primarily on a
   high level of oppositionist social mobilization and, secondarily,
   favorable patterns of economic distribution. On the other hand, a high
   level of socioeconomic development is by far the best guarantor of
   democratic resiliency, whereas mass political conflict endangers
   consolidation once democracy has been introduced. The study also reveals
   that institutionalist factors are less influential than socioeconomic
   characteristics in explaining regime transitions. This study highlights
   the contribution of social movement theory to the study of regime
   transitions.},

Abstract = {This article examines patterns of popular trust in political and public
   institutions in Nepal. We ask to what extent such trust is linked, on
   one hand, to citizens' social and political identities, and on the other
   hand, to citizens' perceptions of institutional performance. Our
   findings demonstrate that trust in public institutions varies
   extensively. Trust is high for a number of professional institutions,
   such as schools and hospitals. It is also quite high for local
   government institutions. Trust in the parliament and the government is
   much lower. Furthermore, the analysis reveals a weak relationship
   between institutional trust and identity variables. Demographic and
   social characteristics of participants, such as caste, and religious and
   political affiliations, have little significance in explaining the level
   of citizens' trust in political and public institutions. Such trust
   primarily depends upon how citizens assess the performance of these
   institutions. Hence, patterns of institutional trust depend on how
   participants evaluate the current macro-political situation in Nepal,
   whether recent political changes are judged to have gone in the right
   direction. In a more general and comparative perspective our findings
   from Nepal fit with a performance-based theory of institutional trust,
   while, to a large extent, they disconfirm identity-based explanations.},

Abstract = {Networks are central to both the practice and understanding of
   contemporary governance. But there is a tendency to conflate and confuse
   different concepts. Concepts of `policy network' (PN) and `governance
   network' (GN) are often used interchangeably, with an assumption that
   the latter has evolved from the former. Such indiscriminate borrowing
   fails to recognise the different antecedents, and distinctive analytical
   offer, of specific network theories. The article develops a systematic
   distinction between PN and GN theories, enabling those engaging with
   networks to select from, and even combine, alternative perspectives as
   they confront a new wave of change in policy making and governance. The
   more sceptical account provided by PN theory provides a valuable
   counterbalance to the `optimistic' character of the GN literature, which
   tends to underestimate the continued hold of (albeit multi-sector)
   elites on policy making, and overstate the extent to which networks
   represent a new `stage' in the evolution of governance.},

Abstract = {Where new democracies threaten the interests of capital owning and
   military elites, O'Donnell and Schmitter (1986) argued that they may
   readily be reversed. This paper, in carrying out a paired comparison of
   authoritarian reversals in contemporary Malaysia and Thailand, extends
   this thesis in several ways. It extends the logic of threats to
   elite-level interests and reversals to electoral authoritarian regimes,
   the posture in which much of the third wave has reached equilibrium. It
   examines more deeply the societal grounding and institutional bases that
   support elite-level statuses. It locates the threats to elite-level
   interests along dimensions identified in a new literature on democratic
   quality. It characterizes elite-level relations as cohesive or
   fractious, enabling us to chart the different modes of reversal that
   take place, as well as the durability of the authoritarianism that
   follows.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the role of the Commission in the European Union
   (EU). We present a game-theoretical model of two EU processes -
   Commission appointment and the adoption of legislation - and apply this
   model to the appointment of recent Commissions and their legislative
   programmes. Institutional reforms of the EU have led to more involvement
   of the European Parliament and majority voting in the Council in both
   processes. We find that the introduction of majority voting in the
   legislative process in the mid-1980s let the Commission move policy
   further from the status quo. Yet unanimity for appointing the Commission
   still allowed the member states to commit to a legislative programme
   that was preferred by all of them. More recently, the move to majority
   voting for appointing the Commission, combined with the ability of the
   European Parliament to amend Commission proposals, has moved the EU
   towards a more majoritarian political system. However, the potential
   policy consequences of these changes have been limited thus far because
   of the particular configuration of policy preferences of the governments
   and the European Parliament.},

Abstract = {In 1995, some observers and policymakers might have expected that the
   international deployment in Bosnia would be an exceptional event. It
   soon became obvious, however, that Bosnia was only the first in a
   succession of ambitious military interventions and post-conflict
   missions: first in Kosovo (1999) and East Timor (1999), then, in
   Afghanistan (2001), and finally in Iraq (2003). It became commonplace to
   refer to all of these missions as if they were variations on the same
   theme: sometimes referred to as nation-building, stabilization
   operations (U. S. military), state-building, or post-conflict
   peacebuilding. As a new international cadre of nation-builders emerged,
   moving from one mission to the next, policymakers asked with ever
   greater insistence whether there were some universal lessons.},

Abstract = {This paper deals with a provision in Article 5.2 of the Icelandic Act on
   Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), No. 106/2000 that allows for a
   special procedure of joint EIA of two or more associated projects. Its
   main aim is to ensure that the overall assessment of environmental
   effects is taken into account before decisions are made. This provision
   has raised questions in relation to its scope and applicability. The
   provision's origin, substance and application are analysed as well as
   its conformity to Directive 85/337/EEC as it has been introduced into
   the EEA Agreement. The paper concludes that administrative
   implementation has clarified certain aspects, including the legal
   conditions for its application. However, the application of the
   provision raises questions as to whether its aim may be achieved by a
   less onerous procedure; in line with Directive 85/337/EEC as interpreted
   by the European Commission.},

Journal = {FRENCH POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {9},

Pages = {260-281},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The introduction of quotas can help women overcome certain obstacles to
   political office that thwart an egalitarian representation. Various
   countries have recently adopted quota laws in order to grant a
   gender-balanced composition of political office. However, the
   effectiveness of quota laws is constrained by several discriminatory
   manoeuvres that parties use to circumvent the law. This article aims at
   unveiling the broad array of strategic discrimination practices that
   parties apply, irrespective of their ideology and the electoral system
   in use. These practices seriously diminish the equalising potential of
   positive action measures. The empirical analysis concentrates on France
   and Spain, two countries where a statutory quota has been recently
   introduced and already tested on various elections.},

   is in jeopardy due to the activities of individuals that place no value

   counterfeiting. It has ripped off many producers, manufacturers,
   artists, marketers and stakeholders of the benefits of their creativity
   and also prevented the industry from rapid financial growth and
   development. It is in this light that we intend to look at the place of
   piracy and counterfeiting to the social and economic development in

Abstract = {Why do men score better than women do on tests of political knowledge?
   We consider the roots of the gender gap in political knowledge in late
   adolescence. Using a panel survey of high school seniors, we consider
   the differences between young men and young women in what they know
   about politics and how they learn over the course of a midterm election
   campaign. We find that even after controlling for differences in
   dispositions like political interest and efficacy, young women are still
   significantly less politically knowledgeable than young men. While
   campaigns neither widen nor close the gender gap in political knowledge,
   we find important gender differences in how young people respond to the
   campaign environment. While partisan conflict is more likely to promote
   learning among young men, young women are more likely to gain
   information in environments marked by consensus rather than conflict.},

Abstract = {Recent developments in Africa have witnessed the establishment of
   African Court of Human Rights and African Court of Justice; and the
   eventual merger of the two Courts as the African Court of Justice and
   Human Rights. The Courts were established to compliment the protective
   mandate of African Commission on Human Rights. The establishment of
   African Human Rights Courts has catapulted scholars into considering
   whether the option is better for African human rights system or whether
   it was taken impetuously. The question is imperative in view of the
   problems that besiege the African Commission. This article considers the
   foreseeable hurdles that the African Court of Human Rights and the
   merged Court are likely to face. It points out that the African human
   rights system was built on a shaky foundation and suggests ways for
   revamping the system.},

Abstract = {An enduring concern about democracies is that citizens conform too
   readily to the policy views of elites in their own parties, even to the
   point of ignoring other information about the policies in question. This
   article presents two experiments that undermine this concern, at least
   under one important condition: People rarely possess even a modicum of
   information about policies; but when they do, their attitudes seem to be
   affected at least as much by that information as by cues from party
   elites. The experiments also measure the extent to which people think
   about policy. Contrary to many accounts, they suggest that party cues do
   not inhibit such thinking. This is not cause for unbridled optimism
   about citizens' ability to make good decisions, but it is reason to be
   more sanguine about their ability to use information about policy when
   they have it.},

Abstract = {The distribution of attention across issues is of fundamental importance
   to the political agenda and outputs of government. This article presents
   an issue-based theory of the diversity of governing agendas where the
   core functions of government-defense, international affairs, the
   economy, government operations, and the rule of law-are prioritized
   ahead of all other issues. It undertakes comparative analysis of issue
   diversity of the executive agenda of several European countries and the
   United States over the postwar period. The results offer strong evidence
   of the limiting effect of core issues-the economy, government
   operations, defense, and international affairs-on agenda diversity. This
   suggests not only that some issues receive more attention than others
   but also that some issues are attended to only at times when the agenda
   is more diverse. When core functions of government are high on the
   agenda, executives pursue a less diverse agenda-focusing the majority of
   their attention on fewer issues. Some issues are more equal than others
   in executive agenda setting.},

Abstract = {The victory of Barack Obama over John McCain in the 2008 presidential
   election marked a historic and pivotal moment in American politics. Many
   observers interpreted the election as heralding a new ``post racial{''}
   politics. However, others noted that even though short-term forces were
   overwhelmingly pro-Democratic in 2008, Obama's overall vote among white
   voters barely increased on the share received by John Kerry in 2004.
   This study uses data from the American National Election Study to
   examine the effect of the racial attitudes-specifically racial
   resentment-of whites on vote choice in the 2008 presidential election.
   Findings show that racial resentment exerted a large influence on vote
   choice, one that was only exceeded by party identification. Furthermore,
   the effect of racial resentment was greater than in any prior election
   for which data on racial resentment is available.},

Abstract = {In this paper we intend to analize the organizational forms adopted by
   the low and middle argentine agrarian bourgeoisie since the mid 1990's
   in their effort to preserve their conditions of existence. Specifically,
   we refer to the so called ``Movimiento de Mujeres Agropecuarias en Lucha
   (MML){''} and ``Chacareros Federados (CF){''}. Firstly, our aim is to
   reconstruct the origins and the history of each one of them. Then we'll
   analize the forms of struggle utilized and the actions fulfilled.
   Finally, we'll describe the political relations and the alliances that
   they establish with other organizations, in particular their links with
   the Partido Comunista Revolucionario (PCR).},

Abstract = {Since the late 1980s, Northern Ireland has seen a radical electoral
   shift away from the historically dominant parties in the Catholic and
   Protestant blocs - the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) and
   Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), respectively - towards the traditionally
   more `extreme' parties - Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionist Party
   (DUP). This change in aggregate support has been accompanied by
   increasing differences between generations as older cohorts of UUP and
   SDLP supporters have been replaced by newer cohorts of DUP and Sinn Fein
   partisans. This is not a result of increased polarisation in values and
   attitudes (whether overtly political or simply communal intolerance)
   among younger cohorts who are, if anything, slightly more moderate than
   their forbears. Rather, this results from the changing political context
   in which new generations have been socialised in particular the expanded
   choice sets facing voters as they have reached voting age. This in turn
   has positive implications for the consolidation of devolved democratic
   governance.},

Abstract = {Two currents can be distinguished in the literature regarding the
   domestic consequences of globalization. One perspective holds that
   globalization depoliticizes extra-parliamentary protest activity despite
   the presence of democracy. Another perspective suggests that
   globalization has contributed to the repoliticization of protest,
   especially when democracy is present. Using cross-sectional time-series
   data in a global sample for the 1970-2006 period, the paper examines the
   effect of globalization on extra-parliamentary protest activity in the
   context of democracy. The paper further tests these relationships
   cross-regionally comparing East Asia with Latin America - arguably the
   two regions in the world where dual transitions to economic and
   political liberalization have been in full force since 1970s. The
   results reveal distinct patterns of protest activity cross-regionally,
   whereby East Asia approximates the depoliticization trend from the
   global sample. In contrast, the results for Latin America provide
   confirming evidence for the repoliticization perspective. These findings
   remain robust across a number of control variables, and different
   measures of democracy and estimation techniques. Overall, the paper
   shows that democracy influences the relationship between globalization
   and extra-parliamentary protest activity - a relationship that up to now
   has remained systematically untested.},

Abstract = {An increasingly large literature on patronage has developed within
   political science in recent years. Yet this body of scholarship has thus
   far failed to explain variation in patronage allocation across
   countries. An original theory based on the logic of institutional
   choice, whereby political leaders allocate patronage in accordance with
   the varying political threats they face, explains this variation. Two
   variables-geography and visibility-capture this variation and thus
   explain patronage allocation. The theory is tested and validated through
   a comparative analysis of Rwanda and Uganda, whose current regimes are
   remarkably similar in origin and structure. The analysis extends to
   previous regimes in both countries.},

Abstract = {``The economics profession both sanctioned and rationalized a business
   model of society which supported a minimally supervised rule of markets.
   As a consequence, the failure of markets has marginalized economics
   itself. It is left on the sidelines as politicians try to salvage
   something from the breakdown of the market order.{''} Robert Skidelsky,
   2009
   ``When I was in college, I majored in political science. But if I were
   going through college today, I'd major in economics. It possesses a
   rigor that other fields in the social sciences don't-and often greater
   relevance as well. That's why economists are shaping national debates
   about everything from health care to poverty, while political scientists
   often seem increasingly theoretical and irrelevant.{''} Nicholas D.
   Kristof, 2011
   Foreign policy decision makers tend to rely on historical analogies. The
   ``surge{''} in Afghanistan, for example, was inspired in part by the
   ``surge{''} in Iraq. Processes for dealing with foreign policy issues
   involving the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were substantially different
   from those processes in the Bush and Obama administrations aimed at
   dealing with economic crises in 2008 and 2009. The latter processes were
   influenced extensively by economists, especially in the Obama
   administration. The decisions to send additional troops to the wars in
   Iraq and Afghanistan involved relatively few political scientists. More
   substantial input from political scientists in the decision making
   process about the surge in Afghanistan might have produced more
   knowledgeable and informative analyses of relevant historical and
   political data in the form of structured focused comparisons of the wars
   and counterinsurgency campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as
   analyses and interpretations of data on larger numbers of cases
   pertaining to broader phenomena of which the US interventions in Iraq
   and Afghanistan are examples. Perhaps political scientists deserve a
   role within foreign policy making processes more similar to that
   reserved for economists in processes focusing on economic issues.},

Abstract = {The high prevalence of social, emotional and behavioural health problems
   in children and young people in Australia, and the high cost and
   relative ineffectiveness of treatments to `cure' them, lead to the
   conclusion that the most efficient and cost effective approach is to
   prevent them from occurring. The challenge is in determining what to
   prevent and how to do so. While there are complex social and political
   aspects to prevention, it must also be guided by a solid scientific
   basis. This paper makes the case that prevention science provides a
   framework for ensuring that prevention initiatives are founded on robust
   evidence and implemented in a way that will allow progressive growth in
   knowledge of ` what works' in prevention. The paper examines some of the
   opportunities and challenges in a shift to an evidence-based prevention
   agenda to improve the lives of children and young people.},

Abstract = {Romania and Bulgaria encounter today problems in joining the visa-free
   Schengen area. The main one in the public eye is corruption. Both
   countries pledged to improve their rule of law when signing their
   accession treaties in 2005, yet little progress is perceived by
   observers or captured with governance measurements relying on
   perception, such as CPI and World Bank Governance indicators. This paper
   explores real policy, with fact-based indicators, to trace progress in
   the area - or lack of it - since 2004 to the present.},

Abstract = {Taking up Freud's positions on economy and mourning where they depend on
   the contact they organize with melancholia, Jukic proposes a critical
   reading of Jacques Derrida's assemblage of mourning and economy in
   Specters of Marx: the State of the Debt, the Work of Mourning and the
   New International. Given the fact that melancholia in Freud calls into
   question what psychoanalysis wants to define as economy, yet is
   conspicuously absent from Derrida's otherwise Freudian configuration of
   the work-and-economy of mourning in his book on Marx, Jukic addresses
   Freud's approach to work in ``Trauer und Melancholie{''} and proposes
   that work in Marx be analyzed not against mourning but against Freudian
   and, more importantly still, pre-Freudian configurations of melancholia.},

   and Corus Radio Network's Adler Online-work to reproduce colonialism in
   Canada through formation of colonial subjectivity. It proceeds through
   analysis of listener experience informed by postcolonial theory, and the
   work of Deleuze and Guattari. The mobilization of affective states by
   these programs, specifically sympathy and outrage, has important
   implications for how colonialism continues to dictate many of the terms
   of Canadian political discourse. If colonialism continues to be
   reproduced in our daily interactions with the media, this poses serious
   threats to Canadian multiculturalism and to the potential for realizing
   Aboriginal political goals.},

Journal = {STATE POLITICS \& POLICY QUARTERLY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {11},

Abstract = {Contrary to media reports, California's 2003 recall election was
   anything but a circus. Despite the presence of 135 candidates, just 3
   managed to split 94\% of the vote, and the winner came close to
   achieving a majority. In this article, the author uses elite interviews
   and a social network analysis of campaign donations to study how the
   Republican Party sought to impose order on the potentially chaotic
   political environment. The author finds that a network of Republican
   donors, activists, and officeholders coordinated their efforts to
   advantage Arnold Schwarzenegger and pressure other Republicans out of
   the race.},

Abstract = {The symbolic significance of the German-Polish treaties of 1990-1991 is
   indisputable. But the balance of the border and neighbourly relations
   treaties is mixed. On the credit side of the ledger are the final
   settlement of the border question and EU enlargement. On the debit side,
   there is the advancement of the Polish-speaking population in Germany
   and the divergent interpretations of the two countries' shared history.
   But Poland and Germany have become partners on an equal footing who can
   press ahead with initiatives such as the Baltic Sea Strategy or a future
   partnership for the transformation of Eastern Europe.},

Abstract = {Literature on open-seat elections has focused on the individual
   attributes of a candidate and/or institutional arrangements. When a seat
   becomes an open contest could be a significant indicator as to how
   likely the incumbent party is able to maintain the seat. Examining data
   on open U.S. House seats from 1996 to 2008, we use OLS regression and
   logistic regression analysis, finding that time is a significant
   predictor for incumbent party fund-raising and seat maintenance. We
   conclude that political parties have an interest in encouraging members
   of Congress to announce their retirement early in the election cycle.},

Abstract = {The effect of policy regimes on immigrant incorporation has been the
   subject of extensive debate. Despite much theoretical literature on the
   subject, the relationships between specific national policies in various
   domains and outcomes broadly related to social solidarity have not been
   well explored empirically. The present work develops measures tapping
   the priority of ``ascriptive{''} traits defining membership in the
   national community. It tests the expectations of the theoretical
   literature on multiculturalism, citizenship policy, and social welfare
   redistribution against these measures across 18 immigrant-receiving
   democracies. Cross-sectional analyses on, 2003 data indicate that both
   jus soli citizenship regimes and high levels of social spending are
   related to more immigrant-inclusive definitions of the national
   community, but the effect of multiculturalism is inconsistent. Examined
   longitudinally, the effect of a jus soli citizenship regime and social
   spending remains consistent, but citizens in multicultural countries
   appear to have become substantially more ``ascriptive{''} on these
   outcomes over time.},

Abstract = {Classical rational choice explanations of voting participation are
   widely thought to have failed. This article argues that the currently
   dominant Group Mobilization and Ethical Agency approaches have serious
   shortcomings in explaining individually rational turnout. It develops an
   informal social network (ISN) model in which people rationally vote if
   their informal networks of family and friends attach enough importance
   to voting, because voting leads to social approval and vice versa. Using
   results from the social psychology literature, research on social groups
   in sociology and their own survey data, the authors argue that the ISN
   model can explain individually rational non-altruistic turnout. If group
   variables that affect whether voting is used as a marker of individual
   standing in groups are included, the likelihood of turnout rises
   dramatically.},

Abstract = {In decentralized countries, national parties have both regional and
   national interests. We should therefore expect variation in national
   parties' policy positions on centre-periphery issues at the regional
   level. In order to test this hypothesis empirically, we content-analyze
   the regional-level manifestos of the two main national parties in Spain.
   We use a novel methodology that estimates national parties' policy
   positions along the centre-periphery dimension of competition. This
   methodology is an adaptation of the Comparative Manifestos Project
   national codification scheme to the regional electoral level. We show
   that the policy positions of national parties in Spain diverge between
   regions and that one of the main factors that accounts for this
   divergence is whether national parties have to compete for votes with
   regional parties.},

Abstract = {With some exceptions, efforts to systematically apply a
   historical-institutionalist framework to the study of federalism have
   been few and far between. This paper argues, however, that historical
   institutionalism lends itself particularly well for addressing two
   important research questions in the field of comparative federalism: the
   origins of federal systems and their dynamics. It is suggested that a
   historical-institutionalist framework can significantly contribute to
   encourage theoretical cross-fertilization within the field of
   comparative federalism.},

Abstract = {Aerial bombardment has been an important component of counterinsurgency
   practice since shortly after it became a viable military technology in
   the early twentieth century. Due to the nature of insurgency, bombing
   frequently occurs in and around settled areas, and consequently it tends
   to generate many civilian casualties. However, the effectiveness of
   bombing civilian areas as a military tactic remains disputed. Using data
   disaggregated to the level of the smallest population unit and measured
   at multiple points in time, this article examines the effect of aerial
   bombardment on the pattern of local control in the Vietnam War. A
   variety of estimation methods, including instrumental variables and
   genetic matching, show that bombing civilians systematically shifted
   control in favor of the Viet Cong insurgents.},

   or will they go beyond that? In other words, will the cross-border
   cooperation lead to the cross-border integration? What will be the scope
   in that integration? That way, the forecast done by the ethnic
   federalism will it be fulfilled?},

Abstract = {This article analyses the influence of the World Bank on reforms of the
   health sector in Bolivia during the period 1986-2006, and assesses their
   impact on the health care delivery system to date. The article examines
   the transformation of health services undertaken by the current
   socialist government since 2006. A literature review and interviews with
   decision-makers critically examine the outcome of reforms on criteria
   linked to health system integration. The study illustrates that Bolivia
   applied quite comprehensively the WB recommendations. Among others these
   included indirect privatization through public health services'
   restriction of access to a basic package of care and decentralization
   with devolution. In consequence, the segmentation and fragmentation of
   the health system was exacerbated, accessibility and quality of care
   suffered and health status barely improved. The article attempts to
   locate the relationship between policy, health care delivery and health
   systems functioning.},

Title = {The Asian Values Thesis Revisited: Evidence from the World Values
   Surveys},
Journal = {JAPANESE JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {12},

Abstract = {The thesis that `Asian' cultures oppose the `Western' emphasis on
   emancipative values and liberal democracy has mostly been criticized for
   its political instrumentality. By contrast, the empirical claim about
   most Asians' dismissal of emancipative values and liberal democracy has
   not been tested on a broadly cross-cultural basis. Filling this gap,
   this article uses data from the World Values Surveys to put the values
   of Asian populations into global perspective. As a result, the
   differences between Asian and Western populations over emancipative
   values and liberal democracy appear to be gradual, not categorical. What
   is more, the forces of modernization that gave rise to emancipative
   values and a liberal notion of democracy in the `West', are doing the
   same in the `East', confirming a universal model of human development
   rather than Asian exceptionalism, or any other form of cultural
   exceptionalism.},

Abstract = {Since the early 1970s, member states of the Organisation of the Islamic
   Conference (OIC) have been pursuing the goal of enhancing economic and
   commercial cooperation to improve the economic linkages and coordination
   among themselves and to jointly act against the global challenges facing
   them. Special attention has been given to trade and considerable efforts
   have been exerted at various OIC forums to develop ways and means of
   joint cooperative action to increase trade among the OIC countries.
   Enhancing intra-OIC trade was also among the priorities of the Ten-Year
   Programme of Action, which set a target of a level of 20 percent for
   intra-OIC trade to be achieved during the period covered by the
   Programme (by 2015). It is with this inspiration that this study
   presents an analytical overview of the evolution and the current
   structure of the merchandise trade among the OIC countries. Also, broad
   policy recommendations are outlined to enhance intra-OIC trade.},

Number = {1},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This article identifies five key considerations for adopting and
   mainstreaming intersectionality: the language and concepts that are
   used; the complexities of difference and how to navigate this
   complexity; the choice of focusing on identities, categories, processes,
   and/or systems; the model that is used to explain and describe mutually
   constituted differences; and the principles that determine which
   interactions are analyzed. The author argues that in the process of
   mainstreaming intersectionality, it is crucial to frame it as a form of
   social critique so as to foreground its radical capacity to attend to
   and disrupt oppressive vehicles of power.},

Abstract = {The article looks at the origins of the 1944 constitution of Iceland,
   when the country declared its full independence from Denmark. It focuses
   on the years of the Second World War and places special emphasis on the
   constraints which members of parliament imposed on themselves in
   changing the constitution. Primarily, the leaders of the political
   parties in parliament were convinced that unless they agreed to change
   the constitution as little as possible, fierce quarrels would arise
   within parliament and amongst the public. That, however, had to be
   avoided since it was of vital importance that the outside world would
   see a nation united in its desire for full independence. Consequently,
   most MPs and others involved in the writing of the new constitution
   agreed that it would be a temporary measure. As soon as it had been
   ratified, however, work could begin on its revision. The conclusion is
   that in later debates in Iceland about the constitution, this crucial
   element has sometimes been overlooked or downplayed.},

Title = {Polecats, lions, and foxes: Coasian bargaining theory and attempts to
   legitimate the Union as a constrained form of political power},
Journal = {EUROPEAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {3},
Number = {1},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {It is often supposed that the European Union (EU) can be legitimated as
   a Pareto-improving bargain between its member states. This paper
   explores the assumptions of social choice and political philosophy that
   lie behind that claim. Starting out from a republican view that a polity
   needs to satisfy standards of non-arbitrariness if it is to be
   legitimate, the paper begins by explaining why `Coasian' assumptions of
   Pareto improvement are so important to arguments for the continued
   indirect legitimacy of the EU by its member states. The paper then
   identifies four reasons from the social choice literature why attempts
   to follow a `Coasian' pathway to Pareto improvement may fail to deliver
   forms of collective choice at the European level that are non-arbitrary
   from the point of view of all member state governments: non-neutral
   starting points, preference drift, indivisibilities, and multiple
   equilibria. These problems are, in turn, used to identify difficulties
   that mechanisms of indirect legitimation are likely to encounter in
   meeting two key conditions political philosophers specify for the
   non-arbitrary exercise of political power, namely, political justice and
   `democratic self-legislation'.},

   system against the background of its transition from military to
   democratic rule in 1999 and the challenges posed to overall outcomes,

   before-and-after assessment of policies and performances, the article
   highlights the progress made in reforming public finance, and discusses
   the formidable political, institutional and social constraints that have
   made reforms difficult and inefficient. By focusing on the Nigerian case
   information, the article contributes to the debates on whether or not,

Abstract = {The strong presence of large countries in World Trade Organisation (WTO)
   dispute settlement and the absence of very poor ones have raised
   concerns that increasing legalisation in the global trading system has
   not diminished discrimination against less powerful countries as much as
   expected. This article examines dispute initiations in all WTO member
   state dyads in 1995-2003 to shed more light on this issue. The analysis
   suggests that the main driver of dispute initiation is a gravitational
   one: larger economies and bigger traders are more likely to become
   involved in trade disputes primarily because their economies are more
   diversified, and also because greater market size makes them more
   attractive targets of litigation. While evidence is not found for
   discriminatory effects against countries with small legal capacity, the
   results of the article point to a more complex form of power bias -
   namely a preponderance effect. They suggest that disputes among country
   dyads including a much more powerful defendant than complainant or vice
   versa are dealt with outside the WTO. This finding is potentially
   worrying because it is, arguably, easier to reduce legal capacity
   differences than to reduce power differences.},

Abstract = {Federal and decentralized political systems vary in the extent to which
   sub-central governments enjoy policy authority, political independence
   from the center, and taxation powers. The institutionalist view of
   fiscal federalism holds that sub-central governments' fiscal powers are
   meaningful and self-enforcing only when the central government cannot
   undermine regional authority. Most recent empirical research on fiscal
   federalism has ignored the institutional foundations of the system, with
   adverse consequences for measurement and interpretation. A new,
   institutional measure of fiscal federalism is proposed. Cross-national
   tests using this measure for thirty-nine democracies find that more
   fiscally federal countries, especially those with many competing
   jurisdictions, have smaller government consumption and government share
   of gross domestic product, while expenditure decentralization increases
   government size, findings consistent with widely accepted
   institutionalist theories.},

Abstract = {This article uses a case study of the 2006 Iraq Study Group to
   illustrate the policy-making power and limitations of blue-ribbon
   commissions. I argue that the distinct political credibility of
   commissions can enable them to shape public opinion and drive policy
   change, but that commissions usually cannot bridge partisan divides on
   highly salient issues marked by intense polarization. The case study
   reveals that the Iraq Study Group influenced public views of George W.
   Bush's Iraq policy, placed significant pressure on Bush to change his
   Iraq strategy, and shaped the Iraq plan of Barack Obama-even though the
   commission was unable to forge agreement between Bush and Democratic
   congressional leaders.},

Abstract = {This article is upon the effects of Urban Reneval Plan and process of
   moving people from thier houses in Neslisah and Hatica Sultan districts
   which are known as Sulukule on the basis of gender. The data of the
   analysis is obtained by my field study to understand the roles,
   relations and work sharing process of the gender. During the field study
   on how gender effects on roles in the society and its practises, the
   procedure focused on the description and meaning, and has relationally
   and dialogic properties. In this process, it is found that the
   patriarchal relations of Romani people have its own characteristics.
   Also the private/public spaces, violence, jobs based on gender and the
   relationship with the space tries to be studied. Nevertheless, analysis
   of the physical and social organization of the location in the gender
   context has been tried to be shown in different aspects with the
   Sulukule example. Because, paradoxical relationship between the central
   (spatial) position of the Sulukule District and Sulukule residents out
   of center position (exclusion) reveals the different aspects of the
   process described as dislocation and gentrification. Questions like how
   much place do Sulukule Romanies take or do not take within the political

Abstract = {Emigrating from Mexico to the United States requires three steps: going
   to the border, crossing it, and going to the final U.S. destination.
   This article attempts to measure the earnings benefits of each migration
   step, focusing particularly on the second step: crossing the border.
   Using U.S and Mexican microdata of workers living in Mexico and in the
   United States, this article compares wages of identical individuals on
   both sides of the border after controlling for unobserved differences
   between migrants and nonmigrants. On average, Mexican workers increase
   their wages 1.22 times by moving to the Mexican side of the border, 4.15
   times by crossing it, and 1.12 times by moving to an interior location
   in the United States. Gains are larger for unskilled workers. Also,
   gains for crossing the border are larger for illegal workers, while
   gains for going to the U.S. interior are larger for legal workers.},

Abstract = {Post-North American Free Trade Agreement and post-9/11, increasing labor
   mobility combined with tightening security regimes and rising
   anti-immigrant sentiment has negatively impacted the health of mobile
   transnational populations in North America. Public health and
   immigration researchers have documented the problems faced by migrants
   and immigrants, including lack of access to health services and
   increased risk of exposure to infectious disease, work-related hazards,
   and violence. This article examines how civil society organizations that
   serve transnational populations act as drivers for health policy
   innovation and convergence. The methodology is a comparative case study
   that combines qualitative methods to analyze data across a range of
   knowledge domains. The article generates new knowledge about the role of
   nonstate actors on hemispheric integration and policy convergence.},

Abstract = {This article argues that Hobbes constructed the sovereignty acknowledged
   among European states on the supposition of the absence of sovereignty
   in the New World. The notion of international anarchy found in Hobbes
   before the twentieth century was not the anarchy of interstate relations
   later posited by realism, but the anarchy of prepolitical societies
   outside the ordered system of European states. The modern geography of
   sovereignty that Hobbes established is demonstrated with reference to
   the cartographic traditions that informed his representation of the
   state of nature and the civil state, and to the historical context of
   the law of nations as it was understood to manage colonial rivalry in
   the seventeenth century. By constructing savages as absolutely free
   individuals in the state of nature, he precluded their recognition as
   free sovereign states. He thus contributed a set of premises to natural
   jurisprudence that denied indigenous societies statehood and excluded
   them from the family nations. A sketch of the Hobbesian legacy among
   theorists of the law of nations and international law is made, showing
   how his motif of savage anarchy remained central to our
   conceptualization of the sovereign state within the international realm
   into the twentieth century.},

Abstract = {Although Ontario's first experiment with faith-based arbitration ended
   in 2006 with the Liberal government's amendment of the 1991 Arbitration
   Act to disallow faith-based arbitration, the debate about whether such
   tribunals should be permitted in a multicultural democracy is still open
   given that actors in a number of jurisdictions persist with campaigns to
   have faith-based arbitration recognized as legitimate. Are faith-based
   arbitration tribunals permissible in a multicultural democracy? Does
   faith-based arbitration put the rights of women and children at risk?
   More generally; are the requirements of democratic stability and
   legitimacy compatible with this sort of legal pluralism in family and
   civil law? The author assesses faith-based arbitration from the
   perspective of deliberative democracy and argues that, if certain
   institutional reforms and safeguards are adopted, faith-based
   arbitration may serve to improve deliberative reciprocity across group
   boundaries, rather than harm stability and integration in a
   multicultural democracy as critics suggest. Contemporary Political

Abstract = {The attention-grabbing act of planting a national flag of titanium on
   the seabed beneath the North Pole in 2007 made clear just how serious
   Russia's geopolitical ambitions in the north are. Several important
   lines of cultural-historical discourse verify Russia's
   self-understanding as a ``northern{''} nation. This dimension has often
   been neglected in favour of cliched comparisons of Russia and Europe.
   But even Russian concepts of the north are by no means homogenous. In
   the past two centuries, the north was repeatedly imagined as the place
   of origin of Russia's national culture and form of government.
   Simultaneously, there were movements towards disengagement and
   rejection, in which the autochthonous Slavic element was played off the
   northern, Scandinavian element, something that was seen as alien.},

Abstract = {This article, based on findings of my master thesis, points to changes
   and ideological absorptions of the narrative about the second Turkish
   siege of Vienna from 1683 until now (covering more than 300 years). By
   applying methods of critical discourse analysis, I attempt to
   demonstrate constraints and expansions that occurred in the dominant
   ``field of the speakable{''} - the field that defines limitations of
   what is thematically predicable under particular historical
   circumstances.},

   One challenge is how to generate the mass for stabilisation. Britain has
   a long history of small-scale but effective training and mentoring
   relationships with countries of strategic importance. A revitalised
   approach to building capacity in other nations - using the right people
   and structures - could have an important part to play in British
   security in an age of austerity.},

Title = {Assessing the Responsiveness of Spanish Policymakers to the Priorities
   of their Citizens},
Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {34},
Number = {4},
Pages = {706-730},
Abstract = {This article analyses how well Spanish political elites have responded
   to the issues signalled as priorities preferred by Spanish citizens from
   the early 1990s to the present, and to what extent the degree of
   correspondence between citizens' and policymakers' priorities is related
   to elections, type of government, issue jurisdiction and institutional
   friction. To measure this the authors rely on Most Important Problem
   surveys and several databases on laws, bills, oral questions and annual
   speeches, coded according to the comparative agendas project. They argue
   that the prioritisation of issues by political elites better matches
   public preferences at the agenda-setting stage than at the
   decision-making stage, and that correspondence of public and
   policymakers' priorities is inversely related to institutional friction.
   The evidence also illustrates that policymakers are more responsive to
   public priorities on those issues without shared jurisdiction, when the
   executive governs without a majority and immediately after elections.},

Abstract = {This article locates the apology within three of the major political
   traditions of Western political thought, namely conservatism, liberalism
   and socialism. While acknowledging internal differences within these
   traditions, it is maintained that the apology is largely incompatible
   with many of the tenets of liberalism and socialism and is more
   compatible with those of conservatism. However, in the sphere of
   practical politics it is groups and individuals from a broadly liberal
   and left tradition which tend to support both the idea and the practice
   of apology and conservatives which tend to oppose them, and this article
   attempts to address and explain this seeming paradox.},

Pages = {81-102},
Abstract = {For a long time it was a cliche to assign the intellectual
   responsibility of the French Revolution to philosophes like Voltaire,
   Montesquieu and Rousseau. More recent studies have tinted such a
   statement. From the first, the contribution seems to have been limited
   to the anticlerical spirit. In turn, the work of Rousseau seems
   increasingly to have been decisive in the conceptions that then
   prevailed: that of Sieyes, more moderate; that of Robespierre, more
   radical. The influence of Montesquieu is however less certain. This
   article aims to investigate precisely the echos of his thought during
   the revolutionary period. They can be perceived in the constitutionalism
   of the party called monarchien, who dominated the Constituent Assembly
   during the first months of the Revolution.},

Journal = {POLITIQUE EUROPEENNE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {34},
Number = {2},
Pages = {167-199},
Abstract = {The creation of political foundations at the EU level, made possible
   thanks to a Regulation adopted in December 2007, is a breakthrough
   compared to the European Commission's previous position on party
   affiliated organisations at both national and European levels. This
   evolution is part of the reorientation of the European communication
   policies, which seems to be an attempt to reach citizens who are
   somewhat indifferent to European affairs. This article analyses the
   mobilisation of political entrepreneurs in the European Parliament and
   of national foundations' networks, lobbying the Commission and Council
   representatives. The Commission's initiative needs to be considered in
   the political context of the aftermath of the 2005 constitutional
   referenda defeat. The article proposes a critical analysis of the
   foundations' contribution to the politicisation of the European public
   debate. It analyses their communication strategies to see how they
   respond to the European objectives of proximity and dialogue.},

Title = {Making Sense of an Unstable Legislature: Committee Assignments in the
   Argentine Chamber of Deputies, 1946-2001},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS IN LATIN AMERICA},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {3},
Number = {3},
Pages = {35-64},
Abstract = {Latin American legislatures have gone largely unstudied, with the
   functioning of the Argentine Chamber of Deputies prior to the 1980s
   being an entirely unexplored subject. This paper fills that gap by
   examining the organization of the Chamber, with particular focus on its
   standing committee system from 1946 to 2001. We assess the portability
   of two U.S.-based theoretical approaches to legislative organization by
   applying them to committee assignments. An original data set of
   Argentine deputies was constructed and a way of measuring political
   power in committees was devised for this study. Despite weak democratic
   governments, military interventions, and changes to the electoral
   system, we find that ruling parties have consistently influenced the
   committee system, shaping its structure and securing an over-proportion
   of their deputies in key committee positions. These results support the
   applicability of the U.S. originated Cartel Theory of legislative
   organization to understanding and studying legislatures outside that
   country.},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In this article the author argues that politicians' time horizons affect
   the differing levels of state intervention against AIDS. Using data
   measuring government spending, AIDS policy, and political constraints,
   the author tests the presumption that the leader of a country can
   determine a country's level of AIDS intervention. She looks at countries
   in eastern and southern Africa to explore the relationship between
   political institutions that constrain an executive's time horizon (i.e.,
   competitive elections) and the level of the state's efforts in the fight
   against AIDS. Her primary hypothesis is that an executive with a shorter
   time horizon is less likely to create policy or devote resources to
   intervene against AIDS. The author finds that lengthening an executive's
   time horizon increases the level of government spending on health but
   that executives with shorter time horizons tended to have more
   comprehensive AIDS policy than their counterparts with longer time
   horizons.},

Abstract = {According to the Constitution of 1866, the prerogatives of Carol I
   permitted him to be a mediator in the political struggle between
   liberals and conservatives, as a constitutional monarch. In 1866, there
   were different political groups, liberal and conservative, which formed
   unstable governments (1866-1871). The political stability was assured
   for a short period by the conservative government (1871-1876). In time,
   the political groups decided to unite, founding the two major parties,
   the National Liberal Party (1875) and the Conservative Party (1880).
   Both parties tended to monopolize the political power for a long period
   of time, generating tensions between government-opposition (1876-1888 -
   liberal government and 1888-1895 - conservative government). During 1895
   and 1914 functioned the ``rotativa guvernamentala{''} ({''}governmental
   rotation{''}), representing a particularity of the Romanian two-party
   system, characterized as an organized alternation at government of
   National Liberal Party with Conservative Party.},

Abstract = {Recent literature on international migration focuses on the benefits it
   confers on migrants in the form of better opportunities and living
   conditions, as well as on households receiving remittance. Although
   legal migrants in OECD countries often enjoy more rights than they would
   at home, this paper also looks at some of the negative aspects for
   sending countries. The paper uses two cases, the Philippines and
   Morocco, countries that have elaborated large-scale and successful
   policies to facilitate the export of labor and the flow of remittances.
   Despite decades of massive migration abroad, Morocco still has
   surprisingly poor social indicators, whereas the Philippines, despite
   much higher social indicators, has significant levels of poverty.
   Despite the long-term use of this development tool, migration, while
   opening up opportunities for people who leave home, maybe less positive
   for those who remain behind. Citing the views of migration experts as
   well as local voices, this paper examines some downsides of migration,
   including its use as a safety valve for discontent that may actually
   delay demands for needed domestic reforms that would broaden social
   rights at home.},

Abstract = {Oil consumption has varied significantly among democracies, but scholars
   have not systematically studied the political determinants of this
   variation. What effects do political institutions have on a democratic
   country's propensity to consume oil? Other things being equal, more
   centralized national political institutions facilitate the adoption of
   policies that lower oil intensity. A time-series, cross-sectional
   analysis of all democracies since the first oil shock in 1973, using an
   error correction model to separate short- and long-term effects and to
   correct for the nonstationarity of the dependent variable, provides
   strong support for a link between numerous veto players and slower
   reductions in oil intensity along with weaker support for the influence
   of party decentralization.},

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {55},

Abstract = {We study two different varieties of uncertainty that countries can face
   in international crises and establish general results about the
   relationship between these sources of uncertainty and the possibility of
   peaceful resolution of conflict. Among our results, we show that under
   some weak conditions, there is no equilibrium of any crisis bargaining
   game that has voluntary agreements and zero probability of costly war.
   We also show that while uncertainty about the other side's cost of war
   may be relatively benign in peace negotiations, uncertainty about the
   other side's strength in war makes it much more difficult to guarantee
   peaceful outcomes. Along the way, we are able to assess the degree to
   which particular modeling assumptions found in the existing literature
   drive the well-known relationship between uncertainty, the incentive to
   misrepresent, and costly war. We find that while the theoretical
   connection between war and uncertainty is quite robust to relaxing many
   modeling assumptions, whether uncertainty is about costs or the
   probability of victory remains important.},

Abstract = {We examine how candidates shape citizens' impressions of their personal
   traits during U.S. Senate campaigns. We look at the personality traits
   emphasized by candidates in their controlled communications and in news
   coverage of their campaigns. We couple information about campaign
   messages with a unique survey dataset allowing us to examine voters'
   understanding and evaluations of the candidates' personalities. We find
   that messages from the news media influence people's willingness to rate
   the candidates on trait dimensions. In addition, negative trait messages
   emanating from challengers and the press shape citizens' impressions of
   incumbents. In contrast, voters' evaluations of challengers are unmoved
   by campaign messages, irrespective of the source or tone of the
   communications. Finally, we find citizens rely heavily on traits when
   evaluating competing candidates in U.S. Senate campaigns, even
   controlling for voters' party, ideological, and issue preferences.},

Abstract = {The recent wave of interest in the rhetorical tradition among political
   theorists can be attributed partly to the rise of theories of
   deliberative democracy, which focused attention on communication and
   discourse. Some scholars see in rhetoric a way to challenge the
   assumptions of Habermasian deliberative theory, while others aim to
   integrate rhetoric into a broader theory of deliberation. Insights taken
   from studies of Aristotle have been especially influential in producing
   a new set of questions for scholars interested in deliberation and in
   democratic communications more generally, in spite of the vast
   differences between ancient city-states and modern liberal democracies.},

Abstract = {9/11 was costly for the UK, not only financially through increased

   cohesion. Former BBC Home Affairs Correspondent Margaret Gilmore
   assesses the consequences of the British response to 9/11, arguing that
   whilst some of our response has been reactionary and overblown, other

Pages = {473-488},
Abstract = {In the context of analyses of the rise of the religious right, this
   article examines the passage and outcomes of the `abortion debate' from
   2004 to 2006. It analyses the reasons for the then Health Minister Tony
   Abbott's pursuit of the issue, and his strategies to place abortion on
   the public agenda, through his encouragement of church lobbies and
   conservative allies in parliament. Although it is commonly argued that
   the influence of right-wing Christian lobbyists is growing, this
   exploration of the abortion debate indicates that this influence is
   limited, and that it was misunderstood and overstated at the time by
   politicians like Abbott, and by many political commentators.},

Title = {The Capability Approach as a New Basis for Poverty Research?},
Journal = {SWS-RUNDSCHAU},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {51},
Number = {1},
Pages = {84-103},
Abstract = {This contribution examines the so called ``capability approach{''},
   which has been now of considerable importance for poverty research for
   several years. References and non-references to other concepts of social
   ethics are discussed and the main characteristics are described based on
   the work of Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum, the two leading
   theoreticians in this field. It is shown that some elements of the
   capability approach - especially those connected to value questions -
   are contested, therefore, a substantial plurality within this approach
   can be found. As a consequence, the capability approach is compatible
   with other concepts of poverty and does not recommend definite
   guidelines for the further research on poverty. Even though this
   approach appears to be underdetermined, some of its core insights may be
   applied productively to questions on poverty research.},

Title = {Creating a Capable Bureaucracy With Loyalists: The Internal Dynamics of

Abstract = {This study explores why South Korea's top leadership combined a
   merit-based principle with region-based particularistic elements in the
   recruitment and promotion of career bureaucrats of the Ministry of
   Commerce and Industry (MCI) during its industrial takeoff in the 1960s
   and 1970s. It also investigates how this recruitment and promotion style
   was emulated by business sectors as a way of securing means to penetrate
   into the MCI. The authors argue that (a) South Korea's top leadership
   utilized region-based particularistic elements to secure loyalty to the
   authoritarian leader and (b) state bureaucrats fell back on the readily
   available social resources of the time-informal social ties-to reduce
   the uncertainty innate to policy implementation and to achieve
   short-term policy goals, and this practice bred the organizational
   foundation that might undermine the bureaucratic character of the
   state-legalism and impersonalism-at the later stage of economic
   development.},

Abstract = {The founding of the Czechoslovak Republic on American soil created a
   special relationship between the Czechs and the United States. The state
   structure of Czechoslovakia oriented itself on the principles of
   American democracy. The United States played an important role in the
   historical turning points of 1918, 1945, and 1989. But Vaclav Havel's
   attempt to adjust this tradition in the name of a ``New Europe{''}
   failed. The United States now has other global policy priorities. And in
   East Central Europe, a gradual turning away from an uncritical
   idealisation of America can be observed.},

Abstract = {Clientelism is characterized by the combination of particularistic
   targeting and contingency-based exchange. This method of contingent
   exchange thrives in both autocracies and democracies. It exists in a
   large variety of cultural contexts. Confronted with economic
   development, clientelism fades away in some political contexts but
   adapts and survives in others. This article explores our understanding
   of the origins and dynamics of clientelism, focusing on the
   relationships between clientelism and democracy and between clientelism
   and development. It then evaluates the connection between clientelism
   and a variety of political and economic outcomes, including democratic
   accountability, corruption, and public goods provision. It concludes by
   outlining some remaining empirical and theoretical challenges and
   highlighting recent innovations in data collection and empirical
   methods.},

Abstract = {The author proposes an annular model of the global geopolitical expanse
   - an analytical construction raised by the seeking to explain the
   correlation between the continental masses of Eurasia and their
   surroundings by virtue of: 1) developing H.J. Mackinder's ideas of
   concentration of the expanses around the geographical pivot of history
   and of the existence of crescent-structures: 2) being guided by
   A.P.Karpinsky's conceptions of concentric location of continents
   ``obliquely relative to the meridian{''}: 3) taking into consideration
   the views of A.L. Wegener e.a. concerning the drift of the continents
   and the pulsatory redistribution of the continental masses of the
   Pangaia protocontinent and the compressing envelopment of the Pacific
   ocean by those masses.},

   Generalised Trust Creation},
Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {34},
Number = {2},
Pages = {282-295},
Abstract = {The institutional approach to generalised trust creation is based on the
   assumption that only institutions with certain features give people
   reason to trust strangers. This article offers a revised version of this
   approach by arguing that there is an indirect rather than a direct link
   between the properties of institutions and trust among strangers.
   Referring to a neo-institutional idea of institutions, it is suggested
   that the potential of institutions for enabling people to trust
   strangers rests on institutions' power to structure individual action.
   The endurance and efficacy of institutions rather than their normative
   principles give us significant clues that our anonymous fellow citizens
   think about institutions as we do and accordingly feel committed to the
   rules of action. This, in turn, provides good reasons to believe that
   most of them will behave in an `appropriate' manner so that we can trust
   them even if they are strangers.},

   schemes of a country's development to derivatives of the more general

   (Russia). Its distinctive characteristics are ``monocentrism{''},

   of ``cycles of reforms-counter-reforms{''} and of ``cycles of

Title = {Negotiating the ``Spatial Turn{''} in European Cross-Border Governance:
   Notes on a Research Agenda},
Journal = {GEOPOLITICAS-REVISTA DE ESTUDIOS SOBRE ESPACIO Y PODER},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {2},
Number = {2},
Pages = {185-207},
Abstract = {Acknowledging the slippery nature of the term ``governance{''}, the
   paper begins by canvassing a `` first-wave{''} of academic reflection on
   the governance of European cross-border regions, emergent in the early
   to mid-1990s amid a EU-phoric plethora of institutional innovations
   designed to create `` laboratories of European integration{''} within
   and across the internal borders formerly dividing European member
   states. The paper then excavates the limitations of this theoretical
   sediment, arguing that by drawing on literatures rooted in public
   administration and political science, the properly spatial dimension of
   cross-border governance has been muted, if not rendered invisible. The
   paper seeks to address this shortcoming by focusing on insights offered
   up by the `` spatial turn{''} in geography and the wider social sciences
   as they relate to the increasingly visible problematic of transboundary
   governance evident at this time. Through this conceptual frame the
   author argues for a normative as well as theoretical specificity to
   cross-border regional spatiality, one which foregrounds the fact that,
   rather than merely epiphenomenal or derivative to state space, European
   cross-border regions (or, euregios) today are themselves important sites
   where the very meaning of `` the political{''} is being negotiated,
   contested, resisted and transformed. The paper suggests that a way
   forward in the analysis of governance in Europe's cross-border regions
   will demand breaking beyond several key assumptions of the mainstream
   border studies literature, notably the by now mantra-like insistence of
   borders as involving primarily identitarian distinctions between ``Us
   and Them{''}, and, concomitantly with this outlook, an understanding of
   internal European borders and cross-border regions as idiographically
   unique appendages to state territoriality. In contradistinction to these
   hegemonic assumptions, a postcolonial, ``contrapuntal{''} research
   agenda is posed, one which seeks to actively counter the logic of
   reducing cross-border ``difference{''} to the ``Same{''} by way of a
   renewed comparative perspectivalism.},

   to deny the deliberate character of those attacks and to rendering the
   demonstration of the intent of genocide impossible. It reconstructs,
   thanks to essentially geographical data, the reasoning elaborated by
   other geographers for the Pentagon so as to carry out this
   ``geographical war{''}. The practical use of geography for war gives
   evidence of both its political and military functions, which have always

   France},
Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {34},
Number = {2},
Pages = {296-316},
Abstract = {This article argues that the high level of protest activity in France
   is, at least partly, the result of distrust between the government and
   the trade unions, and that such distrust is inevitable in a society
   where unions are sometimes strong enough to mobilise against the
   government but not confident in their own future strength. This trust
   problem can be overcome if governments are willing to make institutional
   changes that commit them to future policies, but such political
   engineering is costly and unstable, which explains why governments
   sometimes prefer open confrontation. The empirical part of the paper
   analyses four French social and labour market reform initiatives in the
   1990s and 2000s, demonstrating that the ideas developed in this article
   help to explain important features of contemporary French policy-making.},

   Alteration},
Journal = {POLITIX},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {24},
Number = {95},
Pages = {73+},
Abstract = {An important number of studies take for granted that the state, which
   arouse during modernity as an essentially political reality, is nowadays
   increasingly shaped by heteronomous logics stemming from management.
   Yet, far less abundant are the studies that strive to observe and to
   document the concrete processes that support the move from the political
   definition to the managerial definition of the state, and the
   uncertainties this move gives rise to. This is precisely the objective
   of this article. We focus on the implementation of a reform of public
   management called ``Lolf{''} (for ``Loi organique relative aux lois de
   finances{''}) within the Ministry of Research between 2001 and 2007. The
   case is interesting as it shows an ongoing conflict between, on the one
   hand side, a conception of the reform that remains devoted to the
   political nature of public decisions and, on the other hand side, a
   conception that conversely indexes public decisions to economic and
   budgetary constraints. The study shows the simultaneously technical and
   semantic operations that make the second option taking precedence over
   the first and back the displacement of a public administration gradually
   thought of as a mere set of ``agencies{''}. We interpret this move
   towards agency as a process of ``impoliticization{''} of the state that
   the social sciences have to take into account if they wish to continue
   contributing to the understanding of the contemporary transformation of
   the state and the alteration (in both senses of the word) of the
   political.},

   Reflections on institutional apologies as politics of cultural
   citizenship},
Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Pages = {93-108},
Abstract = {Institutional apologies for historical injustices can be conceived as
   acts of symbolic inclusion directed to people whose collective
   experiences and memories of the past have not been recognized in the
   hegemonic narratives of the past. However, in this article it is argued
   that such apologies also have exclusionary potential as vehicles of
   symbolic politics of citizenship in that they may designate the
   apologizing community, so that it effectively excludes cultural
   `aliens', like migrants, from the community of `remedial' citizens. The
   article suggests a crucial point is the rhetoric shifts when one is
   appealing to both cultural and political solidarity, as when apologizing
   in the name of the state but simultaneously invoking `our' nation and
   `our' history. Thus, the increasing number of institutional historical
   apologies is not necessarily incompatible with the trend of reinforcing
   the symbolic boundaries around `our' historical-cultural communities
   that has been visible recently, e.g. in the demands for cultural canons
   and citizenship tests in many Western societies.},

Abstract = {The Northern Irish Westminster general election of 6 May 2010 witnessed
   a mixture of striking episodes and more mundane continuities in Northern
   Ireland. Not for the first time in the history of the Northern state,
   these changes reflected the ethnic divide - the leaders of the two main
   unionist parties failed to win a seat (indeed, the First Minister and
   leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, Peter Robinson, was unseated),
   as did the leader of a much-vaunted unionist insurgency, while
   nationalist politics remained largely as-you-were. The election
   reinforced divisions at the communal and party political level that have
   been a hallmark of the 1998 settlement. As such, one of the main results
   of the general election was to sound a starting pistol for the race for
   control of the symbolically important post of First Minister in the
   Northern Ireland Assembly elections scheduled for 2011.},

Title = {Democratic Transition, Persistent Civilian Control over the Military,
   and the South Korean Anomaly},
Journal = {ASIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {19},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {250-269},
Abstract = {South Korea's civilian control over the military has been amazingly
   stable, and no signs of political moves by the military have ever been
   detected since 1993. Given the frequency of military's intervention in
   civil politics and a relatively long duration of military rule, such
   civil-military relations seem quite anomalous. The article argues that
   the persistent civilian control over the military was an outcome of
   path-dependency of the military rule that disfavours military
   intervention in civil politics, while strengthening civilian control
   over the military. In South Korea, the military did not intervene in
   civilian politics as an institution. Two military interventions (1961
   and 1979) were nothing but greedy acts of politically motivated military
   officers, and those who seized political power crafted institutional
   arrangements that could prevent another military intervention.
   Consequently, the military in South Korea was highly de-politicized, and
   path dependency has produced a structure rather favourable to civilian
   control over the military in the postdemocratic transition period.
   Sanctioning and monitoring deserve special attention in this regard.
   Finally, socio-economic development and overall democratic maturity have
   led to the popular rejection of the military as a political actor,
   fostering the norm of traditional professionalism within the military.},

Abstract = {This paper examines how and why a deliberate enactment of the state got
   out of control. It does so by outlining three phases of border
   management in Tusheti, a highland province of post-Soviet Georgia. In
   the first phase, control was directly exercised by the local population.
   At the same time, border transgression for economic and political
   purposes was encouraged. A second phase of border management was
   triggered by the Chechen war in the mid-1990s. In order to discredit
   claims that Chechen `terrorists' were hiding in Georgian territory, the
   Georgian government, monitored by the Organisation for Security and
   Co-operation in Europe, effectively brought border transgression to a
   standstill. Finally, a third phase was initiated by a mission of the
   Georgian Orthodox Church sent to Tusheti with the aim of `spiritual
   fortification'. In the end, despite their courageous civic engagement,
   the locals had fewer entitlements than before. In order to explain what
   went wrong, I reflect on the downside of performing and incorporating
   the state and elaborate three different models of citizenship enacted by
   the key players in each distinct period. Finally, I argue for a
   temporalisation and hence deconstruction of the notion of
   `post-socialism'.},

Abstract = {Free media may reduce incidents of socio-political instability.
   Different types of sociopolitical instability have been shown to have a
   negative effect on investment and economic growth. This study examines
   the effect of free media on various indicators of socio-political
   instability. Using a panel of 98 countries over 1994-2005, this study
   shows that media free from government control and interference may
   decrease different forms of socio-political instability because it puts
   internal and external pressure on self-interested governments to act in
   the best interests of citizens-rather than their own. The empirical
   results suggest that a freer media is associated with lower levels of
   socio-political instability as measured by ethnic tensions, external and
   internal conflicts, crime and disorder, military participation in
   government and religious tensions. The estimates are robust to several
   sensitivity tests.},

Abstract = {Televised leaders' debates were, for the UK, a major innovation in the
   2010 General Election campaign. Though common in many other democracies,
   they have not previously featured in Britain. Inevitably, their likely
   influence on the election result was much debated both before and after
   the event. A substantial mid-campaign surge in support for the Liberal
   Democrats after the party's leader was widely seen as having won the
   first debate seemed to vindicate a claim of substantial effects, though
   over the remainder of the campaign Liberal Democrat support subsided and
   the other parties recovered, returning to nearly the same levels all had
   been at when the campaign opened. So were the effects of the debates
   very short term, or did their influence last until polling day? The
   paper employs panel data to assess the impact of voters' perceptions of
   how the party leaders performed in debate on their evaluations of the
   leaders, their parties, government performance and vote choice.},

Title = {Measuring Populism: A Quantitative Text Analysis of Party Literature in
   Belgium},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ELECTIONS PUBLIC OPINION AND PARTIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Pages = {97-119},
Abstract = {Despite the increased use of the term populism in vernacular and
   scholarly language, the measurement of the concept has long been
   neglected. The label is often attached to a certain party without any
   justification. Minimal definitions are alternatives but lack rigor.
   Classical content analyses provide more systematic measurements of
   populism but are extremely resource hungry. This article proposes an
   alternative, quantitative text analysis to measure the degree of
   populism among Belgian parties, drawing on both internally and
   externally oriented party literature. The results confirm that usual
   suspects such as the Vlaams Belang or Lijst Dedecker are the most
   populist of all parties under study. Populism turns out not to be an
   ``either-or{''} concept, however, since we also identify a moderately
   populist party. It is furthermore demonstrated how populism can be
   attached to other ideologies, such as the radical right and (neo)
   liberalism. A cross-validation of the proposed method with independent
   voter survey data confirms its validity. This article concludes that a
   quantitative text analysis might be a promising method to measure
   populism over time and space without the huge costs of hand coding.},

   Institutional Dependence and Franco-German Inflections},

Year = {2011},
Volume = {35},

Pages = {55-82},
Abstract = {Following its pragmatic emergence in the EU political landscape, the
   Presidency of the European Council was the most visible part of the
   rotating Presidency until the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty. An
   in-depth analysis of this function shows its long dependency on the
   half-year exercise. The Institutionalization of the Presidency of the
   European Council was primarily marked by two periods of inflection
   during which the behaviours of the actors, especially French and German
   leaders, have tailored a presidential role dissociated from the rotating
   presidency. The emergence of this supranational role has led to
   heightened tensions over questions of identity, due to its exercise by
   national leaders. Moreover, the secondary nature of its legal
   formalization as regards reflections and codifications by the actors
   themselves is clearly underlined by this institutional construction.},

Abstract = {The article analyzes the official policy of the Colombian Catholic
   Church forehead to liberalism between 1886 and 1930. Thesis rejects that
   Catholicism was totally intransigent with liberal modernity and
   maintains, on the contrary, that Catholic Church, at the end of the
   nineteen century, maintained a pastoral distinction between thesis
   (dogma) and hypothesis (local adaptation), that gave rise to a complex
   policy of adaptation here denominated ``dogmatic machinery of
   negotiation{''}, characterized as a discursive device (the neothomist
   philosophy) and as a political one (a classification system of the types
   of liberalism) to differentiate men from ideas, and to produce an
   individualized government, for selecting situations and people, case by
   case. It was an entropic device that was mining its own capacity to
   manage the generated tensions and the reached agreements.},

Abstract = {Recent scholarship suggests that the U.S. Supreme Court might be
   constrained by Congress in constitutional cases. We suggest two
   potential paths to Congressional influence on the Court's constitutional
   decisions: a rational-anticipation model, in which the Court moves away
   from its preferences in order to avoid being overruled, and an
   institutional-maintenance model, in which the Court protects itself
   against Congressional attacks to its institutional prerogatives by
   scaling back its striking of laws when the distance between the Court
   and Congress increases. We test these models by using Common Space
   scores and the original roll-call votes to estimate support in the
   current Congress for the original legislation and the Court's
   preferences over that legislation. We find that the Court does not
   appear to consider the likelihood of override in constitutional cases,
   but it does back away from striking laws when it is ideologically
   distant from Congress.},

Abstract = {This experimental study examined the perceived effects of negative
   political advertising on self versus others and whether such perceptual
   differences might be moderated by message type (issue versus character)
   and exposure. After viewing independently sponsored political ads from
   the 2004 presidential election, participants were found to have
   significantly different perceptions of the effects of negative political
   advertising on self versus others. While both exposure levels and
   participants' candidate preferences had an impact on the observed
   self/other perceptual differences, ad type did not have significant
   effects. Furthermore, it was found that an increase in the perceived
   effects of negative political advertising was a significant predictor of
   support for campaign finance reform.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS IN LATIN AMERICA},
Year = {2011},

Pages = {107-140},
Abstract = {In this paper, we systematically analyze decisions made by the Peruvian
   Constitutional Tribunal from 1996 to 2006 in amparo cases, which
   significantly impact individual rights. We ask the following question:
   in these types of cases, what conditions led the Tribunal to assert
   itself against the executive? Through an analysis of Tribunal decisions
   during the presidencies of Alberto Fujimori and Alejandro Toledo, we
   find that the Tribunal is more likely to rule against the executive, as
   the public's confidence in the executive decreases and as the share of
   congressional seats of the president's party declines. Further, the
   Tribunal is more willing to decide cases against the executive in areas
   that most pervade its docket, specifically in the areas of pensions and
   employment. These findings add to the comparative and American judicial
   politics literature by showing that high courts, even relatively weak
   ones, follow politics, but that case subject area and prevalence may
   temper this tendency.},

   Shari'a in Australia: A Case of Multiple or ``Clashing{''}
   Modernities?},
Journal = {DEMOCRACY \& SECURITY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {7},

Pages = {338-353},
Abstract = {In some Western countries with Muslim minorities, there has been debate
   in the last few years about the role of Shari'a in the context of
   domestic family law. In Australia there has been a negative response to
   the adoption of Shari'a, as this form of law has been seen as divisive,
   patriarchal, and inconsistent with the notion of the rule of law.
   Underlying these responses to Shari'a has been the implication that
   Islamic law was/ is backward and patriarchal whereas Western law was/is
   both secular and egalitarian. The aim of this article is to do three
   things: first, to show the extent to which matrimonial settlements by
   Muslims in divorce cases reflect a variety of personal practices and
   strategies toward Shari'a and Australian family law; second, to examine
   the values of Australian law and how law as a ``form of practice{''}
   excludes Muslim values; and third, to situate this debate within the
   multiple modernity thesis and argue that, to move the matter further, we
   should look into working toward a new multifaith pragmatic modern
   project.},

Abstract = {A small Buddhist nation long isolated in the Himalayas between China and
   India, Bhutan navigates the passage to internal modernity and global
   integration by using the precepts of `Gross National Happiness':
   cultural and environmental preservation, economic equity and
   sustainability, and clean and transparent governance. Challenges include
   the degree of homogeneity desirable under the doctrine of `One Nation,
   One People'. The country's youth wrestle with an education often
   unsuitable for job prospects, urban migration, social temptations, and
   the waning of traditions. Choosing cultural elements suitable for
   preservation, modification, or substitution incorporates key elements of
   spiritual continuity for easing the development path.},

Abstract = {In anticipating an 8th Pan-African Congress (PAC), this article reflects
   on the ideological dynamics of the 6th and 7th PACs that were convened
   in the last third of the 20th century. Of particular concern is the
   importance of drawing lessons from the persistent debates and
   contentions that took place at those meetings. Specifically, debates
   around Black nationalism and Black Marxism, that have been constants in
   Pan-Africanist discourse over the years, will remain significant.
   However, as calls for the next Congress grow, this article suggests a
   task of reflecting on the evolution of this important debate.},

Title = {From the global politics of poverty alleviation to the global politics
   of social solidarity},
Journal = {GLOBAL SOCIAL POLICY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2-3},
Pages = {233-249},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This article argues that the important role of the middle class in
   helping to expand state responsibility for social welfare and a minimum
   standard of living has been long forgotten, particularly so when it
   comes to the analysis of how to address ongoing problems of poverty and
   inequality in the developing world. In light of the global recession and
   the predicted failure to achieve most of the Millennium Development
   Goals, this article makes the case for returning to the idea that
   strengthening the middle class can contribute to improving the quality
   of life of more vulnerable populations. The `global politics of poverty
   alleviation', which has been the dominant development discourse for 20
   years, needs to be replaced by the `global politics of social welfare
   state building' or more precisely the `global politics of solidarity'.
   Equality, social mobility and collective welfare would thus become the
   focus of policy strategies rather than targeted populations and
   quantitative objectives. The article begins by investigating why the
   middle class has been neglected in international development and how it
   is experiencing a rebirth. The article then suggests why a shift in
   attention to the middle class is critical for addressing global social
   problems and offers a policy and research agenda for the future.},

Abstract = {The `varieties of capitalism' approach contributes to the explanation of
   varying privatization trajectories due to the assumption of
   institutional complementarities between coordinated market economies and
   state-owned enterprises. This hypothesis is corroborated by a
   quantitative analysis of privatizations in 19 OECD countries from 1978
   to 2008. Overall, coordinated market economies have privatized fewer
   sectors and have maintained greater state ownership of the shares (even
   when controlling for indicators of corporatism). Thus, the quantitative
   analysis provides additional support to the hypothesis which previously
   has mostly been tested using qualitative methods.},

Abstract = {In this article, we reassess the findings of where presidents visit
   during midterm elections from 1954 to 2010, with data that, for the
   first time, segments presidential visits into ``rallies,{''}
   fundraisers, and ``virtual{''} campaigning. On one hand, our findings
   reflect what others have found-when aggregating all visits together, the
   total Electoral College votes and the previous state-level winning
   percentage of the president in the state affect the probability of a
   visit by the president. However, presidents are more likely to visit
   states for a ``rally{''} when they are more popular, and the number of
   competitive races in the state is greater. Presidents are more likely to
   host a fundraiser in a state when the number of Electoral College votes
   is higher but are less likely to visit when there are fewer competitive
   races. The results suggest that there is value in knowing the purpose
   for which a president visited a state in a midterm election.},

Abstract = {Using a one-dimensional model of multi-bloc two-part competition across
   the two rounds of the French presidential election, and drawing on
   polling results from several months in advance of the election, we
   examine the Socialist Party's chances of winning the French presidency
   in 2012. Although the polls show that the Socialist Party has a high
   probability of winning the presidency, using our model, we argue that
   their likely success can be strongly affected by which candidate wins
   the 9 and 16 October two-stage Socialist Party primaries. We also show
   that our one-dimensional model allows us to estimate how the removal of
   Dominique Strauss-Kahn from the set of candidates shifted votes among
   the other candidates in the primary based on which of them was seen as
   ideologically closer to him. We also provide insights into the strategic
   calculations of President Sarkozy in his 2007 campaign and in
   anticipation of the 2012 election.},

Abstract = {The paper is an attempt to identify main challenges of the EU and of
   EU's eastern neighbours generated by EU's enlargement in 2007, that
   resulted in the shift of frontiers eastwards. The paper finds that the
   present EU eastern frontier is placed in an area where countries in
   between are subject to influences and centripetal forces coming from
   both east and west. The focus in this article is on Moldova and Ukraine
   - which represents the, southern flank' of the `tectonic plate' that
   separates EU from Russia. The first three parts of the article discuss
   the parallel evolutions of Russia and EU in the last twenty years, the
   development of the relationship between them and the impact of EU on
   Moldova and Ukraine, underlying some elements of Russia's impact as
   well. The fourth part is dedicated to the identification and discussion
   of the challenges EU, Moldova and Ukraine are faced with as a result of
   the evolutions generated by the 2007 enlargement.},

Abstract = {In this paper, I argue that a fuller understanding of the recent
   activism in Turkish foreign policy, and in particular the changing
   nature of relations with its neighbors, requires us to engage in the
   study of the increasing economic interdependence and the analysis of
   broadly redefined national interests. Therefore, this paper aims to
   explain Turkey's relations with its neighbors through the neo-liberal
   theory model put forth by Robert O. Keohane and Joseph S. Nye, which
   underlines the importance of interdependence and cooperation among
   states. I argue that recent developments in Turkish foreign policy,
   particularly Turkey's relations with its neighbors, resemble the
   characteristic features of complex interdependence. The new activism in
   Turkish foreign policy facilitates international cooperation among
   regional actors and creates a ``complex interdependence{''}.},

Abstract = {What rulers think is betrayed by their attitude towards freedom of the
   press. Viktor Orban and his government leave no doubt as to their
   position. They have terminated the constitutional guarantees of freedom
   of the press. A new media authority not only regulates the media market,
   but is to supervise and sanction the media with regard to content. In a
   move unprecedented for a democracy, the media law threatens freedom of
   the press. 900 journalists were dismissed from public broadcasters. That
   was a political purge. Under the Fidesz government something unexpected
   has happened. A state monopoly of opinion has been restored, something
   that seemed to have been overcome in 1989.},

Abstract = {In the elections to the Latvian Saeima in September 2011, Harmony Centre

   The new party of former President Valdis Zatlers also achieved a high
   degree of popularity. By contrast, the former ruling party and the
   oligarch parties suffered heavy losses. After the elections, the
   ethnic-Latvian political elite struggled with the question whether it
   should maintain its monopoly on power. But it lacked the courage to open

Journal = {CONTEMPORARY POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {10},
Number = {4},
Pages = {423-443},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Drawing on the work of Jacques Derrida, I propose a deconstructive
   reading of Gutmann and Thompson's theory of deliberative democracy. The
   deconstructive reading starts from their concept of provisionality, and
   I argue that provisionality has consequences beyond those admitted by
   Gutmann and Thompson. While provisionality is an essential part of
   Gutmann and Thompson's theory of deliberative democracy, it also
   dislocates the principles and distinctions on which their theory rests.
   Although Gutmann and Thompson try to control the effects of
   provisionality for instance, through a distinction between deliberative
   and non-deliberative disagreements ultimately this is only possible by
   suppressing contingency and disagreement, which are otherwise part of
   the motivation for introducing provisionality. Thus, Gutmann and
   Thompson's deliberative democracy is marked by a tension between their
   affirmation of provisionality and their attempts to limit the effects
   provisionality. Out of the deconstructive reading emerges an alternative
   deconstructive conception of democracy and provisionality in terms of
   Derrida's concept of democracy to-come. Contemporary Political Theory

   moratorium on capital punishment has little to do with public opinion,
   which generally favors retaining the death penalty. Rather, it reflects
   specific domestic political contexts, especially the power and autonomy
   of the executive and the experience of a drastic regime change, that

Abstract = {This paper focuses on the members of the military and their families who
   have served on behalf of the American public over the last ten years of
   conflict. Typically referred to as the ``9/11 Generation,{''} this
   extraordinary cohort of young Americans has already made major
   sacrifices for the American people, yet has the potential for continued
   service as members of the academic, and broader American, community. Yet
   military families also face distinctive challenges that are not always
   considered under the rubric of civil-military relations. The paper
   focuses on these by outlining the military families initiative known as
   Joining Forces, and suggests steps that the academic community can
   undertake to strengthen the connection between the military and the
   public it serves.},

Abstract = {``Public interest{''} narratives are practical tools for policy makers
   to justify policy choices and methods of implementation. Few studies
   have been conducted on the narratives of the public interest in
   semidemocratic, less-developed countries, however. In Western
   scholarship, the public interest has been conceptualized in three ways:
   as the common good, as the aggregation of public preferences, or as a
   deliberative process. This article examines how narratives of the public
   interest were used in the development of environmental policy in
   Tanzania over more than a decade. Looking at three stages of
   administrative policy making, the findings suggest that narratives
   differ according to the audience perceived to be most important to
   policy makers.},

Abstract = {Over a decade ago, Hays and Kearney published results from a survey of
   human resource managers who were members of the International Personnel
   Management Association and the Section on Personnel and Labor Relations
   of the American Society for Public Administration. This survey solicited
   members' opinions regarding the present and anticipated status of public
   personnel systems at that time. Our survey solicits the opinions of
   human resource management (HRM) professionals at the local government
   level a decade later to determine the importance of these same functions
   and activities to the practice of HRM today. Survey respondents are also
   requested to project the importance of these same concepts in 2019. This
   analysis shows that while the reinvention movement has generated several
   changes in the field of public HRM, many of the traditional functions
   and activities continue to remain as important at the local level of
   government.},

   third candidate in a general election immediately thereafter. Prior to
   the primary election, there is a pre-election poll on how voters would
   vote in a hypothetical general election between one of the candidates in
   the primary election and the third candidate. I illustrate that voters
   have an incentive to misrepresent their voting intentions in the
   pre-election poll in order to influence voter beliefs about candidate
   electability in the general election and possibly cause voters to vote
   differently in the primary election.},

Abstract = {Research on multiparty governments has started to debate how coalition
   partners oversee each other's policymaking. Due to the divergence of
   preferences among partners and the difficulty of sanctioning members of
   other parties, cabinet members attempt to monitor each other in
   policymaking activities through the use of junior ministers. By
   analyzing multiple countries' governments across decades, this article
   contributes to the current debate about government oversight by defining
   the circumstances under which parties in coalition governments choose to
   use junior ministers to keep tabs on ministers from coalition partners.
   Specifically, we contend that their use depends on the power dynamics
   within a coalition, as well as the institutional structures in the
   broader political environment.(1)},

Abstract = {The hypothesis of inequality as the source of violent conflict is
   investigated empirically in the context of killings by Nepalese Maoists
   in their People's War against their government during 1996-2003. The
   dependent variable is the total number of people killed during that
   period by Maoist rebels in each of 3,857 villages. Inequality is
   measured by the Gini, the Esteban-Ray polarization index, and four other
   between-groups indexes. Using models with district fixed effects, and
   instrumenting for endogeneity of the inequality measures, we find strong
   evidence that greater inequality escalated killings by Maoists. Poverty
   did not necessarily increase violence. Education moderated the effect of
   inequality on killing, while predominance of farmers and of Nepali
   speakers exacerbated it. We find evidence that more killings occurred in
   populous villages, lending support to the idea that violence was
   directed at expanding the Maoist franchise by demonstrating that
   opposition to the monarchy and elites in power was possible to achieve.},

Abstract = {An empirical study in six Russian cities shows that the question whether
   an active civil society exists is anachronistic. It exists and is slowly
   growing. Non-governmental organisations and initiatives are engaged in
   many areas. But in everyday life, they run up against numerous problems.
   Financing is precarious, co-operation with state agencies threatens
   their autonomy, and repression is always present. But the civil sector
   has also failed so far to develop a strategy to embrace the interests of
   social groups ``from below{''}, articulate them, and transform them into
   a durable stable social movement or even stable organisations.},

Abstract = {Very few theories of democratic elections can claim to overarch the
   field. One of them that has not been given due regard, I suggest, is
   Albert Hirschman's Exit, Voice, and Loyalty. I aim to exploit the
   integrative capacity of this general framework in a model of typical
   ``midterm{''} effects occurring through the electoral cycle. The model
   unites such diverse phenomena as antigovernment swings, declining
   turnout, protest voting, conversion, and alienation. An empirical test
   with comparative survey data from elections to the European Parliament
   reveals that the role of strategic voting in the form of voice is
   limited. Instead, processes of de- and realignment in the form of exit
   dominate a picture of European Parliament elections beyond the
   widespread conception of ``second-order{''} irrelevance. More generally,
   the ``cyclical{''} view on voting behavior suggests systematic links
   between short-run midterm effects and long-run electoral change.},

Abstract = {The authors assess the factors that affect judgments about the fairness
   of the distribution of wealth with pooled public opinion data from
   Latinobarometro surveys conducted in 1997, 2001, and 2002. They test
   hypotheses with a multilevel logit model that allows them not only to
   examine the effects of the class background and perceptions of
   individual respondents but also to assess the impact of society-level
   differences in economic growth, GDP per capita, income concentration,
   and the availability of information. Examining the direct and
   conditional effects of these society-level factors, the authors find
   support for relative deprivation approaches but much more limited
   evidence for hypotheses derived from distributive conflict and
   development theories.},

Abstract = {The provocative question raised by Rogers Smith's ``Living in a
   Promiseland? Mexican Immigration and American Obligations{''} is whether
   the tortured history of U.S.-Mexican relations and the racialized
   context of Mexican immigrant reception can best be ameliorated through
   targeted immigration policies that would create added opportunities for
   Mexican migrants relative to others. I argue that the current, more
   universally-principled system of U.S. immigration policy, supplemented
   by an inclusive legalization program, can better serve the needs of
   potential Mexican migrants and Mexican immigrants resident in the United
   States. Also, I am more skeptical than Smith is about the depths of
   Mexico's commitment to seeking binational strategies to address the
   needs of its emigres abroad.},

Abstract = {This paper addresses the arguments presented by Gougou and Labouret
   (2011) in their comments on my paper. I contest their arguments that
   are, from a theoretical point of view, unfounded and I show that the
   methodology that they propose to test my theoretical hypothesis is not
   appropriate. I thus argue that my conclusion regarding the major impact
   of the electoral reform on turnout at the 2010 French regional election

Abstract = {The authors uncover evidence that citizens' priorities about various
   spheres of legislative representation differ across demographic groups
   and that these differences are subsequently reflected in the in-office
   behavior of their elected officials. Specifically, African Americans and
   Latinos are less concerned than whites with policy representation-the
   attentiveness of elected officials to citizens' policy preferences-but
   place more emphasis on their district receiving its fair share of
   federal money. Citizens with higher incomes place a higher priority on
   policy representation and less on constituency service than do those
   with lower incomes. Importantly, these priorities map onto their member
   of Congress's behavior.},

Abstract = {The political consequences of the crisis in world financial markets are
   only beginning to be understood. In this article, we take up one of
   these many repercussions by examining public beliefs of who's to blame
   for a complex and unparalleled set of events. Analyses of survey data
   from Britain find that while most assign responsibility for the crisis
   to market actors, the likelihood of blaming governments, as opposed to
   blaming banks and investors, is greater among low sophisticates and
   Conservative Party identifiers. We further show how elite messages from
   competing political elites evolved over-time and were reflected in mass
   beliefs about the crisis. Results highlight the centrality of partisan
   cues and, in particular, of political sophistication in understanding
   the dynamics of responsibility attributions. Lastly, we estimate the
   consequences of blaming the government for the crisis for voter choice.

Abstract = {This article examines how powerful policy actors defend themselves
   against opponents' strategies of conflict expansion through a case study
   on the oil sands of Alberta. In response to an escalation of criticism
   of its performance on environmental regulation and related issues, the
   government of Alberta has pursued a strategy of engaging in several
   multi-stakeholder consultations. We argue that in examining subsystem
   change, it is essential to go beyond an examination of formal
   institutional mechanisms to examine policy impacts. Thus far, despite a
   significant pluralisation of consultative mechanisms on the oil sands,
   there is little or no evidence of a shift in power away from pro-oil
   sands interests. This strategy of selective opening is designed to
   bolster the legitimacy of the policy process while maintaining control
   over decision rules and venues.},

Title = {Taking Cantonal Variations of Integration Policy Seriously - or How to
   Validate International Concepts at the Subnational Comparative Level},
Journal = {SWISS POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {17},
Number = {3},
Pages = {336-357},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Subnational varieties of immigrant integration policy, which are
   particularly salient in federal states, remain largely neglected by
   migration studies. Following Lijphart, who long demanded to verify
   international research at the subnational level, this study aims at
   capturing subnational policy variations using the example of Swiss
   cantons. In line with international approaches, cantonal integration
   policies are conceptualized and measured in terms of immigrants' ease or
   difficulty of access to civic, political, socio-structural, as well as
   cultural and religious rights and obligations. The transfer of an
   international concept to the subnational level facilitates a validation
   of the former, which constitutes a second neglected research field.
   Finally, a look at the empirical evidence allows testing the construct
   validity of our measurement: in line with theoretical assumptions, our
   data reveal a clear linguistic divide, an institutionalised
   ``Roschtigraben'', with German speaking cantons exhibiting overall more
   restrictive policies than Latin cantons.},

Abstract = {While research has provided evidence that culture and institutional

   scholars have neglected to adequately estimate the effect of political
   institutions and macroeconomic conditions on trust. Using data from the
   World Value Surveys for eleven Latin American cases, we test if
   countries with ``partyizing{''} electoral systems - those with rules
   that encourage voters to hold the party, not individuals, accountable
   for government performance - experience lower levels of distrust in
   political parties and the legislature in times of poor economic
   conditions than those countries with ``personalizing{''} electoral
   rules. Our analysis shows that the macro political and economic context
   largely conditions the impact of culture and institutional performance
   on political trust. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {As the maladies of material scarcity fade into cultural memory
   throughout much of the post-industrial world, there is something of a
   tendency to orient ethical and political reflection away from any
   driving concern for limitation, whether material or intellectual. In
   this article, I revisit Sartre's underappreciated meditations on
   scarcity and dialectical reason in an effort to vivify a sense of
   reflective sobriety. I argue that dialectical language emerges in
   Sartre's later work, at least partly, as a rhetorical tool, a means of
   directing attention toward persistent conflicts over limited resources.
   On Sartre's account, we tend to `internalize' conflicts in such a way
   that we come to exhibit an almost Hobbesian political sensibility or
   ethos. By underscoring the psychic significance of our situation in what
   he calls a `milieu of scarcity,' Sartre's dialectical perspective
   encourages a sharper attentiveness to some of the material and
   intellectual constraints that may prevent the normative possibilities
   late-modern theorists imagine and defend. Contemporary Political Theory

Abstract = {Japan is geographically located on the fringe of Asia. Japan's location
   is often divided between those arguing that Japan is inside Asia and
   those arguing it is outside Asia. Japanese ideas of Asian regionalism
   are thus immensely varied. This article details a number of Japanese
   ideas on Asian regionalism with author/agency, scope and method
   specified. Special mention is made of weak integration of government
   agencies, thus causing proliferation of many Japanese ideas within Asia.
   With the increasing self-assertiveness of China, the apparent peaking
   out of American hegemony, and the steady rise of non-Chinese Asians,
   Japan tries to maintain enduring alliance with the United States, to
   invigorate interdependence with China, and to reinvent new relationships
   with the countries of the East Asian Summit. Japanese ideas of Asian
   regionalism take those templates as guidelines to develop new ideas of
   Asian regionalism.},

   authors stress that they are writing the ``truth{''} about the blockade.
   However, even they follow a normative discourse with established
   formulae for pathos. An alternative, critical means of writing was only
   possible in private documents destined for a close circle of recipients.
   Only most recently have writers of the postwar generation de-heroicised

Abstract = {Although elections loom large in the study of nondemocracies, scholars
   continue debating what function those elections play. This article sets
   evidence from the Arab world in a global context to evaluate three
   theorized roles for elections: safety valve, patronage network, and
   performance ritual. Executive elections in the Middle East and North
   Africa remain less common and less competitive than polls in sub-Saharan
   Africa and Asia. This profile is largely consistent with the observable
   implications of leading theories. The data, though, also show
   theoretically rich differences. Although levels of competition and
   participation in Yemen, Tunisia, and Algeria fit expectations about
   elections being safety valves or political spectacles, Egypt's
   presidential election stands apart, with exceptionally meager public
   involvement. In such circumstances, where competition and turnout are
   both unusually low, other social and political phenomena may matter more
   than elections for regime survival, resource distribution, and the
   manifestation of state power.},

Abstract = {This article addresses the expansion and mutation of the democratic
   political regime that has acquired a universal validity and value,
   resulting in the centrality of citizenship, understood as a space of
   individuals who are given rights or otherwise claim them and constitute
   changing associative and identity bonds.
   At the same time there is a questioning of representation bonds in
   different orders of social organization, resulting in an emancipation of
   the political world. Therefore the conception of public and political
   life as a mere expression of social realities and the conflicts they
   entail has vanished. Interests and ideals are constituted in the public
   sphere along with the citizen identities that support them.
   It is evident that the very institutional and normative system is in
   permanent revision and restructuring, so democracy should be conceived
   as an unstable regime, where an autonomous citizenship keeps distance
   from power by making their rulers renew their legitimacy in each
   decision. In fact, the political regime could be defined as a continuous
   democracy whose essence is citizen life, which requires but does not
   occur within an institutional device; as a consequence, is not
   definitive and universal but subject to the particular mutations that
   democratic principles require.},

Abstract = {Republican party government during the presidency of George W Bush
   prompted liberal academics and intellectuals to reconsider the theory of
   responsible party government (RPG). While liberal thinkers traditionally
   had viewed party government positively, the onset of robust conservative
   government led some to question its desirability This article examines
   this momentary turn in liberal thought and argues that it misconstrues
   the arguments for RPG, overstates the extent to which contemporary
   conditions constitute a fulfillment of the model, and exaggerates the
   degree to which Bush-era Republicans were able to shift policy to the
   right. Most important, recent critics misunderstand the ways that
   stronger parties help organized labor and favor a left-liberal political
   agenda. Polity (2011) 43,358-387. doi:10.1057/pol.2011.2; published

Journal = {AUSTRALIAN REVIEW OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS},

Abstract = {The practice of ` academic red-shirting'(parents delaying enrolment in
   primary school for a year after their child is first eligible) is
   becoming more common in the developed world. The idea behind this
   practice is that the ` gift of time'enables children to develop
   cognitively and emotionally so that they are more school-ready than
   their peers. Little is known about the factors associated with delayed
   school entry in Australia. In this paper we begin to fill this gap in
   the Australian research using data from the Longitudinal Study of
   Australian Children. We estimate that 14.5 per cent of school entrants
   in 2005 had been delayed from the previous year, the first national
   estimates of delayed entry. The rates of delayed school entry vary
   markedly between states and territories with New South Wales having
   particularly high rates of delayed entry (31.3 per cent in 2005).
   Parental decision-making about delaying a child's entry to school
   appears to be most influenced by state and territory entry age policies
   with only a few other factors found to be statistically significant.
   Children who are less able to persist at tasks and boys are more likely
   to be delayed entrants. The decision to delay a child's entry to school
   is also more likely if English is the mother's first language and if the
   family lives in a non-metropolitan area.},

Abstract = {Jocelyne George, Female workers and feminism (1945-1979)
   Between 1945 and 1979, we can observe a trade-union feminism, whose
   influence and strength are not recognised. Women of the CGT were the
   first, the more conscious, and the more engaged in the struggle for
   recognition of their role at work and in their organisation. Those of
   the CFDT have been for a long time the victims of the reluctance of
   their union (of catholic origin). Then they joigned other feminist
   movements. CGT and CFDT will meet in 1979 during the struggle for the
   right to abortion, which is considered for now on as a new social
   freedom.},

Abstract = {Dale and Strauss's (DS) noticeable reminder theory (NRT) of voter
   mobilization posits that mobilization efforts that are highly noticeable
   and salient to potential voters, even if impersonal, can be successful.
   In an innovative experimental design, DS show that text messages
   substantially boost turnout, challenging previous claims that social
   connectedness is the key to increasing participation. We replicate DS's
   research design and extend it in two key ways. First, whereas the
   treatment in DS's experiment was a ``warm{''} text message combined with
   contact, we test NRT more cleanly by examining the effect of ``cold{''}
   text messages that are completely devoid of auxiliary interaction.
   Second, we test an implication of NRT that habitual voters should
   exhibit the largest treatment effects in lower salience elections
   whereas casual voters should exhibit the largest treatment effects in
   higher salience elections. Via these two extensions, we find support for
   NRT.},

Abstract = {This article examines Rousseau's understanding of the phenomenon of
   admiration. I begin with a discussion of Rousseau's critique of the
   enlightenment understanding of the relation among admiration, charisma,
   and fanaticism found in Voltaire's Mahomet. I then turn to Rousseau's
   own account of the nature of admiration and his argument that admiration
   is necessarily ubiquitous in social life, even in the minds of
   apparently cynical men. Next, I look to Rousseau's indications of how
   this psychic passion can be constrained and turned to good use for
   political and moral education. Finally, I offer a critical assessment of
   Rousseau's view of admiration, arguing that he shows persuasively that
   admiration is inevitable in social life, but that his ``system{''}
   offers no standard of the truly admirable grounded in nature. Rousseau
   thus teaches us an important lesson about ourselves, but leaves us in
   need of guidance we cannot find in his system.},

Abstract = {Luck egalitarianism provides one powerful way of defending global
   egalitarianism. The basic luck egalitarian idea that persons ought not
   to be disadvantaged compared to others on account of his or her bad luck
   seems to extend naturally to the global arena, where random factors such
   as persons' place of birth and the natural distribution of the world's
   resources do affect differentially their life chances. Yet luck
   egalitarianism as an ideal, as well as its global application, has come
   under severe criticisms in recent debate. My aim in this article is to
   restore plausibility to the luck egalitarian idea, and to suggest how it
   could then provide a plausible grounding for global egalitarianism. To
   do this, I will propose a more modest but also more defensible
   conception of luck egalitarianism that can also strengthen the case for
   global distributive justice.},

   Beast Policies Feed the Machine},
Journal = {FORUM-A JOURNAL OF APPLIED RESEARCH IN CONTEMPORARY POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The notion of ``starving the beast{''} has been an important
   justification for fiscal programs emphasizing revenue reductions since
   the mid-1970s. While the idea of restraining government spending by
   limiting government revenues has an intuitive appeal, there is
   convincing evidence the reducing federal tax rates without coordinated
   reductions in federal spending actually produces long-term growth in
   spending. This perverse result is explained by a theory of ``fiscal
   illusion.{''} By deferring the costs of government services and benefits
   through deficit financing, starve the beast policies have the effect of
   lowering the perceived price of government in the minds of many
   citizens. We assess the principal behavioral prediction of the fiscal
   illusion theory.
   Incorporating estimates of the effects of federal deficits into a
   standard substantive model of Stimson's mood index, we find strong
   support for a subjective price-driven theory of demand for government.
   In particular, we find that the size of the federal budget deficit is
   significantly associated with greater demand for government services and
   benefits. This may have important implications for contemporary debates
   about fiscal discipline.},

Journal = {BRITISH POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {6},

Abstract = {Parliamentary misconduct is a recurring feature of British politics. It
   has a long history and a broad meaning: some transgressions are
   relatively trivial; others encroach on the territory of political
   corruption. This article systematically analyses instances of officially
   recognised misconduct in the House of Commons since 1995. It explores
   recent institutional changes in the way that the House seeks to maintain
   Members' propriety and analyses incidents of misconduct by coding every
   critical report about a named MP published by the House's Committee on
   Standards and Privileges. The article identifies eight general types of
   misconduct: breaching parliamentary privilege, failing to register an
   interest, failing to declare a relevant interest, engaging in paid
   advocacy, personal misbehaviour, making an improper private gain from
   official resources, making an improper political gain from official
   resources and obstructing the House's investigative procedures. It finds
   that failures to register financial interests were initially the most
   common form of misconduct, and it also finds an increase in the number
   of cases involving the misuse of allowances in the years before the 2009
   expenses controversy. It discusses possible causes for these patterns
   and concludes by pointing the way for future research. British Politics

Year = {2011},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {From the normative point of view, there is a general agreement that
   representatives should act in line with the interests of those being
   represented. The knowledge about citizens' preferences for
   representation is very limited, however. This study examines MP's
   representative roles from the perspective of the citizens. It utilises a
   task definition approach in the Finnish institutional setting, which
   substantially differs from the context of earlier investigations in
   terms of open-list electoral systems with mandatory preferential voting.
   Based on the 2007 Finnish National Election Study (n = 1,422), voters'
   preferences concerning four different representational roles are
   analysed: as representatives pursuing the interests of their electoral
   district, party, individual voters or being independent actors. Next,
   voters' preferences are accounted for by the factors related to each
   type of representation: citizens' regional electoral context, party
   attachment and electoral supply, political engagement and political
   competence, respectively. The results show that citizens living in
   electoral districts located far away from the political centre or in
   constituencies where it is more difficult for small parties to win
   political representation are most prone to prefer regional
   representation. Similarly, voters who have closer ties with political
   parties prefer party-centred representation while those who feel less
   politically efficient favour close ties with their MPs. Education in
   turn increases the support for a political representative to act
   independently from the electorate or the party.},

   and aggregating published vote-intention figures from across different
   polls; forecasting how public opinion might change before election day;
   and predicting the seat totals from the forecasted election-day vote
   shares. Specifically, we consider a state-space model for opinion polls
   which correct for house effects and other sources of survey error, the
   estimation of the historical relationship between polls and the
   election-day share of the vote, and a probabilistic approach to
   predicting the winner in each constituency. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Authoritarian consolidation is conceptualised as a deliberate state
   project to improve a regime's capabilities for governing society. It is
   hypothesised that the durability of an authoritarian regime increases to
   the extent that regime elites manage to substitute coercion for
   governing by organisation, regulation and the management of discourses.
   This provides them with a broader - and less costly - range of options
   to address social problems and regime challenges than merely
   intimidating or cracking down on opponents.},

Abstract = {In this article, the author shows why the student movement for free
   education ({''}the blockade{''}) is wrong in asserting that the cause of
   injustice in higher education is the implementation of an allegedly
   neo-liberal project - the Bologna Process. Furthermore, he claims that,
   in a serious discussion which would include all interested parties, the
   students' demand of ``everything free on all levels in the highest
   possible numbers{''} could not be defended as a just demand. A socially
   just higher education would not be one which would be available free of
   charge to all interested parties, but one which would ensure access to
   higher education to the poor. The expose of the article is divided into
   three sections. First, Kurelic presents some ideological-theoretical
   formulations used in advocating free education. Then he attempts to show
   the short-sightedness of such formulations by referring to the example
   of criticism aimed at the higher education reform in Croatia, the
   so-called Bologna. In the third and final section, he explains why he is
   of the opinion that egalitarian liberals such as Scanlon and Barry,
   developing their line of argument from the position of social justice,
   would ask for much more than cancellation of school fees on all levels,
   and why the demand formulated according to Barry's categories is more
   solid.},

Abstract = {Recent research from social psychology suggests that personal values
   predict political behavior, such as vote choice. In contrast to previous
   studies, it is hypothesized in this article that personal values
   influence voting behavior only indirectly through political value
   orientation. Drawing on the personal value concept of Shalom Schwartz,
   structural equation models based on Swiss electoral data (SELECTS 2007)
   are applied to test the hypothesis of indirect effects. The empirical
   analysis shows that the effects of personal values are indeed mediated
   by political values, but that their indirect impact on vote choice
   remains substantial. It is argued on a theoretical level that personal
   values need first to be translated (or transformed) into political
   values to become effective on voting behavior.},

Abstract = {Research investigating whether female legislators provide more effective
   substantive representation on women's issues than their male colleagues
   faces a significant methodological hurdle. Models used to estimate the
   effect of gender on representation inevitably omit constituency
   variables that affect the character of legislators' decisions and are
   also correlated with gender, potentially biasing the estimates of the
   effect of gender. Employing a quasi-experimental research design as an
   alternative strategy, the authors remove this hurdle and estimate the
   influence of gender on representation free from this potential bias. The
   authors find that gender does affect representation and observe critical
   mass effects.},

Title = {Forecasting the 2010 general election using aggregate local election

Abstract = {The paper presents a revised method for estimating national vote shares
   using aggregate data from local government by-elections. The model was
   originally developed to forecast the annual outcome of local elections
   but was adapted in time to provide an accurate forecast of Labour's
   landslide victory at the 1997 general election. However, over the past
   decade the changing pattern of party competition which has seen parties
   becoming more selective about which elections to contest has led to more
   elections being excluded from the modelling because they failed to meet
   the exacting criteria that all three major parties, Conservative, Labour
   and Liberal Democrats, had contested both the by-election and the
   previous main election, normally held in May. Relaxing these criteria,
   although increasing the number of available cases would adversely affect
   the forecast, over- or under-estimating party votes. Instead, the
   revised method overcomes the problem of differential competition by
   estimating vote shares for parties that contest one but not both
   elections. A further innovation is the calculation of a weighted moving
   quarterly average which takes account of the number of days elapsed
   between the by-election date and the date of forecast. Using the new
   method we provide estimates for likely party shares for the 2010 general
   election. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This article proposes a new cross-national thesis for judicial decision
   making. The judicial politicization theory posits that judges on highly
   politicized high courts will be more likely to decide cases using
   ideological and attitudinal factors than judges at less politicized
   courts. The theory holds that informal norms regarding judicial
   appointment by the executive are more important than the formal
   selection mechanism in determining whether a judiciary is highly or less
   politicized. The results show significant attitudinal judicial voting at
   each high court and strong support for the contention that judges on
   highly politicized courts are more likely to decide cases ideologically.},

Abstract = {The privatization of government services tends to bring about a more
   rapid adoption of innovative policies due to the competitive pressures
   of the market. In federal systems, however, the diffusion of innovations
   across subnational governments may offset such benefits of
   privatization. In this study, we test whether county governments that
   have privatized their provision of foster care services are more or less
   likely to adopt policy innovations and more or less likely to learn from
   the policies of other counties than are those that have resisted
   privatization. We explore the diffusion of four innovative foster care
   policies across 384 counties in five states between 1995 and 2006. We
   find that the initial innovativeness arising from the market competition
   of privatization is counterbalanced by learning across public diffusion
   networks.},

Abstract = {Given the interminable debates over the consistency and significance of
   Marxian value theory, we, the editors of Rethinking Marxism, raised the
   question: What is at stake in these debates? The contributors concur
   that these debates are about Marx's/ Marxian articulation(s) of (class)
   exploitation, an understanding of capital, and a critique and
   adjudication of capitalism. In addition, Marxian value theory allows one
   to rethink economic categories and to analyze the reproduction, limits,
   and historical transformations of capital. Focusing on Marx's
   discussions of commodity fetishism and ``the trinity formula,'' I, too,
   suggest that these debates are about the relevance, coherence, and
   validity of Marx's understanding of capital ``as a pumper-out of surplus
   labor.'' With the unique class perspective he elaborates, Marx not only
   ``renders visible'' the exploitative capitalist class relations in their
   historical specificity{*} thus suggesting the possibility of a
   noncapitalist, nonexploitative economy-but also provides a critique of
   and an alternative to mainstream economic analyses.},

Abstract = {From direct observation and hemerography sources, this article
   reconstructs the mobilizations that took place in Mexico city on June 8,
   16 and 30 of 2006, in protestation of the results of the previous
   electoral day. An important challenge was set out for the institutions
   behind the slogan ``Vote by vote... box by box{''} and a basic right to
   democracy was demanded, even in its more limited version: the certainty
   that what was individually expressed on the ballot boxes, would be
   counted according to reliable and dependable criteria and procedures.
   These mobilizations represented an unknown experience in the Mexican
   context. In contrast to previous actions against electoral fraud, one of
   the driving forces on this particular protest was the certainty that,
   from society, people could and should intervene. From such perspective,
   and regardless of the sympathies or dislikes that it might create, they
   constitute a milestone for social, political and contemporary history in
   Mexico. Hence, to recover and to systematize its central characteristics
   is of great importance},

Abstract = {In today's fragmented media environment, citizens have an enhanced
   ability to select information outlets that match their preexisting
   political beliefs and avoid information sources that clash. This modern
   version of ``selective exposure{''} means that citizens can more easily
   isolate themselves from perspectives unlike their own. In this article,
   we employed a quasi-experimental design to test (1) the extent to which
   subjects selectively exposed themselves to opinion articles that were
   congenial to their presumed predispositions about Sarah Palin and (2)
   whether selective exposure reinforced these predispositions, thereby
   magnifying differences between Republicans and Democrats. We found that
   subjects did indeed tend to engage in selective exposure. And among
   those who did, there was evidence of reinforcement. Interestingly, there
   was evidence of persuasion among the relatively few subjects who exposed
   themselves to sources that ran counter to their predispositions.},

Abstract = {We offer a model of colleague valuation to illuminate the coordination
   challenges women legislators face. Our model predicts that women
   members' strategies depend upon whether they value women colleagues as
   much as men do, or instead value fellow women colleagues more highly. We
   test these predictions by analyzing leadership PAC campaign
   contributions U. S. Senators made to incumbent and challenger women
   during the 105(th)-108(th) Congresses. We find that women Senators value
   fellow incumbent women colleagues less highly than do men Senators,
   whereas they value women challengers more highly than do men. Attaining
   a critical mass of women in legislatures is thus not sufficient for
   creating a successful working environment, but instead creates a
   coordination problem that supplants the previous token minority problem.},

Abstract = {Recent empirical work has brought a renewed attention to the effect
   congressional rules of procedure have on the size of winning coalitions.
   Specifically, scholars have posited that legislative success hinges on
   the support of legislators identified by institutionally defined
   decision rules. Under these theories, supermajority decision rules in
   the U.S. Senate lead to larger, more inclusive coalitions on final
   passage. In this article, I reevaluate these claims by controlling for
   changes in the legislative agenda and the roll-call voting record. I
   find that the aggregate size of winning coalitions is highly responsive
   to the underlying legislative agenda, the size of the Senate's majority
   party, and the manner in which researchers treat unrecorded votes.
   Further, my findings suggest that any connection between changes in the
   Senate's voting rules and the size of winning coalitions is spurious.},

Abstract = {Scholars offer differing accounts of the roles played by political
   elites, on the one hand, and ordinary citizens, on the other, in the
   highly polarized partisan conflict of contemporary American politics.
   Some take polarized elite conflict to indicate, in itself, that elected
   policymakers have escaped the constraints of democratic control and act
   essentially independently. In sharp contrast to this view, I outline a
   case for the importance of what I call polarized populism-a condition of
   politics in which elected officials accord very substantial deference to
   ordinary citizens, especially those who hold relatively extreme
   ideological views. I clarify the differences between elite centered and
   populist accounts of polarized policymaking, and then develop the
   argument for polarized populism, presenting theoretical considerations
   in support and assessing several kinds of relevant evidence. I also
   reply to some claims by Lawrence Jacobs and Robert Shapiro, proponents
   of the elite-centered view, in an earlier exchange in the Forum. In
   concluding, I comment briefly about some directions for research to
   assess the case for polarized populism and discuss some broader
   implications of this pattern of policymaking.},

Abstract = {A considerable body of work explores the relationship between the
   economy and governmental popularity. These `popularity functions'
   exhibit a good deal of instability in the economics coefficient, leading
   some to question its very existence. It is argued in this article that
   this instability is apparent, rather than inherent. Improvements in
   model specification, measurement, sample size and estimation reveal a
   strong and stable economic effect. In particular, fixed and random
   effects models on pooled time-series (from France, Germany, Italy,
   Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States) are estimated here. The
   impact of national economic perception on popularity emerges as
   statistically and substantively significant, across this sample of
   countries.},

Abstract = {While it may be tempting to dismiss the broad humor and downright
   inaccuracies of politically oriented YouTube videos such as Brad Neely's
   animated short on George Washington, this article argues it would be a
   mistake. The campy exaggerations and absurd claims contained therein may
   offer new sources of populist resistance to dominant understandings of
   masculinity as played out in the relation between the founding fathers
   and contemporary constitutional politics. This article explores two
   parodies of masculinity and paternity, suggesting ways in which YouTube
   may be used to integrate or converge scholarly and popular
   understandings into a new discourse, called Constitutionalism 2.0.},

Abstract = {The global economic crisis and its effects have changed the context for
   public sector unions in Canada. There is evidence that an intensified
   offensive against public sector unions is beginning. Few public sector
   unions are prepared to respond adequately to such an offensive, as the
   important 2009 strike by Toronto municipal workers illustrates. In this
   more difficult context, change within public sector unions is
   increasingly urgent. The most promising direction for union renewal lies
   in the praxis of social movement unionism. However, there are very few
   signs of moves to promote this approach within Canadian public sector
   unions.},

Title = {The legacy of lethargy: How elections to the European Parliament depress
   turnout},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {30},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {67-76},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Why has turnout in European Parliament (EP) elections remained so low,
   despite attempts to expand the Parliament's powers? One possible answer
   is that because little is at stake in these second-order elections only
   those with an established habit of voting, acquired in previous national
   elections, can be counted on to vote. Others argue that low turnout is
   an indication of apathy or even scepticism towards Europe. This article
   conducts a critical test of the ``little at stake{''} hypothesis by
   focusing on a testable implication: that turnout at these elections will
   be particularly low on the part of voters not yet socialized into
   habitual voting. This proposition is examined using both time-series
   cross-section analyses and a regression discontinuity design. Our
   findings show that EP elections depress turnout as they inculcate habits
   of non-voting, with long-term implications for political participation
   in EU member states. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   forces can be legitimately used to maintain law and order. There are

   Comitatus Act, which prohibits the use of such forces ``to enforce the
   laws'' unless such use is specifically authorized by the Constitution or
   Act of Congress. However, there is no law which allows state governors
   to dispatch militias to Washington, DC in order to maintain law and

Abstract = {This paper examines democratic development in Nigeria between 1960 and
   1999. It discusses various democracies and some of the shortcomings
   inherent in their implementations. This work adopts a qualitative
   approach using both content and historical analysis to analyze secondary
   sources gathered on both civilian and military regimes as they affected
   democratic performances in Nigeria. This paper aims at helping policy
   makers in carrying out policies that will help strengthen the electoral
   bodies/conducts, respect the rule of law/constitution, ensure good
   governance which will improve leadership qualities and cement democratic
   values in the nation hence evidence from findings indicate that
   democracy have failed to triumph in Nigeria due to reasons emanating
   from bad governance and lack of democratic values. The paper provides
   some plausible recommendations that will be of particular benefit to
   policy makers and to general interest of Nigeria if properly
   implemented.},

Abstract = {Missing from recent presidential agenda-setting scholarship is an
   examination of the president's impact on the agenda for war. To fill
   this gap, I conduct case studies of William McKinley's and George W.
   Bush's rhetoric before the Spanish-American and Iraq wars, respectively.
   Specifically, these presidents' agendas are examined through the lens of
   Jeffrey Tulis's rhetorical presidency model. While McKinley struggled
   against limitations on presidential rhetoric to avert war with Spain,
   Bush succeeded largely because he was free from such limitations. This
   study suggests the utility of Tulis's model, particularly his
   classification system for uses of the bully pulpit and its affect on
   deliberation, as well as his attention to whether the president should
   be a central and powerful actor in public deliberation and our
   constitutional system. The present study yields important conclusions
   about the strong-and potentially harmful-influence that modern
   presidents have in setting the agenda for war.},

Abstract = {The end of the Soviet Union was accompanied by the collapse of the
   centrally planned economy. This set off a massive migration of people,
   especially from the peripheral regions of Russia. Since 1991, the far
   north has lost almost a fifth of its population. Some 59 percent has
   left the Magadan region; almost three-fourths of the inhabitants have
   left the Chukotka Autonomous Okrug. This has grave consequences for the
   socio-economic situation of those who remain and for infrastructure,
   settlement, and the job market.},

Abstract = {Identifying policy status quo locations is a precondition for testing
   key predictions of many spatial models of legislative politics, but such
   measures have proved to be extremely difficult to construct. This study
   applies a novel technique that measures policy locations in relation to
   legislators' preferences. The resulting status quo estimates allow for a
   direct test of the policy consequences predicted by pivotal politics and
   party cartel theories of legislative politics. The empirical tests
   indicate that parties interact with pivotal politics to contribute to
   policy gridlock and shape policy change. By bringing pressure to bear on
   pivotal politics ``pivots{''} and by blocking policy changes that would
   ``roll{''} the party, parties increase the range of policies subject to
   gridlock in the American political system.},

Abstract = {After three decades of the `victory' of the Islamic Revolution in Iran
   it is worthwhile to study how Imam Khumayni's initial theory of wilayat
   al-faqih has developed in the political thought of Hizbullah as regards
   to the framework of molding and interpreting the original theory to make
   it adaptable to the Lebanese social and political conditions. Hizbullah
   employed wilayat al-faqih as a cornerstone in its religious-political
   ideology from 1978 to the present. The party managed to mold the
   doctrine through the successive changes in the political system by
   shifting its ideology in order to become a key player capable of
   affecting the dynamic changes taking place in the Lebanese public
   sphere. Although it is assumed in many circles that Hizbullah is the
   proxy of Syria and Iran, concentrating on the assumed Iranian influence,
   this chapter argues that Hizbullah pursued an independent course of
   action in its attempt to influence the Lebanese political system.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the clandestine connections, in what we call the
   gray zone of politics, between official political actors and unofficial
   political actors who are entrusted with the more unseemly ``dirty
   work{''} of politics in contemporary Argentina, such as inciting
   episodes of collective violence, ``paying off{''} youths with drugs and
   alcohol for their work of attending political rallies, and making
   physical threats against opposition parties and candidates. After a
   brief review of existing literature on the relationship between
   clandestine political connections and collective violence, this paper
   uses an ethnographic reanalysis of existing data to construct three
   detailed accounts that highlight the role the gray zone plays in
   contemporary Argentinean politics. We argue that the laundering of
   political acts through these clandestine channels constitutes a crucial
   dimension of politics that must be empirically dissected and theorized
   to better understand routine political activity writ large before
   concluding with a brief consideration of the analytical and
   methodological implications of such a framework.},

Title = {What do the Brands ``Mark Out{''}: a Socio-Historical Approach to
   Consumption of Brands},
Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {48},
Number = {1},
Pages = {95-116},
Abstract = {From an historic, sociologic and motivational perspective, we analyse
   the role of brands and theirs consumes in the frame of the XX century in
   Spanish kingdom. Following a concrete periodization of the stages
   established by each consume model, we observe as brands ``marking{''}
   objects, individuals and groups in different ways depending of historic
   and social context. Far of economicist model (which characterise the
   consumer only as rational and maximized), this work registers, in its
   different analytical stages, the brands consume as way and strategy of a
   symbolic fight in order to integration and/or social differentiation of
   groups and individuals, which are overdeterminants in the motivational
   processes. But conceiving the consume of brands as strategy for the
   reconstruction of ``social link{''}, as well show as the capitalism
   transform the constitution of social life into pure merchandise. Indeed,
   the ``relational{''} brands consume, a special feature of the current
   consume model, is an expression of a concrete way of companies power
   domination, in the field of private consume. This concrete form of
   domination generates particularised communities, that cannot constitute
   new channels of social and collective integration and should be approach
   as the fragmentation process that characterise the current societies.},

Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},

Volume = {18},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {462-489},
Abstract = {Recent research has questioned the notion that ethnicity is the main
   determinant of party preference in sub-Saharan Africa. Drawing on data
   from representative survey polls in eight anglophone and francophone
   sub-Saharan countries, multinomial and binary logit regressions confirm
   that ethnicity counts but does not explain party preference as a whole.
   More importantly we find that the relevance of ethnicity varies
   substantially from country to country. Looking at possible effects,
   there is little evidence that `ethnicized' party systems harm democracy;
   discussing possible structural, institutional and historical
   determinants of the role of ethnicity in party politics, tentative
   results suggest that specific integrative cultural features, low ethnic
   polarization, one-party dominance and a historical non-mobilization of
   ethnicity might thwart the politicization of ethnicity. Future research
   should focus on the interaction of several factors and how processes of
   ethnic mobilization evolve historically.},

Abstract = {When politicians employ public servants, have those people peculiar
   attitudes toward politics and policies? This paper assesses this topic
   through trajectories and working practices of senior civil servants in
   French local governments. A mix of political sociology and of sociology
   of work, it focuses on generational patterns of political attitudes and
   thereby renews the thesis of ``politicized{''} public managers. It
   demonstrates that new patterns in careers increasing diploma
   requirements, fewer social mobility, increasing geographical mobility
   and decreasing steady employment contracts - result in less personalized
   relations toward politicians, although political screening remains
   strong.},

   I argue that the availability, accessibility, and attractiveness of
   offices provide the most important clues for career-planning. The
   article develops a conceptual framework for the analysis of political
   careers in multi-level systems. Political careers are seen as being
   shaped by the interplay of individual ambition and the institutional
   structure of opportunities. Under the conditions of political
   professionalism, career decisions are made comparing the costs and
   benefits of attaining the various offices given in a certain polity. I
   argue that the availability, accessibility, and attractiveness of
   offices provide the most important clues for career-planning. These in
   turn are shaped by the institutional structure. Within multi-level
   systems, the article finds that the relationship between offices on
   different territorial levels may be organized in one of three ways:
   there may be a clear hierarchy, there may be separate alternative arenas
   largely sealed off against each other, or there may be one large
   integrated playing-field. Finally, the article discusses the
   repercussions career patterns may have for the political system in which
   they occur by linking certain political institutions but not others.},

   the Post-Soviet countries (excluding Baltic states) according to such
   criteria as the degree of institutionalization of presidency, the degree
   of political regime consolidation, the level of democratization and the
   level of statehood. The methodological basis of the work is new
   institutionalism that interprets institutions as both formal and
   informal ``rules of game{''} that are created by rational individuals in
   order to facilitate interaction with each other. The research methods
   home in on indexes of statehood and institutional bases of democracy
   elaborated by the authors of the project ``Political Atlas of
   Modernity{''} as well as ``Freedom House{''} indexes of democratization
   and author's version of the index of institutionalization of presidency.},

Abstract = {Over the past decade, there has been a surge of ``new Left{''}
   governments in Latin America, yet polling data shows no comparable shift
   to the left among the general Latin American population. If electorates
   have not followed their political leaders to the left, then it is likely
   that new right-wing political actors will emerge to compensate for the
   leftward shift in Latin American politics. I propose a research agenda
   for studying right-wing politics in light of the current wave of
   left-leaning governments in the region. I argue that we should focus on
   four main areas of right-wing politics: the political agenda of
   right-wing groups; their political organization; their power capability;
   and the institutional environment in which they operate. This agenda
   requires that we move beyond the traditional focus on right-wing
   political parties and focus on right-wing organizations at all levels of
   formal politics, as well as groups that operate outside the formal
   political arena.},

Abstract = {This paper introduces the special collection on East Asia and the global

   draws out the main themes that run through the individual contributions.
   These are the extent to which the region is decoupling from the global
   economy (or the West), the increasing legitimacy of statist alternatives
   to neoliberal development strategies, and the impact of crises on the
   definition of `region' and the functioning of regional institutions and
   governance mechanisms.},

Title = {Inclusion and Participation: Working with the Tensions},
Journal = {STUDIES IN SOCIAL JUSTICE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {5},
Number = {2},
Pages = {183-196},
Abstract = {Democracy is crucially about inclusion: a theory of democracy must
   account for who is to be included in the democratic process, how, and on
   what terms. Inclusion, if conceived democratically, is fraught with
   tensions. This article identifies three such tensions, arising
   respectively in: (i) the inauguration of the democratic public; (ii)
   enabling equal participation; and (iii) the relationship between
   instrumental and non-instrumental accounts of democracy's value. In each
   case, I argue, rather than seeking somehow to dissolve or avoid such
   tensions, theories of democracy should allow us to live with their
   implications reflexively: to work with them. Such tensions are
   counter-democratic to the extent that they derail what Nancy Fraser
   calls ``participatory parity,{''} under which citizens count as ``full
   partners in social interaction.{''} But the extent to which they do this
   is not itself dependent on points of paradox in the very idea of
   inclusion. Such parity relies on complex factors, social and economic,
   which democratic institutions and procedures will not by themselves
   address. To achieve full democratic inclusion we must already have
   addressed such factors; no account of democracy itself, however
   finely-tuned, will do this.},

Abstract = {Although scholars increasingly acknowledge a contemporaneous
   relationship between public opinion and Supreme Court decisions, debate
   continues as to why this relationship exists. Does public opinion
   directly influence decisions or do justices simply respond to the same
   social forces that simultaneously shape the public mood? To answer this
   question, we first develop a strategy to control for the justices'
   attitudinal change that stems from the social forces that influence
   public opinion. We then propose a theoretical argument that predicts
   strategic justices should be mindful of public opinion even in cases
   when the public is unlikely to be aware of the Court's activities. The
   results suggest that the influence of public opinion on Supreme Court
   decisions is real, substantively important, and most pronounced in
   nonsalient cases.},

Abstract = {This paper reviews the articles by Pan and by Zhu on the China Model.
   The review of Pan is critical, that of Zhu sympathetic. Pan is
   criticized for taking an unquestioning attitude towards state supporting
   ideologies and failing to adequately account for the effects of changes
   in family structure and class structure in China over the past 50 years.
   The reviewer broadly agrees with Zhu's comments about a future steady
   state economy. The article provides statistical data from the recent
   economic and demographic histories of China and Japan to back up the
   general conclusions drawn by Zhu.},

Title = {Estonia after the 2007 Cyber Attacks: Legal, Strategic and
   Organisational Changes in Cyber Security},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CYBER WARFARE AND TERRORISM},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {1},
Number = {1},
Pages = {24-34},
Month = {JAN-MAR},
Abstract = {At the time of the state-wide cyber attacks in 2007, Estonia was one of
   the most developed nations in Europe regarding the ubiquitous use of
   information and communication technology (ICT) in all aspects of
   society. Relaying on the Internet for conducting a range of business
   transactions is common practice. But naturally, the more a society
   depends on ICT, the more it becomes vulnerable to cyber attacks. Unlike
   other research on the Estonian incident, this paper does not focus on
   the analysis of the events themselves. Instead, the authors examine
   Estonia's cyber security policy and subsequent changes made in response
   to the cyber attacks. As such, the authors provide a comprehensive
   overview of the strategic, legal, and organisational changes based on
   lessons learned by Estonia after the 2007 cyber attacks. The analysis is
   based on a review of national security governing strategies, changes in
   the Estonia's legal framework, and organisations with direct impact on
   cyber security. The paper discusses six important lessons learned and
   manifested in actual changes: each followed by a set of cyber security
   policy recommendations appealing to national security analysts as well
   as nation states developing their own cyber security strategy.},

Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {319-333},
Abstract = {This paper examines the dynamic, moving relationship between three
   concepts - those of life, law, and exception. Following a brief
   exposition of these concepts, this paper provides an ethnography of
   struggles over housing waged by the urban poor in a squatter colony in
   Noida that adjoins the city of Delhi, India. I argue that each concept
   in this triad exerts force on the other and is the dynamic relation that
   creates the conditions of possibility for the emergence of claims over
   citizenship for the urban poor. In suggesting that citizenship is a
   claim rather than a status, which one either has or does not have, the
   article shows the precariousness as well as the promise for the poor of
   `belonging' to a polity. Joining the discussion on the politics of life,
   the paper argues that the notion of life allows the mutual absorption of
   the natural and the social, and thus illuminates aspects of citizenship
   forged through the struggles waged by the poor for their needs. These
   are aspects of citizenship which remain obscure if we reduce democratic
   citizenship to the domain of rational deliberative processes alone.},

Journal = {REVISTA ESTUDOS POLITICOS},
Year = {2011},
Number = {2},
Pages = {29-44},
Abstract = {This article aims to demonstrate how political competition at the
   municipal level was affected by the federative arrangement put into
   place after the 1988 Constitution and by the introduction of the
   multi-party system. The compared analysis of more than 400
   municipalities detected important changes in the process of electoral
   and party competition in municipal disputes. These changes significantly
   modified patterns described by the literature on local power structures.
   The central hypothesis in this literature held that the cause of
   ``oligarchization{''} of local party subsystems was the concentration of
   resources and decisions at the Federal Executive level. The modification
   of rules with the intent of decentralizing attributions and function
   provoked a realignment within electoral and political disputes in
   contexts considered oligarchic.},

Abstract = {Xenophobia is the main foundation of the legal barriers which were set
   up between the late nineteenth century and the 1930s to deter foreigners
   from practicing medicine in France. Should we therefore consider that
   this xenophobia embedded in the law is the main explaining factor of the
   confinement of doctors coming from the former French colonies and
   protectorates in low status jobs within the medical field, and of the
   public decisions which were taken about them before regularization
   measures in the late 1990s? Using sociological and historical materials,
   this paper provides some answers to this question by analyzing the
   evolution of the situation of ``foreign doctors{''} and of the debates
   and measures about this issue between post-war years and the mid-2000s.},

Abstract = {This article aims to review the relationships between religion and
   national identity as revealed through some 23 articles in National
   Identities published over the last 10 years. In addition I will also try
   to lay out a broad perspective on religion and nation from which to
   develop this review. Specifically the message is that religion has not
   gone away and in many ways is just as prevalent today in influencing
   national identity as in the past, despite the popularity of the
   secularization thesis, although religion's overt presence, role and form
   may have changed. In addition I will also argue that whilst the
   published articles represent a confirmation of the continued importance
   of religion they also display a greater need for an understanding of
   religion and its importance in human affairs.},

Abstract = {For many of Russia's poorest people, and especially for the officially
   recognized `indigenous small-numbered peoples', neoliberal reforms
   following the collapse of the Soviet Union represented a major
   retrenchment in `social citizenship' as defined by T. H. Marshall.
   However, some reforms also promised increased civil, political and
   cultural citizenship rights, which Russia's indigenous peoples have
   sought to realize through new legislation and appeals to international
   agreements regarding the rights of indigenous peoples. But with Russia's
   current economic and political course geared towards maximizing revenues
   from the extraction and sale of natural resources, Russia's indigenous
   peoples have been frustrated in their efforts to realize these
   citizenship rights, particularly in their attempts to assert rights to
   land and resources through legal means. This paper draws on case studies
   from southern Siberia to discuss first how Russia's identity politics
   and an international focus on indigenous peoples have combined to create
   indigenous subjects in the Russian Federation, and second how the
   anticipated transition from indigenous subjects to indigenous citizens
   has for the most part failed to materialize.},

Abstract = {This study estimates an individual-level model of turnout and vote
   choice in United States presidential elections. Extending a methodology
   proposed by Bartels (1996), the model allows one to assess whether the
   electoral choices of citizens would change if they were more
   knowledgeable about politics, and if such changes have implications for
   aggregate election results. Simulations of hypothetical electorates
   under different assumptions about the distribution of political
   knowledge show that while some citizens would change their votes if more
   knowledgeable, the primary effects of increasing voter knowledge is to
   raise turnout levels and to solidify preexisting vote tendencies. The
   few vote changes that result from increased political knowledge largely
   average out in aggregation. Increased turnout resulting from a more
   informed electorate, however, favors Democratic candidates in two of the
   four studied elections.},

Title = {Do Immigrant Integration Policies Matter? A Three-Country Comparison
   among Turkish Immigrants},
Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {34},
Number = {2},
Pages = {208-234},
Abstract = {Various theoretical perspectives make strong, but often contradictory,
   claims about effects of immigrant integration policies on immigrants'
   retention of their ethnic cultures and their adoption of the host
   country's culture. However, there is very little empirical research
   investigating these competing claims. This article addresses this gap by
   investigating the merits of four prominent theoretical perspectives,
   which emphasise respectively the material costs and benefits of
   retention and adoption, acculturative stress, the permeability of ethnic
   boundaries, and reactive ethnicity. It uses original survey data on
   Turkish immigrants in Germany, France, and the Netherlands, countries
   with different integration regimes, and investigates identification,
   language proficiency and use, religious observance and interethnic
   social contacts. The results indicate that policies have only a modest
   effect on immigrants' degree of adoption and retention. The findings
   clearly contradict the reactive ethnicity and acculturative stress
   hypotheses, and provide support for a combination of the material
   cost/benefit and boundary permeability perspectives.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates whether in 2010 ethnic minorities continued to
   give overwhelming support to Labour or whether the Conservatives made
   inroads, especially among the more middle-class or entrepreneurial
   sections of the ethnic minority electorate. Does ethnicity over-ride
   other social cleavages such as the class cleavage? Or does religion,
   especially Islam, now represent a cross-cutting cleavage alongside
   ethnicity? Using a major new survey, the 2010 Ethnic Minority British
   Election Study (EMBES), substantial variation was found between ethnic
   minorities in their level of support for Labour, although overall
   minority support for Labour remains double that of White British voters.
   In general the Conservatives have failed to make greater inroads than
   would be expected on the basis of uniform swing. Ethnicity does not in
   general `trump' social class, although there are other ways in which the
   predictors of ethnic minority turnout and party choice differ from those
   of the majority group. Overall considerable heterogeneity is found in
   patterns of ethnic minority electoral behaviour and in the predictors of
   that behaviour.},

Abstract = {Traditional international relations theory holds that states will join
   only those international institutions with which they generally intend
   to comply. Here we show when this claim might not hold. We construct a
   model of an authoritarian government's decision to sign the UN
   Convention Against Torture ( CAT). Authoritarian governments use the
   signing of this treaty - followed by the willful violation of its
   provisions - as a costly signal to domestic opposition groups of their
   willingness to employ repressive tactics to remain in power. In
   equilibrium, authoritarian governments that torture heavily are more
   likely to sign the treaty than those that torture less. We further
   predict that signatory regimes survive longer in office than
   non-signatories, and enjoy less domestic opposition - and we provide
   empirical support for these predictions.},

Abstract = {The number of regional organizations and regional trade agreements has
   risen sharply since the 1990s. In its wake, comparative research on
   regionalism has seen a revival. An important strand of this literature
   asks about the drivers of these developments, but has to date largely
   neglected a puzzling phenomenon: the similarities between regional
   organizations in their institutional design and the chosen methods of
   integration. Existing perspectives analyze different cases of
   regionalism primarily as phenomena that develop independently of each
   other, and whose genesis and design are determined either endog-enously
   by domestic regional dynamics or exogenously by powerful hegemons.
   Against this background, this article argues for an extension of
   existing analytical perspectives and sketches a diffusion-oriented
   research agenda that conceives of regional organizations as
   interdependent phenomena.},

Abstract = {The article compares the current debate on democratization of the
   processes of global governance with controversies in context of the
   American Revolution. The comparison of these two discussions shows three
   analogies. Firstly, a reconfiguration of the basic democratic
   institutions and practices occurs in both debates, notably in the change
   from a radical into a representative respectively from a representative
   into a deliberative understanding of democracy. Secondly, in both cases
   the reconfiguration is attended by a semantic transformation of the
   concept of democracy. Furthermore, in each case the transfer of
   democracy to a new political order is attended by a weakening of the
   mechanisms of popular control.},

Abstract = {Applying notions of citizenship to consumers and corporations links up
   economic and political arenas and brings about tensions with regard to
   traditional concepts of (national) citizenship. This contribution aims
   at scrutinizing these reconfigurations from a political science point of
   view and examines both analytical potentials and conceptual limits. In
   doing so, consumer citizenship and corporate citizenship are `located'
   alongside political interdependencies of transnational production
   cycles. Moreover, the article focuses on the reciprocity of the
   political roles of consumers and corporations: To what extend does the
   interaction of consumers and corporations shape transnational political
   markets?},

Title = {Coalition Formation and the German Party System},
Journal = {GERMAN POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Pages = {146-163},
Abstract = {The article uses a thick synthetic analytical framework, derived from
   the established coalition literature to examine the process of coalition
   formation in the context of the German party system at the time of the
   2009 federal election. It argues that increasing party system
   fragmentation and fluidity are long-term effects of the critical changes
   that took place between 1983 and the mid-1990s. These changes have
   shifted coalition power away from the smaller parties, and in particular
   the FDP, and towards the two Volksparteien. In terms of the coalition
   game, the article argues that outcomes cannot be explained by pure
   office-seeking but that these motives do become important once the
   desire to avoid unnecessary co-ordination costs, achieve ideological
   adjacency and reduce ideological range to a minimum has been satisfied.
   The article concludes by asserting that, rather than being a
   re-constitution of the default coalition model in Germany, the logic of
   the 2009 Black-Yellow coalition is consistent with more recent coalition
   games and therefore is a reflection of change rather than continuity.},

Journal = {POLITIX},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {24},

Abstract = {According to a peculiar model of social justification, in which
   principles matter above all, no representation of the social world could
   find any public legitimacy as long as it relies upon intrinsic
   inequalities. However, through the empirical study of a case of public
   legitimation of an inegalitarian public action the legitimation of the
   ``intellectual precocity{''} (giftedness) of children in France one can
   prove that a strictly inegalitarian categorization can reach a high
   degree of public legitimacy, including the State legitimacy. Besides,
   such a legitimacy depends not only on semantic reformulations, but
   mainly on social activities that favour a logic of symbolic imposition.
   In fact, this logic is socially efficient thanks to the mobilization of
   certain activists (the more ressources they have, the more decisive they
   are). Autonomous structural and institutional evolutions play also a
   role, as they increase or decrease the probability for the action of the
   activists to be considered publicly as relevant.},

Abstract = {Partisan voters who change their voting choice on election day account
   for a small proportion of the electorate, but play a decisive role in a
   close election. Paul Beck's (2002) social-support theory of partisan
   defection states that a voter who perceives support for a candidate of
   the opposite party from his or her communication network is likely to
   defect. This study examines Beck's theory in the context of data
   collected in Taiwan after the 2004 presidential election. This election
   was marked by competition between two camps, making it the first
   campaign in Taiwan's history that resembled a two-party system. Besides
   providing an empirical test of the theory, this article shows that
   Pan-Green Camp supporters are more volatile than Pan-Blue Camp
   supporters, and it identifies the major factors associated with this
   pattern.},

Abstract = {It is the phenomenon of dominant party in transitional societies that is
   considered in the article: the dominant parties' common features, their
   main types and their functions in a given political system. In such
   comparativistic context, the author presents specific characteristics of
   the dominant parties in the post-Soviet states (he distinguishes them as
   a specific type, suggesting to raise the journalistic cliche ``party of
   power{''} into the status of a political-science term, in order to bring
   it out). Further on, the author retraces in detail the evolution, the
   programmatico-political positioning and the functions of the ``United
   Russia{''} party and comes to the conclusion that the tasks of Russia's
   modernization demand qualitative renewal of this party.},

Journal = {POLITICA Y GOBIERNO},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {18},
Number = {2},
Pages = {231-264},
Abstract = {The objective of this article was to analyze the influence that
   political contexts and political careers exert on the behavior of
   legislators, through the use of the Elites Parlamentarias
   Latinoamericanas (PELA) database of the Universidad de Salamanca, which
   centers on three Central American countries: Costa Rica, El Salvador and
   Honduras. Relying on a theoretical division between retrospective and
   prospective loyalties, the results suggest that the behavior of
   lawmakers is influenced by their future job prospects. This influence
   becomes clear when the aspect being evaluated is exclusive, namely, when
   it does not allow legislators to cultivate loyalties that would secure
   their professional future without damaging their retrospective
   loyalties. When political parties control the continuity of political
   careers, the percentage of lawmakers who place the interests of their
   districts above the interests of their party is greater among those not
   seeking to continue their political careers than among those who wish to
   remain in politics.},

Abstract = {This article presents some of the findings of research on issues
   surrounding teaching terrorism and political violence at UK higher
   education institutions. It reports the results of a survey of UK
   institutions of higher education on their responses to government and
   other pressures in relation to terrorism. The data show a minority of
   universities have developed systems, policies or procedures for
   `preventing violent extremism', while a significant number have
   developed close cooperation and collaboration with state
   counterterrorism policies raising potential issues of academic freedom.
   This article then examines three high-profile cases - incidents where
   universities, lecturers and students have come under political and legal
   pressures over the content of terrorism courses or accusations of
   `radicalisation' on campus. It suggests that these pressures can be and
   sometimes are resisted, but that they have on occasion effectively
   narrowed the scope of academic freedom in practise with the danger that
   a further chilling effect follows in their wake.},

Abstract = {The article introduces into the Russian discourse the key elements of
   securitization theory. one of the ways of conceptualizing security which
   is most popular in contemporary literature on political and
   international theory. Using as the starting point the understanding of
   security by the theorists of securitization as a discursive political
   practice, this study analyses some consequences of this approach for our
   understanding of political issues. First and foremost. the article
   focuses on the contradictions between security and democratic politics,
   on the one hand, and security and politicization, on the other hand.},

Journal = {CIVIL WARS},

Pages = {259-279},
Abstract = {This article argues that both socio-economic disadvantage and political
   factors, such as foreign policy of the West about the Muslim world,
   along with historical grievances, play a part in the development of
   Islamic radicalized collective action in Western Europe. We emphasize
   the role of group identity-based individual behaviour in organizing
   collective action within radicalized Muslim groups. Inasmuch as culture
   plays any role at all in radicalization, it is because individuals feel
   the imperative to act on the basis of their Muslim identity, something
   to which different individuals will attach varying degrees of salience,
   depending on how they place their Muslim identity-based actions in the
   scheme of their multiple identities. We also emphasize the role of the
   opportunistic politician, from the majority European community, in
   fomenting hatred for Muslims, which also produces a backlash from
   radicalized political Islam. We present comparative evidence of
   socio-economic, political and cultural disadvantage faced by Muslim
   minorities in five West European countries: Germany, the UK, France,
   Spain and the Netherlands.},

Abstract = {This paper examines and criticizes the defence of toleration due to John
   Rawls in Political Liberalism, and similar strategies mobilized in
   defence of toleration. It argues that the notion of the burdens of
   judgement, used by Rawls to defend his doctrine of reasonable pluralism,
   faces incoherence: schematically, either disagreement succumbs to
   reason, or vice versa. On similar grounds, reasonable disagreement
   defences of neutrality fail because of a double-mindedness about the
   relation between private judgements and public reason. This problem
   arises, it is argued, from an attempt to make private judgements
   determinative in the formation of political and legal outcomes, even
   while subjecting the latter's justification to norms of public reason.
   Deference to private judgements in political justification tends to
   countenance sedition, and this applies also to modern liberal attempts
   such as Rawls's to ground toleration in private judgements.},

Year = {2011},
Volume = {5},

Pages = {1-10},
Abstract = {Since its publication in 1971, John Rawls' A Theory of Justice has
   defined the terrain of political philosophical debate concerning the
   principles, scope, and material implications of social justice. Social
   justice for Rawls concerns the principles that govern the operation of
   major social institutions. Major social institutions structure the lives
   of citizens by regulating access to the resources and opportunities that
   the formulation and realization of human projects require. Rawls' theory
   of social justice regards major institutions as just when they
   distribute what he calls ``primary goods{''} in a manner that he regards
   as egalitarian. Hence, the subsequent social justice debate has been
   shaped by and large as a debate about the meaning and implications of
   egalitarianism. While on the surface a debate about egalitarianism as a
   distributional principle seems to uncover the core problem of social
   justice-how much of what everyone should get as a matter of right-the
   entire history of the debate has been conducted in abstraction from what
   matters most to people's lives. It is as a corrective to such
   abstractions that the life-value approach to social justice has been
   developed.
   In this introduction I have three aims. First, I will substantiate the
   claim that the debate over social justice that has dominated political
   philosophy from Rawls until the present is abstracted from what
   ultimately matters. Second, I will provide a concise conceptual history
   of the development of life-value onto-axiology, defining its key terms
   and providing an overview of its importance for social justice. Finally,
   I will provide a brief discussion of the unifying principle of this
   special issue and each of the four papers that make it up.},

   availability of a unique ``compensatory{''} political mechanism

Abstract = {In the recent past, the distinction between inclusive and exclusive
   legal positivism has been touted as the important controversy in the
   field. I argue that a more fundamental distinction lies elsewhere - the
   distinction between positivism qua naturalism and positivism without
   naturalism. In the first camp, positivism qua naturalism, John Austin
   argues that the reduction to fact (habit, fear) is sufficient to explain
   the ostensibly normative material of the law, and if this is so, no
   non-contingent link between the law and morality can be necessary. This
   is to say that H. L. A. Hart's celebrated separation principle, far from
   lying at the very core of legal positivism, is a corollary of the
   fundamental doctrine, naturalism. Hans Kelsen is the proponent of
   positivism without naturalism. While Kelsen of course defends the
   separation principle, his position represents a wholesale rejection of
   naturalism, which, he insists, is wrong-headed. Kelsen believes that he
   can explicate normativity within positivism. He does not offer his
   normativity thesis as an answer to the time-honoured question of how
   obedience to law might be justified. Rather, Kelsen's normativity thesis
   is properly seen as the core of his argument against legal positivism
   qua naturalism.},

Abstract = {In the article, theses are set out to the effect that authorities in
   modern Russia operate in accordance with their short-term interests, and
   that in order to realize such interests, they apply rather informal
   procedures, than norms of Russian legislation. Under such conditions,
   the object of political competition is rather politicians' access to
   this or that set of resources on hand with bodies of state or municipal
   authority, than citizens' support, and therefore political competition
   is determined to a large extent by particularistic norms and rules,
   generated by relations of corruption and patrimonialism.},

Abstract = {Europe is implementing common security systems, but does not seem that
   they are well-functioning and integrated. Beyond of the technical
   difficulties, we believe that problems of poor cooperation between the
   States are present and that a cause of this stems from the concerns
   about migration and its regulation at European level. After reporting on
   the major issues on European security agencies, Europol, SIS and VIS, we
   dwell on the Eurodac system, created for the control of asylum seekers
   arriving in Europe. We argue that some European regulation, like the
   Dublin agreement on asylum seekers, puts improper incentives, dampening
   a cooperative behaviour of the participants to the European Union. We
   argument that this, among other things, derives from rival interests of
   the various States, and that this has negative implications on the
   construction of an European intelligence system.},

Abstract = {To what extent are ethnic minority interest groups able to influence
   U.S. foreign policy? Current case study research has identified several
   factors that may condition the ability of diasporic groups to influence
   foreign policy toward ancestral ``homelands.{''} To this point, existing
   studies have been unable to isolate the impact of campaign contributions
   from other factors that may influence U.S. foreign policy decision
   making. The current study uses a combination of conditional and standard
   logistic regression to examine the impact of Cuban American interest
   group and individual campaign contributions on a series of votes on key
   amendments in the 108th and 109th Congresses. Results from the study
   support the idea that the Cuban diasporic community in the United States
   has had an impact on U.S. foreign policy toward Cuba. However, there are
   significant limits to this influence conditioned in part by issue
   salience.},

Abstract = {This article proposes a new way to measure proportionality using
   aggregated threshold functions. Electoral systems can be summarised by a
   single value that shows the necessary share of the total vote to win
   either one seat or half of the seats in parliament. The article
   calculates aggregate threshold values for 142 different electoral
   systems that were used in 525 democratic elections between 1946 and
   2000. These results are also contrasted with the most commonly used
   indices of proportionality and turn out to be both substantively and
   empirically richer. Aggregated threshold functions provide both students
   and reformers of electoral systems with a measure based purely on
   institutional variables that offers an exhaustive summary of the
   functioning of many electoral systems.},

Abstract = {This critical review of the new political science literature on the
   causes of nuclear weapons proliferation consists of seven parts. The
   first section briefly presents what we know about which states developed
   nuclear weapons and which states started but abandoned weapons
   development programs. I highlight the problems that result from
   uncertainty about the accuracy and completeness of the data. The second
   and third sections review the literature on the spread of the technical
   capability to develop nuclear weapons. We still lack robust knowledge
   about the relationship between the development of civilian nuclear power
   programs and nuclear weapons acquisition. The next two sections review
   the literature on the demand for nuclear weapons. Comparative case
   studies and statistical studies have improved our understanding of the
   diversity of motives for weapons development and restraints, but serious
   gaps in our knowledge remain. The sixth section outlines alternative
   theories about the potential impact of the nuclear Non-Proliferation
   Treaty (NPT) on nuclear weapons programs decisions. Finally, I lay out a
   future research agenda to address the weaknesses in our current
   understanding of the causes of nuclear proliferation.},

Abstract = {As austerity and inflation continue to bite into the defence budget, the
   UK remains committed to two expensive programmes: the Queen
   Elizabeth-class carriers, and the Joint Strike Fighter to fly from them.
   While the authors accept that the rationale for sea-launched air power
   remains sound, remotely piloted capabilities have already matured
   sufficiently, and will continue to evolve by the JSF's in-service date,
   to offer more efficient capability than piloted aircraft. Smaller, more
   numerous carriers might therefore be procured - mitigating the risk of
   loss and increasing the number of ships available to project UK national
   influence.},

Abstract = {Tony Thirlwall is Professor of Applied Economics at the University of
   Kent at Canterbury, United Kingdom, where, after coming from the
   University of Leeds in 1966, he has taught ever since, albeit
   interspersed with spells at the University of Papua New Guinea, West
   Virginia University, Princeton University, Cambridge (England),
   Melbourne and La Trobe universities. In his early career he made
   contributions to regional economics, and the analysis of unemployment
   and inflation, but since the beginning of the 1980s his major research
   field has been international trade, the balance of payments and economic
   development. His major intellectual debts are to John Maynard Keynes and
   to Nicholas Kaldor (whose biography he wrote). His books include
   Regional Growth and Unemployment in the UK (with R. Dixon) (London:
   Macmillan, 1975); Balance of Payments Theory and the UK Experience
   (Basingstoke, Hampshire: Macmillan, 1980); Inflation, Saving and Growth
   in Developing Economies (London: Macmillan, 1974); Economic Growth and
   the Balance of Payments Constraint (with J. McCombie) (Basingstoke,
   Hampshire: Macmillan, 1994); a best-selling textbook Growth and
   Development (Basingstoke, Hampshire: Palgrave Macmillan), now in its
   ninth edition; and, his most recent, Trade Liberalisation and The
   Poverty of Nations (with Penelope Pacheco-Lopez) (Cheltenham,
   Gloustershire: Edward Elgar, 2008). Between 1972 and 1991, he organised
   eleven Keynes Seminars at the University of Kent to commemorate the life
   and work of Keynes (later published by Macmillan), and he is now the
   editor of the Great Thinkers in Economics series published by
   Palgrave-Macmillan. Eleven volumes have appeared so far.},

   Iterations},
Journal = {POLITY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {43},
Number = {1},
Pages = {128-149},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In her recent work, Seyla Benhabib has appropriated Jacques Derrida's
   notion of iterability-or iteration in Benhabib's terminology whereby
   repetition always implies alteration. This gives her a dynamic
   conception of democracy and citizenship that is sensitive to otherwise
   excluded constituencies. Nevertheless, I take issue with the ways in
   which Benhabib limits the effects of iterability She does so by
   separating the transformative effects of iterability from, first, the
   content of universal constitutional principles and, second, the subject
   understood as narrative ability. This gives rise to some theoretical
   difficulties, but it also has practical implications, which I illustrate
   in the context of the debates about the hijab, which Benhabib also
   discusses at length. I argue that Benhabib depoliticizes the universals
   and takes the agency of the subject as given when these should be in
   question. Polity (2011) 43, 128-149. doi:10.1057/pol.2010.18; published

Abstract = {This study analyses results of the 2010 September 26 th elections in the
   State of Zulia, focusing on the case of the United Socialist Party of
   Venezuela (PSUV). Comparative methodology serves as a basis for
   analysis; voting levels achieved by the PSUV in electoral processes for
   1998, 2000, 2005 and 2010 were compared in order to determine the trend
   in their development. Results of the 2010 elections for parliamentary
   seats were also compared using a pure proportional model (the D'hondt
   formula), the German mixed system contained in the Organic Law of
   Suffrage and Participation Policy of 1998 and the system implicit in the
   2009 Organic Law of Electoral Processes. According to the analysis,
   conclusions are that the PSUV, despite having been defeated in the 2010
   elections, shows a trend toward growth for its electoral support in the
   State of Zulia. On the other hand, the electoral formula contained in
   the 2009 Law (regarding the majority), magnified the PSUV electoral
   defeat by reducing it to just three seats in Parliament for Zulia, when
   from the viewpoint of proportionality, it should have obtained seven
   seats.},

Title = {Power Politics and Interstate War in Africa},
Journal = {AFRICAN SECURITY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {4},
Number = {3},
Pages = {195-221},
Abstract = {The steps-to-war theory suggests that power politics strategies, such as
   alliance formation, military buildups, hardliner domestic actors, and
   aggressive crisis bargaining, often have the unintended consequence of
   escalating a crisis to war. The theory has gathered extensive empirical
   support in large-N studies, but only a handful of studies have examined
   the expectations of the theory as applied to specific regions. This
   paper questions if the steps-to-war theory can explain wars in a region
   where one might not expect power politics methods to be in operation. I
   first test the theory statistically by using a sample of only African
   dyads and then employ a structured comparison and process-tracing
   methods to examine the steps taken prior to two African wars, the
   OgadenWar (1977-1978) and the Ugandan-TanzanianWar (1978-1979). This
   research is unable to falsify the theory in the Africa region, although
   the theory does require modifications in that the actions of rebel
   groups are important in motivating territorial demands and arms
   acquisitions in the region.},

Abstract = {From 1860 to 1914, 10 million people left Poland. Circa 3.6 million
   emigrated permanently. Starting in 1880, America became one of the most
   attractive destinations. The emigrants dreamt of social advancement and
   a better life. But reality was different. Lacking education, the Poles
   ended up doing the simplest and hardest jobs in industry and mining. At
   the workplace and in society, emigrants experienced rejection and
   exclusion. They responded by establishing their own lifeworld of
   organisations and associations and constituted their own ethnic group:

Abstract = {Political strategy matters - especially in the case of unpopular
   reforms. This is the main argument of this article. It shows that the
   analysis of political strategies gives complementary insights into the
   causal mechanisms of reform politics. It helps us to understand how
   political actors successfully implement unpopular reforms. The article
   provides empirical evidence for this claim by means of an analysis of
   adjustment efforts in Sweden, Belgium, Canada and France during the
   1990s. It is shown that governments acted strategically in two areas:
   they used strategic manoeuvres in the political sphere in order to
   circumvent veto players. And they employed strategic organisation and
   communication in the public sphere in order to dampen the risk of being
   punished by voters for the implemented policies.},

Abstract = {Somali piracy is a direct threat to maritime security and commerce. It
   is also a theatre of international politics and great power competition.
   Involvement in counter-piracy for some states has been motivated as much
   by political signalling and wider security interests than it has by
   national and alliance commitment to solving the piracy problem.
   Counter-piracy operations have proved to be a useful way for states to
   expand their influence in a strategically significant region.},

Title = {Local economies and national economic evaluations},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {30},
Number = {4},
Pages = {795-803},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Underlying the phenomena of economic voting are voters' perceptions of
   economic conditions. But from where do these evaluations originate? This
   work examines the effects of three types of factors influential to the
   formation of national economic evaluations: predispositions (such as
   age, gender, income, partisanship), information and attentiveness, and
   objective local economic conditions (local unemployment rates). Our
   findings fit with earlier work, broadly confirming the influential role
   each set of factors plays in shaping national economic perceptions. We
   then extend the literature - demonstrating that the impact of the local
   economic environment is conditional on attention to media, political
   information and education. Using a combined dataset of the 2006 Canadian
   Election Studies with neighbourhood level economic indicators drawn from
   Canadian Census data (2006), our findings show that, in developing
   perceptions of the national economy, more attentive, more informed and
   more educated individuals are less influenced by local economic
   conditions than their less attentive, less informed and less educated
   counterparts. These findings contribute to our understanding of how
   local economic conditions influence the formation of national economic
   evaluations. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The day after revolution is never easy. Euphoria fades quickly;
   expectations are prone to quick frustration. Experience shows that
   change is never easy, and it never happens overnight. Instead of
   ``transitions,{''} we should rather speak of ``transformations.{''}
   Political change on the scale we saw in Eastern Europe and we are
   witnessing today in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya involves more than
   transition - it takes in all aspects of a State, its institutions and
   its society. Accordingly, UNESCO crafts the conditions to make
   development and democratic reforms more sustainable. We do not provide
   the hardware for peace but the software to make it meaningful.},

Abstract = {Analyzing dynamic social phenomena is a major challenge for research.
   This article conducts a feasibility test of a social scientific tool we
   developed based on Dunn (2004). We apply this tool to a corpus of
   historical documents on tobacco policy in the city of Bern generated
   between 1659 and 1723. A longitudinal analysis across time periods of
   argument structure and form shows shifts in the perceived problems,
   causes, and policy measures considered with respect to tobacco, as well
   as their legitimation. The implication is that our method is a viable
   approach for studying historical policy arguments.},

Abstract = {In recent years, scholars have marshaled a vast amount of evidence to
   show that the congressional parties are increasingly polarized. However,
   David Mayhew demonstrated that most standard legislative enactments in
   the second half of the twentieth century passed with the support of
   large majorities of both parties. This article investigates whether the
   partisan polarization of the past two decades has crept into the temple
   of consensual lawmaking that hitherto characterized Senate action on
   final passage votes. The findings reveal that unilateral votes by one
   party are better explained by unified government than the rise of
   partisan polarization. In that light, the import of polarization may be
   overstated. Institutional features of the political system, coupled with
   the electoral incentives of lawmakers, offset ideological polarization
   at the final passage stage of important legislation.},

Title = {Testing the ownership society: Ownership and voting in Britain},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {30},
Number = {4},
Pages = {784-794},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Prior work on political effects of personal asset ownership in the
   United Kingdom has found a causal link between home and share ownership
   and conservative political preferences and voting. These estimates
   appear to confirm the ``ownership society{''} thesis tying privatization
   and asset ownership to improved prospects for conservative parties. This
   paper proposes a new identification strategy for testing this causal
   connection that improves on earlier research designs. I exploit temporal
   variability in panel data to better specify the definition of home
   ownership and control for unobserved confounders associated with
   ownership. Under this design, home ownership is found to have no or very
   weak effects on voting in the 1997 and 2001 General Elections. Where
   weakly significant results are found, they suggest a mixed effect on
   partisan outcomes at the ballot box. Finally, while extending this
   strategy to financial assets does support the ``ownership society{''}
   hypothesis, doing so illuminates a very different set of identification
   problems, which point to underlying flaws in the ``ownership society{''}
   argument itself. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to evaluate how democratic and deliberative the
   direct participation of citizens experiencing poverty is in the
   definition and implementation of public policies that affect them. A
   comparison of Belgian and Quebec processes involving persons in
   situation of poverty indicates that the procedural dimensions of
   participation (franchise, quality and accountability) are clearly
   strengthened by institutionalized processes and weakened when processes
   become politicized. However, the authenticity of the process (a
   dimension tied to outcomes) remains largely independent from the nature
   of these processes and depends instead on the mobilization of social
   actors and especially of anti-poverty organizations.},

Abstract = {Accurate expectations about the outcome of elections play a central role
   in psychological and economic theories of voting. In the paper, three
   questions about voters' expectations are investigated. First, we
   identify and test several factors that influence the overall accuracy or
   quality of voters' expectations. Second, the phenomenon of ``wishful
   thinking{''} is tested and confirmed for expectations about the
   electoral performance of individual parties and coalitions. Finally, two
   mechanisms how expectations might influence voting behavior are
   identified and tested. Based on surveys from Austria and Germany, the
   results suggest that voters not only rely on expectations to avoid
   casting ``wasted{''} votes for parties without electoral chances, but
   that they are able to engage in fairly sophisticated strategic coalition
   voting. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In a recent article, Riggs et al. (2009) aim to measure the `Electoral
   College winner's advantage'-in particular, the extent to which the
   winner's electoral vote margin of victory is magnified as a result of
   (i) the `two electoral vote add-on' given to each state and (ii) the
   `winner-take-all' mode of casting state electoral votes. Their results
   are based on two sets of one million simulated two-candidate elections.
   This note has two purposes. The first is to demonstrate that RHR's
   simulation estimates can be calculated precisely using the theory of
   voting power measurement. The second is to correct several flaws in
   RHR's analysis, the most substantial of which pertains to the effect of
   the two electoral vote add-on, which actually has a negative effect on
   the winner's advantage. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Indigenous Capitalisms are rooted in local concepts of wealth,
   accumulation and distribution, but they must operate within current
   global markets. Indigenous Capitalisms reflect Indigenous peoples'
   shifting political relationships to settler colonial states and the
   supranational organizations that drive international policy. As such,
   articulations of Indigenous Capitalisms can be measured as indices of
   self-determination, demonstrating to the world that Indigenous political
   entities engaging in global commerce will likely not simply dissolve
   into a multi-cultural body politic. Future research in this area should
   offer new ways of understanding the ties between economic issues and
   Indigenous lives, challenging existing stereotypes about Indigenous
   peoples' stakes in the global economy contributing to the growing
   discipline of Indigenous Studies.},

Abstract = {This article describes some of the reasons why we love and hate
   democracy since Greek times. To this end, there is an emphasis, on the
   one hand, on the sovereign and violent dimension and the isogonic pathos
   that is necessarily involved within any equal ordering, and on the other
   hand, on the strange link that exists between democracy, justice and
   anarchy. This article also addresses the tensions of the political
   democratic form that holds an indisputable affinity with the arbitrary
   and unfounded nature of social divisions, to wit, the just order of the
   community. Even Plato and Aristotle - who feared the devastating effects
   of democracy as a government of anyone and the denial of supposedly
   natural (that is, without question) and hierarchical division in the
   parts of the community - were unable to give an unquestionable basis for
   this principle of division of the parts that would make possible the
   establishment of a true justice. This article, therefore, deals with
   these matters.},

Year = {2011},
Volume = {9},
Number = {3},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Military bases have always been complicated as a policy area, with the
   demands of national security policy and military strategy often at odds
   with local and state interests and constituent demands upon elected
   officials. Over the course of more than 200 years, the domestic military
   basing structure has changed and adapted, often the result of a
   compendium of factors including shifting military strategies,
   technological advances, differing alliances, and the changing
   demographics and constituent desires within a given area or region. The
   Executive and Legislative branches have both been intimately involved in
   the military base decision-making process, both in determining where to
   establish bases and also in the process to select bases for closure or
   realignment. Over the past thirty years, the issue of base closures has
   become even more acutely political and, ultimately, led to the creation
   of the Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC) as a successful
   method to select bases for closure and realignment while also compelling
   Congress and the President to comply with those decisions.},

Journal = {COMPARATIVE POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {44},
Number = {10},
Pages = {1343-1369},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The autonomous regulatory agency has recently become the ``appropriate
   model{''} of governance across countries and sectors. The dynamics of
   this process are captured in the authors' data set, which covers the
   establishment of agencies in 48 countries and 15 sectors for the period
   1966-2007. Adopting a diffusion approach to explain this broad process
   of institutional change, the authors explore the role of countries and
   sectors as sources of institutional transfer at different stages of the
   diffusion process. They demonstrate how the restructuring of national
   bureaucracies unfolds via four different channels of institutional
   transfer. The results challenge theoretical approaches that
   overemphasize the national dimension in global diffusion and are
   insensitive to the stages of the diffusion process. Further advance in
   study of diffusion depends, the authors assert, on the ability to apply
   both cross-sectoral and cross-national analysis to the same research
   design and to incorporate channels of transfer with different causal
   mechanisms for different stages of the diffusion process.},

Abstract = {Political scientist Professor Bruce Bueno De Mesquita, has made
   significant claims for the predictive accuracy of his computational
   model of group decision making, receiving much popular press, including
   newspaper articles, books and a television documentary entitled `The New
   Nostradamus'. Despite these and many journal and conference publications
   related to the topic, no clear elucidation of the model exists in the
   open literature or can be found in a single place. We expose and present
   the model by careful navigation of the literature and illustrate the
   soundness of our interpretation by replicating De Mesquita's own
   results. We also raise issues regarding sensitivity and convergence.},

Abstract = {Turkish political parties display an oligarchic leadership structure and
   experience difficulty in changing leaders. In addition to state directed
   modernization producing a legacy of single party rule which Turkish
   democracy has inherited and the powerful central state as a model, the
   prevalence of clientelistic relations and the evolution of a culture
   supportive of leadership oligarchy have all contributed to leadership
   oligarchy. The oligarchic tendencies continue to be supported by the
   continuation of extensive clientelistic relations and the construction
   of a legal framework that supports it. The organizational structure of
   parties, their methods of candidate designation for public office and
   many other factors lend support to the continuation of leadership
   oligarchy. Oligarchic leadership structure is dysfunctional for the
   well-functioning of a democratic system.},

Abstract = {In his compelling piece, ``Living in a Promiseland? Mexican Immigration
   and American Obligations,{''} Rogers Smith argues that the greater the
   degree to which the U.S. has coercively constituted the identities of
   non-citizens in ways that have made having certain relationships to
   America fundamental to their capacities to lead free and meaningful
   lives, the greater the obligations the U.S. has to facilitate those
   relationships. Over the last hundred years, many rural communities in
   Mexico have been constituted more by U.S. immigration policy and the
   labor demands of U.S. employers than by similar policies and economic
   factors in Mexico. According to Smith, this means that Mexicans may be
   owed `` special access{''} to American residency and citizenship, ahead
   of the residents of countries less affected by U.S. policies, and in
   ways that should justify leniency toward undocumented Mexican
   immigrants.},

Volume = {32},
Number = {4},
Pages = {458-479},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {What accounts for the substantial variation in the temporal volatility
   of economic growth rates in democratic regimes? We claim that
   institutional differences between the majoritarian and proportional
   representation (PR) electoral systems explain why growth volatility is
   high in some democracies, but not others. Specifically, we suggest that
   unlike PR democracies, the pronounced career concerns of policymakers in
   majoritarian systems give them incentives to use their discretionary
   spending power to alter government spending levels sharply, which
   generates higher spending volatility in these countries. As a result,
   policymakers in majoritarian systems cannot credibly commit themselves
   to stabilizing spending levels. This causes uncertainty among economic
   actors about future spending levels and leads to unstable investment
   patterns that generate a higher volatility of growth rates in
   majoritarian democracies. Results from statistical models provide robust
   statistical support for our theoretical predictions.},

Abstract = {Morality issues such as the death penalty, drug consumption, gambling,
   and same-sex-marriage often constitute intractable policy controversies.
   Classical ``morality politics'' scholars predict two types of
   governmental responses to such public problems: either a substantive
   policy design if there is a broad consensus among electoral
   constituencies or a non-decision if there is a fundamental clash of
   values. We argue that the adoption of a procedural policy design
   represents a third option. Providing empirical evidence on the
   plausibility of this hypothesis, we compare the Swiss regulation of four
   morality issues in the medical field: reproductive medicine and
   embryo-related research; abortion; euthanasia; and organ transplant. In
   fact, ``moral values'' frames are not always dominant, as the
   multi-dimensionality of each morality issue allows for concurrent policy
   frames promoted by various policy actors.},

Abstract = {This article is a reply to a recent contribution to this journal arguing
   that the dramatic decrease in turnout in the first round of the 2010
   French regional elections was the consequence of a change in the
   electoral calendar: unlike the previous regional elections, which were
   held on the same day as other elections, the regional elections of 2010
   took place in isolation. In our opinion, this view is not sustained by
   the facts. We argue that the impact on turnout of the isolation of the
   2010 regional elections was only minor. We suggest alternative
   hypotheses that might explain the sharp decline in voter turnout that
   happened in 2010, especially in the light of the results of the 2011
   cantonal elections.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN UNION POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {12},
Number = {3},
Pages = {359-379},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Research on Euroscepticism focuses increasingly on the role of group
   identities: national identities and attitudes towards multiculturalism.
   Yet hardly any attention has been paid to the way in which religious
   intolerance shapes Euroscepticism. We argue that religious intolerance
   influences not only diffuse Euroscepticism, but also more specifically
   opposition to enlargement of the European Union with Turkey. To examine
   the relationship between religious intolerance and Euroscepticism, this
   article analyses unique data from two representative surveys conducted
   in Ireland and the Netherlands. Our findings show that religious
   intolerance is indeed a powerful determinant of attitudes towards the
   European Union and that it particularly shapes people's attitudes
   towards future Turkish enlargement. This study therefore contributes to
   the literature by demonstrating that social identities are strong
   determinants of Euroscepticism.},

Abstract = {Research suggests that outsourcing is one way that local governments
   have to meet rising expectations and unwillingness to pay when resources
   are constrained. The degree to which resources are constrained is a
   function not only of local economic and political conditions, but of
   state rules as well. We build on previous models of local government
   outsourcing by studying the interaction between state rules and local
   fiscal, economic, and political conditions. We find that cities in
   states that place limits on the resources available to local governments
   choose differently from among the constellation of service provision
   options than cities in states without such limits.},

Abstract = {What explains the varied ways that Africans practice citizenship on an
   everyday basis? And how does the extent of state building (or neoliberal
   unbuilding) in a particular context affect the way individual Africans
   think about the rights, duties, and appropriate channels for exercising
   their citizenship? Over the past 20 years across most of sub-Saharan
   Africa, neoliberal economic reform has meant a major retrenchment of the
   state in the provision of health and education services. This article
   argues that Africans who have at least some experience with public
   schools and clinics are more likely to exercise their citizenship on a
   more frequent basis than those who have no experience of state social
   services at all. The article confirms the existence of policy feedbacks
   between the micro experience of state social policy and democratic
   consolidation in Africa.},

Volume = {50},

Abstract = {Coalition governments in established democracies incur, on average, an
   electoral `cost of governing'. This cost varies across coalition
   partners, and is higher for anti-political-establishment parties. This
   is because, if such a party participates in a coalition, it loses the
   purity of its message by being seen to cooperate with the political
   establishment. In order to demonstrate that anti-political-establishment
   parties suffer an additional cost of governing, this article builds on
   the work by Van der Brug et al. and refines the standard cost of
   governing theory by `bringing the party back in'. The results of the
   analyses, based on 594 observations concerning 51 parties in seven
   Western European countries, cast doubt on the conventional concept of a
   cost of governing that pertains to all parties equally. The findings
   call for a major revision of the standard cost of governing literature,
   while adding a significant contribution to the debate on strategies
   against parties that may constitute a danger to democracy.},

Abstract = {Models of political participation have begun to incorporate actors who
   possess ``social preferences.{''} However, these models have failed to
   take into account the potentially incongruent political goals of
   different social preference types. These goals are likely to play an
   important role in shaping political behavior. To examine the effect of
   distinct social preferences on political activity we conducted an
   experiment in which participants played five rounds of a modified
   dictator game (Andreoni and Miller 2002). We used the decisions in these
   games to determine their preference type and mapped these types to
   reported political activity. Our results show that subjects who were
   most interested in increasing total welfare in the dictator game were
   more likely to participate in politics than subjects with selfish
   preferences, whereas subjects most interested in reducing the difference
   between their own well-being and the well-being of others were no more
   likely to participate than subjects with selfish preferences.},

   to inspire a resurrection of the council form in the present, she would
   have done better to orient her readers to the French Revolution,
