Abstract = {This article presents a framework to measure activity and potential for
   open source software development and use at a country level. The
   framework draws on interviews with experts in the open source software
   industry and numerous existing studies in the literature to identify
   relevant indicators. Several indices of diverse variable lists and
   weighting and aggregation methods were developed and tested for
   robustness. The results provide a first step toward more systematically
   understanding the current state of open source software internationally.},

Abstract = {Video games are important sites for critical geopolitics, and this
   article engages in the analysis of Diplomacy, Civilization, America's
   Army, and Grand Theft Auto IV in order to understand how the
   geopolitical imaginary works in popular culture. It makes the argument
   that the claim to geopolitical and tactical verisimilitude is at odds
   with the representations of violence and the body in war. It concludes
   by mapping new directions for the study of video games.},

   humour and summarise its main aspects as discussed in the relevant
   literature: the genres where political humour surfaces or dominates; the
   reasons why political criticism is so often encoded in humorous terms;
   and the (side-) effects of political humour. They also discuss the
   so-called ``inherent ambiguity of humour{''}, thus explaining why
   political humour does not necessarily influence politics. Rather than
   provoking social and political change, political humour conveys
   criticism against the political status quo and recycles and reinforces
   dominant values and views on politics. The diverse sociopolitical
   conditions may influence who is allowed to participate in the creation
   and circulation of political humour and who may become its target.},

Abstract = {Competent public agencies are associated with better economic outcomes.
   Beyond competence, political leaders need to secure the loyalty of their
   agencies. Unfortunately, several theories predict a tradeoff between
   these two valued features. This paper finds that recruitment into
   agencies is meritocratic where (1) agency officials have poor outside
   options, (2) careers in agencies are long-lasting, and (3) agency
   loyalty is important. Moreover, agency competence is lower when (4)
   loyalty is important but the time horizon is short, and (5) outside
   opportunities improve but the time horizon is long. This evidence fits
   best with a theory of loyalty as non-contractible behavior.},

Abstract = {Objectives. This article examines the comparative effectiveness of
   different types of social ties used by a job seeker and proposes an
   explanation for the inconsistency in empirical evidence for
   strength-of-weak-ties hypothesis. Methods. Granovetter's
   strength-of-weak-ties hypothesis predicted that in a job search, weak
   ties (acquaintances) are a more valuable source of information as
   compared to strong ties (close friends or relatives). However,
   subsequent empirical research has provided ambiguous support for this
   hypothesis. To sort out the conflicting results, a mathematical model of
   the transmission of job information through a contact network has been
   constructed. Along with the strength of tie, a widely used
   characteristic of contact, the model also incorporates the work relation
   of tie. Results. The model has numerous implications with strong
   empirical support, as well as propositions going beyond the findings of
   prior empirical work, which can be evaluated in subsequent studies. It
   is shown that the effectiveness of a certain type of contact depends on
   both the ego's status (weak and work-related contacts are more
   advantageous for higher-status workers) and the composition of the ego's
   network (work-related contacts promote the effectiveness of weak ties,
   while strong-tie contacts hinder the effectiveness of work-related
   ties). In particular, it implies that the inconsistency in empirical
   evidence for the strength-of-weak-ties hypothesis can be explained by
   the differences in status or the proportion of work-related contacts in
   the samples examined. Conclusion. Work-related ties play a significant
   role in the analysis of informal job-search methods; their incorporation
   into the model allows one to account for a number of previously
   unexplained empirical results.},

Abstract = {Objectives. Few studies fully integrate the interactive effects of
   political, geographic, and media contexts into studies of public opinion
   on immigration. We rectify this by utilizing the post-Katrina Latino
   immigrant migration to Louisiana as an opportunity for study of these
   relationships. Methods. We utilize survey data and content analysis of
   news coverage to examine the influence of news exposure on attitudes
   toward immigrants and immigration. Results. Exposure to immigration news
   influences the relative importance of immigration to other issues,
   self-reported personal contact with Spanish-speaking populations, and
   perceptions of the legal status of immigrant populations. Conclusions.
   Local news coverage of immigration increases awareness and concern about
   immigration and heightened news exposure increases perceptions about
   personal interactions with Spanish-speaking populations. Additionally,
   local news coverage of immigration influences the importance of key
   characteristics of immigrant populations, particularly whether
   immigrants are here illegally. Tone of coverage, as opposed to amount,
   exerts the more consistent effect on immigration-related attitudes.},

Abstract = {We propose three ideal types of business-state relations in a transition
   economy and explore the impact of government directors on corporate
   boards for firm behavior. Using a unique dataset of joint-stock
   companies in Russia, we find that the presence of government directors
   on corporate boards is more consistent with a ``collusion{''} ideal type
   of relations between firms and the state than with a managerial
   discipline or rent-extraction ideal type. The state sends directors to
   firms that both extract resources from the state, but that also provide
   important benefits and services to the state. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {The Supreme Court's landmark decision in Citizens United v. FEC provided
   corporations with the highest level of First Amendment speech
   protection, at least in the context of election-related speech. On its
   face, this strong level of protection would seem to throw into doubt the
   speech-related restrictions federal tax law imposes on charities,
   including the limits on lobbying. There are, however, at least two
   reasons to believe this conclusion is incorrect. First, the effect of
   the Citizens United holding on the lobbying limits for charities is
   unclear because of the Supreme Court's identification of a government
   subsidy-in the form of tax benefits-in the charity context. Second, the
   Court's related decision to conclude that a charity's First Amendment
   rights are sufficiently vindicated by the ability to speak through the
   alternate channel of a non-charitable affiliate further complicates the
   analysis. At the same time, however, these complications provide grounds
   for considering whether a more nuanced, ``institutional rights''
   approach to First Amendment speech protection is appropriate in the
   context of lobbying by charities and perhaps also in other ``subsidy''
   contexts. Part I of this article briefly reviews both the federal tax
   law limits on lobbying by charities and the Supreme Court's basis for
   concluding that the limits are constitutional. Part II then reviews the
   Citizens United decision and why that decision is unlikely to have an
   immediate effect on the viability of those limits. Finally, Part III
   considers how both the Citizens United decision and a broader
   institutional rights perspective may instead affect the ability of the
   federal government to restrict the relationships between charities and
   their non-charitable affiliates that engage in lobbying, as well as
   affecting other contexts where the government places speech-related
   conditions on the provision of government subsidies.},

Abstract = {Objective. To survey the contemporary literature in the social and
   biological sciences relevant to race that examines both the reality and
   the usefulness of the concept. Race is considered a major correlate of
   criminal behavior, and thus a fresh look at the concept is of obvious
   importance to criminologists and sociologists. Method. Social, genetic,
   medical, and criminology databases were keyword searched for articles on
   race that either addressed its existence/nonexistence or usefulness as a
   concept. Results. We find that biologist and social constructionists
   talk past one another and never venture beyond the comfort of their own
   positions. Genetic studies using very few chromosomal loci find that
   genetic polymorphisms divide human populations into clusters with almost
   100 percent accuracy and that they correspond to the traditional
   anthropological categories. Conclusion. There is much to gain by
   recognizing that these categories differ genetically, and that we can
   dispense with the term race in favor of some other term such as
   population or ethnic group and nothing would be lost except a word.},

Abstract = {Intergovernmental competition can enhance efficiency. Centralization of
   government expenditures inhibits intergovernmental competition because
   it makes governments more homogeneous, and so cartelizes local
   governments. Cartelization reduces Tiebout competition, and limits
   benchmark competition in which one government's performance can be
   compared with neighboring governments. Measuring fiscal centralization
   as the ratio of local to state and local government expenditures within
   the state, the evidence shows that more fiscal decentralization is
   associated with higher levels of state per capita income. Cartelization
   of local governments negatively impacts income.},

Abstract = {We test the performance of a host of real and financial variables as
   early warning indicators for costly aggregate asset price boom/bust
   cycles, using data for 18 OECD countries.
   A quasi real time signaling approach is used to predict asset price
   booms that have serious real economy consequences. We use a loss
   function to rank the indicators given policy makers' relative
   preferences with respect to missed crises and false alarms and suggest a
   new measure for assessing the usefulness of indicators.
   Global measures of liquidity, in particular a global private credit gap,
   are the best performing indicators and display forecasting records,
   which are informative for policy makers interested in timely reactions
   to growing financial imbalances. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {We analyse preferences for public, private or mixed provision of
   childcare theoretically and empirically. We model childcare as a
   publicly provided private good. Richer households should prefer private
   provision to either pure public or mixed provision. If public provision
   redistributes from rich to poor, the rich should favour mixed over pure
   public provision, but if public provision redistributes from poor to
   rich, the rich and poor might favour mixed provision while the middle
   class favour public provision ('ends against the middle'). Using
   estimates for household preferences from survey data, we find no support
   for the ends-against-the-middle result. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

Journal = {SCOTTISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},

Volume = {58},
Number = {4},
Pages = {567-588},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This paper empirically investigates the interaction between financial
   development and trade openness through simultaneous-equation systems.
   The identification and estimation of the systems rely on the methodology
   of identification through heteroskedasticity proposed by Rigobon (2003).
   Using a panel consisting of 70 countries over the period 1960-2007, we
   find a two-way causal relationship between financial development and
   trade openness. A better-developed financial sector induces higher
   openness to trade, while higher openness in goods market stymies
   financial development. And such findings hold well for low-income,
   high-inflation, or low-governance countries.},

Abstract = {We provide a new price-quantity mechanism to implement the Lindahl
   allocations as Nash equilibria. We show that it satisfies the property
   of forthrightness, introduced by Saijo et al. {[}1996]. Thus, at a Nash
   equilibrium, each player reports directly and honestly his personal
   price and his demand for the public good and obtains the corresponding
   commodity bundle. Using the gradient process to formalize the behaviour
   of the players out-of-equilibrium, we show that, in quasi-linear
   economies, the Nash equilibrium of the game is globally stable.},

Abstract = {Military Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are being increasingly used to
   provide surveillance and attack capabilities within war zones. At the
   heart of much of the rhetoric about these aircraft is their supposed
   ability to enable persistent presence across the battlespace. They are
   also unique in that they actively distance the aircrew from the
   aircraft. This paper seeks to question whether this claim to persistent
   presence can be justified and considers the implications of the
   distancing of pilot from machine in this. In order to achieve this, the
   paper focuses upon conceptualising UAVs as assemblages, composed of both
   human and machine elements. It uses firsthand accounts from a Royal Air
   Force Reaper UAV aircrew as a basis to analyse the ways in which the
   deployment of these aircraft in Afghanistan is changing the ways that
   war is experienced by aerial combatants. It does this through the
   utilisation of a feminist, embodied geopolitics, refiguring it from a
   concern with victims of war to argue for its use to understand the
   micro-scale of how the humans within these UAV assemblages experience
   combat. This paper thus focuses upon the extent to which the Reaper UAV
   achieves a persistent presence through analysis of its supposed
   more-than-human loitering and vision abilities, and the limitations
   associated with the requirement for a human-in-the loop. The paper
   contends that although UAVs like the Reaper change the geopolitics of
   combat, the continuing requirement for the human element of the
   assemblage restricts their ability to provide persistent presence. (C)

Abstract = {Republican freedom is freedom from domination juxtaposed to negative
   freedom as freedom from interference. Proponents argue that republican
   freedom is superior since it highlights that individuals lose freedoms
   even when they are not subject to interference, and claim republican
   freedom is more `resilient'. Republican freedom is trivalent, that is,
   it includes the idea that someone might be non-free to perform some
   actions rather than unfree, and in that sense everyone regards
   republican freedom as different from negative freedom. Trivalence makes
   republican freedom moralized according to negative libertarians. Beyond
   that, negative libertarians argue that all the supposed advantages of
   republican freedom are compatible with those of pure negative-freedom
   measures. That is, losses and gains of republican freedom are captured
   in measures of pure negative freedom, and any protection for republican
   freedom also protects negative freedom, ensuring each is equally
   resilient. Since republican freedom has no advantages over negative
   freedom, but has other problems (is moralized and is trivalent),
   negative freedom is superior. I examine this debate in this article
   through the `coalition problem' for republican freedom. The coalition
   problem is that since there is always a coalition of others who could
   dominate any agent in any sphere, all agents are subject to domination,
   and hence no one can ever have republican freedom. Pettit's simple
   solution to this reductio ad absurdum distinguishes potential from
   actual coalitions. Individuals are only dominated by actual coalitions,
   and not by potential ones. The simple solution highlights moralization
   problems as it demonstrates that domination cannot be purely
   institutionally defined, but requires consideration of dispositions and
   expectations about others' behaviour. I argue that the differences
   between the `free man' and `unfree person' paradigmatic to republican
   arguments is best captured not by the difference between domination and
   interference, but, rather, from familiar distinctions between different
   types of rights and freedoms. Resilience is a practical matter that
   might track some of these familiar distinctions.},

Abstract = {This article tests the hypothesis of opportunistic and partisan cycle
   models using a new large data set of Brazilian municipalities over the
   1989-2005 period. The results show an increase in total and current
   expenditures and a decrease in municipal investments, local tax
   revenues, and budget surplus in election years. They also show that
   partisan ideology exerts a relative influence on the performance of the
   local public accounts. These results confirm that both opportunistic and
   partisan cycles have occurred in the management of the budgets of
   Brazilian municipalities after the end of the military government.},

Abstract = {In 1885, Kropotkin called for geography to be `a means of dissipating
   {[}hostile] prejudices' between nations that make conflicts more likely,
   and `creating other feelings more worthy of humanity'. As a body of
   scholars, we have risen far more ably to the negative task of
   `dissipating' than to the positive charge of `creating': Geography is
   better at researching war than peace. To redress that imbalance, we need
   both to conceptualise more clearly what we mean by peace, and make a
   commitment to researching and practising it. These arguments are made
   with reference to the broader literature and research along the
   Danish/German, Israeli/Palestinian and Kyrgyz/Uzbek interfaces. (C) 2010

Abstract = {In this paper, it is shown that it matters a lot for empirical research
   whether policy is taken to be exogenously set or to be endogenous. In
   the model investment depends on policy that depends on economically
   important fundamentals and is, thus, endogenous. The paper analyzes what
   might be concluded when treating policies as randomly assigned, when in
   fact they are not. When policy is endogenous, the measured effects of
   policy on growth will generally be biased. Based on the model and OECD
   data, the signs of the biases for tax variables and for redistribution
   are derived. Based on these signed biases, the paper discusses some
   empirical results that seem puzzling from a theoretical viewpoint. The
   paper argues that regressing growth on policy can still yield important
   information if policy endogeneity is taken into account.},

Title = {Liberal Civic Education, Religious Commitment, and the Spillover Thesis:
   What Psychology Can Teach Us},
Journal = {POLITICS AND RELIGION},

Abstract = {This article addresses an idea central to liberal debates on civic
   education: the spillover thesis. Both egalitarian liberals and their
   religious opponents in these debates claim that liberal civic education
   creates spillover effects into the way individuals assess the meaning of
   their own lives. Some religious citizens fear that their politically
   reasonable conceptions of the good life are being undermined by
   education that emphasizes the practice of autonomous reasoning.
   Egalitarian liberals usually acknowledge this risk or cost, but deny
   that religious citizens should be given special dispensation from the
   burdens of autonomous reasoning. Some may even hope that conservative
   religious beliefs will be eroded by the practice of liberal civic
   education. This article disputes the spillover thesis. Given the best
   evidence available from the field of cognitive psychology, we challenge
   the notion that critical personal reflection about public matters is
   bound to spillover into critical reflection about private moral matters.
   On the contrary, the evidence suggests that human beings are usually
   well equipped to compartmentalize and are capable of reasoning in
   different ways depending on the context. Thus, reasonable citizens of
   faith are not necessarily unduly burdened by programs of civic
   education; nor are liberal programs of civic education necessarily going
   to lead us to a more secular society of autonomous thinkers. The article
   also speaks to a broader civic humanist tradition in political
   philosophy that includes Plato, Tocqueville, Rousseau, and Marcus
   Aurelius. For these authors, the success of a political enterprise is
   seen to crucially depend on the inculcation of a robust and
   comprehensive system of private virtue. For without private virtue,
   there is no public virtue. If we are correctly interpreting the
   available psychological research, private virtue need not be as
   crucially relevant for the success of common political enterprises. The
   inculcation of private moral virtue does not so clearly translate into
   making good leaders, voters, and public servants.},

Abstract = {Indonesia, the world's third largest democracy, has been called a
   template for Muslim political reform and has the potential to serve as a
   bridge between the United States and the Islamic world. Indonesian
   journalists play a vital role. Since the collapse of the Suharto regime
   in the late 1990s, the Indonesian media sector has experienced its own
   revolution. A nationwide survey of 600 Indonesian journalists finds that
   while the influence of Islam in the newsroom is increasing, journalists
   support the separation of mosque and state and reject militant Islam.
   Their attitude toward the United States has improved under Obama and,
   while skeptical of American motives, they support continued American
   aid. Although most reject Suharto-era government-mouthpiece media
   functions, they have not yet fully embraced the role of watchdog. They
   say that the industry as a whole, and they as individuals, are still not
   free, but cite their own lack of professionalism and poor ethics as the
   greatest threat to their industry. The echo of the development
   journalism model that prevailed in the Suharto years can be seen in the
   top priorities of Indonesian journalists.},

Abstract = {We investigate whether countries with poor human rights records oppose
   human rights resolutions in the United Nations General Assembly. An
   instrumental account of voting would suggest that these countries aim to
   weaken resolutions since they could be future targets of these policies.
   We estimate determinants of voting using 13,000 individual voting
   decisions from 1980 to 2002. Our results from ordered probit estimation
   show that a country's human rights situation is irrelevant to voting
   behavior if regional dependence of voting is controlled for. The results
   also show that simple rules for aggregating voting choices can lead to
   misleading results.},

   the private provision of public goods embedded in a system of democracy
   and redistributive taxation. Results show that the positive effect of
   inequality on production of public goods, to which Olson (1965) pointed,
   is weakened and might even be reversed in this context. Also, the median
   voter may choose a negative tax rate, even if he or she is poorer than
   the mean, in order to stimulate production of public goods. The
   relevance of the model is illustrated with an application to the
   financing of higher education. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Ethnic Context and Immigration Policy Preferences Among Latinos and
   Anglos},
Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {92},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-19},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Objective
   We examine how the immigration policy preferences of Anglos and Latinos
   vary according to ethnic context. Specifically, we hypothesize that
   immigration policy attitudes are a product of both Latino immigrant and
   Latino native born group size. In contrast to previous work, which found
   that Latinos and Anglos react to contextual forces in an identical
   manner, we argue that Latino group size produces opposite reactions for
   Anglos and Latinos.
   Methods
   These hypotheses are tested using an original state-wide survey of
   Anglos and Latinos in Texas conducted during 2006, which is supplemented
   with data from the 2000 Census.
   Results
   Our findings show that residing in a heavily Latino area produces more
   liberal immigration attitudes among Latinos and more conservative
   attitudes among Anglos. However, this result is driven not by the size
   of the foreign-born Latino population, but by the size of the
   native-born Latino population.
   Conclusion
   Anti-immigrant sentiments among Anglos appear to result, at least in
   part, from ethnic concerns.},

Abstract = {This article explores whether use of the Internet changes the role that
   political motivation has traditionally played in classic explanations of
   participation. We ask if, by reducing so dramatically the costs of
   political participation, the Internet causes interest in politics to
   lose importance as a causal factor of participation. We examine this
   issue analysing a representative survey of the Spanish population which
   deals with political participation and Internet use. The results show
   that use of Internet has a direct effect on participation independently
   of motivation, and that, in order to participate online, skilled
   Internet users do not need to be motivated or interested in politics.},

Abstract = {This article discusses changes in collective memory of World War Two in
   France during the 1960s-1970s on the basis of a contextualized
   discussion of three films, all of which adopt, it is argued, a
   self-conscious politics of memory. The films are taken as examples of a
   particular relationship to World War Two that was historically possible
   in a given political context. As in most of the literature, `the 1968
   years' are taken as a moment of change, but it is argued here that they
   constituted the end rather than the start of a series of political
   challenges to collective memory of World War Two. During the 1970s
   representations of World War Two in cinema as well as public discourse
   more generally were increasingly historicized and disconnected from
   contemporary society, and thus de-politicized.},

Abstract = {How should we determine which nations have a responsibility to remedy
   suffering elsewhere? The problem is pressing because, following David
   Miller, `{[}it] is morally intolerable if (remediable) suffering and
   deprivation are allowed to continue ... where they exist we are morally
   bound to hold somebody (some person or collective agent) responsible for
   relieving them'. Miller offers a connection theory of remedial
   responsibilities in response to this problem, a theory he has been
   developing over the last decade. This theory is meant to serve as a
   guide on how we can best determine which nations are remedially
   responsible for alleviating suffering and deprivation elsewhere.
   Miller's theory entails our following a procedure in order to determine
   remedial responsibility for nations. The problem is that there is an
   important flaw in this procedure, a flaw that previous critiques have
   overlooked. This essay will explain this flaw and how Miller's theory
   might be reformulated into a two-tiered procedure that would take better
   account of this problem.},

Abstract = {The results from interviews conducted with 51 respondents represent a
   small contribution to an empirical research agenda designed to find out
   what goes into wellbeing reports and the appropriateness for policy
   analysis of what comes out. It appears that life satisfaction ratings
   are retrospective assessments of how life has gone thus far, or at least
   how the last few years have gone. Most respondents would be reluctant to
   take a pill to improve their life satisfaction. Respondents were also
   generally in favour of providing good public services and perhaps
   promoting the conditions for happiness rather than focussing on
   happiness itself. Some people did not think the government should be
   responsible for promoting happiness directly and others were against
   happiness as a goal of policy because people were seen as being too
   different for policies to actually make any difference. Convincing
   people like these of the merits of policies designed to improve SWB
   requires the development of good measures and design of good policies.},

Journal = {POLITICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {28},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-18},
Abstract = {The stock index ``point{''} is a regular component of financial news
   reports. While much attention is paid to daily changes in stock index
   point totals, few people realize that the value of each stock index
   point also changes frequently. We call inattention to such variations
   ``point blindness.{''} We describe point blindness' psychological causes
   and economic consequences. Our empirical inquiries include a content
   analysis of New York Times articles that demonstrates how news reports
   fuel point blindness and an experiment that we conducted on over 2,000
   Americans. The experiment shows how simple changes in news presentations
   can significantly affect public perceptions of stock market performance.
   The directions of these perceptual shifts correspond to a refined
   understanding of the changing value of stock index points. Hence, small
   changes to news reports can provide valuable information to audiences.},

Abstract = {The proliferation and development of media during the current war in
   Iraq and the opening of the Iraqi media landscape, which had heretofore
   been dampened through authoritarian state control and international
   isolation due to economic sanctions, has played a role in political
   articulation and identity formation throughout the occupation in a
   fashion not seen during previous conflicts. The adoption of media tools,
   emerging as both technology and its applications - often referred to as
   Web 2.0 - impacted both combatants and civilians caught within the
   conflict providing them the opportunity to capture and articulate their
   own experience in a fashion never before available. This investigation
   points to the potential impacts on current political action, the
   resourcefulness of opposition access to media, as well as dangers posed
   through the emotive content most often produced. We argue that while
   such media production is disassociated from surrounding events (or
   decontextualised), its nonetheless trusted and impactful due to its
   viral distribution and sourcing networks and diverse in its impact on
   those not intimately involved due to its lack of overarching narrative
   and production away from sites of power.},

Abstract = {Marx's analysis, supplemented by that of Engels, of the US Civil War is
   as instructive, if not more, as any of their writings to illustrate
   their `materialist conception of history'. Because the American
   experience figured significantly in the young Marx's path to communist
   conclusions, the outbreak of the War in 1861 obligated him to devote his
   full attention to its course. His application of their method allowed
   him to see more accurately the course of the War than his partner. Also,
   he was able to see what President Abraham Lincoln had to do, that is, to
   convert the War from one to end secession to one to overthrow slavery,
   before the President himself. Despite its contradictory outcome, Marx's
   expectation that the War would put the US working class on terra firma
   for the first time was justified.},

Title = {Dangerous Drafts? A Time-Series, Cross-National Analysis of Conscription
   and the Use of Military Force, 1946-2001},
Journal = {ARMED FORCES \& SOCIETY},

Abstract = {Conscription has been claimed to both increase leaders' propensity to
   use military force abroad and constrain them from doing so. The author
   sheds new light on this longstanding controversy by presenting the first
   time-series, cross-national quantitative analysis of the impact that
   state military manpower systems (either conscription or volunteerism)
   have on the initiation of both traditional, belligerent military
   missions and ``operations other than war{''} (OOTWs). Using negative
   binomial regression on 166 states from 1946 to 2001, the author finds
   that states with conscript militaries have a significantly higher
   propensity to use belligerent military force than states with volunteer
   armies. Countries that practice conscription are also more likely than
   countries with volunteer forces to launch a specific type of OOTW,
   military operations against nonstate actors such as rebels or
   terrorists. Neither form of military manpower system seems, however, to
   be significantly related to the initiation of humanitarian military
   operations.},

Title = {Bifurcated Images of the U.S. in Urban China and the Impact of Media
   Environment},

Abstract = {The Chinese public's prevailing admiration and respect for the United
   States was widely observed in the 1980s when reforms first began.
   However, since the early 1990s significant anti-American sentiments have
   started to emerge in China. Such a dramatic shift in Chinese people's
   attitudes toward the U. S. has significant implications for both U. S.
   domestic politics and foreign policies. Many politicians, journalists,
   and scholars have identified the increasing reliance of the Chinese
   Communist Party (CCP) on nationalism for mobilizing political support,
   as well as its still firm control over the domestic mass media for
   propaganda campaigns, as critical factors driving this dramatic public
   opinion shift. Nevertheless, without systematic and appropriate
   empirical evidence, it is extremely difficult to adjudicate the validity
   of speculations on why such a change occurred. Taking advantage of a
   2005 two-city survey in China with pertinent survey instruments, we (a)
   explored Chinese urban residents' usage of different media sources, (b)
   examined the dimensionality of their evaluations of the U. S., and (c)
   scrutinized the impacts of Chinese urbanites' usage of diversified media
   sources on their perceptions of the U. S. The findings show that
   people's attitudes toward U. S. foreign policies can be clearly
   distinguished from their evaluations of American political institutions
   and socioeconomic achievements. Most importantly, our analyses also
   reveal that, embedded as they are in China's partially transformed and
   partially diversified media environment, Chinese urban residents do not
   become pro-American (or vice versa) from the usage of alternative media
   sources beyond the CCP's control.},

Series = {African Dynamics},
Year = {2011},

Abstract = {From a nave transcontinental perspective, the challenge surrounding
   human rights amounts to mediating and vindicating a North-Atlantic
   cultural product outside the North Atlantic in contexts that initially
   appear to be alien and inimical. From this perspective, human rights in
   Africa are part of the wider problematic of the continent's reception of
   North-Atlantic constitutional law. However, intercultural philosophy
   exposes this nave view as inherently hegemonic for attributing the
   monopoly of something that could, alternatively, be considered an
   inalienable achievement of humankind as a whole to the North-Atlantic
   region, This approach is disqualifying for persons outside the North
   Atlantic as it makes it more difficult for them to adopt human-rights
   thinking as potentially universal and as resonating with their own local
   concepts of personhood, integrity and freedom. The present argument
   challenges the hegemonic approach to human rights. On the basis of a
   study of the human-rights thinking in the traditional legal system of
   the Nkoya people of Western Central Zambia, I argue an endogenous, local
   historical basis for many of their human-rights concepts and that the
   application of these rights in Nkoya society is often subtle and
   liberating. In addition, the Nkoya people even boast a few human rights
   for which there are no ready equivalents in standard North-Atlantic
   human-rights catalogues.},

Abstract = {Prior research has concluded that socio-economic development does not
   significantly affect terrorism. We take an alternative view. First, we
   note that a country's socio-economic circumstances affect terrorists'
   behavior through terrorism's opportunity costs. We argue that this
   reasoning also holds for the case of supreme value terrorism. Then, we
   run a series of negative binomial regressions for 110 countries between
   1971 and 2007 to test the hypothesis that poor socio-economic
   development is conducive to terrorism. We find that socio-economic
   variables indeed matter to terrorism, contrary to other results. Our
   findings imply that countries can benefit from economic development and
   growth in terms of a reduction in terrorism. (C) 2011 Published by

Abstract = {Objective. The objective of this study was to investigate whether
   misaligned or uncertain ambitions in adolescence influence the process
   of socioeconomic attainment. Methods. Using 34 years of longitudinal
   data from the British Cohort Study (BCS70), we considered whether youth
   with (1) misaligned ambitions (i.e., those who either over-or
   underestimate the level of education required for their desired
   occupation), (2) both low occupational aspirations and educational
   expectations (low-aligned ambitions), and (3) uncertainty with regard to
   their future occupations (uncertain ambitions) at age 16 experienced
   more unemployment spells, lower educational attainment, and lower hourly
   wages in adulthood compared to youth with high occupational aspirations
   and educational expectations (high-aligned ambitions). Results. Youth
   who hold misaligned or uncertain aspirations show long-term deficits in
   employment stability and educational attainment, which in turn leads to
   lower wage attainments at age 34. Conclusion. Misaligned and uncertain
   ambitions in adolescence compromise the construction of life paths and
   the realization of long-term educational and occupational goals.},

Month = {NOV-DEC},
Abstract = {This empirical analysis aims at assessing the effect of the economic
   climate and the intensity of capital utilisation on companies' capital
   retirement behaviour. It is conducted using individual company data, as
   well as original data on the degree of utilisation of production
   factors. The sample includes 6,998 observations over the period
   1996-2008. This database is, to our knowledge, unique for the empirical
   analysis of the intensity of capital utilisation on firms' capital
   retirement behaviour. We adjust for endogeneity biases by means of
   instrumental variables.
   The main results obtained from the estimation of capital retirement
   models may be summarised as follows: i) The retirement rate decreases
   with the variations in cyclical pressures measured by the changes in
   output and the workweek of capital; this relation corresponds to a
   countercyclical decelerator effect on capital retirement; ii) The
   capital retirement rate increases with the structural intensity of
   capital utilisation; this effect, which corresponds to a wear and tear
   one, is nevertheless small compared to the decelerator one; iii) The
   profit rate does not have a significant impact on the retirement rate.
   Compared with the existing literature, here mainly Mairesse and Dormont
   {[}1985], the contribution of these results is to show, through the use
   of unique survey data, that the effect of the intensity of capital
   utilisation on capital retirement is structurally positive, via a wear
   and tear effect, and cyclically negative, via a decelerator effect which
   completes that already taken into account via the effect of changes in
   value added.},

Abstract = {The Australian government and military have maintained humanitarian
   interventions for far longer than any comparable U.S. humanitarian
   intervention. This longevity confounds most traditional international
   relations theories. It seems that the key variable is public support for
   humanitarian interventions. The U.S. public quickly grew impatient with
   humanitarian operations, while the Australian public has not yet done
   so. Two reasons for the Australian public's forbearance are explored.
   First, the idea that the Australian military and government are
   proficient at these operations and that the public supports these
   operations because it ``loves a winner{''} is found wanting. Second,
   innate differences between the United States and Australia, particularly
   regarding news media, are explored; these differences seem to be highly
   correlated with the longevity of the operations. It seems likely that
   the Australian public does not hear enough about these operations to be
   concerned about them or question their utility, efficacy, or cost.},

Abstract = {We construct a model of a yes/no referendum for which the outcome is
   valid only if the voter turnout rate is greater than a predetermined
   value. With such a turnout threshold, three types of equilibria exist,
   in each of which the voters who favor the status quo either go to the
   polls, abstain, or use mixed strategies. We show that abstaining is more
   likely to realize the status quo than going to the polls if the
   threshold is sufficiently high, whereas one of the mixed-strategy
   equilibria is least likely to realize the status quo for any level of
   threshold.},

Year = {2011},

Number = {3},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This article discusses citizenship in the age of new media using Denmark
   as a critical case study. It argues for the importance of considering
   cultural as well as political aspects of citizenship, and for the
   inclusion of emotions and belonging as well as rational political acts.
   There are strong relationships between the experience and practice of
   citizenship, and it is demonstrated that intensive media use and
   experience/practice of citizenship are highly interrelated: eager media
   users are also the most active and confident citizens. To a certain
   extent new media tend to reinforce existing behavior patterns and
   attitudes: those feeling engaged are those who use ICTs most widely, and
   new media provide them with yet another platform for practicing
   citizenship. It is also shown, however, that there is a segment of new
   media users who prefer online cultural and social activities to offline
   ones. As this segment grows, one might expect an expanded number of
   active citizens, mobilized by the new media themselves.},

   liberalization as a policy variable. A combination of wage subsidy and
   tariff rate obtains the second-best welfare level. The theoretical
   result is new, policy-relevant and important in view of

Abstract = {The article analyses the political process (between July and October
   1977) which led up to all the political parties signing, and Parliament
   ultimately passing the Pactos de la Moncloa (Moncloa pacts). The general
   election gave Adolfo Suarez's Government the legitimacy it needed to
   deal with the economic crisis that had already dragged on for four
   years. Nevertheless, the magnitude of the crisis as well as the results
   of that election obliged the Government to implement a policy of
   agreement and consensus. The article pays particular attention to the
   parliamentary debates on the floor and in the economic parliamentary
   committee. The aim is to measure the scope and the limitations of said
   policy of consensus among the different political parties, even the
   party in power, as well as among the unions and the business
   organisations.},

Abstract = {We use measures of trade-related corruption to investigate the effects
   of corruption on international trade and compare the results with those
   of corruption in general. We distinguish corruption in an exporting
   economy from that in an importing economy. Both distinctions appear to
   be important. Corruption in general hampers international trade, whereas
   bribe paying to customs enhances imports. This effect is most robust in
   importing countries with inefficient customs. High waiting times at the
   border significantly reduce international trade. The effects of
   unpredictability of corruption and policies are inconclusive. (C) 2010

Abstract = {In this article we examine the effect of efforts on the part of election
   administrators in Georgia to compel registrants to cast ballots early
   in-person during the 2008 presidential election. We incorporate data
   collected from a survey of Georgia election administrators into a
   multivariate model designed to explain early in-person turnout at the
   county level. Our results indicate that county election officials who
   attempted to increase early in- person voting through advertising and
   outreach were successful. In addition, early inperson turnout was
   positively linked to voter convenience. Most previous research has
   examined nonprecinct voting from the perspective of the consumer
   (voter). Our work demonstrates the need to also explore this area from
   the standpoint of producers (election officials) who are charged with
   implementation of policy. If election officials want to promote early
   voting, our findings indicate they should utilize a wide range of
   formats to familiarize their voting population with this option. In
   addition, careful thought should also be given to the number of early
   voting sites, their locations, and hours of operation if the goal is to
   get a sizable segment of the electorate to vote prior to the date of the
   election.},

Abstract = {This paper assesses the consequences of immigration for natives'
   unemployment in OECD countries and investigates the role played by
   product and labour market policies in the adjustment of the economy to
   immigration inflows. The estimations, combining a skill-level and an
   aggregate approach using data for males, cover eighteen OECD countries
   over the period 1984-2003. While no significant long-run impact is found
   in any case, we find that immigration may have a temporary impact on
   natives' unemployment, depending upon the policy framework. In
   particular, a temporary increase in unemployment may be observed in a
   context of stringent anticompetitive product market regulation, or of
   high replacement rates of unemployment benefits. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {We question results claiming to extend non-cooperative models of
   legislative bargaining to the theoretically general and substantively
   typical case with an arbitrary number of disciplined parties. We
   identify problems with both the derivation of formal results and
   empirical evaluation of these. No empirically robust formateur advantage
   is observed in field data on bargaining over government formation. Given
   this theoretical and empirical impasse, we reconsider the substantive
   premises that should form the foundation for any new attempt to model
   this fundamental political process, arguing that models should be
   grounded in binding constitutional constraints on the government
   formation process in parliamentary democracies.},

Abstract = {Previous literature has demonstrated the important role that trust plays
   in developing and maintaining well-functioning societies. However, if we
   are to learn how to increase levels of trust in society, we must first
   understand why people choose to trust others. One potential answer to
   this is that people view trust as normative: there is a social norm for
   trusting that imposes punishment for noncompliance. To test this, we
   report data from a survey with salient rewards to elicit people's
   attitudes regarding the punishment of distrusting behavior in a trust
   game. Our results show that people do not behave as though trust is a
   norm. Our participants expected that most people would not punish
   untrusting investors, regardless of whether the potential trustee was a
   stranger or a friend. In contrast, our participants behaved as though
   being trustworthy is a norm. Most participants believed that most people
   would punish someone who failed to reciprocate a stranger's or a
   friend's trust. We conclude that, while we were able to reproduce
   previous results establishing that there is a norm of reciprocity, we
   found no evidence for a corresponding norm of trust, even among friends.},

Title = {Language, Regional Identity and the Failure of the Left in the Moselle
   Departement, 1871-1936},
Journal = {EUROPEAN HISTORY QUARTERLY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {41},
Number = {2},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In 1934, the French left joined forces for the first time to form the
   Popular Front, a left-wing alliance whose credo was born of an
   antifascist imperative. The Moselle, located in the north-eastern corner
   of France, seemed likely to make an important contribution to the
   formation of this alliance. The departement, which returned to French
   sovereignty in 1918 after 47 years of German domination, was one of
   France's most heavily-industrialized regions and counted a large
   working-class population in its steelworks and mines. As this study
   demonstrates, however, the Moselle's industrial workers took little part
   in left-wing social and political movements and massively supported the
   Catholic right and the far right during the interwar period. It was not
   until the national strike movement in June 1936 that they became
   involved in left-wing social and political activities. As this study
   argues, a series of key factors pertaining to the Moselle's distinct
   historical, linguistic and cultural context were decisive in shaping the
   political character of the departement and preventing the Mosellan left
   from mobilizing the support of the working classes.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the effect of political and economic asymmetries in
   the formation of common external tariffs (CETs) in a customs union (CU).
   We do so by introducing possible cross-border lobbying and by
   endogenizing tariff formation in a political economic model for the
   determination of CETs. The latter allows us to consider asymmetries
   among the member nations in their susceptibilities to lobbying. We also
   consider asymmetries in the influence of the member nations in CU-wide
   decision-making. A central finding of this paper is that, in the absence
   of economic asymmetry, the CET rises monotonically with the degree of
   asymmetry in country influences if the two countries are equally
   susceptible to lobbying. If influences are the same, the CET also rises
   monotonically with the degree of asymmetry in susceptibilities. These
   results hold irrespective of whether the lobby groups in the two member
   countries cooperate or work non-cooperatively.},

Abstract = {Countries engaged in transitions from Communist rule to democracy and
   market economies face a considerable challenge to foster tax morale and
   to reduce tax evasion. Tax evasion, however, severely limits the
   capacities of these reformed states, which reduces in a vicious circle
   the citizens' incentives to pay taxes. The question then arises how this
   vicious circle may be broken. Several authors suggest that political
   institutions may do the trick. Based on insights that institutions
   allowing a direct say on policy issues (especially tax questions) may
   increase tax morale, we propose to study comparatively how the link
   between trust and tax morale is affected by these institutions. We find
   that allowing for referendums strengthens the link between trust and tax
   morale, but that this effect depends on the nature of the institutions.

   interjurisdictional spillover effects. The direction and magnitude of
   fund flow, which ultimately determine the local provision of public
   goods, are influenced by the re-election probability of the parties in
   power at the federal and provincial levels. The prevailing wisdom is
   that provincial governments, which are ruled by the same political party
   as that ruling at the federal level, enjoy a higher level of federal
   transfers. We demonstrate that there exists incentive effect of federal
   transfer complementing such partisan effects. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {We evaluate the macroeconomic performance of different monetary policy
   rules when there are bubbles in the exchange rate. We do this in the
   context of a non-linear rational expectations model. The exchange rate
   is allowed to deviate from its fundamental value and the persistence of
   the deviation is modeled as a Markov switching process. Our results
   suggest that reacting to exchange rate movements does not significantly
   improve welfare. However, taking into account the switching nature of
   the economy may be more beneficial.},

   Source Software (FLOSS) movement, interfere in European Union
   decision-making in order to advocate principles of freedom, openness,
   transparency, access to information, participation, creativity, and
   sharing. The analysis is based on a case study of a French activist
   group's campaign against the strengthening of copyright enforcement
   measures and for Net neutrality in the reform of the Telecoms Package-a
   set of five directives regulating the European Union's
   telecommunications sector. I discuss how free and open source principles
   sustain their action repertoire and claims during the campaign in the
   light of recent literature regarding Internet activism and the FLOSS
   movement.},

Abstract = {This article presents an exploratory case study based on fieldwork
   consisting of in-depth, semistructured interviews and group discussions

   an online citizen engagement initiative in ``TechCounty,{''} a
   pseudonymous U.S. local government authority operating in one of the
   most favorable sociodemographic and technological contexts imaginable.
   In contrast with many of the dominant approaches in the literature, the
   article reveals how a rich, complex, and sometimes surprising array of
   internal institutional variables explains the initiative's failure. The
   article highlights the fragile and uncertain adoption of online
   engagement by public organizations and the significance of this study's
   method for building theory and guiding future research.},

Abstract = {My paper is an analysis of contemporary Czech expert discourses on love
   and coupledom, framed within ongoing feminist discussions of
   sociological theory's emphasis on the individualization, reflexivity and
   detraditionalization of gender. Using Bourdieu's notion of symbolic
   violence, I argue for understanding therapeutic discourses as
   perlocutionary speech acts that authoritatively enact gendered norms and
   heteronormative assumptions. This performative approach both challenges
   heightened reflexivity theory by pointing to its flawed voluntarism, and
   also allows for grasping transformation through fissures between a
   perlocutionary act and its reception.},

Abstract = {Under the administration of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, the
   Brazilian state has advocated the use of Free/Livre and Open Source
   Software (FLOSS) throughout the public sector. How did FLOSS adoption
   gain traction as a developmental strategy across a large federal
   bureaucracy that had embraced information technology policies supporting
   export-oriented growth and market liberalization during the 1990s? In a
   historical case study, I argue that the FLOSS agenda emerged as a result
   of the actions of a network of insurgent experts working within elite
   political, technical, and educational institutions. I trace the history
   of this mobilization and show how a dedicated network of experts brought
   about conditions for institutional transformation that contradicted
   prevailing neoliberal policy proscriptions. The Brazilian FLOSS
   insurgency offers insights into the means by which a group of elites
   endeavored to reframe debates about technology-driven economic growth
   around questions of state-led access to source code and knowledge.},

Abstract = {We conduct experiments to test the collective action dilemmas associated
   with defensive and proactive counterterror strategies. Defensive
   policies are associated with creating public `bads' (e. g., a commons)
   whereas proactive policies are akin to the voluntary provision of public
   goods. When combined, the inefficiency of collective action is
   exacerbated, resulting in a situation known as a Prisoner's Dilemma
   squared (PD2). Deterministic versus probabilistic equivalent versions of
   the associated externalities are compared within a laboratory setting.
   Experimental results reveal that the collective action problem
   associated with counterterror strategies is deepened in uncertain
   environments, and is indeed a robust regularity that is not easily
   overcome; as individuals gain more experience, they become even more
   self-interested.},

Abstract = {We model monetary policy decisions as being taken by a group of
   heterogeneous policy makers, organized in a committee. Intuitively, when
   MPC members disclose and discuss the arguments behind their view on the
   interest rate, the quality of the collective decision should be higher
   compared to merely taking a simultaneous vote. We show that in some
   cases this intuition need not be correct. We also find that
   communication is a relatively effective way to implement the `knowledge
   pooling' argument in favor of collective decision-making, compared to
   expanding the size of a committee. Moreover, decision-making with
   internal communication appears generally more robust in situations when
   heterogeneity of members is not adequately captured by decision-making
   rules. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {It is well-known that events influence the standing of the governing
   parties. Still, important questions remain unanswered: Which
   characteristics are necessary for an event to have an impact? Why should
   voters care about events and which role does the mass media play? How
   are other influences on government popularity affected by the occurrence
   of events? To answer these questions a model of German government
   popularity containing the economic situation and events, selected by
   addressed criteria, will be advanced and tested by means of time-series
   regression. The results show that events have an impact on government
   popularity and are able to repress real-world influences. This effect is
   rather short-lived and does not cover all events which are normally
   perceived as influential.},

Abstract = {Objective. Does increasing a political party's power lead to Leviathan
   state governments? The evidence is mixed. We use the Economic Freedom of
   North America (EFNA) Index to measure governmental activity to study the
   impact of political parties on government outcomes. Methods. We employ
   instrumental-variable, panel data methods to regress states' EFNA scores
   on median voter and differentiated-party variables. Results. Party
   effects are negligible, but a simple median voter explanation emerges.
   Conclusion. As political power is consolidated in either party, economic
   freedom increases. This is consistent with a model wherein the median
   voter has effective agency control with positive monitoring costs and
   prefers a particular level of so-called economic freedom. These results
   are inconsistent with Leviathan models of state legislatures.},

Abstract = {We analyze the determinants of the origin of domestic and international
   terrorism in a large panel data set of 159 countries spanning from 1970
   to 2007. We show that terror increases with GDP per capita, a higher
   polity score measuring a more open and competitive political system and
   experiences of domestic conflict, anarchy and regime transitions. Our
   evidence thus contradicts the notion that terrorism is rooted in
   economic deprivation or that strongly autocratic regimes breed more
   terrorists. Rather we show that weak or failing states are an incubator
   for terrorism. We also show that the causes of domestic terror and
   international terror are similar. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Theories of political legitimacy normally stipulate certain conditions
   of legitimacy: the features a state must possess in order to be
   legitimate. Yet there is obviously a second question as to the value of
   legitimacy: the normative features a state has by virtue of it being
   legitimate (such as it being owed obedience, having a right to use
   coercion, or enjoying a general justification in the use of force). I
   argue that it is difficult to demonstrate that affording these to
   legitimate states is morally desirable, and that obvious alternative
   conceptions of the value of legitimacy (notably epistemic and
   instrumental) are not without problems of their own. The intuitive
   triviality of establishing the value of normative legitimacy may mask a
   serious problem.},

Title = {Higher and lower virtues in commercial society: Adam Smith and
   motivation crowding out},
Journal = {POLITICS PHILOSOPHY \& ECONOMICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {10},
Number = {4},
Pages = {370-395},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Motivation crowding out can lead to a reduction of `higher' virtues,
   such as altruism or public spirit, in market contexts. This article
   discusses the role of virtue in the moral and economic theory of Adam
   Smith. It argues that because Smith's account of commercial society is
   based on `lower' virtue, `higher' virtue has a precarious place in it;
   this phenomenon is structurally similar to motivation crowding out. The
   article analyzes and systematizes the ways in which Smith builds on
   `contrivances of nature' in order to solve the problems of limited
   self-command and limited knowledge. As recent research has shown, a
   clear separation of different social spheres can help to reduce the risk
   of motivation crowding out and preserve a place for `higher virtue' in
   commercial society. The conclusion reflects on the performative power of
   economics, arguing that the one-sided focus on models of `economic man'

Abstract = {This paper considers how the welfare of voters is affected under an
   Electoral College system when some state elects to award electoral votes
   in proportion to the number of votes received by each candidate rather
   than awarding all electoral votes to the winner of the state. I show
   that a majority of voters in that state is made worse off as a result of
   the change. I also give conditions under which voters in other states
   are made better or worse off as a result of the change.},

Abstract = {Human beings are temporal and spatial beings. We cannot go back in time;
   whatever we do is an intervention in irreversible, on-going causal
   processes; physically, we cannot be in two places simultaneously; and
   the specific area of space we fill in cannot be occupied by anybody else
   simultaneously. While the nature of time has been theorised in
   philosophy, social theory and (world) political theory, in practice
   historians and social scientists tend to equate time with the modern
   linear conception of time, organising their narratives and explanations
   in a chronological order, without reflecting upon the complexities of
   time and temporalities of social being. I make four arguments,
   developing them in the context of concrete world historical events and
   processes. First, I ask what and when is ``now{''}? The present cannot
   be punctual. Rather, the present is a moment of becoming, and makes
   reference to an on-going process. Second, because ``now{''} is relative
   to the relevant processes, its meaning and characteristics depend on how
   these processes turn out. Thus, the past is, in part, undetermined, and
   at some level will remain so. Third, the futurized nature of the present
   is changing. Critical social sciences are involved in this process of
   transformation, especially through reflexive self-regulation of social
   systems. Fourthly, the move from predictions to reflexive scenarios
   about possible futures, and to open ethico-political discourse about
   unwanted and desired future possibilities, raises deep - in effect,
   mythological - questions about the meaning and purpose of world history
   as a whole. I argue that mythopoetic imagination can also be a means for
   critique.},

Abstract = {Religious appeals have been part and parcel of campaign strategy for
   decades. Most often, however, these appeals to have come from men, but
   little is known about how women would fare using religious appeals on
   the campaign trail. To remedy this, we used an experimental design to
   examine voter reaction to religious appeals from a female and a male
   candidate competing for an open United States Senate seat. We find that
   women's use of religious appeals is governed by the dynamics of tokenism
   - reinforcing traditional gender stereotypes and serving to reduce voter
   support of the female candidate. This suggests that women must be
   careful in using a key campaign tool traditionally employed by men, and
   that this may affect the extent to which female candidates can
   effectively shape voter perceptions on the campaign trail.},

Abstract = {The Women's Peronist Party came up in July 1949 as one of the three
   branches of the Peronist movement. This party was an emblematic example
   of charismatic power; it was a centralized organization ruled by the
   principle of obedience to the leader, where the symbiosis between the
   organizational identity and the founding leader was absolute. Eva Peron
   decided which was going to be the organization and structure of the
   Party and who would occupy the leadership posts. In this way, there was
   not any space for internal democracy or for splinter groups. At the same
   time, this was the very first organization that assembled the women as
   voters, activists and legislators. This article tries to figure out how
   the election processes for the leadership posts were and which was the
   political power that the chosen leaders could exercise. In addition, how
   much influence did the power of Eva Peron signified to the party and
   what happened after her death.},

Abstract = {Spanish nationalists lauded the Constitution of 1812, which erased the
   boundaries of colony and metropole. By the early 1820s, however,
   separatists narrated 300 years of American history as a Biblical tale of
   enslavement, with nations ultimately freed from captivity by the heroism
   and martyrdom of liberators such as Hidalgo. Contrary to the idea that
   an apathetic metropolis turned away from its empire, this article
   recovers a vibrant public sphere in which debates raged over
   independence, nationality and the possibilities of constitutional
   monarchy. As Spain and Mexico shared a liberal political culture, it is
   clear that national identities diverged only inasmuch as nationalists
   insisted upon distinctive cultural and historical roots and the
   definitive separation of the `two Spains'.},

Title = {Decomposing Trends in Attitudes Toward Gay Marriage, 1988-2006},
Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {92},
Number = {2},
Pages = {346-363},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Objective
   The objective of this article is to examine the trend in attitudes
   toward gay marriage through the analysis of data from the General Social
   Survey.
   Methods
   Using linear decomposition techniques, I explain the change in attitudes
   toward gay marriage from 1988 to 2006.
   Results
   Attitudes significantly liberalized over time; 71 percent opposed gay
   marriage in 1988, but by 2006, this figure dropped to 52 percent.
   Approximately two-thirds of this change was due to an intracohort change
   effect, or individuals' modifying their views over time, and one-third
   was due to a cohort succession effect, or later cohorts replacing
   earlier ones. This pattern was replicated across many subgroups of the
   U.S. public, including age, sex, residential, educational, and religious
   groups.
   Conclusion
   The results suggest that the use of the ``equality/tolerance{''} framing
   of gay marriage by its supporters and other societal events or
   ``moments{''} may have convinced some people who used to disapprove of
   gay marriage in 1988 to approve of it by 2006.},

Journal = {POLICY AND INTERNET},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {3},
Number = {2},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Online safety for children and adolescents as a policy issue finds
   itself in a turbulent arena: emerging new mobile and online technologies
   and applications carry opportunities and risks and constantly bring new
   challenges. This article explores particularly the field of adolescents
   and cybercrime against a background of a culture of control combined
   with an increasing use of new media by youngsters. Based on two
   particular cases, i.e. `grooming'-a new development in criminal law
   where children and adolescents are treated as (potential) victims in
   need of protection-and `sexting'-a new development in online risk-taking
   where adolescents are framed as (potential) offenders in need of
   repression-we argue that public policy with respect to adolescent
   behaviour and online risks is tilting towards more control. These
   developments in cybercrime policy that focus on criminal law as a policy
   instrument disturb the balance between the freedom of adolescents to
   develop into responsible and independent adults and controlling online
   risks. Other, more promising avenues, such as encouraging digital
   literacy of citizens and protecting those children who are particularly
   vulnerable, should rather be at the forefront of public policy.},

Abstract = {The topic of reserve military service began with the citizen-soldier who
   performs military duties periodically, fending off community threats.
   Now, the reservist routinely performs full-time military service in
   support of national security operations. Evident in this shift are
   matters of importance, such as the preparedness of the reserve force,
   staffing the reserve force in its new role, the demographic and social
   representativeness of the force, and so forth. Authors from different
   countries examine these and other issues concerning their reserve
   forces. Common content and themes in the articles are briefly described.},

Abstract = {This paper examines effects that alternative voting systems can have on
   electoral outcomes in multicandidate elections. Using ballots collected
   from a county Republican Party special election, we recount the votes
   using preference-based voting systems and compare the results to the
   special election outcome. Relative rankings of candidates change across
   vote counting rules and voting systems. Because candidates trade places
   depending on rules, there are strong strategic implications for
   candidates and for those establishing the rules.},

Abstract = {In this paper we seek a robust methodology for the measurement of the
   relative public sector efficiency of 19 OECD countries over the period
   1980-2000. We estimate relative efficiency scores for five disaggregated
   accounts of public spending as well as for aggregate public spending.
   Then, we use a semi-parametric econometric method to isolate the impact
   of government inefficiency from the inefficiency arising from the
   socioeconomic environment and luck. To verify the validity of our index,
   we use it to examine a number of well-established relationships in the
   public choice literature, which have only been tested using local
   government data.},

Abstract = {Economies that currently have the same productive capacity may implement
   different growth rates. This entails that it is insufficient to base
   international comparisons of welfare solely on current well-being, or
   introducing the potential for future growth in an arbitrary manner.
   NNP-based measures trade off current well-being and the potential for
   future growth in a consistent manner. This paper shows that it matters
   for NNP-based measures whether different growth rates in different
   economies are due to different technological opportunities or different
   social preferences for development. The analysis illustrates the
   similarity between international comparisons of welfare and
   interpersonal comparisons of well-being.},

Abstract = {This paper traces the process by which the British residents of the Lot,
   a department in rural France, develop a deeper understanding of their
   new surroundings. While their initial perceptions of the landscape as
   providing a beautiful view and a backdrop to their everyday lives
   prompted their migration, once they are living in the French countryside
   these perceptions subtly change in response to their experiences of life
   there. As I argue, ills not simply the case that their initial
   impressions are replaced with the knowledge gained from their embodied
   experiences. Indeed, it becomes clear that their idealizations of rural
   living continue to frame, partially, their understandings of how really
   to live in rural France; through valorization and imitation of the lives
   and practices of their French neighbours my respondents lay claim to
   local belonging. The paper thus demonstrates the ways that imaginings
   and experience coalesce in the production of a continually renewed
   understanding of their new location.},

Abstract = {This paper appeals to novel survey information on over 30 000
   individuals in 21 European countries to address an important and
   controversial question with respect to well-being: Do cognitive, hedonic
   and eudaimonic measures of well-being reflect very different aspects of
   individual quality of life? Or, more precisely, do the subjective
   appreciation of these dimensions by individuals exhibit different
   patterns? Our empirical results first reveal a very significant
   correlation between happiness and life satisfaction. Second, someone
   with high standard ``hedonic{''} well-being (happiness or life
   satisfaction) is likely to have high eudaimonic well-being as well
   (flourishing, vitality, resilience and functioning). In addition, the
   factors that are correlated with the different measures of well-being
   seem to be very similar at the individual level. For example, marriage,
   higher income and greater education are associated with greater
   satisfaction, but also with higher levels of flourishing, vitality,
   resilience and functioning. This fit is not perfect, however, and men
   notably report lower levels of standard well-being measures, but higher
   eudaimonic well-being.},

Abstract = {The recent economic crisis has brought to the fore another crisis that
   has been going on for many years, that of (orthodox) economic theory.
   The latter failed to predict and, after the event, cannot offer an
   explanation of why it happened. This article sketches out why this is
   the case and what constitutes the crisis of economics. On this basis,
   the case is made for the revival of an interdisciplinary political
   economy as the only way for offering an explanation of the workings of
   the (capitalist) economy in general and of economic crises in
   particular.},

Title = {Multinationals and Foreign Investment in Zimbabwe A Development and
   Human Rights Perspective},
Booktitle = {ZIMBABWE: PICKING UP THE PIECES},
Year = {2011},
Pages = {203-228},
Abstract = {Zimbabwe, up to 2009, was frequently described as the fastest shrinking
   economy outside a war zone. Its decline has been discussed and debated
   in detail, and solutions sought for its problems by other countries,
   mostly western, for nearly a decade. The country's economic decline was
   driven by a government bent on political survival, buoyed by the support
   of regional governments; yet the innovative people of Zimbabwe devised
   ways to survive the state's tortuous economic policies.
   Development as a whole in Zimbabwe has suffered under many years of
   Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) misrule, with
   a rapid deterioration in social sectors, infrastructure, services, and
   macroeconomic fundamentals.
   Most foreign investors, notably those from South Africa, which comprise
   the majority of foreign companies still operating in Zimbabwe, have held
   the line through the darkest times in Zimbabwe's history, ever hopeful
   of change. However, there was little new investment as business
   conditions became ever more difficult and policies increasingly
   unpredictable and erratic.
   Zimbabwean-owned businesses suffered mixed fortunes. Many were unable to
   survive the economic contraction and closed their doors. Others reduced
   operations to a fraction of capacity and retrenched workers, while a
   handful prospered-mostly as a result of government patronage and
   regional expansion as a hedge against problems at home.
   The plight of Zimbabwean workers became dire. With unemployment rising
   to more than 80 percent of adults, according to anecdotal estimates,
   thousands of professionals and blue collar workers fled to greener
   pastures in other parts of the world, mostly the United Kingdom (UK) and
   South Africa. Many of those who stayed, including skilled and well
   qualified workers, were forced by the economic climate into the informal
   sector, and a significant number of Zimbabweans survived on foreign
   currency remittances, which acted as a buffer against the economic
   crisis.
   Foreign investors were pressured by their home governments and civil
   society to examine their ethical stance in this compromising situation.
   Lobby groups and commentators asked whether foreign investors, by
   staying, were either supporting the pariah government, or helping the
   people of Zimbabwe-or both. While continued investment in Zimbabwe meant
   jobs could be saved, multinational companies had to weigh this against
   the fact that their very presence helped to maintain the political
   status quo, notwithstanding the fact that their bottom line was being
   affected by the ruling party's policies and behavior.
   The pressure for disinvestment became more intense in 2008 when the
   violence against the opposition and intimidation of potential voters
   reached new levels ahead of that year's election. Several multinationals
   did pull out in 2008, although most continued to operate, citing
   concerns about workers.
   Zimbabweans seemed inclined to believe it was good for multinationals to
   stay because they provided a lifeline to thousands of people, in terms
   of jobs and social spending, and their presence helped to keep Zimbabwe
   on the map. Multinational corporations would also be a resource, it was
   argued, when a new government finally was able to restore normality in
   Zimbabwe.
   The new multiparty Government of National Unity (GNU), brokered by the
   Southern African Development Community (SADC) in 2008 and inaugurated in
   2009, signaled a new order for Zimbabwe and nullified the disinvestment
   debate, despite the fact that tensions between the main parties
   continued to hold back the country's potential.
   This chapter examines the recent political and business climate in
   Zimbabwe, focusing on issues affecting, and of particular concern to,
   local and foreign multinationals in Zimbabwe. It also looks at the role
   such businesses can play in the country's economic recovery.},

Abstract = {Chris Wickham's important intervention in debates about the
   transformation of the Roman world from the fifth century onwards
   presents a vast array of evidence about the nature of social relations,
   the economy and the late-Roman and early-medieval state across the
   Mediterranean and Western-European world. Wickham is successful in
   taking into account both the high level of regional variation and
   differentiation across the Roman world and, at the same time, the
   various key unifying elements which bound these regions together. But,
   in arguing that the nature of the fiscal apparatus and structures of
   extraction, redistribution and consumption of surpluses of the
   late-Roman state were formative in the structure and appearance of the
   late-Roman elites in East and West as well as in the evolution of their
   early-medieval successors, a number of structural tensions in the model
   become apparent. This discussion highlights some of the issues at stake,
   while, at the same time, affirming the critical importance of the book,
   more especially its emphasis on the structural force of late-Roman
   institutions and social relations for the successor-states of the
   early-medieval West.},

Journal = {POLITICKA EKONOMIE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {59},
Number = {2},
Pages = {164-183},
Abstract = {The article discusses the approaches and options for identification of
   disequilibrium asset prices movements. It focuses mainly on theoretical
   and empirical methods for identifying the so-called ``bubbles{''} in
   asset prices. Subsequently, the dissimilarity among foreign exchange,
   stock and real estate markets in the Czech Republic is discussed, and
   application of selected methods (ratios, statistical and econometric
   methods) for identification of bubbles on these markets is shown. Its
   main advantage is that we analyze the problem not only from the
   perspective of one market, but on the main segments of financial sector.
   Paper concludes that the misalignment of asset prices during current
   financial crisis was not significantly different from their values from
   the second part of nineties.},

Journal = {POLITICKA EKONOMIE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {59},
Number = {5},
Pages = {680-705},
Abstract = {The article deals with monetary disequilibrium in the theory of
   endogenous money. In new consensus economics, monetary disequilibrium is
   not considered whereas money is endogenous and passive. In
   post-Keynesian economics, there is an explicit discussion about
   reconciliation of money demand and supply. Based on careful distinction
   between money and credit markets, it is argued that monetary
   disequilibrium can occur even when money is endogenous and therefore
   money is endogenous and active. This is because of insufficiency of
   reflux mechanism. The article suggests ways in which new consensus
   should be supplemented to incorporate this issue. This is also important
   for monetary policy otherwise a part of transmission mechanism is left
   out.},

Title = {The Political Consequences of the Rise of the Internet: Political
   Beliefs and Practices of Chinese Netizens},
Journal = {POLITICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {28},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {291-322},
Abstract = {This article addresses a long-standing question: What are the political
   consequences of the rise of the Internet and the attendant emergence of
   netizens in China, particularly in terms of China's democratic
   prospects? Given the Chinese state's firm control in the realm of
   traditional media, the Internet has been expected to bring about
   political and social change in China since its introduction. Although
   scholars have had divergent views on what this change might look like,
   there has been no systematic effort to produce representative evidence
   to address the debate. Examining a nationwide representative survey data
   set, this study finds that Chinese netizens, as opposed to traditional
   media users and non-media users, are more politically opinionated. In
   addition, they are more likely to be simultaneously supportive of the
   norms of democracy and critical about the party-state and the political
   conditions in China, while also being potential and active participants
   in collective action. This article argues that, despite the competent
   authoritarian state, a more decentralized media system enabled by
   technology has contributed to a more critical and politicized citizenry
   in China's cyberspace. The Internet has made it possible for China's
   media system to undertake a new, albeit restricted and contingent role

Abstract = {Based on psychological research on the attractiveness effect, this study
   investigated the role of legislators' physical attractiveness in shaping
   the amount of their news coverage. The physical attractiveness of
   members of the first session of the 110th U.S. Congress was evaluated by
   non-American college students. Computerized searches in news transcripts
   archived in Lexis-Nexis were used to determine the number of times each
   of the representatives appeared on national TV news, radio, and
   newspapers. Multivariate analysis, controlling for a host of predictors
   of coverage (e.g., seniority, state size, number of bills sponsored by
   members, number of press releases sponsored, members' ideology and
   extremity, and assignment to a prestigious committee), demonstrated that
   televised news coverage was associated with the measure of physical
   attractiveness. Possible mechanisms underlying the association were
   empirically explored.},

Abstract = {Transnational terrorism in Western countries has raised questions about
   security measures that constrain civil liberties. This is the first
   paper that uses a terrorist attack, that in the London 7/7/2005, as an
   exogenous source of variation to study the dynamics of risk perception
   and the effect on the readiness to trade off civil liberties for
   enhanced security. In this framework we show that willingness to trade
   off security for liberties is dramatically affected by changes in
   individual risk assessments due to a terrorist attack. We document the
   extent of persistence of changed attitudes. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {This paper is concerned with expressions of Argentine territorial
   nationalism with a specific focus on the Malvinas/Falklands dispute.
   Billig's (1995) notion of banal nationalism has been widely applied as a
   means to understanding the ways in which national identities are learnt
   and reproduced by the populace, through a multitude of `mundane'
   representations. More recently Billig's (1995) thesis has been critiqued
   (Jones \& Merriman, 2009) for its rigidity and inability to take account
   of the different ways these nationalisms are produced and received
   (Muller, 2008) within and outside of the nation-state. We build on these
   interventions by arguing that research into territorial nationalism
   should not ignore the wider temporal, spatial, political and everyday
   contexts in which such discourses emerge and are consumed. To illustrate
   this diversity we contend that territorial nationalism and, more
   specifically, the attention placed on the Malvinas dispute by the
   Argentine government has varied in its intensity, depending on wider
   political events and agendas in the South West Atlantic and Latin
   American regions. Secondly, through the use of interview extracts from a
   pilot study conducted with 20 young people in Buenos Aires, we suggest
   that Argentine territorial nationalism is not received uniformly across
   the nation-state and, rather, should be explored in its everyday
   contexts. These contexts take into consideration things like
   respondent's geographical location, personal/familial relationships and
   generation, amongst other variables, in order to more sensitively
   appreciate Argentine territorial nationalism's multifarious reception.

Abstract = {For over 40 years researchers have attempted to test the relative
   efficiency of governments run by elected versus appointed officials with
   conflicting results. The focus of prior research has been the
   expenditure levels of municipal and county governments. In this paper,
   we consider the achievement of students in public schools. Using data
   from Florida's 67 school districts, we compare academic outcomes of
   students in districts run by elected and appointed superintendents. To
   overcome selection bias, we utilize both instrumental variable methods
   and panel data techniques. We find no consistent differences in the
   performance of elected and appointed superintendents.},

Abstract = {No consensus has yet emerged on whether fiscal decentralization
   facilitates or impedes the growth of the public sector. One explanation
   for this ambiguity in the literature is that the effect of fiscal
   decentralization on public sector size depends on the government's
   ideology. This paper therefore develops a simple model to study
   theoretically how interactions between fiscal decentralization and the
   ideology of the government may influence the size of the public sector.
   Thereafter, the implications of the model are tested empirically with
   panel data from 18 OECD countries over the 1980-2000 period. (C) 2011

Abstract = {Objectives. This study examines the impact of competitiveness, winning,
   and ideological congruence on evaluations of democratic principles,
   institutions, and performance. We posit that winning matters most.
   Individuals will hold favorable views toward democracy when it produces
   the outcomes they desire, independent of other contextual factors
   associated with elections. Methods. We use cross-sectional multiple
   regression models to analyze survey data from Australia, Canada, the
   United Kingdom, and the United States. Results. We find that the
   psychological effect of being an election winner at the national level
   greatly boosts evaluations of democracy, as measured with a host of
   different indicators, while competitiveness and congruence do not
   systematically affect these evaluations. Conclusions. This study sheds
   light on what factors boost regime support among the populace by sorting
   out the relative impact of being in a competitive district, winning ( at
   the local and national level), and having a representative with a
   similar ideological outlook.},

Abstract = {50 years after George J. Stigler's seminal contributions on price and
   wage dispersion produced by the lack of available information, the 2010
   Nobel Prize in memory of Alfred Nobel rewards three pioneers of the
   search and matching literature. In this article, rather than writing a
   new survey of the large number of contributions in this active field, we
   discuss some of its micro-foundations to show that they have a clear and
   compelling character; then we evoke the debates on the ability of the
   canonical macroeconomic model DMP (Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides) to
   replicate stylized facts of the business cycle. We then show that unlike
   competitive models, the value of this model class is to generate
   non-trivial policy recommendations. Finally we discuss four tracks for
   future research: directed research; strategic wage bargaining within
   firms; on-the-job search; and finally, interactions with other market
   frictions, including financial and product markets.},

Abstract = {Following Borcherding and Deacon {[}1972] and Bergstrom and Goodman
   {[}19731, a sizeable empirical literature has used the median voter
   model to analyze local spending behaviors. The main innovation in this
   paper is methodological as the median voter `s satisfaction is described
   by a Stone-Geary utility function. Then, we are able to specify the
   public spending function in a simplified linear expenditure system,
   which can be estimated without price measurement. Then, the median voter
   model offers a price variable which the voter uses to define her demand
   for local public goods. So, we are able to estimate the specification
   with a price measurement. We provide new evidence using French
   municipalities of more than 20,000 inhabitants. The main results suggest
   that the minimum public spending value is dominant but decreases with
   the population size. Estimates oblained with price measurement lead to
   an overestimation of the preferences parameter and to an underestimalion
   of the minimum part. Price and income elasticities are greater than
   values obtained with the traditional method.},

Abstract = {This discourse analysis of audience reception examined journalistic
   response to the May 1, 2006, immigrants' rights protests in mainstream
   newspapers, niche news and opinion outlets in the United States. The
   organizers of the protests faced a particular rhetorical challenge: to
   craft a message that would be well received by both hostile and friendly
   audiences. In addition to attracting significant media coverage, the
   actions sparked both celebration and criticism in public commentary.
   Three key themes were identified based on primary texts from protest
   organizers and existing research on media coverage of political protest:
   economy; policy/rights; and law/order. Linguistic representations of
   these themes were constructed and keywords were searched across a corpus
   of newspaper front pages and television transcripts to identify general
   trends. These trends were then analyzed at the level of sentence and
   utterance. Our findings illustrate the particular challenges of polysemy
   for social movements that seek to use mass media to advance their
   political goals in an increasingly fragmented media environment, as well
   as the persistence of some aspects of the ``protest paradigm{''} in
   media coverage.},

Abstract = {This article compares the perceived importance of influences on news
   work across 18 societies. Evidence is based on journalists' survey
   responses to a six-dimensional scale, covering political, economic,
   organizational, professional, and procedural influences as well as
   influences from reference groups. The results confirm the expectation
   that political and economic factors are clearly the most important
   denominators of cross-national differences in the journalists'
   perceptions of influences. Furthermore, perceived political influences
   are clearly related to objective indicators of political freedom and
   ownership structures across the investigated countries. Economic
   influences seem to have a stronger impact in private and state-owned
   media than in public newsrooms, but they are not related to a country's
   economic freedom. With respect to organizational, professional, and
   procedural influences as well as the impact of reference groups, the
   differences between the countries turned out to be much smaller.},

Abstract = {What career information do potential military recruits seek? The
   Internet increasingly provides a medium for advertising and
   communication with recruiters and other potential recruits. The authors
   explored the influence of online information on enlistment decision
   making. Analysis of recent Army new recruit surveys showed that a
   sizable proportion of recruits have encountered military advertising or
   sought recruiting information online. The authors also examined online
   discussion forums-in which soldiers and prospective soldiers ask
   questions, trade insights, and vent frustrations-for postings indicating
   information seeking for enlistment decision making. Potential recruits
   were most interested in recruiting processes and what to expect from a
   military lifestyle, seeking opinions and details on job functions, duty
   stations, and benefits. These findings suggest that potential recruits
   may seek information online when unable or unwilling to find it from
   military websites or talking to recruiters.},

Title = {The Influence of Spanish-Language Media on Latino Public Opinion and
   Group Consciousness},
Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {92},
Number = {2},
Pages = {509-534},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Objective
   This article determines if the use of Spanish-language media among
   Latinos influences public opinion on various policy issues and group
   consciousness.
   Methods
   Using a 2004 national public opinion survey of U.S. Latinos, a
   multivariate analysis is run to determine the effect of language media
   preference on immigration policy, abortion, same-sex marriage, and three
   measures of group consciousness.
   Results
   I find more frequent use of Spanish-language media leads to more liberal
   attitudes toward immigration, but has no effect on opinions toward
   abortion and same-sex marriage. I also find increased use of
   Spanish-language media leads to increased levels of group consciousness.
   Conclusions
   The differences in attitudes are due to the diverging goals of
   Spanish-language and English-language media. The effect of using
   Spanish-language media serves to promote a sense of group consciousness
   among Latinos by reinforcing roots in Latin America and the
   commonalities among Latinos of varying national origin.},

Title = {The Effect of Descriptive Representation on Latinos' Views of Government
   and of Themselves},
Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {92},
Number = {2},
Pages = {483-508},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Objective
   This article investigates the relationship between descriptive
   representation and the political attitudes of Latino citizens in the
   United States. We specifically test the impact of both panethnic and
   national-origin specific representation on Latino citizens' attitudes
   toward government and their individual-level identity.
   Methods
   Original data on the ethnicity and national origin of Latino mayors in
   2005 and 2006 was merged with the Latino National Survey (2006) to
   analyze the impact of descriptive representation on four specific
   outcomes: perceptions of political alienation, efficacy, political
   commonality, and linked fate.
   Results
   We find a meaningful relationship between descriptive representation and
   the political attitudes of Latino citizens. However, the impact of
   representation varies by level (panethnic vs. national origin) and the
   particular outcome of interest.
   Conclusions
   By developing a Latino-specific model of descriptive representation,
   this investigation improves our knowledge of how recent increases in the
   number of Latinos elected to public office have impacted the Latino
   electorate.},

Abstract = {Using a detailed survey on Spanish workers, this paper investigates the
   relationship between firm size and working conditions, the extent to
   which firm size differences in workers' job satisfaction can be
   accounted for by differences in their work environment and the impact of
   firm size on workers' quit intentions. The results indicate that: (1)
   employees in larger firms face a worse work environment; (2) working in
   large firms significantly reduces job satisfaction when no controls for
   working conditions are included, but taking them into account makes
   differentials across size categories statistically insignificant; and
   (3) no systematic differences exist in intentions to quit across firm
   size categories, irrespective of conditioning on wages.},

Abstract = {This study utilizes the Habermasian public sphere as a theoretical
   framework to analyze the discussions and deliberations surrounding the
   Muslim-Christian discourses in Egypt as they were portrayed in two of
   the most popular Egyptian political blogs launched by a prominent male
   and a female political blogger in Egypt, namely, Wael Abbas and Nawara
   Negm, respectively. The study focused on the portrayal of
   Muslim-Christian tensions, in particular, as an especially sensitive and
   controversial issue to explore the extent to which the postings on these
   blogs reflect a new form of vibrant and dynamic virtual public sphere,
   and the degree to which this newly constructed virtual public sphere
   conforms to, or deviates from, the idealized Habermasian public sphere.
   Our analysis showed that although there was a genuine Habermasian public
   sphere reflected in some of the threads on the two blogs, there was a
   general lack of rational-critical debates, reciprocal deliberations, and
   communicative action as envisioned by Habermas. It also showed that this
   newly (re)envisioned virtual public sphere aimed to revitalize civil
   society, through broadening the base of popular participation, which in
   turn led to boosting and expanding the concept of citizen journalism,
   beyond the official sphere of mainstream media.},

Title = {State Educational Investments and Economic Growth in the United States:
   A Path Analysis},
Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {92},
Number = {1},
Pages = {226-245},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Objective
   This article investigates direct and indirect relationships between
   state investments in education and economic growth measured as change in
   per-capita gross state product (GSP). As a basis for selecting control
   variables, it also applies a conceptual framework borrowed from the
   cross-national growth research.
   Method
   We gathered 18 years of panel data on the 48 continental states and ran
   GLS regressions with panel corrected standard errors after executing an
   AR1 correction for autocorrelation.
   Results
   Per-capita savings deposits, college attainment, and initial GSP are the
   most consistent predictors of GSP growth over the 18-year period
   investigated. However, all the independent variables in the model,
   except high school attainment, predict per-capita GSP growth from 1997
   to 2005.
   Conclusion
   The study supports the virtues of a path model and a cross-national
   framework for explaining the relationship between educational
   expenditures and GSP growth, especially from 1997 to 2005.},

Abstract = {This article aims to make a long overdue re-examination of
   Indo-Australian relations in the early Cold War years. By drawing on
   available secondary sources, it reassesses the existing literature on
   Australian engagement with Asia. In so doing, it seeks to understand the
   reasons why the Menzies government found it so difficult to forge a
   close partnership with India. Canberra's rather frosty relations with
   New Delhi during the Menzies-Nehru years had little to do with Menzies'
   alleged condescension towards the Asians or his personal antipathy
   towards Nehru. Rather, it had to do with the two leaders' different
   readings of Cold War politics as well as their responses to the
   structural changes taking place at the international level following the
   end of the Second World War.},

Abstract = {Objectives
   One of the major policy concerns at the federal and state level is the
   rising number of individuals without health insurance. The purpose of
   this article is to investigate whether party control of government and
   various state reforms impact the percentage of the state population
   without health insurance.
   Methods
   Using data from 1987-2007, I empirically examine whether party control
   and five state policy reforms reduce the uninsured population.
   Results
   The results show that Republicans are more effective than Democrats at
   the state level at reducing insurance gaps and that three of five policy
   reforms explored appear to significantly expand insurance coverage.
   Conclusions
   The results provide valuable insight into which components of
   health-care reform at the national level may help address the health
   insurance problem.},

Abstract = {From offshore border enforcement to detention centers on remote islands,
   struggles over human smuggling, detention, asylum, and associated
   policies play out along the geographical margins of the nation-state. In
   this paper, I argue that islands are part of a broader enforcement
   archipelago of detention, a tactic of migration control. Island
   enforcement practices deter, detain, and deflect migrants from the
   shores of sovereign territory. Islands thus function as key sites of
   territorial struggle where nation-states use distance, invisibility, and
   sub-national jurisdictional status (Baldacchino \& Milne, 2006) to
   operationalize Ong's (2006) `graduated zones of sovereignty'. In sites
   that introduce ambiguity into migrants' legal status, state and
   non-state actors negotiate and illuminate geopolitical arrangements that
   structure mobility. This research traces patterns among distant and
   distinct locations through examination of sovereign and biopolitical
   powers that haunt asylum-seekers.detained on islands. Offshore
   detention, in turn, fuels spatial strategies employed in onshore
   detention practices internal to sovereign territory. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {This paper investigates bailouts in the fiscal federal system of Spain.
   An equation is estimated in which central government grants to regions
   depend on the regions' issue of debt. The data is for the period
   1986-2006. The results reveal partial bailouts. This holds for
   discretionary and inprinciple non-discretionary grants. Bailouts are
   greater or more likely when there are limits on the borrowing autonomy
   of a region, when the region is responsible for providing health care;
   and when the region has a high proportion of swing voters). (C) 2010

   Political Information},
Journal = {POLICY AND INTERNET},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {3},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This empirical study addresses dynamics of viral information in the
   blogosphere, presenting a new methodology which enables the capture of
   dynamism and the time-factor of information diffusion in networks. Data
   was gathered on nearly 10,000 blogs and 13,000 blog posts, linking to 65
   of the top U.S. presidential election videos that became viral on the
   Internet between March 2007 and June 2009. The article argues that the
   blogosphere is not monolithic and illuminates the role of four important
   blog types: elite, top-political, top-general and tail blogs. It creates
   a map of the `life cycle' of blogs posting links to viral information.
   It shows that elite and top-general blogs ignite the virality process,
   which means that they get the chance to frame messages and influence
   agenda setting while top-political and tail blogs act as followers in
   the process.},

Journal = {HISTORICAL MATERIALISM-RESEARCH IN CRITICAL MARXIST THEORY},

Pages = {92-112},
Abstract = {Liberalism is currently the hegemonic world-view, capable of dictating
   its terms even to the very movements that antagonise it. But does the
   history of liberalism really coincide with that of modern democracy? In
   two of his recent works, Liberalism: A Counter-History and The Language
   of Empire, Domenico Losurdo demonstrates that this is not the case. At
   its origin, liberalism was not a universalistic defence of the
   individual's freedom. On the contrary, it represented a demand for
   wresting complete self-government of civil society from the monarch.
   However, given that each society is traversed by deep differences and
   bitter conflicts, the emancipation from absolute power turned into the
   possibility for the strongest individuals and social forces to exercise
   an unprecedented absolute power over subaltern classes and `inferior
   races'. It was only after the confrontation and clash with the demands
   of radicalism and socialism and two world-wars that liberal thought was
   forced to make peace with the principles of democracy. However,
   contemporary liberalism seems to have forgotten its own most-recent
   achievements and to have returned to its eighteenth-century form: will
   modern democracy survive this involution?},

Journal = {PUBLIC CHOICE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {146},

Abstract = {Lipset and Rokkan's (Party system and voter alignments: cross national
   perspectives, Lipset and Rokkan eds., New York: Free Press, pp. 1-64,
   1967) sociological model of cleavages and the so-called ``freezing
   hypothesis{''} dominate theorizing about party system formation. Torcal
   and Mainwaring (Br. J. Polit. Sci. 33:55-84, 2003) show the relevance of
   a purely political cleavage for structuring the party system in the case
   of Chile, challenging the freezing hypothesis's claims. They also
   dispute case-specific research that argues Chile's party system still
   reflects a ``three-thirds{''} division between Left, Right, and Center.
   Revisiting this debate, our study employs spatial maps of the party
   system. Such political-economy models are rare in studies of Latin
   American politics. The application here supports a
   democratic/authoritarian political cleavage in Chile.},

Journal = {GEOPOLITICS},

Volume = {16},

Abstract = {The article examines the EU's and specifically the European Commission's
   proposals for an external energy policy. The analysis departs from the
   assumption that the geographical scope of the Commission's proposals is
   not the result of `geopolitical facts' but rather of a discursive policy
   process of geopolitical writing in which geopolitical images and ideas
   are constantly being created and re-created. I first examine how the
   Commission is constructing its vision of an integrated European energy
   space in theory and how it uses `spectacular' images to justify the
   linkages between energy security and geography. I then distinguish
   between Walters's notions of `networked' and `colonial' type of
   relations between the EU and third states to examine the wider political
   purpose behind the Commission's vision of the European energy space. I
   then analyse the extent to which the Commission's geopolitical vision
   has been or can be implemented in practice in four concrete empirical
   case studies: EU energy relations with Eastern Europe, the
   Mediterranean/Middle East, the Caucasus and the Russian Federation.},

Abstract = {The Dutch Republic holds a marginal position in the debate on the
   transition from feudalism to capitalism, despite its significance in the
   early stage of the development of global capitalism. While the positions
   of those Marxists who did consider the Dutch case range from seeing it
   as the first capitalist country to rejecting it as an essentially
   non-capitalist commercial society, all involved basically accept an
   image of Dutch development as being driven by commerce rather than real
   advances in the sphere of production. Their shared interpretation of the
   Dutch `Golden Age', however, rests on an interpretation of Dutch
   economic history that does not match the current state of historical
   knowledge. Rereading the debate on the Dutch trajectory towards
   capitalism in the light of recent economic historiography seriously
   challenges established views, and questions both major strands in the
   transition-debate.},

Abstract = {Twenty years after the last research was conducted on military families
   in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), this study explores gender
   arrangements in families of male and female career military personnel as
   viewed by their civilian spouses. The research objective was to analyze
   the differences in attitudes toward family life and examine the
   differences in work-family practices among the IDF's career servicemen
   and women. The findings indicate that the IDF's heavy demands on career
   personnel, regardless of gender lead to the construction of family and
   couple arrangements that deviate from the norm in civilian
   Israeli-Jewish families of similar characteristics. For the servicemen,
   this demand creates a `'traditional'' role division model that places
   the entire burden of family work on their wives; for the servicewomen
   the same demands create a relatively `'egalitarian'' role division
   model, by placing more of the burden of `'family chores'' on their
   husbands.},

Title = {Global Web Accessibility Analysis of National Government Portals and
   Ministry Web Sites},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY \& POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {8},

Pages = {41-67},
Abstract = {Equal access to public information and services for all is an essential
   part of the United Nations (UN) Declaration of Human Rights. Today,
   theWeb plays an important role in providing information and services to
   citizens. Unfortunately, many government Web sites are poorly designed
   and have accessibility barriers that prevent people with disabilities
   from using them. This article combines currentWeb accessibility
   benchmarking methodologies with a sound strategy for comparingWeb
   accessibility among countries and continents. Furthermore, the article
   presents the first global analysis of the Web accessibility of 192
   United Nation Member States made publically available. The article also
   identifies common properties of Member States that have accessible and
   inaccessible Web sites and shows that implementing antidisability
   discrimination laws is highly beneficial for the accessibility of Web
   sites, while signing the UN Rights and Dignity of Persons with
   Disabilities has had no such effect yet. The article demonstrates that,
   despite the commonly held assumption to the contrary, mature,
   high-quality Web sites are more accessible than lower quality ones.
   Moreover, Web accessibility conformance claims by Web site owners are
   generally exaggerated.},

Abstract = {During the last ten years, the Swedish Armed Forces has undergone a
   transformation in its shift toward worldwide peacekeeping operations.
   Subsequently, the Swedish government is moving away from conscription to
   an all-voluntary recruitment system. This transition may lead to
   substantial challenges in recruiting new soldiers for the Armed Forces
   as well as for peacekeeping operations. A key to successful recruitment
   is understanding what motivates young men and women to participate in
   peacekeeping operations. This research note addresses questions about
   what motivated Swedish peacekeeping soldiers to join the 5th mission to
   Liberia and the 14th mission to Kosovo in 2006. Fabrizio Battistelli's
   motivation typology, paleomodern, modern, and postmodern, is used in the
   analysis. The results show that all three motives were represented but
   that postmodern motives were by far the most common motivator.},

   Politics},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY \& POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {8},
Number = {2},
Pages = {146-162},
Abstract = {This article addresses the fragmentation of political communication in
   the context of Norwegian election campaigns. The fragmentation thesis
   refers to two distinguishable, interrelated tendencies: New technology
   providing incentives to tailor campaign communication to specific voter
   categories, and the audience fragment due to increasing number of media
   outlets. The consequence is asserted to be fragmented voter agendas. The
   findings undermine the fragmentation thesis as a general tendency.
   Norwegian parties hardly use information and communication technologies
   (ICTs) to multi-tailor campaign messages to different voter categories.
   The voters who considered online sources important for electoral
   information also identified traditional sources as important.
   Furthermore, the analysis offers no evidence that the voter agenda has
   fragmented over time, and online voters are preoccupied with the same
   issues as the rest of the electorate. The article addresses how both
   general countervailing forces as well as context-specific factors such
   as aspects of the law and the lack of existing practices concerning
   voter targeting curb the push towards fragmentation. Moreover, the
   campaign coverage in advanced democracies is proposed as a general
   constraint towards fragmentation of campaign communication.},

Journal = {GEOPOLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {16},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {486-511},
Abstract = {Recent discussions on the development of European Union (EU) energy
   policy have become dominated by a discourse of insecurity relating to
   the questions of energy dependence and relations with energy suppliers,
   echoing the debate during the energy crises of the 1970s. This article
   compares the two periods, analysing the way in which the EU (and the
   European Community in the 1970s) reacted to disruptions to energy
   supply. The article critically applies the concept of securitization,
   arguing that while the salience of energy increased in both periods, the
   Europeans neither faced an ``existential threat{''} nor adopted
   ``extraordinary measures{''} in responding to the crises.},

Abstract = {The article analyzes the international human rights standards applicable
   to military justice systems, especially in the matter of independence
   and impartiality of judges. The research describes, analyzes and
   compares the case law and commentaries of international human rights
   bodies. It focuses on four international and regional human rights
   subsystems: the Human Rights Committee of the International Covenant on
   Civil and Political Rights, the African Commission on Human and Peoples'
   Rights, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights and the European Court
   of Human Rights. From a comparative approach, it is defined three
   independence and impartiality standards for military courts: the
   exclusion of civilians from the jurisdictional scope of military
   justice, the subject matter jurisdiction's restrictions and the
   determination of independence and impartiality guarantees in the
   military sphere.},

Booktitle = {KOREA 2011: POLITICS, ECONOMY AND SOCIETY},
Series = {Korea Yearbook},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {5},
Pages = {147-174},
Abstract = {South Korean outward FDIs have registered a strong increase since 2002,
   with significant growth in investments in developing countries as well
   as in Asia and North America, targeting energy and raw materials. South
   Korean companies face strong competition from Chinese, Japanese and even
   Indian corporations in the search for resources. This study aims to
   examine the modalities of Korean penetration in the raw material
   overseas markets and to analyse the key features of the South Korean
   approach compared to Chinese, Indian and Japanese competitors. Koreans
   are known to employ a generally successful strategy in their
   acquisitions abroad, while putting in place one of the most
   comprehensive policies to secure strategic materials. It is possible to
   identify some key factors of this success, some linked internally to the
   economic and political choices of the South Korean government, some
   external. The analysis of a recent deal in a series of Korean successes,
   a lithium-exploitation agreement with the Bolivians, is proposed as a
   case study. Finally, the article will present the dangers and
   opportunities ahead for South Korea, and, in general, coming
   geopolitical challenges in the resource acquisition business.},

Pages = {268-290},
Abstract = {This article examines how Chinese newspapers respond to opposing demands
   by audiences and Propaganda Department authorities about news regarding
   the United States when competition poses pressure on marketized media to
   make a profit. To examine the tone of news reporting about the U. S., I
   rely on a computer-aided text analysis of news stories published in the
   People's Daily and the Beijing Evening News, comparing the years 1999
   and 2003 before and after the rise of commercialized newspapers in the
   Beijing newspaper market. Results show that the emergence of news
   competitors may exert pressure on less marketized papers to change news
   content, resulting in an increase of negative news about the United
   States. Evidence is provided to show that the rise of negative news is
   unlikely to result from an intended strategy by Propaganda authorities,
   actions undertaken by the American government, or journalists' own
   attitudes.},

Abstract = {Africa has a wide array of polities that are characterized by extremely
   diverging leadership styles. How can the same continent house a Mugabe
   and a Bokassa, but also a Nyerere and a Mandela? Based on the Bourdieu
   notion of types of capital as the basis for inequality in society, this
   study sketches the cultural models that underlie African variations in
   power configurations that are set in a model founded on three power
   bases: Symbols, economics and social relations. From there, it
   formulates six basic types of power in Africa: The `icon', the
   `elephant', the `executive', the `pater familias', the `lion' and the
   `patron'. Polities and politicians move through these models in the
   course of their lives, which gives the model its dynamics. Finally, the
   six types show four major commonalities that inform African cultural
   thinking about power: power as a personal attribute; the use of the
   kinship discourse with all its ramifications in politics; the link with
   the spiritual world; and neo-patrimonialism and exploitation. In
   combination, they provide a portrait of African power relations where
   the major characteristic is the ready translation of the three capitals
   into each other.},

Title = {The Supreme Court's Shrinking Election Law Docket, 2001-2010: A Legacy
   of Bush v. Gore or Fear of the Roberts Court?},
Journal = {ELECTION LAW JOURNAL},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {10},
Number = {4},
Pages = {325-333},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This article describes the drop in Supreme Court election law cases in
   the first decade of the twenty-first century, and offers at least a
   partial explanation as to the reasons for the drop. Although the general
   amount of election law litigation has risen dramatically since 2000, the
   number of cases in which parties sought Supreme Court review declined by
   more than 36 percent from the 1991-2000 decade compared to the 2001-2010
   decade. Factoring that decline into account, the data show that the
   Court issued written opinions in nearly the same percentage of election
   law cases each decade in which parties sought Supreme Court
   review-11.9\% of cases in the 1991-2000 decade, and 10.5\% of cases in
   2001-2010. While I cannot exclude the possibility that the Court shied
   away from hearing some election law cases out of Bush v. Gore fatigue or
   as the result of random noise, the drop in the number of election law
   cases in which litigants sought Supreme Court review cases seems to
   explain a great deal of the decline. This article concludes by
   considering why the number of cases in which litigants sought Supreme
   Court review dropped so precipitously in 2001-2010 even as the total
   number of election law cases in the lower courts increased dramatically.
   One reason is that liberal litigants who had sought review especially in
   voting rights cases in the 1990-2000 period were less willing to do so
   in the 2001-2010 period, likely because they expected unfavorable
   results before the more conservative Roberts Court. The 2005-2010 period
   is especially important; the number of election law petitions in the
   Supreme Court dropped precipitously after Justice Alito joined the
   Court.},

Abstract = {This study presents a simple empirical framework suitable for describing
   individuals' subjective evaluations of wage inequality and their
   normative assessment of market justice. The framework is illustrated
   using survey data from the International Social Survey Program from
   Switzerland. Although most individuals accept the fact that there are
   quite large pay differentials across different occupations, they would
   still prefer a more equal distribution of market wages. The empirical
   analysis further shows that financial self-interest, normative beliefs,
   and perceptions of how wages are determined all have an impact on the
   assessment of market justice. Finally, subjective inequality measures
   and the assessment of market justice turn out to be substantive
   predictors of individuals' general support for the welfare state and
   their party identification. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A model developed in this paper shows a mechanism for inducing
   self-sacrificing contributions among members of closely knit
   organizations, such as cults, terrorist groups and military forces.
   Members are assumed to gain utility from social cohesion and their
   in-group reputations. When social cohesion strengthens, members ascribe
   more importance to their reputations. This prompts them to increase
   their contributions to group goals, which causes social cohesion to
   strengthen further. The model identifies three ways for leaders to
   initiate this multiplier process: increasing their own contribution,
   putting effort into indoctrinating members, and raising the obstacles
   that members face when they contribute.},

Abstract = {Immigration has various economic and non-economic effects on the
   destination country's inhabitants. In this paper, we focus on the impact
   of immigration on factor returns and analyze how aging affects
   immigration policy, employing a dynamic political-economy model of
   representative democracy. Aging, that is, a decline in the growth rate
   of the native population, has an expansionary effect on immigration in
   this framework. This immigration effect may even overcompensate the
   initial contraction of the labor force. We show that the immigration
   rate in the representative democracy equilibrium exceeds the immigration
   rate that would maximize welfare of current and future generations, and
   we also discuss the influence of social security on immigration policy.},

Abstract = {Recent empirical work has shown that trust plays an important role in
   economic development. In this paper, we delve deeper into the mechanism
   behind that relationship. Specifically, we investigate the effect of
   trust on human and physical capital while controlling for the fact that
   the two types of capital are simultaneously determined. In a sample of
   50 countries from 1976 to 2005, we show that trust has a positive and
   significant effect on human capital and a non-linear effect on physical
   capital. Increasing trust in a low-trust country has a greater impact on
   the accumulation of physical capital than an identical increase in trust
   in a high-trust country. We go on to investigate the interaction between
   institutions and trust and find that institutional reform is less
   effective at promoting investment in countries with high levels of
   trust. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the effects of globalization on social protection
   expenditures in European countries. The particular focus is on (a) the
   Eastern European countries and (b) on differences in globalization
   effects between welfare regimes. We find evidence in favor of the
   compensation hypothesis inWestern Europe which is driven by the
   conservative welfare regime, outweighing the efficiency effect of
   globalization in the social-democratic welfare regime. In Eastern
   European countries the efficiency effect is predominant. No
   globalization effect is found for the liberal and the southern welfare
   regimes.},

Abstract = {Immigration and settler literatures provide contrasting approaches to
   the evaluation of conflict between `newcomers' and `indigenous' groups.
   On the one hand, immigration studies emphasize that newcomers,
   particularly migrants, almost never fight civil wars; on the other hand,
   studies on settlers in contested territories expect inherently unstable
   relations between settlers and native populations affected by
   colonization projects. While each provides strong evidence to support
   its argument, neither literature has adequately accounted for hybrid
   cases where the settler and migrant categories have become almost
   indistinguishable. The article focuses on Cyprus as a paradigmatic such
   case. Specifically, it looks at populations transferred from Turkey to
   the northern part of the island after 1974 described either as settlers
   or immigrants by rival accounts in the Cypriot conflict. While
   colonization constitutes a violation of international conventions and a
   major obstacle to peace, settlers in such places as Cyprus, Tibet or
   Western Sahara often meet the profile of migrant populations more
   interested in daily survival issues than in territorial politics. In
   contrast to other historical or contemporary cases of settler
   colonialism such as Algeria (France) or West Bank and Gaza (Israel),
   what is particularly puzzling in Cyprus and elsewhere is the absence of
   mobilization and politicization among settlers despite perceived
   discrimination and fear of relocation following a negotiated peace
   agreement. Addressing this puzzle is essential to bridging the gaps
   between immigration and settler literatures and in mediating the
   tensions between conflicting claims over space, land and the political
   geography of peace settlements in deeply divided societies. (C) 2011

Abstract = {William Stanley Jevons suggested that monetary exchange is socially
   superior to barter exchange because agents' optimization is simplified
   by the use of money. We experimentally study how subjects perform under
   monetary and barter exchange and find that a majority of subjects
   achieve a higher utility level in the monetized economy. The individual
   choices are statistically analyzed in order to track important elements
   of suboptimal decision making like the tendency to under- or over-react
   to price signals. Our laboratory findings indicate that, at a minimum,
   government may have a role in promoting a common unit of account.},

Abstract = {Are the rights, duties, and virtues of citizenship grounded exclusively
   in considerations of justice, or do some or all of them have other
   sources? This question is addressed by distinguishing three different
   accounts of the justification of these rights, duties, and virtues,
   namely, the justice account, the common-good account, and the
   equal-membership account. The common-good account is rejected on the
   grounds that it provides an implausible way of understanding what it is
   to act as a citizen. It is then argued that the justice account and the
   equal-membership account provide complementary perspectives that differ
   in terms of the scope of the duties they ground: the latter offers an
   analysis of the duties that citizens proper (those with an unconditional
   right of residence and full political rights) owe to each other, whereas
   the former provides an analysis of the duties that those who are under
   the jurisdiction of the same state, whether fellow citizens or not, owe
   to each other. The article concludes by arguing that the distinction
   between the justice account and the equal-membership account cuts across
   the traditional one that is drawn between liberal and republican
   theories of citizenship.},

Abstract = {In this analysis, we expand the debate on the place of religion in
   political science by using the predictions of Wald and Wilcox as our
   starting point. Following in their footsteps, we ask how political
   scientists have studied Islam since 2002 and identify the studies on
   Islam and Muslims at the flagship conference of the discipline, the
   annual meeting of the American Political Science Association. We
   evaluate not only the quantity but also the approaches employed by these
   studies. In order to gauge the balancing of roles (or lack thereof)
   between the discipline and area studies, we also take a closer look at
   the Middle East Studies Association, the largest association focused on
   the Middle East, North Africa and the Islamic world and its annual
   meetings during the same period. Our findings suggest that, unless
   carefully addressed, the prevailing patterns are likely to result in a
   crippling knowledge gap among political scientists.},

Abstract = {This article studies the trajectories of the officers defeated at the
   battle of Ayacucho who upon their return to Spain had prominent
   political careers. It follows them before, during and after the Wars of
   Independence in the Andes in an attempt to discern a certain pattern of
   relationship between Europe and America during the crucial decade of the
   1820s, and beyond. It enquires on the far-reaching consequences of
   prolonged mobilization on both sides of the Atlantic, and the degree to
   which the histories of Europe and America were intertwined during this
   period. The disintegration of empire and the reactions to the Cadiz
   Constitution led to similar situations with confrontations between
   liberals, radicals and conservatives as well as the military irrupting
   onto the political world. It became possible, both in Spain and America,
   for capable and ambitious men of humble origins to reach the highest
   echelons of power.},

Abstract = {I evaluate the `Securing the Base' strategy, which prescribes that
   candidates position themselves away from the political center in order
   to maximize turnout among their supporters and reduce defections of
   their supporters to third party candidates. My results support the
   notion that voters abstain due to indifference and imply that candidate
   positioning has a large effect on voter turnout and third party voting.
   Nonetheless, my results indicate that the candidates can best compete by
   adopting centrist positions. While a candidate can increase turnout
   among his supporters by moving away from the center, many moderate
   voters will defect to his opponent.},

Abstract = {The article argues that the secular Indian state and the Hindu
   nationalist movement are invested in restricting changes in religious
   membership in ways that intensify religious and caste-based
   inequalities. The secular state and the Hindu nationalist movement
   attempt to enforce a shared model of religion that takes the form of a
   fixed territory. In this model, changes in religious membership through
   conversion are restricted. An analysis of state-civil society
   interactions in India must therefore move away from a presumed
   opposition between state secularism on the one hand and religious
   nationalism and conflict within civil society on the other. The article
   draws on three cases: (1) nationalist debates over caste and religious
   conversion, (2) Hindu nationalist mobilization against religious
   conversion, and (3) state caste-based affirmative action policies that
   restrict benefits based on religious conversion.},

Title = {British Opinion and Russian Terrorism in the 1880s},
Journal = {EUROPEAN HISTORY QUARTERLY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {41},
Number = {2},
Pages = {255-277},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The sinister figure of the Russian revolutionary was well established in
   the British mind by the early 1870s, whilst the terrorist campaign
   pursued by the People's Will during the period 1878-1881 entrenched the
   stereotype still further. At the same time, however, the long-standing
   Russophobic motifs in British political culture helped to foster a
   degree of sympathy for the Russian terrorists as fighters against
   tsarist oppression. The first part of this article examines the reports
   carried in British newspapers during these years, arguing that although
   they generally condemned `terrorism' in Russia, there was also a
   widespread sense that the upsurge in violence was at least in part a
   consequence of the Russian government's refusal to embrace reform.
   Whilst the periodic eruption of `Fenian' bombs created something of a
   moral panic about terrorism, most commentators believed that the use of
   violence to bring about change in an autocratic political system was
   qualitatively different from resorting to terror in a constitutional
   system where other avenues for non-violent change were available. The
   second part of the article examines the reception of the books and
   articles of Sergei Kravchinskii (Stepniak), a former member of People's
   Will, who arrived in Britain in 1884. Stepniak made a concerted attempt
   to persuade his readership of the iniquities of the tsarist regime. He
   also argued that the use of terror was a natural response to the
   existence of despotic rule. Stepniak was generally successful at
   presenting himself as a representative of a national liberation
   movement, committed to promoting the cause of freedom, establishing in
   the process a good deal of support for his views amongst a section of
   British public opinion.},

Abstract = {This article challenges the common idea of Italy's obsession with
   Italian music, and with Verdi in particular, an image which supports
   stereotypes of Italians as narrowly focused on their own national
   culture, mentally sealed off from what is happening outside the
   peninsula. Starting from an analysis of the frequently rather mixed or
   even negative reception of Verdi's music in Italy, the article outlines
   the general crisis which affected Italian opera after Unification. One
   of the responses to this crisis was a remarkable internationalization of
   the repertoire on the Italian stages. Taking music and opera as an
   example, the article demonstrates the extent to which Italy articulated
   its experience of modernity and nation building through a transnational
   exchange of ideas and a generous reception of European culture.},

Abstract = {The Muhammad cartoon crisis in 2005 provides an illustrative example of
   how crises travel across geographical boundaries, in this case, from a
   national newspaper into a full-fledged public diplomacy crisis at the
   international level. From a crisis management perspective, a multilevel
   setting poses a real challenge to actors trying to contain the situation
   at hand. Likewise, the multilevel nature of a crisis poses a challenge
   to crisis communication theories, which have traditionally focused on
   rhetorical strategies in single organizational crises. As a response,
   this article proposes a framework for examining crisis communication
   based on how actors' framing impact the perceptions of arenas,
   stakeholders, and communication strategies.},

Abstract = {Objective
   Few social scientists have examined how Internet usage, including using
   the Internet for health purposes, may affect mental health. This study
   assesses whether the type or amount of online health activities and the
   timing of Internet use are associated with psychological distress.
   Methods
   We use data from the National Cancer Institute's 2005 Health Information
   National Trends Survey.
   Results
   When we compare Internet users to non-Internet users, using the Internet
   and using the Internet for health purposes are negatively associated
   with distress. However, among Internet users, the number of online
   health activities is positively associated with distress. Greater
   distress is also associated with using the Internet on weekdays and
   looking online for information on sun protection.
   Conclusions
   Internet usage is not necessarily positively associated with
   psychological distress. The effects depend on the type, amount, and
   timing of Internet usage.},

Abstract = {In 1916 the Dardanelles Royal Commission was convened to investigate the
   circumstances surrounding the Dardanelles naval fiasco of the previous
   year. Lords Fisher and Kitchener, former heads of the Royal Navy and
   British Army respectively, were ultimately found to have been culpable,
   in having failed to adequately warn the Cabinet War Council of the
   dangers implicit within the naval operation. Winston Churchill, the
   political head of the Royal Navy was also admonished, though to a lesser
   degree. It is the contention of this paper that the findings of the
   Dardanelles Commission were seriously flawed and that Fisher and
   Kitchener were unjustly castigated, as convenient scapegoats. This
   proposition will be tested against all of the relevant evidence
   available, including hitherto-neglected primary sources, in order to
   determine who in fact was responsible for that disaster.},

Abstract = {There is a rich political science literature on the relationship between
   election administration and voter turnout but it is largely based on
   studies of U.S. elections. Innovations with election administration by
   the United Kingdom's New Labour government allow researchers to see
   whether U.S. findings travel. These short-term experiments and permanent
   reforms have been criticized for encouraging electoral fraud and
   undermining confidence in the democratic process (Wilks-Heeg, 2009);
   being led by motivations of party statecraft (James, 2010a); or being a
   false substitute for real democratic reform (Hay and Stoker, 2009: 226).
   There is much to these claims, and drawing lessons from the pilots is
   difficult because of poor experimental design. However, the innovations
   suggest that election administration can affect U.K. turnout. The
   effects of all-postal and individual registration appear to be
   particularly significant. Election administration is therefore an
   overlooked variable in non-U.S. literatures on electoral participation
   and is worthy of further investigation by researchers and policymakers.},

Abstract = {Although Chilean municipalities are not permitted to borrow, they do so
   through arrears and leasing contracts. A formal model of municipal
   indebtedness is estimated, based on a sample of 345 municipalities with
   yearly data from 2004 to 2007. Variables that are positively and
   significantly related to borrowing through arrears are: mayors closely
   tied to the ruling central government coalition; politically diverse
   municipal councils; years close to elections; and deeper municipal
   involvement in education. While leasing contracts appear to be
   insensitive to political factors, they are positively and significantly
   related to municipal staff managerial skills and municipal revenues per
   capita.},

Title = {Pulling Toward or Pulling Away: Deliberation, Disagreement, and Opinion
   Extremity in Political Participation},
Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {92},
Number = {1},
Pages = {206-225},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Objective
   Evidence supports two somewhat contradictory notions: deliberation is to
   encourage engagement, but disagreement may decrease participation. This
   study aims to provide a common denominator in the debate. It
   distinguishes between deliberation and political disagreement that
   emerges during deliberation to test which factors advance or thwart
   participatory goals. This study also accounts for opinion extremity,
   which may moderate the tested relationships.
   Methods
   This study draws on quasi-experimental data from participants in
   structured, moderated, and heterogeneous face-to-face deliberations on
   sexual minority rights in Poland (N=181).
   Results
   Relative to the pretest, deliberation discouraged moderates from active
   engagement and pulled them away from communicative participation. As
   predicted, extreme participants who perceived high disagreement intended
   to be more active than their counterparts in like-minded groups.
   Conclusions
   Research on deliberative versus participatory democracy should
   differentiate between deliberation and political disagreement as well as
   account for individual characteristics that affect responses to
   deliberation and disagreement. Theoretical and practical implications
   are discussed.},

Title = {Extracting sovereignty: Capital, territory, and gold mining in Tanzania},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {30},
Number = {2},
Pages = {70-79},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In contemporary discussions of ``resource nationalism,{''} sovereignty
   is often imagined as the exclusive control of national states over
   internal resources in opposition to external foreign capital. In this
   paper, we seek to draw attention to the specifically national
   territorial forms of sovereignty that rather than hindering the flow of
   capital become constitutive to the accumulation of resource wealth by
   states and capital alike. Drawing from political geographical
   theorizations of sovereignty, we argue that resource sovereignty cannot
   be territorially circumscribed within national space and institutionally
   circumscribed within the state apparatus. Rather, sovereignty must be
   understood in relational terms to take into account the global geography
   of non-state actors that shape access to and control over natural
   resources. Specifically, we engage national-scale state sovereignty over
   subterranean mineral resources in the form of legal property regimes and
   examine the mutually constitutive set of interdependencies between
   mining capital and landlord states in the accumulation of resource
   wealth. Using Tanzania as a case study, we argue that national-scale
   ownership of subterranean mineral resources has been critical to
   attracting global flows of mining capital from colonial to contemporary
   times. We first examine the history of the colonial state in Tanganyika
   to illustrate how land and mineral rights were adjudicated through the
   power of the colonial state with the hopes of attracting foreign capital
   investment in the mining sector. We then examine contemporary efforts on

Abstract = {The political theorist Michael Walzer has usually been taken as an
   opponent of global distributive justice, on the basis that it is
   incompatible with collective autonomy, would endanger cultural
   diversity, or simply on the basis that principles of global distributive
   justice cannot be coherently envisaged, given cross-cultural
   disagreement about the nature and value of the social goods that might
   be distributed. However in his recent work, Walzer demonstrates a
   surprising degree of sympathy for the claims of global distributive
   justice, even of the egalitarian variety. But the precise contours of
   his current position on global equality are not yet clearly developed.
   The paper, therefore, attempts to reconstruct what that position might
   be, paying particular attention to the conclusions we could draw firstly
   for our understanding of the opposition between global equality and
   national self-determination (which is more complex than has sometimes
   been thought), and secondly for the relationship between global equality
   and shared understandings.},

Abstract = {Marc Sangnier (1873-1950) was the instigator of a series of
   International Democratic Peace Congresses in the 1920s and 1930s. A
   veteran of the First World War, he ardently wished to `disarm hatred'.
   Drawing on his pre-war experience as leader of the Christian Democratic
   youth movement, the Sillon, he launched a non-governmental movement
   aimed at youth for the advancement of Franco-German understanding. The
   Ruhr occupation, undertaken due to war reparations disputes, made the
   Freiburg Congress of August 1923 particularly audacious as Sangnier and
   a portion of the French left embraced a non-militarist Germany even if
   political divisions intruded. Sangnier clashed with Prime Minister
   Poincare in parliament and withstood the physical violence of the
   nationalist right on the street for his daring. The advent of Locarno
   diplomacy and detente from 1925 turned Sangnier's movement from being
   marginal to an important vehicle for promoting rapprochement, recognized
   as such by Foreign Minister Aristide Briand, himself the symbol of
   pacifist hopes.},

   of this study is to examine instances of humour in the discourse of
   politicians during a period of social turmoil in Greece. The analysis
   confirms the impact of humorous contributions, as well as other forms of
   linguistic creativity, in constructing, and resisting the construction
   of, damaging political identities in the discourse of political
   opponents. It also confirms the symbiotic relations among politics and
   media, via the formation of dialogical networks, which are shown to
   contribute to the blurring of ideological boundaries and identities in
   politics.},

Abstract = {We analyze the extent of the integrated state control over the
   privatized companies in the Czech Republic during the decade of
   1995-2005. During this period, the integrated potential of the state to
   control companies had a pyramid-like form. Even though the pyramid
   control was not fully utilized, the state owned the golden shares that
   significantly improved state ability to control companies. Our findings
   suggest that state control in the period under research is correlated
   with decreasing, or even negative performance of companies. The
   efficiency of the state-owned companies was much lower than that of the
   privately owned. The inability of state agencies to cooperate and
   inefficient state administration are the most probable explanations
   behind our findings.},

   Our results show that growth accelerations are preceded by economic
   liberalizations. We also find that growth accelerations are less likely

   autocracy-has been in place, while (a move toward) more democracy
   according to the Polity IV dataset reduces the likelihood of growth
   accelerations.},

Abstract = {This study focuses on the function of humour in a postmodern performance
   which explored Stalinism as a paradigm of power politics and suggested
   that Stalinism is comparable to Modern Greek theatre. The performance
   suggests that non-conformist art can be denied acceptance and/or success
   and that both Stalinism and Modern Greek theatre are powerful enough to
   curb non-conformist artists. This analogy creates a special form of
   political humour which targets both Stalinism and the Greek theatre, and
   reveals the Stalinist practices followed in the latter. The study
   applies a semiotic approach to the analysis of performance and argues
   that humour, irony, and parody in the production are activated through
   the complex interaction of verbal, visual, musical, paralinguistic, and
   intersemiotic signs and codes.},

Title = {A Matter of Context: A Comparative Study of Media Environments and News
   Consumption Gaps in Europe},
Journal = {POLITICAL COMMUNICATION},

Pages = {110-134},
Abstract = {Research has shown that individual-level characteristics such as
   socioeconomic status and political interest are becoming more important
   as predictors of news consumption in a rapidly changing media
   environment. Despite this general trend, this article argues that the
   importance of individual-level predictors of news consumption varies
   between national media environments. We use extensive survey data from
   16 European countries and multilevel modeling in order to investigate
   both contextual-level and cross-level effects on news consumption. The
   results show that media environment characteristics have additional
   effects on news consumption beyond the effects of individual-level
   characteristics such as education and political interest, but also
   moderating impacts on these individual-level predictors of news
   consumption. More specifically, national media environments
   characterized by higher levels of newspaper-centrism are related to
   smaller gaps in newspaper reading between those with high and low levels
   of education and political interest. Lower degrees of newspaper-centrism
   are, on the other hand, related to a weaker ``lower-class bias{''} of
   television news and larger gaps in news consumption between those with
   and without high political interest. These findings are discussed in
   light of previous research on news consumption, knowledge, and
   participation gaps as well as cross-national comparative research.},

Abstract = {This article frames and describes a novel method of political party
   positioning within the European Union and beyond. The EU Profiler
   project, a large-scale, interdisciplinary, and pan-European research
   endeavor, takes a step beyond the conventional approaches by including
   party self-positioning and by using internet-based information
   technology to offer full documentation of the positions that are
   identified. In addition to conventional expert coding, some 270
   political parties in Europe have been invited to place themselves on 30
   issue dimensions. Where it proved possible, each coded position for each
   party is then fully documented with extracts from party manifestos,
   party leaders' speeches, or relevant press or policy statements. The
   resulting data offer unique opportunities for comparing the accuracy and
   efficiency among party positioning techniques, and explore for the first
   time and in a systematic way the auto-positioning of political parties
   throughout Europe.},
