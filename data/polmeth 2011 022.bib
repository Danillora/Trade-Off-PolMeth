Abstract = {In this contribution, we use a governance lens to assess the
   possibilities for political participation of non-governmental
   organizations (NGOs) in the European Common Foreign and Security Policy
   (CFSP). We illustrate their engagement in the case of the European Code
   of Conduct/Common Position on Arms Export. We show that, while processes
   related to the emergence of the Code fit the description of
   intergovernmental approaches, developments since then, however, more
   closely resemble governance. With the growing institutionalization of
   the CFSP in general, and that related to the Code in particular, access
   points for NGOs became increasingly available. Through information and
   symbolic politics as well as rhetorical entrapment, civil society
   organizations contributed not only to the tightening and widening of the
   Code's provisions, but also to the increasing willingness of governments
   to provide information to each other as well as their own publics about
   arms exports.},

Abstract = {As with the rest of the world, Belarus has been affected by the global
   economic crisis. However, the main consequences for the country were
   less economic, but rather political in nature. Although closely
   connected with Russia, it was not the spillover of the crisis, such as
   the reduction in its hitherto `miraculous' levels of economic growth to
   almost nothing in one year, that hit Belarus hard. Instead, it was
   Russia's deliberate politics of `pragmatization', directed at its `near
   abroad' to facilitate compliance of and interdependence with its
   neighbours, which dramatically altered Belarus's foreign policy
   landscape. The two principal corollaries of the global crisis for
   Belarus therefore included the new and irreversible search (successful
   or otherwise) for diversification away from Russia, and the
   reinvigorated sense of sovereignty with which Belarus now attempts to
   rebuild itself domestically and internationally.},

Journal = {STUDIES IN CONFLICT \& TERRORISM},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {34},
Number = {6},
Pages = {476-500},
Abstract = {This article attempts to fulfill a lacuna in the literature on terrorism
   by providing a systematic response to the widespread criticism of the
   concept of onew terrorism.o According to this conceptualization, the
   onew terrorismo is characterized by religious motivation, networked
   organizational structures, tendency to launch mass casualty attacks and
   possible use of weapons of mass destruction. This conceptualization is
   criticized by scholars who argue that religiously motivated terrorism
   has always existed; that increased frequency of mass casualty attacks is
   due to other factors; that traditional terrorists were also
   indiscriminate in their targeting; and that there is nothing new about
   terrorist attempts to use WMDs or horizontal terrorist networks. These
   critics are not convincing on three counts: they adopt a rudimentary
   notion of onewo which is hardly appropriate for detecting or
   understanding social change; they employ inappropriate categories and
   labels, which make it impossible to distinguish the characteristic
   features of new terrorism from those of the old; and several critics
   create a straw man version of the onew terrorismo argument by resorting
   to reductionist interpretations. The article points out that the
   contemporary terrorism is not only religious, but is also characterized
   by the absence of several ideological and political imperatives for
   centralized and hierarchical organizational structures and for using
   discriminate violence that characterized left wing and ethno-nationalist
   terrorism of the past. The critics also ignore the fact that there is a
   declared intention on the part of new terrorists to organize
   horizontally through networks and to kill indiscriminately among
   civilians.},

Abstract = {The differential participation of the post-communist countries in the
   world economy both conditions and mediates the effects of shocks from
   the world system. Major differences exist between leading European
   members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) (Russia, Belarus
   and Ukraine) and the post-communist New Member States (NMS) of the
   European Union. In responding to the financial and economic crisis of
   2007 onwards, countries of the CIS were relatively less dependent on,
   and less integrated into, the world financial system than the NMS;
   consequently, direct contagion from the world financial crisis, although
   significant, had less impact on them compared with the NMS. While
   Russia, Belarus and Ukraine share some economic and structural features,
   they also have important differences. Economic crises were results of
   transformation trajectories as well as of financial contagion from the
   West. Future economic scenarios for Russia. Belarus and Ukraine involve
   not only exchange with the world system, but greater domestic
   development and participation in semi-autonomous economic blocs,
   including the wider CIS.},

Title = {Regulatory networks and regulatory agencification: towards a Single
   European Regulatory Space},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {18},
Number = {6, SI},
Pages = {810-829},
Abstract = {The European regulatory space has been expanding rapidly since the
   1990s. The double movement towards a single market on the one hand and a
   Single European Regulatory Space on the other is evident almost
   everywhere. A new regulatory architecture is emerging and is expressed
   in the extension of regulatory capacities beyond the European Commission
   via two major forms of institutionalization: agencies and networks. This
   paper explores the politics and architecture of the institutionalization
   and administrative rationalization of the EU regulatory space and
   demonstrates (a) how agencies replace networks in a process that might
   best be called `agencification'; (b) how agencies compete with networks
   and are often able to create, employ, and control them, creating what
   might best be called `agencified networks'; and (c) how networking
   empowers agencies creating a new type of regulatory organization that
   might best be called a `networked agency'.},

Title = {Promoting corporate diversity in the financial services sector},
Journal = {POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {32},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {309-323},
Abstract = {This article sets out a detailed and realistic strategy for achieving
   the diversity in financial services to which the UK Government's
   Coalition Agreement is committed. Diversity of ownership types and
   business models creates a corresponding diversity in forms of corporate
   governance; risk appetite and management; incentive structures; policies
   and practices; and behaviours and outcomes. It also offers wider choice
   for consumers through enhanced competition that derives in part from the
   juxtaposition of different business models. However, the UK financial
   services sector is dominated disproportionately by a single business
   model, namely the large, shareholder-owned plc. This domination of the
   shareholder ownership model - whose purpose is to maximise financial
   returns to the shareholders - proved a lethal combination with the
   financial deregulation, the creation of new financial instruments and
   the concomitant rising levels of debt over the past 20 years. In a
   situation of uncertainty and unpredictability, we cannot know which
   model will prove to be superior in all possible future circumstances, so
   we ought to be rather cautious before destroying any successful model.
   The global economy is a complex system, and an important point about
   complexity is that many complex systems are intrinsically unpredictable,
   even if we know everything else about them. Thus, the problem is not
   just that the economic future is uncertain, but that it is fundamentally
   unpredictable.},

Abstract = {This article critically assesses the debate surrounding Juan Linz's
   famous depiction of the Franco regime as an example and point of
   departure for conceptualising authoritarianism as a distinct type of

   objection to his use of an abstract ideal-typical framework; (2) the
   objection to his depiction of the absence of ideology; (3) the objection
   to his account of the sources of apathy and forms of social control; (4)
   the objection to his description of the form and extent of the regime's
   limited pluralism; (5) the objection based on the allegedly legitimating
   function of his description; and (6) the objection to his account of the
   rule of law in the regime.},

Abstract = {Americans are a major target of international terrorism. Yet, terrorists
   from some countries are much more likely to attack American citizens
   than terrorists from other countries. Similarly, anti-American terrorism
   from a specific foreign country is much more prevalent during certain
   periods than others. This article develops a rational theory of
   international terrorism, which argues that attacking foreign nationals
   is of strategic value to terrorists even if they ultimately aim at
   gaining political influence in their home country. Attacking foreigners
   is the more attractive to domestic terrorists the more the terrorists'
   home government depends on military support from the foreign country.
   Applied to the US case, our theory predicts that more anti-American
   terrorism emanates from countries that receive more US military aid and
   arms transfers and in which more American military personnel are
   stationed, all relative to the country's own military capacity.
   Estimations from a directed country dyad sample over the period 1978 to
   2005 support the predictions of our theory for both terrorist incidents
   involving Americans and terrorist killings of Americans as dependent
   variables. These results are robust to a wide range of changes to the
   empirical research design.},

   Rights and the Right to Health},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {10},
Number = {3},
Pages = {339-357},
Abstract = {Though few would argue against the right to health care on moral
   grounds, we argue that the greater problem has been over the feasibility
   of such an idea, especially where the ``right to health{''} has never
   been clearly defined. We discuss a range of problems in balancing the
   two values: the right of a creator to protect their intellectual
   property and the right of everyone to enjoy the highest attainable
   standard of health care. We argue that to strike a balance between these
   important values, all countries must work to develop policies that take
   into account the basic health and developmental interests of developing
   countries. We also argue that important changes must be made to the
   current IPR system, especially with respect to the production and
   pricing of basic goods and services needed to fulfill health subsistence
   rights. These changes must include allowing developing countries access
   to essential medicines that support the realization of basic health,
   welfare, and economic development. We examine an alternative patent
   compensation system that Pogge (2005a) has proposed. While we highlight
   the important aspects of this plan, we also argue that Pogge's scheme
   falls short in that it does not provide enough incentive to break the
   short-term profit perspective that corporations possess. We propose two
   amendments to address this issue in Pogge's scheme. We further argue
   that we need to replace the dominant state-centric paradigm that views
   the right to health care in strictly nationalistic terms (as simply
   problems of the state) with a more cosmopolitan paradigm that reflects
   the true nature of the relationship between IPR and human rights as a
   ``global public good.{''}},

Title = {Public Service Ethos: Developing a Generic Measure},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION RESEARCH AND THEORY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Pages = {27-51},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This article conceptualizes public service ethos as a multidimensional
   construct and develops a framework that explains first, why individuals
   are motivated by this ethos (Public Service Belief); second, how they
   deliver public services in accordance with this ethos (Public Service
   Practice); and third, what ends they perceive it to endorse (Public
   Interest). Despite considerable interest in public service ethos within
   the public administration literature, research is constrained by the
   absence of a measure of this ethos. This article therefore reports three
   studies conducted to advance theory and research through the development
   of a psychometrically sound instrument. Confirmatory factor analysis
   demonstrates support for a three-factor structure, where the dimensions
   are distinct but related aspects of public service ethos. Moreover,
   findings show this measure to be valid, reliable, and generalizable. As
   such it offers researchers an instrument with which to better explore
   the character and existence of a public service ethos.},

Abstract = {This article examines the persecution of Spanish Freemasonry under the
   Franco regime (1936-75). It emphasises the significance of the Francoist
   conviction that a `JudeoMasonic- Communist' conspiracy not only made the
   Civil War `inevitable' but also continued to threaten Spain after final
   victory in 1939. Thus in March 1940, Franco felt compelled to create a
   special repressive framework to fight Freemasonry in the `Law for the
   repression of Freemasonry and Communism'. This article demonstrates that
   despite its title, the law was primarily an anti-Masonic measure. It
   also shows that the persecution of Freemasons was not alleviated by
   Allied victory in the Second World War in 1945. Indeed, despite the
   abolition of the March 1940 law in 1963, the regime continued to fear
   the supposed dark powers of Freemasonry until Franco's death in November
   1975.},

   Tool},
Journal = {POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {39},
Number = {1},
Pages = {79-103},
Abstract = {An enduring challenge for the policy and political sciences is valid and
   reliable depiction of policy designs. One emerging approach for
   dissecting policy designs is the application of Sue Crawford and Elinor
   Ostrom's institutional grammar tool. The grammar tool offers a method to
   identify, systematically, the core elements that comprise policies,
   including target audiences, expected patterns of behavior, and formal
   modes of sanctioning for noncompliance. This article provides three
   contributions to the study of policy designs by developing and applying
   the institutional grammar tool. First, we provide revised guidelines for
   applying the institutional grammar tool to the study of policy design.
   Second, an additional component to the grammar, called the oBject, is
   introduced. Third, we apply the modified grammar tool to four policies
   that shape Colorado State Aquaculture to demonstrate its effectiveness
   and utility in illuminating institutional linkages across levels of
   analysis. The conclusion summarizes the contributions of the article as
   well as points to future research and applications of the institutional
   grammar tool.},

Abstract = {Israel's counter-terrorism policies have often aroused the anger of the
   Palestinians and the international community. One of the most
   controversial policies is the demolition and sealing of houses of
   families connected to a terrorist act. While there is significant media
   attention on this controversial policy, there have been very few
   academic studies examining the effectiveness of this policy. This
   article examines Israel's policy during the first Intifada (1987-1993),
   administered in accordance with section 119 (1) of the Defence Emergency
   Regulations of 1945 from the British Mandate government. Based on a
   carefully structured empirical analysis, the article concludes that the
   benefits of this policy do not outweigh the costs.},

Abstract = {Strengthening the budgetary powers of legislatures through nonpartisan
   budget offices adds to the capacity-building repertoire of development
   donors. Budget offices are supposed to provide legislatures with
   information and analysis independent from the executive. The United
   States Agency for International Development believes that strengthening
   the legislature's power of the purse improves governance. We highlight
   USAID-funded legislative strengthening projects implemented in Jordan,
   Kenya, Morocco, and Afghanistan to show how these budget offices
   function. There is a significant potential for these units to assist
   members of parliament in understanding the budget process, the broad
   fiscal challenges facing government, and expenditure control and
   budgetary trade-offs that affect present and future spending. These
   cases demonstrate the challenges of creating and sustaining a
   parliamentary budget office. Finally, in an effort to make budget
   offices effective and sustainable, we outline several key steps that we
   believe are important both for donors and the legislative bodies.},

Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-16},
Abstract = {This article examines the ways in which the European Employment Strategy
   seeks to govern and further improve the performance of British
   employment policies. It is argued that by creating an epistemological
   and normalizing space for the problematization and governing of
   unemployment in terms of activation, the European Employment Strategy
   contributes to the legitimation of British employment policies. By
   addressing unemployment as a problem of structural labor market
   barriers, missing incentives and inadequate employability, the European
   Employment Strategy serves to reinforce the British preference for
   tackling unemployment through a host of activation and training measures
   and seeking to get the unemployed into work as fast as possible. Other
   ways of problematizing and handling unemployment seem excluded by
   default.},

Volume = {27},
Number = {2},
Pages = {322-334},
Abstract = {Dmitrii Medvedev delivered his third presidential address to the Russian
   parliament in an atmosphere marked by widening fissures in the country's
   power structure and increasing calls for political reform. His public
   statements in recent months had led many to believe that he was prepared
   to stand again for the presidency, this time on a reformist platform,
   and that this speech would launch his campaign. His banal and
   conservative address deeply disappointed them. A close analysis of that
   address, however, shows that it is altogether congruent with Russian
   political discourse, and thus indeed signalled his bid for another term
   in office.},

Journal = {CRITICAL POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {5},
Number = {4},
Pages = {361-390},
Abstract = {In this article, we introduce an empirical case study of the German
   forest policy subsystem in order to understand how the concept of
   sustainable forest management has been discursively constructed,
   challenged, and changed over time. As a theoretical basis, we use an
   idea-based coalition approach, drawing on both the Advocacy Coalition
   Framework and Hajer's Argumentative Discourse Analysis. We show that
   rival coalitions that share a certain idea of forest management have
   dominated German forest policy for decades by employing different
   rhetorical and institutional strategies in order to incorporate their
   ideas into public policy institutions. Analyzing how the issue of
   climate change is discursively `digested' by the actor coalitions, we
   find that climate change has been incorporated into the political
   argumentation of both coalitions in a manner consistent with their
   existing main policy ideas. Moreover, the membership of the coalitions
   has remained stable. These findings allow for conclusions regarding both
   our theoretical approaches and the policy subsystem's ability to adapt
   forests to cope with climate change.},

Title = {The Effectiveness of International Environmental Regimes: Comparing and
   Contrasting Findings from Quantitative Research},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {13},
Number = {4},
Pages = {579-605},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This article uses quantitative methods to deepen and broaden our
   understanding of the factors that determine the effectiveness of
   international regimes. To do so, we compare and contrast the findings
   resulting from two major projects: the Oslo-Seattle Project and the
   International Regimes Database Project. The evidence from these projects
   sheds considerable light on the determinants of regime effectiveness in
   the environmental realm. Clearly, regimes do make a difference. By
   combining models and data from the two projects, we are able to move
   beyond this general proposition to explore the significance of a number
   individual determinants of effectiveness, including the distribution of
   power, the roles of pushers and laggards, the effects of decision rules,
   the depth and density of regime rules, and the extent of knowledge of
   the relevant problem. We show how important insights emerge not only
   from the use of statistical procedures to separate the effects of
   individual variables but also from the application of alternative
   techniques, such as Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA), designed to
   identify combinations of factors that operate together to determine the
   effectiveness of regimes. We use our results to identify a number of
   opportunities for additional research featuring quantitative analyses of
   regime effectiveness. Our goal is not to displace traditional
   qualitative methods in this field of study. Rather, we seek to sharpen a
   set of quantitative tools that can be joined together with the extensive
   body of qualitative studies of environmental regimes to strengthen our
   ability both to identify patterns in regime effectiveness and to explore
   the causal mechanisms that give rise to these patterns.},

Abstract = {With judges chosen, cases underway, and judgments rendered, the
   International Criminal Court has officially begun operations. As the
   Court has proceeded with its activities, its potential has become
   enhanced. The creation of the Court through the 1998 Rome Statute came
   through cooperation of an exceptionally broad coalition of NGOs with
   like-minded states. This article examines the historical background to
   the Court's establishment, exploring why seemingly favorable conditions
   after the World Wars failed to result in a permanent judicial
   institution. Even post-1948 genocides in Southeast Asia, Central Africa,
   and elsewhere did not lead to international steps. Unexpected events,
   including the end of the Cold War and special tribunals for the former
   Yugoslavia and Rwanda, reopened the possibility for action. Despite
   opposition from most Permanent Members of the Security Council, the
   Coalition for the International Criminal Court-the major focus of this
   study coordinated a network of citizen groups to exert pressure
   successfully. The 2010 Review Conference for the International Criminal
   Court reaffirmed the Court's basic directions, and broadened the areas
   over which it exercises powers of judgment. The 1998 ``miracle on the
   Tiber{''} and subsequent steps strengthening the Court thus call into
   question long-standing assumptions about the relative significance of
   states and civil society.},

Abstract = {The planning orientation and the entrepreneurial orientation are
   traditionally portrayed as opposites in analyses of local development.
   Based on a survey of developmental activities in Norwegian
   municipalities, the authors argue that municipal leaders apply planning
   tools also when engaged in local development projects. The mechanisms at
   work when planning practices and entrepreneurial-type actions intersect
   are analysed by case studies. There is no uniformity in the ways
   municipalities handle the planning-entrepreneurialism nexus; only in one
   instance a classical ``planning-first{''} case is found. A bottom-up
   approach, in which a multitude of initiatives elicits coordination by
   planning, seems to be a more apt description.},

Journal = {BUSINESS AND POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {13},
Number = {3, SI},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Exchange rates influence a country's trading capability, foreign
   reserves and competitiveness. Recently, the exchange rate between the
   Chinese RMB and the U.S. dollar has been a contentious issue in both the
   United States and China. In this paper, we conduct a historical review
   of how the United States deployed negotiation strategies with China on
   the exchange rate issue and consider the degree to which it follows
   theoretical expectations. We then analyze the changing nature of the
   factors which shape exchange rate negotiations between the two nations
   in projecting alternative scenarios for the future of conflict
   resolution between the U.S. and China on this issue. We predict that the
   U.S. is likely to continue alternating between competition and
   collaboration, a negotiation cycle influenced by U.S. domestic politics,
   and China is less likely to continue with accommodation and compromise.
   The sequencing and timing of each nation's negotiation strategy will
   lead to widely divergent consequences for the management of exchange
   rates and the world economy.},

Journal = {WORLD POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {63},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {The long-standing understanding of the British 1832 Reform Act as an
   elite response to a revolutionary threat has been given renewed
   prominence in recent work on the political economy of democratization.
   But earlier episodes of popular revolt in Britain led to elite unity
   rather than elite concessions. This article argues that the absence of
   effective elite closure against parliamentary reform in the early 1830s
   was the result of an extended process of state reform that had the
   effect of gradually reducing the capacity of the monarchy. This deprived
   the crown of patronage required for the construction of an antireform
   coalition, while also mollifying the reformers' fears that mass
   mobilization would invite repression and with it the recalibration of
   the constitution in favor of the monarchy. Therefore, while pressure
   from below was indeed critical to the passage of parliamentary reform,
   its contribution was mediated by institutional changes that, over time,
   weakened the sources of resistance to change and rendered reformist
   elites more amenable to the necessary reliance on the threat of force.
   This case study thus establishes that change at critical junctures can
   be subject to the influence of incremental institutional change
   occurring in relatively settled periods.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the effectiveness of transnational
   multi-stakeholder partnerships for sustainable development-also known as
   ``Type II outcomes{''} of the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable
   Development-in the sustainable energy sector. We combine quantitative
   and qualitative research. Quantitatively, we use a database of 340
   partnerships, including 46 partnerships that focus on energy. Our
   qualitative analysis includes case studies of five partnerships that
   appear as the most effective and five that are operational but only with
   modest degrees of effectiveness. We study two competing hypotheses. The
   first, rooted in institutionalism, assumes that variation in
   effectiveness is related to organizational structures and procedures.
   The competing hypothesis emphasizes the power of actors and expects
   partnerships that involve key business actors and powerful Northern
   states to perform better. We conclude that the level of
   institutionalization is most important in explaining effectiveness,
   while powerful partners and the type of internal organization may
   further enhance effectiveness.},

Abstract = {The revival of pragmatism has brought renewed enthusiasm for John
   Dewey's conception of democracy. Drawing upon Rawlsian concerns
   regarding the fact of reasonable pluralism, I argue that Deweyan
   democracy is unworthy of resurrection. A modified version of Deweyan
   democracy recently proposed by Elizabeth Anderson is then taken up and
   also found to be lacking. Then I propose a model of democracy that draws
   upon Peirce's social epistemology. The result is a non-Deweyan but

Title = {Motivated Closed-Mindedness Mediates the Effect of Threat on Political
   Conservatism},
Journal = {POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {32},
Number = {5},
Pages = {785-811},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In this article we synthesize theory and research from several areas of
   psychology and political science to propose and test a causal model of
   the effects of threat on political attitudes. Based in part on prior
   research showing that fear, threat, and anxiety decrease cognitive
   capacity and motivation, we hypothesize that under high (vs. low)
   threat, people will seek to curtail open-ended information searches and
   exhibit motivated closed-mindedness (one aspect of the need for
   cognitive closure). The subjective desire for certainty, control, and
   closure, in turn, is expected to increase the individual's affinity for
   political conservatism, insofar as resistance to change and adherence to
   authority figures and conventional forms of morality are assumed to
   satisfy these epistemic motives more successfully than their ideological
   opposites. Consistent with this account, we find in Studies 1a and 1b
   that putting people into a highly threatened mindset leads them to
   exhibit an increase in motivated closed-mindedness and to perceive the
   world as more dangerous. Furthermore, in Study 2 we demonstrate that a
   subtle threat manipulation increases self-reported conservatism (or
   decreases self-reported liberalism), and this effect is mediated by
   closed-mindedness. In Study 3, we manipulated closed-mindedness directly
   and found that high (vs. low) cognitive load results in a greater
   affinity for the Republican (vs. Democratic) party. Finally, in Study 4
   we conducted an experiment involving political elites in Iceland and
   found that three different types of threat (to the self, group, and
   system) all led center-right politicians to score higher on
   closed-mindedness and issue-based political conservatism. Implications
   for society and for the theory of ideology as motivated social cognition
   are discussed.},

Title = {National determinants of international preferences in post-communist

Abstract = {This paper shows that the dominant theory of European integration, the
   liberal inter-governmentalism, contains several assumptions about the
   process and character of national preference formation that may not be
   fully met in the post-communist EU member states. It argues that the
   primacy of economic and societal interests in influencing positions of
   national governments should not be taken for granted. Using Slovakia as
   an example, it demonstrates the autonomy of political and bureaucratic
   actors and importance of their preferences. It is also argued that
   ideational and exogenous factors should not be left out in constructing
   a realistic framework of national preference formation. (C) 2011

Abstract = {We design a real-time, intercultural common pool resource experiment
   using participants from cultures that derive different benefits from a
   global public good (extraction vs. conservation of biodiversity
   resources) to analyze the effect of group affiliation on cooperative
   behavior. We also collect survey attitudes toward conservation to
   augment our experimental results. We find that when participants
   interact interculturally, extraction choices change significantly and
   that these changes can be attributed to an amplification of the
   relationship between attitudes and choices cued by the intercultural

   Participation of Poles in Crimes against Jews in the Swietokrzyski{''}
   (Yad Vashem Studies, 2007, No 35). By the thorough analysis of the files
   of several dozen trials that had taken place in the courts of Kielce
   during the 1940s and 1950s, I am looking for the answers for the
   questions focused on such issues as specific and diverse circumstances
   in which the crimes emerged (direct reasons and situational conditions),
   perpetrators (their profile based on such criteria as position/function,
   age, marital status, education, financial and social status, etc.),
   witnesses (both of the defendant and the plaintiff), and defense (the
   analysis of the defense strategies and arguments used during the
   investigation and the main trial, as well as the pleas for parole and
   other letters applied to defend the accused people). Special emphasis is
   going to be laid on the final issue-defense strategies of the
   perpetrators-which should enable the reconstruction of the then and,
   probably, still unchanged, attitude of the villagers of central Poland
   toward the crimes committed there and their victims.},

Abstract = {The Great Famine of 1932-33, known in Ukraine as the Holodomor and
   silenced for decades by the Soviet regime, holds a special place in
   national memory. It was after the Orange Revolution that the Holodomor
   became the core of a new identity politics, which conceptualized the
   Ukrainian nation as a ``postgenocide{''} community, a collective victim
   of the Communist regime. But the official interpretation of the Famine
   as a genocide met ambivalent responses in the regions. While formally
   complying with the official political line, the regional political
   elites in Eastern and Southern Ukraine often refused to accept the
   official interpretation of history and sabotaged orders coming from
   Kyiv. The present article focuses on the official commemoration of the
   seventy-fifth anniversary of the Holodomor in Kharkiv, the former
   capital of Soviet Ukraine and epicenter of the famine. The ``memory
   wars{''} in Kharkiv during 2006 to 2009 have revealed more than just
   tensions between the center promoting a new national identity and a
   reluctant ``Sovietized{''} region adhering to its political mentality
   and commemorative culture. In fact, the official narrative of the
   Holodomor as a genocide and the corresponding memory regime have been
   contested, renegotiated, and modified on the regional level, through the
   conflicts and the bargaining of the local political actors. The
   borderland identity of Kharkiv, its geographic proximity to Russia,
   added an international dimension to the local memory wars as the
   Holodomor issue became a stumbling block in Ukrainian-Russian relations.},

Abstract = {The collapse of the Soviet Union in December 1991 was multiple, but the
   demise of the very economic system was one important component that in
   itself rendered its implosion inevitable, and with the Soviet collapse
   the Cold War came to a definite end. The purpose of this article is
   twofold, to depict this amazingly fast demise of a petrified economic
   system and to show how it was connected with the end of the Cold War.
   Today, the case for socialism is no longer persuasive, but it was not
   always so. Once, many intelligent people considered socialism not only
   morally but also economically superior to capitalism and democracy. They
   thought a benign state would pursue higher ideals than a petty democracy
   and execute them more effectively. In order to understand the demise of
   the socialist economic system, we need to comprehend its advantages as
   well as its drawbacks. International Politics (2011) 48, 545-561.

Abstract = {The latest episodes of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict bring further
   evidence that this conflict cannot be understood solely in political
   terms. In this paper, we review a significant set of psychological
   scientific articles that specifically examine this conflict, and we
   argue that such psychological insights may renew perspectives towards
   its understanding and, perhaps, resolution. After having set the issue
   in our introduction, we proceed in three steps, which correspond to the
   three kinds of insights that we argue could be gained from psychology.
   First, we consider the perceptions of the conflict by its actors.
   Second, we consider the dynamics of identity and aggressive behaviour.
   Third, we consider the effects of violence on mental health. Eventually,

Abstract = {This article distinguishes between `'direct'' and `'indirect'' violence
   during civil wars. These two types differ in their forms of production:
   while indirect violence is unilaterally perpetrated by an armed group,
   direct violence is jointly produced by an armed group and civilians, and
   it hinges on local collaboration. These differences have consequences
   for the spatial variation of each of these types: in conventional civil
   wars, indirect violence is hypothesized to be positively associated with
   levels of prewar support for the enemy group; in contrast, direct
   violence is hypothesized to increase with the level of political parity
   between factions in a locality. The predictions are tested with a novel
   dataset of 1,710 municipalities in Catalonia and Aragon during the
   Spanish civil war (1936-1939).},

Title = {When is Democracy an Equilibrium? Theory and Evidence from Colombia's La

Abstract = {The conventional wisdom is that for a democracy to be consolidated, all
   groups must have a chance to attain power. If they do not, then they
   will subvert democracy and choose to fight for power. In this article,
   the authors show that this wisdom is seriously incomplete because it
   considers absolute, not relative payoffs. Although the probability of
   winning an election increases with the size of a group, so does the
   probability of winning an armed conflict. Thus, in a situation in which
   all groups have a high chance of winning an election, they may also have
   a high chance of winning a fight. Indeed, in a natural model, the
   authors show that democracy may never be consolidated in such a
   situation. Rather, democracy may only be stable when one group is
   dominant. The authors explore this key aspect of the theory using data
   from La Violencia, a political conflict in Colombia during the years
   1946-1950 between the Liberal and Conservative parties. Consistent with
   their results, and contrary to conventional wisdom, the authors show
   that fighting between the parties was more intense in municipalities
   where the support of the parties was more evenly balanced.},

Journal = {GLOBAL POLICY},

Volume = {2},

Pages = {152-162},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This article focuses on the institutions of transatlantic aviation since
   1945, and aims at extracting from this historical process topical policy
   implications. Using the methodology of an analytic narrative, we
   describe and explain the creation of the international cartel
   institutions in the 1940s, their operation throughout the 1950s and
   1960s, their increasing vulnerability in the 1970s and then the
   progressive liberalisation of the whole system. Our analytic narrative
   has a natural end, marked by the signing of an Open Skies Agreement
   between the US and the EU in 2007. We place particular explanatory power
   on (a) the progressive liberalisation of the US domestic market, and (b)
   the active role of the European Commission in Europe. More specifically,
   we explain these developments using two frameworks: first, a `political
   limit pricing' model, which seemed promising, then failed, and then
   seemed promising again because it failed; second, a strategic bargaining
   model inspired by Susanne Schmidt's analysis of how the European
   Commission uses the threat of infringement proceedings to force member
   governments into line and obtain the sole negotiating power in
   transatlantic aviation.},

Abstract = {The major issues confronting world politics in the 21st century -
   climate change, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, pandemics,
   terrorism and economic meltdowns, among others - require that the United
   Nations reinvent itself as the multilateral forum for tackling the
   pressing challenges of today. The possibilities for significant reform
   are remote but not impossible. This article addresses four major
   roadblocks: sacrosanct state sovereignty; the emphasis on process over
   results in organizational culture; perennial and theatrical North-South
   confrontations; and the twin problems of turf battles and
   decentralization. At the same time, individuals and states can be as
   strong as the institutions they create. There are plenty of things wrong
   with the United Nations, but many can be fixed.},

Volume = {21},
Number = {2},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Images of the modern public administrator clash with yesteryear's
   neutral public servants obediently carrying out the orders of elected
   politicians. Partly influenced by the literature on New Public
   Management, people often argue that public administrators today should
   ensure quality services, give value for public funds, be responsive,
   operate strategically, uphold organizations' reputations, and the like.
   They thus seem to serve many masters, not just politicians, but do the
   various masters' interests harmonize or contradict? The research
   question of this article is: Where do the loyalties of public
   administrators lie? The answer involves all the potential objects of
   their loyalties: colleagues, the public good, moral imperatives, the
   law, their organizations, the organizations' clients, and elected
   officials. What is the composition of loyalty for top public
   administrators? What are their conceptions of loyalty? With the use of
   Q-methodology, we identify and describe four distinct types of public
   administrators within the context of loyalty: (a) by-the-book
   professionals, (b) society's neutral servants, (c) the personally
   grounded, and (d) open and principled independents. These conceptions
   matter because they indicate how administrators behave and make
   decisions.},

Abstract = {The global environmental agenda, alongside the broad neoliberal agenda,
   may be viewed by developing states and societies as a neo-imperialist
   adventure to be resisted. This paper argues that while the idea of
   `eco-imperialism' reflects the uncertain location of politics, the
   ambivalent role of states, and unchallenged state-centred assumptions
   about world politics, it also introduces conceptual confusion. It is an
   unusual case of imperialism, in so far as it involves diverse actors who
   may not be pursuing the same objectives. It appears that eco-imperialism
   may be both hegemonic force and anti-capitalist movement. In order to
   explain this apparent contradiction, we must note the contradictions in
   globalisation, but also how the mix of underlying political orientations
   create strange bed-fellows of, for example, developing country activists
   and oil company executives. In doing so, a nuanced view of the dynamics
   of global environmental policy and the prospects for matching these to
   particular political contexts may be discerned. While the exploitative
   and dominating aspects of global environmental policy deserve to be
   challenged and studied, these may have less bearing on global governance
   per se than on the globalised world in which it occurs. In recognising
   the intent of the critique, one must also note the mutual constitution
   of governance and resistance, local-global reverberations, and the
   prospects for bottom-up support identified by `environmentality'. Hence,
   any signs of eco-imperialism imply `participatory empire' at worst,
   which should inform rather than obstruct global environmental
   governance. Journal of International Relations and Development (2011)

Abstract = {Voluntary codes of best practice have become increasingly prominent in
   corporate governance regulation. Given their similarity in focus and
   substance, the global spread of private self-regulation in corporate
   governance is often attributed to the rise of institutional investors
   and seen as signalling a global convergence of standards among the
   traditionally divergent national corporate governance systems. Drawing
   on institutionalist approaches of Comparative Political Economy, we
   argue that national code developments are strongly shaped by national
   state-economy relationships, in particular by domestic `key coalitions'.
   Comparing the emergence of corporate governance codes in the UK and
   Germany, our study reveals marked differences with respect to the
   formulation, substance and function of codes in national corporate
   governance. In the UK, the code largely reflects the demands of
   institutional investors for stricter standards. In contrast, members of
   the traditional German `stakeholder coalition' pushed for a code that
   was intended to be more of a marketing than a regulatory instrument.},

Abstract = {As socio-medical phenomena, epidemics are revealing of the cultures in
   which they are experienced. The HIV/AIDS epidemic in Africa exposes
   antecedent tensions between state and society, and, on a broader canvas,
   between the global north and south. As a contribution to the emerging
   literature on the social ramifications of HIV/AIDS, this article
   examines the saga of the Nigerian physician and immunologist, Dr
   Jeremiah Abalaka, who like other innovators in sub-Saharan Africa claims
   to have developed a curative HIV vaccine. Whilst articulating the social
   conditions that enabled Abalaka to thrive, the article explores the
   marked differences in the reaction to his `discovery' among state
   representatives, the scientific establishment, the general public,
   people living with HIV, and the media. Finally, the article valorizes
   the emergence of new actors in the African health sector, and the
   diversity of strategies used by ordinary people to achieve and maintain
   wellness.},

Abstract = {US foreign policy owes much to a malleable religious identity, shaped by
   foundational myths, and that this religious dimension has, until
   recently, been largely neglected in the US foreign policy literature to
   the detriment of our understanding of how America's status as global
   hegemon is formed, sustained and expanded. This article explores the
   role of the foundational myths of manifest destiny, exceptionalism and
   innocent nation. These foundational myths are explored as they develop
   into a civil religion espoused by successive presidents from George
   Washington to the present day. The article considers how Barack Obama
   has utilised civil religion to maximise domestic support for a foreign
   policy agenda, which seeks to maintain US hegemony through a more
   conciliatory and multilateral approach than his predecessor in the White
   House. Examples of the use of soft power through missionary endeavour
   and the evangelicalisation of military hard power beginning during the
   George W. Bush presidency are detailed in order to reveal an Obama
   presidency that continues to define itself in religious terms while
   providing opportunities for religious actors to continue to play a role
   in representing US interests beyond its shores. International Politics

Abstract = {This article explores the effects of religious appeals by politicians on
   attitudes and behavior. Although politicians frequently make religious
   appeals, the effectiveness of these appeals and the mechanisms of
   persuasion are unknown. This article explores the possibility that
   religious language can affect political attitudes through implicit
   processes. Because religious attachments are formed early in the lives
   of many Americans, religious language may influence citizens without
   their awareness. Implicit and explicit attitudes are related but
   distinct constructs, and implicit attitudes may have behavioral
   implications in the political realm. I test these hypotheses
   experimentally, relying on a widely used implicit measure, the Implicit
   Association Test. I find that a Christian religious appeal affects
   implicit attitudes and political behavior among people who currently or
   previously identify as Christian. Furthermore, an explicit preference
   for less religion in politics does not moderate implicit effects.},

Abstract = {While debates on migration policy often revolve around rival values and
   interests, they also invoke knowledge claims about the causes, dynamics
   and impacts of migration. Such claims are best conceptualised as `policy
   narratives', setting out beliefs about policy problems and appropriate
   interventions. Narratives are likely to be more successful where they
   meet three criteria: they are cognitively plausible, dramatically or
   morally compelling and, importantly, they chime with perceived
   interests. Increasingly, such narratives are also expected to draw on
   expert knowledge, although knowledge is often deployed to legitimise
   particular actors or preferences rather than to enhance the cognitive
   plausibility of the narrative. The series of articles in this issue
   explore how narratives are developed, codified, revised and diffused in
   policy debates and policy-making. We hope that they contribute not just
   to understanding migration policy, but also to wider debates on the role
   of ideas and knowledge in public policy.},

Abstract = {Corruption and insecurity are intimately linked. Crime uses corruption
   to gain the support from the authorities to continue their criminal
   activities, and deteriorating public security and democratic governance.
   The actors involved in public safety programs are particularly
   susceptible to corruption due to low wages, weak controls and general
   institutional weakness in many countries of Latin American region.
   It is therefore necessary to define a systematic process of identifying,
   analyzing and responding to risks of corruption in citizens' security
   programs. The proposed methodology, based on the value chain allows
   this, increasing probability of success achieving their expected
   objectives of scope, cost, time and quality. The critical
   macro-processes of the value chain of public safety identified are: (i)
   developing security policies; (ii) prevention of violence; (iii) control
   and sanction; (iv) rehabilitation and reintegration into society; and
   (v) monitoring and evaluation of policies. The administrative and
   support processes are: (i) infrastructure of the organization, (ii)
   developing technology, (iii) managing human resources, and (iv) managing
   supply.
   This methodology is complemented by risk analysis methodologies of
   systemic corruption in the countries. The proposed methodology is
   purposeful in the sense that it raises a number of measures to address
   identified risks.
   If corruption in citizens' security institutions is not prevented, the
   vicious circle insecurity-corruption could bring many countries in the
   region to serious political instability, loss of control of its
   territory and extended wars of rival groups with loss of lives.},

Title = {Assessing incrementalism: Formative assumptions, contemporary realities},
Journal = {POLICY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {30},
Number = {1},
Pages = {29-39},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Lindblom's 1959 article on incrementalism is one of the most cited works
   in social science.(1) This article examines and probes five of the
   theory's basic, underlying assumptions in light of current empirical and
   theoretical approaches. The five assumptions are: (1) the limited nature
   of rationality and the weak powers of human cognition, (2) the emphasis
   on practical reason and applied knowledge, (3) partisan mutual
   adjustment conceived as interactions and conflicts among singular,
   distinct, and disconnected entities, (4) policy decisions made
   incrementally can be remediated and reversed, and (5) the United States
   political system is taken as the model for incremental politics. In our
   assessment, incrementalism holds up quite well with more recent thinking
   on public policy process with respect to the first and second
   assumptions. The third assumption has been confronted by new work on
   networks. The fourth has been challenged by theories on path dependency.
   The fifth assumption betrayed a national focus and strong value
   consensus globalization and ``culture wars{''} have rendered it
   untenable. The article therefore gives only qualified support for the
   continued relevance of incrementalism as a theory of the policy process.

   LOCAL GOVERNMENT MAKE?},
Journal = {PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {89},
Number = {2},
Pages = {595-610},
Abstract = {Scholars and policy-makers alike argue that government efforts to
   empower citizens and build cohesive communities are integral to the
   development of a flourishing civic culture, especially within
   disadvantaged areas. In this paper, we explore this assumption by
   analysing the impact of different approaches to supporting citizenship
   in English urban local authorities on levels of political efficacy and
   social cohesion. Support for citizenship is modelled using primary data
   drawn from a large-scale national survey as well as in-depth case
   studies, supplemented with relevant secondary data. The findings suggest
   that local authorities that seek to promote greater understanding of
   citizenship and democracy can enhance citizens' perceived influence over
   local decisions, and that this effect is particularly marked in deprived
   areas. Citizens experiencing high levels of social harmony tend to
   reside in areas where councils actively seek to reduce disaffection.},

Abstract = {This article uses the case of the Nubians in Kenya as an ethnic
   minority, and the 2009 Kenyan census as a particular form of
   recognition, to engage in a particular aspect of the debates surrounding
   the politics of recognition: the perceived competitive nature of the
   relationship between national and subnational groups, in this case
   ethnic groups. Using data obtained during a 6-month qualitative study
   conducted over the census period, this paper evaluates the response of
   some members of the Nubian community to their participation in the
   census, focusing on its most controversial question, `What tribe are
   you?' The article concludes that the dynamic between ethnic and national
   identities and allegiances, when the former are recognized, can be the
   site of agency, participatory citizenship, and therefore also democratic
   equality, action and interaction.},

Abstract = {This article documents the evolution of ``cap and trade{''} as a policy
   response to global climate change. Through an analysis of 33 distinct
   policy venues, the article describes how the cap and trade policy domain
   has developed along spatial, temporal, and institutional dimensions.
   This discussion demonstrates that following initial discussions of cap
   and trade in the Kyoto Protocol negotiations, the idea quickly spread to
   other policy venues, creating a complex system of multilevel governance,
   where many questions about how to govern emissions trading remain
   contested. The analysis contextualizes recent questioning of emissions
   trading as an appropriate mechanism for controlling GHG emissions, as
   well as the ongoing debates about who should govern cap and trade and
   how it should be carried out. The findings highlight the value added of
   a domain-level perspective and suggest the need for future research on
   the sociopolitical nature of cap and trade policy debates.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION RESEARCH AND THEORY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Pages = {53-86},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Using data from the Federal Human Capital Survey, we demonstrate that
   the managerial traits of competence, integrity, and benevolence share an
   important common dimension that we identify as the trustworthiness of
   managerial leadership (TWML). Using recursive hierarchical linear
   models, we demonstrate that levels of TWML are strongly and positively
   associated with several measures of perceived organizational outcomes.
   This relationship between TWML and perceived outcomes is especially
   strong in low-performing agencies and in agencies experiencing increased
   uncertainty due to structural and upper level leadership changes. We
   draw two substantive conclusions from these empirical results. First, it
   is clear that the characteristics of managers matter for outcomes of
   public organizations. In particular, trustworthy managers preside over
   more productive organizations and are better able to maintain and even
   increase organizational outcomes in agencies challenged by low level of
   performance and perturbations in the external environment. Second,
   public managers and management scholars ought to view trust not only as
   an exogenous variable but also as a managerial resource to be
   cultivated.},

Title = {Who takes the hit? Ministerial advisers and the distribution of welfare
   state cuts},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},

Volume = {18},

Pages = {294-310},
Abstract = {This paper suggests a new way of analysing welfare state cutbacks.
   Instead of analysing the level of cuts, it analyses the way in which the
   cuts are distributed between social groups. It argues that we need to
   better understand the role of key bureaucrats in order to explain
   welfare state policy output, and thereby the distribution of cuts. In
   line with this argument, the paper suggests that ministerial advisers
   are influential in determining the character of policy output and that
   their actions partly depend on the terms of their employment. It
   hypothesizes that recommendations made by politically appointed advisers
   differ systematically from recommendations made by advisers who were not
   appointed politically, and that this also affects policy output. To test
   these suggestions, a set of 18 mature welfare states is used, and the
   results indicate that the ministerial advisers' terms of employment
   indeed influence the distribution of welfare state cuts.},

Pages = {339-360},
Abstract = {Why did the European Union (EU) attempt yet fail to reform its
   anti-dumping legislation between 2006 and 2008? We analyse this attempt
   to reform a legislative act regulating interest groups' access to public
   decision-makers by relying on collective action and principal-agent
   theory. Contrary to approaches assuming that the European Commission
   enjoys a large degree of agent autonomy to implement a more liberal EU
   trade policy than most member state principals would want, we conceive
   of principals and their agents as actors responding to the relative
   balance between interest groups mobilizing for and against reform.
   Tracing interest group collective action advantages back to industry
   consolidation and the certainty of future losses, we argue that
   concentrated producer groups mobilize most intensively and persistently
   and successfully influence policy outcomes. On the losing side,
   importers and retailers, joined by producers having outsourced parts of
   their production, let alone consumers, fail to counter this mobilization
   effort.},

Abstract = {Jihadi hostage-taking manuals as well as recent attacks such as the
   Moscow theater and the Beslan school are an alarming indication of the
   likely characteristics of future barricade hostage sieges. While there
   are many trained crisis negotiators around the world, the vast majority
   lacks any experience whatsoever in dealing with issues such as ideology,
   religion, or the differing set of objectives and mindsets of terrorist
   hostage-takers. This is especially true in relation to dealing with
   terrorists of the onewo breed, who possess much greater willingness to
   execute hostages, are likely to employ large teams of willing-to-die
   hostage-takers who will have the capability to effectively repel a
   rescue operation, and who will also have detailed knowledge of the
   hostage negotiation and rescue teams' oplaybook.o This article presents
   the findings of a detailed evaluation of recent case studies to
   highlight the adjustments that need to be made to the contemporary
   crisis negotiation protocols, in order to improve the capacity of
   negotiators to deal with such incidents more effectively.},

Abstract = {Political Control of Military Contributions to International Operations:
   Restrictions on the Use of Norwegian Fighter Aircraft in Afghanistan
   The article investigates the political process leading to the Norwegian
   government's self-imposed restrictions on the use of Norwegian fighter
   aircraft under the command of the US military in Operation Enduring
   Freedom (OEF) in 2002-2003. The restrictions gave Norwegian political
   leaders influence over how the Norwegian aircraft were used. The article
   builds on the assumption that the Norwegian fighter aircraft support was
   motivated by the government's expressed desire to underline Norwegian
   alliance commitments to the USA. And it shows how the government's
   self-imposed restrictions were established as a consequence of two
   different but overlapping considerations: First, out of consideration of
   the development of the conflict in Afghanistan and the government's need
   to reduce the risk of Norwegian aircraft becoming involved, in mistaken
   bombing or contributing to escalation of the conflict on the ground.
   Second, the restrictions were used to secure domestic support in
   government, in the national assembly and in public opinion for the
   Norwegian fighter support in OEF.},

Abstract = {This article aims at investigating how the hypothesis that Brazil could
   become one of the permanent members of the United Nations Security
   Council emerged and developed when the organization was created in 1945.
   The motivations of President Roosevelt in putting forward this proposal
   in 1944, during the Dumbarton Oaks Conference, the resistances faced, as
   well as the position adopted by the Brazilian government at the San
   Francisco Conference, are analyzed by using archival sources and
   documents from the period under examination.},

   Abuse from the Israeli Occupied Territories},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Pages = {17-33},
Abstract = {This article seeks to explore the practice of Israeli human rights
   organizations through detailed analysis of the photographs that they
   publish in their reports and on their websites. A recurrent theme that
   emerges from these photos is the way in which they have been taken over
   the shoulders of Israeli soldiers. My intention is to question what
   governs the selection of these images. The persistent appearance of
   these images in human rights reports is puzzling when we pause to
   consider the aims of such reports. It is through the highlighting of
   human rights abuse that the reports aim to generate a sense of
   responsibility that transcends responsibilities to one's family, one's
   community or even one's nation. Through the deployment of a
   hermeneutical reading of the photographs and interviews with the
   organizations protagonists that complement and illuminate each other, I
   intend to demonstrate that the local civil activists focus on the
   soldiers for both pragmatic and sentimental reasons. It would seem, upon
   first reflection, somewhat disturbing that the subjects of concern are
   absent from view but, upon closer inspection, these subjects are not
   neglected by focusing on those in charge. I argue that the Israeli
   citizens belonging to human rights organizations highlight the
   responsibilities of the representative of the Israeli state by focusing
   on duties rather than on rights.},

   FROM A GERMAN PERSPECTIVE},
Journal = {PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {89},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1526-1545},
Abstract = {With the Lisbon Strategy and mandate, the European Commission committed
   itself to promoting entrepreneurship as a major driver of innovation,
   competitiveness, and growth. This paper demonstrates that the
   renaissance of entrepreneurship policy along with the implementation of
   the Lisbon Agenda resulted in the localization of policy-making, and
   re-strengthened policy-makers on the ground to successfully mobilize
   directly at the supranational level. Furthermore, it shows that EU
   entrepreneurship policy-making has contributed to a shift from
   hierarchical government to a more horizontal and interactive form of
   governance in the new German Laender which were highly exposed to
   Structural Funds and the Lisbon Agenda. The focus of analysis on the
   sub-national level helps to fill an academic void in Europeanization and
   governance literature. By integrating a region- and policy-specific
   perspective, this contribution goes beyond theorizing the regional
   dimension of Europeanization in a multi-level governance scheme.},

Abstract = {By means of an Anglo-French comparison, this article shows the existence
   of certain atypical forms of public sector work that are associated with
   internal and external coordination, particularly in the context of
   locality based partnerships. In the case of rural and urban development
   in France in the 1980s, such atypical work involved organizations that
   were on the fringe of local authorities, a job description that allowed
   for considerable autonomy and, finally, employment conditions that were
   often insecure. These are the essential components of `fuzzy' jobs.
   Similar atypical characteristics can also be found elsewhere and in
   particular in contemporary practice for urban regeneration in England.
   Through a comparison of diverse situations, the article explores various
   factors that influence these forms of employment. The analysis reveals
   the heavy impact of the mechanisms for allocating public funds, as well
   as the difficulties in dealing with certain objectives in public policy.},

Abstract = {Institutions can affect the degree to which public opinion influences
   policy by determining the clarity of responsibility in decision-making.
   The sharing of power between national and devolved levels of government
   makes it difficult for the public to attribute responsibility for
   decisions. In the UK, this generates the prediction that the devolution
   of power to territorial units weakens the effect of public opinion on
   policy both for the UK and Scottish governments. To test this
   expectation, this paper analyses responsiveness of the legislative
   outputs of the UK and Scottish parliaments to the issue priorities of
   the public. It finds the policy-opinion link in the UK appears to be
   weaker since devolution to the Scottish Parliament in 1999 compared with
   the period between 1977 and 1998. It shows no evidence of a direct link
   between issue priorities of the Scottish public and legislative outputs
   of the Scottish Parliament.},

Title = {Learning within the European Commission: the case of environmental
   integration},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {18},
Number = {7},
Pages = {980-998},
Abstract = {This article analyses how the Directorates-General for Transport and
   Energy (DG TREN) and for Enterprise (DG ENTR) of the European Commission
   reacted to the demand to integrate environmental aspects into their
   activities. In doing so, we study the DGs - as suborganizations within
   an organization - through the lenses of organizational learning
   concepts. To reveal if, and to what extent, the observed reactions of
   both DGs towards environmental integration can be described as
   organizational learning, we develop a heuristic model that allows for a
   distinction between single-loop and double-loop learning as well as
   between compliant and non-compliant learning. Our empirical study
   detects different types of organizational learning by DG TREN and DG
   ENTR in three time periods between 1986 and 2004. Furthermore, our

Abstract = {The global neoliberal economic and political order impregnated the
   emergence of democracy in South Africa. One of the hallmarks of this
   order is that the capacity of the state to transform society is
   constrained, particularly in the rural hinterlands. The incapacity of
   the state to extend its grip, both economically and politically, has
   provided traditional leaders with an opportunity to both recast
   themselves as intermediaries between state and society and elevate
   themselves to decision makers on behalf of large communities. The
   article examines the way in which traditional leaders have repositioned
   themselves in the new democracy, what their source of support is, and
   why the African National Congress government has come to support these
   efforts.},

Abstract = {A key problem for counterterrorism is how large numbers of individuals
   can be screened most efficiently to discover terrorists. This question
   arises at security checkpoints of all kinds, from roadblocks to airline
   security counters. Some argue that certain categories of individuals,
   for instance, young Muslim men in the airline context, should be
   screened more heavily than others. Others deride this as racial
   profiling, and argue that any such scheme would be easily evaded. I
   examine a model of searching for terrorists among a population divided
   into categories that vary in their potential reliability or ease of
   recruitment as agents of terrorist attacks. The equilibria in the model
   feature profiling, in that different categories are searched with
   different intensities. Practical difficulties in implementing a rational
   profiling scheme are discussed.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-16},
Abstract = {This article examines Kazuo Ishiguro's novel Never Let Me Go as a type
   of Bildungsroman that presents coded models of contemporary human rights
   issues. It shows how autobiographical storytelling functions within the
   novel as a form of rights claim that gives voice to the suffering of an
   oppressed social group. The article demonstrates how the text grapples
   with the effects of storytelling on individual psychologies, both as a
   constructive response to atrocity and as a potentially dubious method of
   overcoming traumatic experience. It also underscores Ishiguro's
   sensitivity to the ways that aestheticized forms of traumatic experience
   are consumed by the general public with a mixture of empathy,
   indifference, and perversion.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {34},
Number = {4},
Pages = {509-530},
Abstract = {Many scholars, strategists and pundits contend that the US is in
   decline. They argue that America's national capabilities are
   significantly eroding, and that with the rise of important regional
   powers, its primacy in world affairs is rapidly diminishing as well. Yet
   America continues to possess significant advantages in critical sectors
   such as economic size, technology, competitiveness, demography, force
   size, power projection, military technology, and in the societal
   capacity to innovate and adapt. This article argues that the nature of
   material problems has been overstated, and that the US should be able to
   withstand modest erosion in its relative strength for some time to come
   without losing its predominant status. Instead, where limits to American
   primacy do exist, they are as or more likely to be ideational as they
   are material. The problem inheres as much or more in elite and societal
   beliefs, policy choices, and political will, as in economic,
   technological or manpower limitations at home, or the rise of peer
   competitors abroad.},

Abstract = {This article explores the supposed shift from New Public Management
   (NPM) to a new era of ``post-NPM{''} by looking at one critical case,
   New Zealand. It finds limited evidence of such a shift, suggesting that
   the wider literature needs to move to a more careful methodological
   treatment of empirical patterns. To contribute to such a move, this
   article applies a three-pronged approach to the study of changing
   doctrines in executive government. After setting out the broad contours
   of what NPM and post-NPM supposedly constitute, the article proceeds to
   a documentary analysis of State Services Commission doctrines; this is
   followed by an analysis of ``Public Service Bargains{''} based on elite
   interviews and finally a case-study approach of the Crown Entities Act
   2004. Far from a new era of administrative reform, the ``messy{''}
   patterns that emerge suggest a continuation of traditional
   understandings and ad hoc and politically driven adjustments, leading to
   diversification.},

Abstract = {This paper critically examines the purposes and objectives of the
   Organisation internationale de la Francophonie (OIF). While analysts
   debate whether the OIF is a hegemonic or counter-hegemonic instrument of
   statecraft, we argue that it is an institution founded upon the
   principle of geopolitical ownership of a distinctive geocultural space.
   Its prime task, with regards to conflict resolution, is to help transfer
   responsibilities and capabilities from Northern to Southern member
   states. From this perspective, we contend that the OIF has progressively
   taken charge of a distinct and necessary geocultural role with regards
   to international security.},

Abstract = {In the last 60 years, we have seen the growing development and
   articulation of human rights, particularly within international law and
   within and across supranational organizations. However, in that period,
   the right to maintain one's language(s), without discrimination, remains
   peculiarly underrepresented and/or problematized as a key human right.
   This is primarily because the recognition of language rights presupposes
   recognizing the importance of wider group memberships and social
   contexts; conceptions that ostensibly militate against the primacy of
   individual rights in the post-Second World War era. Drawing on
   theoretical debates in political theory and international law, as well
   as the substantive empirical example of Catalonia, this article argues
   that language rights can and should be recognized as an important human
   right.},

Abstract = {In the last two decades, the civilian dimension has become an essential
   aspect of peace operations. In 2010, the UN had deployed 20 000
   civilians in peace operations, while the EU and the OSCE had sent 2 000
   and 3 000 civilians. This dimension also is one of the bases of the
   African Standby Force of the African Union. This article gives a
   preliminary overview of the reinforcement of civilian capacities in
   peace operations, a topic that hasn't been broadly covered by the
   literature, except through the broad scope of peacebuilding. This
   article addresses the concept of the civilian dimension though the
   evolution of peacekeeping, then analyses its slow and laborious
   emergence. Finally, it identifies some of the main operational
   challenges of its development.},

Journal = {ETHNOPOLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Pages = {35-50},
Abstract = {In order to end conflict and foster democracy, most contemporary peace
   agreements recognize particular ethnic groups, typically by
   accommodating them within the central institutions for governing the
   state. Yet the conflicts that peace agreements aim to manage or resolve
   also affect other groups in society. Accordingly, this article considers
   whether a convincing normative case might be made for extending the act
   of recognition to women. To this end, four possible arguments are
   considered-the justice argument, the nature argument, the interest
   argument and the role-model argument. Although the fourth of these
   arguments has received the least amount of attention from contemporary
   feminists, it is argued that it is the most plausible (or least
   problematic) way to justify the claim that peace agreements should
   recognize and accommodate women. That said, the authors accept that,
   taken on its own, the role-model argument is still a fairly weak
   argument, and so the paper concludes by suggesting how, in practical
   terms, it might be bolstered.},

Journal = {REVIEW OF POLICY RESEARCH},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {28},
Number = {1},
Pages = {25-47},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The issue of economic growth and human development has been a central
   concern in the oil and gas sector of Nigeria's extractive industry, and
   this has featured prominently in the agitations and generalized
   restiveness in the Niger Delta, the oil-producing region. While many
   studies have focused on these problems, policies aimed at confronting
   them have not received much broad attention. This article bridges this
   research gap by holistically focusing on the solution to the problem. In
   doing this, the article examines the policies during the Obasanjo
   administration from 1999 to 2007 in order to critically assess the
   efficacy or inefficiency of the policies in reversing the general
   problem now known as the ``resource curse,{''} and to offer a better
   understanding of the deeper political, social, and economic issues that
   drive outcomes. The article finds that while significant efforts were
   made to avoid the boom and bust cycle of oil and lower volatility by
   de-linking public expenditure from oil revenue through the
   ``oil-price-based fiscal rule,{''} generally, progress in this area was
   not matched by improvement in the other areas examined by this study,
   notably peace and safety of lives and oil/gas installations, the
   development of the oil-producing region, environmental security and
   sustainability, and the transparent and accountable use of oil/gas
   revenues.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},

Volume = {18},
Number = {7},
Pages = {927-943},
Abstract = {This paper develops a typology of strategies used by political actors to
   place issues on the Europena Union (EU) agenda. In doing so, it builds
   on a theoretically derived twofold distinction between two challenges in
   putting issues on the agenda (gaining attention and building
   credibility) and two factors that actors can affect (venues and frames).
   The resulting four types of strategy are further specified on the basis
   of the existing case study literature on EU agenda-setting. This results
   in a typology that elucidates the political rationales behind
   agenda-setting strategies and applies to all types of actors in EU
   policy-making. The typology can be used to understand the
   interrelationships between different (types of) strategies, to identify
   opposing strategies meant to keep issues off the EU agenda, and to
   compare agenda-setting processes in the EU and domestic political
   systems.},

Journal = {ETHNOPOLITICS},

Abstract = {International statebuilding in Afghanistan must be considered in terms
   of identity politics as they have emerged since the Bonn Agreement of
   2001. In light of this, Afghanistan's 2009 presidential election serves
   as a window on the broader post-Bonn statebuilding process in which
   factionalized elite networks have constituted an internationally
   supported regime that masquerades as a state. Comparing political
   cultural and political economic explanations for the factionalism that
   was widespread during the elections, the paper demonstrates that the
   identity politics were contingent on the business of vote-rigging. In
   this light, the internationally assisted state is shown to be a site for
   inter-factional and inter-elite competition. This is a fundamentally
   unstable outcome that highlights the role of Western-led statebuilding
   in consolidating the ethno-regional and factional divisions in
   Afghanistan's state.},

Number = {8, SI},
Pages = {1078-1095},
Abstract = {The status of democracy in European foreign and security policy is
   increasingly questioned. In order to identify if there is something at
   the European Union (EU) level that requires legitimation, we need to
   establish whether there has been a move beyond intergovernmentalism. In
   this contribution an analytical scheme that makes it possible to
   identify such a move and its putative democratic implications is
   developed. Four constituent pillars of intergovernmentalism are
   identified and discussed. These pertain to actors, decision-making
   procedures, the scope of delegated powers and the raison d'etre of the
   intergovernmental endeavour. These pillars constitute necessary
   requirements if intergovernmentalism is to be democratic. Developments
   within the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) are assessed with
   reference to this analytical scheme, with a view to identify whether,
   when and where a move beyond intergovernmentalism has created a
   democratic dilemma.},

Abstract = {Scholars are divided over whether the emancipatory politics promised by
   new social movements can be attained within civil society or whether
   seizure of the state apparatus is necessary. The Bolivarian Revolution
   led by President Hugo Chavez presents a crucial case for examining this
   question. Chavez's use of the state apparatus has been fundamental in
   broadening the concept of citizenship, but this extension of citizenship
   has occurred alongside the deliberate exclusion of others. This has not
   only limited its appeal as a citizenship project but created
   counterpublics that challenge the functioning of the government and its
   very legitimacy. Analysis of Bolivarianism in terms of micropublics
   shows both how otherwise disparate micropublics fuse together and why
   their union remains contingent and dependent on the figure of Chavez,
   its most significant producer.},

Title = {Beyond demand management: co-managing energy and water practices with
   Australian households},
Journal = {POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {32},
Number = {1},
Pages = {35-58},
Abstract = {This paper highlights the problems and assumptions ingrained in dominant
   demand-management programmes designed to address issues of erratic
   household energy consumption, urban water shortages and increasing peak
   electricity demand. It begins by highlighting the problematic divide
   between energy and water production and the seemingly separate sphere of
   consumption. This divide fails to consider the ways in which consumption
   shapes, and is shaped by, resource production and provision. The paper
   argues that, by focusing on the individual consumption of resources,
   demand managers overlook the changing dynamics of everyday practices for
   which resources are consumed, such as bathing, laundering, heating and
   cooling. This is problematic because these practices are continuing to
   shift and change, often in more resource-consuming, expensive and
   environmentally damaging directions, potentially negating the resource
   savings achieved through demand-management programmes and policies. To
   address these oversights, this paper proposes an alternative resource
   management paradigm which brings together the conceptual strands of
   co-management and social practice theory. By shifting emphasis away from
   co-managing resources and onto co-managing day-to-day practices, a range
   of new opportunities for change emerge. The paper presents the concepts,
   methodologies and strategies central to this new paradigm and contrasts
   these with demand-management approaches. Avenues for change include
   focusing on the `intermediaries' of demand (taps, showers, appliances,
   etc.), the material infrastructure of housing, co-operatively owned
   and/or managed resource systems, campaigns to instigate new cultural
   practices or collaborative partnerships established during some variable
   pricing programmes. However, the paper warns that making the transition
   towards this new paradigm requires urgent research and policy attention.
   It concludes by proposing a research agenda which aims to highlight both
   the complications in continuing to ignore the relationship between
   production and consumption, and the benefits of co-management approaches
   which attempt to bridge this divide.},

Abstract = {This short comment seeks to clarify what unipolar politics as usual is,
   and how it differs from politics as usual under alternative systemic
   conditions, especially bipolarity. This is an assessment `from within',
   accepting Brooks and Wohlforth's description of unipolar politics as
   well as their central premises that America's lonely superpower status
   faces no immediate threat and that there is little evidence that
   powerful states are actively seeking to overthrow the current unipolar
   system. I suggest that a comparative assessment of how alternative
   distributions of power create different incentive structures for states
   yields different conclusions and policy prescriptions than those
   advanced by Brooks and Wohlforth. Most notably, Brooks and Wohlforth do
   not fully appreciate how the `unipolar politics as usual' that they
   describe provides states with few incentives to cooperate with their
   policy prescription that the US reshape the world's institutional
   architecture.},

   Istanbul},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {20},
Number = {6},
Pages = {861-878},
Abstract = {In Istanbul during the late 1990s a mobilisation opposed the
   construction of a third bridge over the Bosphorus Strait to connect the
   Asian with the European shores of the city. The residents of one of two
   neighbourhoods over which the bridge would be placed, organised an
   Arnavutkoy District Initiative - ASG (Arnavutkoy Semt Girisimi) -
   claiming that the construction of the bridge would have destructive
   effects on the natural and cultural environment of the area. The
   environment is one of the central arguments around which the anti-bridge
   campaign revolves but closer ethnographic examination reveals that ASG
   is much more than an environmental group. Therefore, ASG is analysed as
   a transenvironmental protest, through the consideration of
   environmentalism as a cultural characteristic appropriated by the
   setting of which ASG is part. Furthermore, the transenvironmental
   character of ASG is discussed in relation to its activities, which
   render it more than a protest but also a community organisation.},

Journal = {POLITICS RELIGION \& IDEOLOGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {12},
Number = {4},
Pages = {355-369},
Abstract = {This article deals with the online activism of Abu Jandal al-Azdi, one
   of the main ideologues of the now-defunct Saudi version of Al-Qa'ida on
   the Arabian Peninsula (QAP), whose writings have been all but neglected
   in publications on this organisation. While rightly seen as only a
   mediocre religious scholar, I contend that al-Azdi is nevertheless an
   important ideologue for two reasons: firstly, his religious university
   education combined with his internet skills propelled him to a position
   that can perhaps best be described as `al-Qa` ida's editor': he
   presented very few (if any) new ideas of his own but collected,
   selected, and presented others' general and more difficult writings into
   readily-applicable and easily-digestible chunks of information -now
   forever present in cyberspace -that was aimed carefully and specifically
   at his target audience of radical Saudi Islamists; secondly, through the
   case-study of al-Azdi, I show that anti-Saudi ideas in QAP's discourse
   -as opposed to pan-Islamism -were more prominent, more openly available
   and expressed at an earlier time than has hitherto been suggested, and
   that al-Azdi has been one of the most important ideologues promoting
   this.},

Abstract = {Construction and operation of water infrastructure, such as dams,
   historically has been carried out with little attention paid to
   mitigating the impacts of such activities on the livelihoods and values
   of those for whom the water being managed. Enhanced awareness of the
   need to take into account a wide range of interests, as well as social,
   cultural, and ecological impacts of water projects, has prompted efforts
   to include such interests in decision processes. Glen Canyon Dam,
   located on the Colorado River upstream from Grand Canyon National Park,
   in the U.S. state of Arizona, has become the center of a complex
   adaptive management program which aims to recognize both locally
   specific and broader interests in the water that flows through the dam.
   A part of this effort has focused on integrating the concerns and values
   of Native Americans with historic and ongoing ties to the area affected
   by the dam. The experience of two Southern Paiute tribes, as
   participants in this effort, foregrounds the challenges and
   possibilities of changing the ways in which non-market values of water
   are conceptualized and, by extension, how water resources are defined
   and managed. (C) 2011 Policy and Society Associates (APSS). Elsevier

Abstract = {The article investigates how major changes in national economic
   policies, and in associated forms of state-business relations, produce
   pro-business local governance arrangements. It places the emphasis on
   the politics of state-business relations that revolve around the
   distribution of public resources. It aims to explain, in particular, how
   these dynamics unfold in the developing countries where neoliberal
   reforms are implemented under conditions of political instability and
   weak policy capacity of the state. The article focuses on the political
   mobilization of the local bourgeoisie through local business
   associations, as the major force behind the rise of pro-business local
   governance. It indicates that the emergent form a pro-business local
   governance scheme, especially when led by local business associations,
   will depend upon a) the degree of political autonomy of the local
   bourgeoisie from the national political actors (i.e, their distance to
   party politics); b) the composition of its constituency/supporters (or
   the class coalition behind it); c) the degree of their dependency on
   public resources. The arguments are elaborated in the case of the city
   of Gaziantep, Turkey.},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This article considers the role of conditional cash transfers as a
   mechanism of governing health risk by buying behaviour change in sexual
   practice. Conditional cash transfers have come to be identified as a
   potential solution to the problem of HIV prevention, and as such look
   likely to be applied throughout countries with high prevalence rates in
   sub-Saharan Africa. The article considers the implications of two pilot
   studies in Tanzania and Malawi for governing the risk of HIV infection.
   It outlines the problem of behaviour change and individual rationality,
   the potential of conditional cash transfers as a relatively inexpensive
   programme with high outcomes, and some of the limitations and
   implications of these initiatives for individual bodies, rationality and
   global health governance. The article makes the argument that
   conditional cash transfers should be met with caution and that governing
   health risk by buying behaviour represents the intersection of
   bio-political control with neo-liberal forms of economic incentive
   through financial gain. The balancing of long-term health needs with
   short-term financial gain induces will to change behaviour, the problem
   being the sustainability of such change in the absence of financial gain
   and the long-term consequences of constructing behaviour.},

Abstract = {In the United Nations (UN) Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (PF),
   indigenous political subjectivities take shape in the power relations
   that not only make indigenous peoples subjects but also subjugate them.
   This article discusses the process and the possibilities of resistance
   that open up for indigenous peoples within it. The approach taken
   acknowledges the limiting political environment of the UN for indigenous
   peoples, because it is a non-indigenous political system based on state
   sovereignty. Yet, it does not view the situation of those peoples in the
   PF as totally determined by the states and their dominant discourse. The
   theoretical framework of the article draws on the work of Michel
   Foucault and his conceptions on power, resistance, subjectification,
   technologies of domination and of the self. The power struggles in the
   PF, described through the complex of sovereignty, discipline and
   government, and the resistances within them engender paradoxical
   indigenous subjectivities: colonized/decolonized, victim/actor,
   traditional/modern, global/local. Indigenous peoples are able to engage
   both in resistance that is a reaction to states' exercise of power or
   the creative use of its tools and in indirect resistance that
   `stretches' the UN system and constitutes action on its own terms.},

Abstract = {This article examines the relationship between homosexuality and the
   concept of publicness, including the idea of the political. Building
   upon the liberal feminism of Susan Okin, as well as upon recent work in
   queer theory, this article outlines an account of the ethic of
   unacknowledgeability, understood as the socially constituted physical
   disappearance of, and discursive silence about, homosexuality. It will
   be claimed that the ethic of unacknowledgeability explains why, unlike
   gendered marginalisation, the marginalisation of gays, lesbians and
   homosexuality as a subject matter is beyond both public and private and,
   as such, distinct. To conclude, this article will sketch a political
   theory of the taboo in which the implications of the ethic of
   unacknowledgeability for normative political theory are explored. More
   specifically, it will be claimed that the political theory of the taboo
   presents a new and unique challenge to politics, and establishes as a
   new standard of justice the extent to which a theory of justice grapples
   with the undiscussable.},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Although U. S. President Barack Obama received extensive media coverage
   during the 2008 U. S. presidential campaign and later during the first
   two years of his presidency, many people still perceive him as elusive,
   or even contradictory. Using biographical facts and objective
   at-a-distance measures, this article presents a personality profile of
   Obama. The profile is organized around a fourfold conception of
   personality. Personality can be understood as the residue of past and
   present social contexts and is publicly visible as traits or
   consistencies of style. Internal beliefs, values, and other cognitions,
   as well as implicit motives, can only be indirectly observed and so are
   measured through content analysis. The resulting profile is used to
   explain some outcomes, as well as paradoxes and puzzles of Obama's
   performance as president. It also suggests predictions about the future
   course of his presidency.},

Abstract = {What, if anything, was Thatcherism? This article aims to gauge the
   extent to which it is credible and useful to speak of Thatcherism in the
   singular. It does so by developing a series of periodisations of the
   policy-making process in different policy domains since the late 1970s.
   This allows us to assess the degree to which a common rationale-such as
   might be associated with Thatcherism (as an instinct or project)-is
   exhibited in the sequencing of policy developments in different fields.
   In the process we seek to establish a new and more generally applicable
   methodology for establishing the existence of path-shaping political
   projects (such as Thatcherism) by gauging their periodisability. We
   conclude that the label Thatcherism is, indeed, warranted, since an
   account couched in such terms can illuminate an analysis of policy
   development since the late 1970s in a range of fields and can contribute
   to our understanding of the timing and sequencing of policy developments
   in each domain. Thatcherism, in other words, can be said to have existed
   because Thatcherism is periodisable. Our approach leads us to develop a
   `cascade' theory of public policy radicalism and spillover between issue
   domains.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to empirically analyse liberal peace
   arguments in the context of shared river basins. In particular, it
   argues that counter to the water war hypothesis, sharing a river need
   not necessary lead to conflict over the shared resource: relying on
   liberal arguments, joint democracy is expected to facilitate trust and
   thus cooperation over transboundary rivers. Furthermore, by mitigating
   asymmetries, facilitating (implicit) side-payments and issue linkage,
   both economic and political interlinkages may encourage cooperation over
   shared rivers. Previous work suggests that these factors might be a
   `fair-weather' phenomenon, that is, that they play a role only for
   problems that are easy to solve. In this article, liberal effects are
   allowed to vary with the difficulty of the underlying problem by
   separating different issues and geographic situations. Empirically, the
   article focuses on intergovernmental behaviour using a new dataset on
   transboundary water events covering all international basins for a
   period of eleven years (1997-2007). The results show that indeed liberal
   peace factors matter with respect to intergovernmental interaction over
   shared river basins and the effect of joint democracy is more prominent
   under `fair-weather' conditions.},

Abstract = {The seminal work by Esping-Andersen (1990) has transformed and inspired
   social policy research over the past two decades. Various contributions
   have confirmed his typology, while others have challenged, and expanded,
   it from substantive and methodological perspectives. This article
   contributes to this debate in two ways. First, it provides a
   comprehensive analysis of the different typologies proposed in the
   literature, employing the concept of `ideal types'. Second, it
   elaborates new directions for research along three dimensions: (1)
   improving measurement validity by linking macro and micro data to
   overcome assumptions, largely based on the average (production) worker;
   (2) assessing the reliability of typologies over time; (3)
   systematically integrating both the work welfare as well as the care
   welfare dimensions.},

Abstract = {This article examines whether a public opinion survey can improve the
   quality of political attitudes. More specifically, we argue that simply
   positioning a summary attitudinal question after a balanced series of
   relevant items can increase people's ability to answer in a way that
   better reflects their underlying interests, values, and predispositions.
   By manipulating the location of the vote preference question in two
   separate national election campaign surveys, we find that there are
   fewer undecided respondents when the question is asked at the end of the
   survey rather than early on, that some people are changing their mind
   during the questionnaire, that a larger set of determinants is
   structuring late-survey vote choice, and that voting preferences based
   on the later question are a better predictor of the actual vote. The
   findings carry important lessons for students of deliberation and of
   citizen decision making.},

Abstract = {The boundary between academic research and policy making is
   characterised by at least two different sets of `troubles'. This article
   draws on the author's experience as scientific adviser to a UK
   government department to highlight the often-problematic relationship
   between researchers and policy actors, and to tease out conflicting
   understandings of the value and robustness of different kinds of
   `evidence'. The article assesses the contributions of both governance
   theory and theories of governmentality to understanding the case
   material, and challenges the idea that there might be a new settlement
   between social science and policy that represents a `post-ideological'

Abstract = {Public organizations rely extensively on sources of support-political
   and otherwise-external to themselves to ensure continued success in
   meeting policy goals. The resource-dependent nature of
   political-administrative relations can create performance problems for
   organizations, especially when perceptions of political support decline.
   Previous literature demonstrates how low levels of political support may
   amplify goal ambiguity for organizations in the public sphere. We argue
   that these organizations benefit from hierarchical authority, which can
   diffuse environmental uncertainties (such as those associated with
   increased goal ambiguity) to maintain performance. We develop a test of
   this claim using data collected in Phase II of the National
   Administrative Studies Project. Findings confirm a contingent model of
   performance in which low political support and increased goal ambiguity
   are counteracted by varying degrees of internal hierarchical authority.},

Abstract = {The International Energy Agency (IEA) is the organization that, despite
   its constrained membership, is as close as the world currently comes to
   a global focal point on the key energy governance arenas. Although when
   the IEA was established in the 1970s it had the specific and limited
   purpose of enabling the world's leading oil consumers to undertake
   collective action in response to oil supply shocks, it now finds itself
   at the center of many of the key developments in global energy
   governance. Its evolution and current challenges reflect the key themes
   of this special issue: the competition between state and market, the
   emergence of multipolarity, the particular growing importance of Asia
   and the rise of climate change on the agenda of key tasks needing
   governance. The article focuses on where the agency now fits in the
   larger global energy governance panoply.},

   series of disclosure-based initiatives in the energy sector, namely:
   making energy markets work more efficiently; inducing corporations to
   internalize their climate change externalities; and improving democratic
   processes that lead to better energy governance outcomes. The disclosure
   initiatives assessed in this article adopt different strategies to
   achieve their objectives, mobilizing either users of information or
   holders of information, with varying effectiveness. Where pressures for
   secrecy exist, voluntary disclosures without formal sanctions to
   incentivize compliance have limited impact. Where users of information
   are primarily mobilized as drivers of change, the disclosures have to be
   easily understood to have impact; this is no easy task when it comes to
   the energy sector. Disclosure mechanisms that use a strategy of
   engagement and building of wide networks have perhaps the best potential
   to influence (or pressure) holders of information to change their
   behavior accordingly. However, disclosure mechanisms underpinned by
   western-influenced values of governmental transparency may not be as
   effective in countries that lack democratic systems.},

Abstract = {Police brutality is part of Latin American social history, not merely a
   consequence of the ``authoritarian legacy{''} of military regimes.
   Violent police practices persist because of the weakness of
   institutional mechanisms for controlling police activity. This can be
   seen by analyzing some of the police control mechanisms present in Rio
   de Janeiro, including legislation, standards of conduct, policing
   strategies, mechanisms of internal and external control, and the
   judiciary. The efficacy of these control mechanisms is tied to the
   pattern of relationship that exists between the state (and police) and
   society. The introduction of new control mechanisms or the improvement
   of existing ones would mean a recalibration of this relationship.},

Volume = {16},

Abstract = {As a preliminary investigation and an intellectual reflection of the
   state of the field of Chinese domestic political study conducted in the
   Chinese language in mainland China, this paper deals with a threefold
   task. It first assesses the state of the field of the study of Chinese
   politics in mainland China, and argues that this scholarship is
   underdeveloped in comparison with the study of home-country politics in
   some other countries. It then clarifies the often blurring boundaries in
   contemporary China between the political science study of Chinese
   politics on one hand and other categories of political writings on the
   other, and maintains that the political penetration from the Party-state
   has been the major factor that hinders the intellectual development of
   the study of Chinese politics as a branch of political science. The
   paper, thirdly, suggests the so-called ``open-minded independence of
   scholarship{''} with the emphases on academic autonomy and
   institutionalized professionalism as what the most needed for developing
   the study of Chinese politics in the Sinophonic world.},

Abstract = {The model of governance bequeathed by Britain to the Caribbean has long
   been praised for ensuring that vibrant democratic practice has generally
   prevailed since the era of decolonisation. Yet it has also become
   increasingly clear that the Westminster system of politics, as it is
   applied to the region's tiny polities, has come to exhibit serious
   deficiencies and is in need of reform. The current government of St
   Vincent and the Grenadines has recently made a serious attempt to
   address the issue, engaging in an expansive process of public
   consultation and constitutional reform which was ultimately rejected by
   the populace in a referendum held in November 2009. This article seeks
   to analyse both the form and content of the constitutional reform
   process, situating it within broader debates about the Westminster Model
   itself.},

Abstract = {The relationship between conflict and education has been studied before.
   However, previous authors have always focused strongly on the
   supply-side effects, whereas this article examines the influence of
   conflict on the demand for education. It is theoretically shown that,
   under relatively general conditions, individuals living in a conflict
   area have an incentive to increase their level of education and that
   this effect depends on the individual's skill level. This hypothesis is
   tested using the conflict in the Basque Region as a case study, which is
   an example of a conflict in which one would not expect strong
   supply-side effects. Using other Spanish regions, an artificial region
   is created in which the population has a similar educational
   distribution as in the Basque Region. When comparing the true and
   artificial regions, individuals with a medium education level clearly
   show an increase in education during the conflict, as predicted by the
   theoretical model.},

Abstract = {While economic sanctions are commonly regarded as nonviolent coercive
   diplomacy, scholars show that senders-particularly democratic
   senders-are actually more likely to use military force against the
   targets of their sanctions. In this article, the authors extend this
   connection between sanctions and military action by arguing that
   countries targeted with third-party economic coercion are more likely to
   be targets of dyadic militarized violence from states not involved in
   the sanctions. The act of sanctioning, the authors argue, lowers the
   prohibitions to use violence against the sanctioned state by others.
   Empirical analysis of dyadic data from 1914 to 2000 shows that, within
   directed dyads, militarized interstate dispute (MID) initiation is more
   likely when the potential target of conflict is sanctioned by
   third-party states, particularly when the sanctioning state is a large
   democracy.},

   decision-makers, civil organisations, and community activists as a
   reflection of education decentralisation in Jewish and Arab communities
   in Israel. Local community involvement constitutes an important process
   in decentralising public power in both Jewish and Arab communities.
   Although the Jewish civil society is the majority society, it seems more
   institutionalised and more persistent than ever before in leading the
   change processes, and in finding solutions to its needs. On the other
   hand, community involvement in Arab society is limited, sporadic, and
   non-institutionalised.},

Abstract = {Corruption manifests itself in many ways and at different levels.
   Corrupt behavior causes outrage to victims and those who value civil
   society, it impedes good government and administrative practice. The
   policy challenge in reducing corruption is to identify the component
   parts of corrupt behavior and the risk-reward profiles of offenders.
   This exploratory article begins this process by reporting data from 100
   successfully prosecuted cases from New York City. The article analyzes
   data on varying degrees of corruption in service provision in New York
   City. The loss to the city is much more a loss of governance capacity
   than it is a monetary loss.},

Abstract = {Public service motivation (PSM) is perceived as a multidimensional
   construct, as an overall, unobserved latent variable with various latent
   dimensions. The present study focuses on the relationships between PSM
   and its dimensions. The purposes in this study are to confirm a set of
   revised items as indicators of a rational base of PSM, to compare a
   four-factor model with various three-factor models, and to analyze
   whether PSM is defined as a formative or a reflective measurement model.
   Using survey data from 2,497 firefighters and a revised 12-item measure
   of PSM, this study shows that the revised items to measure the dimension
   of attraction to policy making are more appropriate for representing the
   rational base of PSM and that the original four-factor model is superior
   to any three-factor models. Based on the discussions about formative and
   reflective specification and the test results, this study provides
   theoretical and empirical evidence in support of a second-order,
   formative approach that PSM is an aggregate construct, meaning that it
   is a composite of its four dimensions. It also shows that it is
   necessary to develop more appropriate items for some dimensions of PSM.
   The practical implications are discussed.},

Abstract = {For several reasons, redistributive social policy has always played a
   minor role in the European Union. Basically, the only distinctive
   European social policy consists in consumer protection, and in the
   protection of individuals against any form of discrimination based on
   nationality or gender. Such social protection is an important example of
   ``negative{''} integration, while the enforcement of positive social
   rights would require not only a much larger budget, but also a level of
   top-down harmonization which is unfeasible under present circumstances.
   Hence, each enlargement of the EU (or, more generally, of a regional
   bloc) changes the calculus of the benefits and costs of policy
   harmonization. In sum, the main limits to deep regional integration are
   social rather than economic or even, strictly speaking, political.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to provide a better understanding of the power
   decentralisation process at the local level in Bangladesh. More
   specifically, this paper intends to explore whether or not the much
   needed autonomy has been built into the decentralisation process. The
   paper is basically based on the review of secondary materials. However,
   efforts have been made to consult all the available local government
   commission reports. The study findings suggest that, despite having
   Constitutional recognition of the establishment of a strong and
   independent local government system, the political leadership of
   Bangladesh has initiated different reforms to bring changes to the
   structure of the Local Government Institutions (LGIs) in the name of
   decentralisation. However, the main intentions behind most of the
   reforms have been to strengthen their political base in the particular
   area. As a result, these institutions could not be established as a
   focal point of development where people would have the power to monitor
   and control their constituencies.},

Abstract = {Studies of the electoral behaviour of immigrants in Western Europe and
   North America have revealed a remarkably coherent cross-national voting
   pattern. Immigrants from the non-Western world hold a strong preference
   for left-of-centre parties. This unusual expression of group voting is
   so stable over time that it has been referred to as an `iron law'. There
   is, however, a dearth of scholarly research on this phenomenon. This
   article tests two explanations for the left-of-centre preferences of
   immigrants in Norway. The first is that the ideological and
   socio-economic composition of the immigrant electorate explains the
   preference for left-of-centre parties. If so, these voters' ethnic or
   immigrant background is not in itself decisive on Election Day. The
   second hypothesis is that immigrant voters engage in group voting, in
   which one's ethnic or immigrant background is significant and trumps
   other concerns when voting. This would express itself in a coherent
   voting pattern that cannot be explained by other factors. We also expect
   those who engage in group voting to favour candidates with similar
   ethnic backgrounds as themselves. The group voting hypothesis finds the
   strongest support. The immigrant vote appears to be driven by group
   adherence, rather than by ideology or social background.},

Title = {A Post-National EU? The Problem of Legitimising the EU without the
   Nation and National Representation},
Journal = {POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {59},
Number = {2},
Pages = {348-367},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This article explores whether the supranational EU polity can be
   legitimised without the nation state. It claims that modern political
   representation depends on establishing a tripartite distinction between
   state, government and civil society. This is contrasted with competing
   notions of the modern state, notably Rousseau's idea of popular
   sovereignty and the Jacobin notion of `immediate democracy'. The
   tripartite system, it is argued, enhances three crucial components of
   democratic legitimacy: governing, sanctioning and mandating
   accountability. Within this framework, the idea of the nation and the
   associated national narrative is shown to benefit democratic legitimacy
   by providing a trans-generational concept of the common good to which
   government can be held accountable. Since the EU does not fit this
   model, two approaches have been touted to legitimise this supranational
   polity in a post-national manner: democratic governance and
   constitutional patriotism. Yet both are highly problematic forms of
   engendering legitimacy. Governance offers no guarantees as to how and
   why citizens will be better represented and does away with the idea of a
   common good. Constitutional patriotism presupposes the prior
   acquiescence of nation states to EU integration without problematising
   how such acquiescence is mandated. Thus the maintenance of a genuinely
   post-national polity - one that does not recreate the division between
   state, government and people - depends on the ability to incorporate EU
   integration into evolving national narratives.},

Abstract = {In light of recent discussions of cognitive and ethical dilemmas related
   to International Relations (IR) scholarship, this paper proposes to
   engage the ``problem of values{''} in IR as a composite question whose
   cognitive treatment requires the objectivation of the more profoundly
   institutional and social processes that subtend its emergence and
   evolution within the discipline. This analysis is hereby offered as an
   exercise in reflexive scholarship. Insofar as the question of values
   constitutes a defining cognitive and moral concern for reflexive
   knowledge itself, the paper also points to the need for its
   reformulation within an epistemic framework that is capable of moving
   beyond reflexivity to Reflexivism proper, understood as a systematic
   socio-cognitive practice of reflexivity.},

Abstract = {The financial crises of 2008 and after have led to some publicised
   reflection on the state of modern economics. Some prominent economists
   have argued that the discipline has some partial responsibility for the
   market meltdown. This article identifies a cluster of interrelated
   failings at the core of economics, including the exaggeration of the
   possibilities for prediction in complex economic systems, the neglect of
   key concepts such as (unquantifiable) Keynesian uncertainty that help to
   explain the crash, the crowding out of discursive and historical
   analysis by mathematical techniques, and the promotion of particular
   models that are remote from real-world phenomena.},

Abstract = {Fisher et al. have argued in this journal that various forms of
   political trust should be distinguished. In this note I critically
   review this assertion. A replication study of the British Election Study
   demonstrates clearly that political trust is a one-dimensional attitude,
   as citizens apparently do not distinguish between the functioning of
   various political institutions. An explanation for this pattern could be
   that political trust judgements reflect the prevailing political culture
   within a political system. It can rightly be assumed that political
   culture is a system characteristic that will guide the behaviour of most
   political actors and institutions.},

Journal = {HUMAN RIGHTS QUARTERLY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {33},
Number = {2},
Pages = {453-480},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This article examines two genres of the humanities literature-poetry of
   witness and prison memoirs-to articulate the distinctive or unique
   contributions that the humanities can make in understanding and possibly
   preventing human rights atrocities. Drawing upon the work of Carolyn
   Forche and the late Ken Saro-Wiwa, it argues that both genres are
   typically inspired by a liberatory and edifying view of literature in
   the way they shed moral light on social and historical tragedies, and in
   that respect they contribute to the goal of human rights education by
   making us better humans, heightening our,awareness, increasing our
   sensibility, and thus indirectly guiding our actions toward the
   establishment of a better world.
   Books and all forms of writing have always been objects of terror to

Title = {The Role of Dissident Values in Institutional Choice 1989 in Comparative
   Perspective},
Journal = {EAST EUROPEAN POLITICS AND SOCIETIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {25},
Number = {2},
Pages = {296-317},

Abstract = {Choices of political institutions have been subject to increasing
   examination in recent years. The literature on these choices generally
   argues that they are driven primarily by politicians' power interests,
   with impartial values playing at most a subservient role. Yet there are
   circumstances in which that may not be the case, in which values do come
   more to the fore. This article examines two propositions: that a
   principal legacy of significant democratic dissident activity is that it
   enhances the direct role of impartial values in initial choices of
   political institutions; and that the values involved have a specifically
   dissident hue. It begins by exploring theoretically the reasons for
   expecting these patterns. It then examines the propositions empirically
   through analysis of institutional choice in East-Central Europe in 1989
   and 1990. The third section expands the analysis, first by using Linz
   and Stepan's typology of nondemocratic regimes to consider the
   circumstances under which the posited mechanisms may operate, and then
   by tentatively exploring evidence from a broad range of cases. The
   article concludes that the circumstances in which dissident values
   matter significantly in institutional choices are rare but nevertheless
   generalizable. The analysis therefore provides a valuable addition to
   our understanding of institutional choice processes as well as of
   dissident legacies.},

Abstract = {The following research note surveys the most recent literature published
   in the past two years on higher education policy and politics in the
   United States. We identify three prominent themes in the literature
   including research on accountability, affordability, and issues
   concerning access and equity. We observe that there has been increased
   attention paid to theories of politics by those who study higher
   education, which has played a vital role in pushing the boundaries of
   education research to help begin answering many of the field's most
   complex and multi-dimensional questions. This theoretical development
   has allowed education policy scholars to better understand why various
   policies are adopted, how they change over time, which groups benefit,
   and how institutions are affected by changes in the economic and
   political landscape.},

Abstract = {Though the policy science movement was born with the purpose of
   counseling the Department of Defense on a plethora of security matters,
   modern research within the field of public policy has tended to neglect
   issues of defense and security focusing instead on a wide variety of
   domestic problems. This nearly exclusive focus on domestic issues
   remained largely intact until September 11, 2001, when the threat of
   terrorism propelled defense and security back onto the disciplinary
   research agenda. Though exceptionally slow to adjust, policy scholars
   are gradually coming to terms with this new reality and are beginning to
   focus on security and defense in a way that informs policymakers and
   advances policy theory. This research note is meant to introduce
   interested readers to this trend by exploring broad themes and exemplar
   works within the field over the last few years.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the extent to which early childhood education
   and care (ECEC) issues have been internationalized to become the focus
   of attention of a number of international organizations (IOs). Through
   an examination of policy statements and other primary documents, the
   article explores how these IOs frame the ECEC policy debate. While a
   great deal of those IOs' recommendations are increasingly cast in human
   capital development terms, multiple and competing frames are in
   evidence: one that rests on more social pedagogic norms that promote a
   concern for the well-being of the ``whole child{''}; another that
   focuses on children's rights to services and countries' obligations to
   deliver services; and another that focuses on parental employment
   concerns and the connection between ECEC policies and programs and
   women's employment. The article examines each of the frames in evidence
   and evaluates their ability to address concerns of both gender justice
   and child well-being.},

Journal = {POLITICAL STUDIES},

Volume = {59},
Number = {1},
Pages = {116-134},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This article examines the recent turn to the all-affected principle as a
   means to determine the proper boundaries of the people. The popularity
   of the principle notwithstanding, it argues that many of its proponents
   are prone to underestimating the challenge it raises to contemporary
   political theory. More specifically, two claims are made. Firstly, it
   argues that we must distinguish between two principles which, while both
   relating to the question of people-making, do so under radically
   different conditions: the all-subjected principle and the all-affected
   principle. Secondly, it argues that while the all-affected principle is
   a popular device in debates on cosmopolitan democracy it does not have a
   singular meaning. The all-affected principle in fact has three distinct
   roles to play, those of diagnosing, generating and justifying the
   boundaries of the people. The latter is the most difficult to account
   for in so far as it draws proponents of the all-affected principle into
   the very conflict that they set out to assess. It is concluded that this
   circumstance calls for a reorientation of the current debate, both with
   regard to the characterisation of the conflict under consideration and
   the challenge it raises to contemporary political theory.},

Abstract = {Why have militants in southern Thailand utilized anonymous and at times
   indiscriminate terrorist violence against civilians? This article gauges
   three explanations: resource wealth, weak states, and strong states. I
   argue that terrorist violence against civilians in southern Thailand is
   partially sustained and largely structured by the considerable
   institutional strength of the Thai state. This helps sustain the
   conflict by providing an additional grievance and it structures the form
   of violence by forcing militants underground and severing their links to
   civilians. A potential response would be to trim state agencies and
   scale back the presence of the state in Patani.},

   importance of the emergent powers (PEMS) and the regions in the present

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {48},
Number = {1},
Pages = {46-70},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {While the concept of friendship has been largely invisible within
   Western political debate, in the international political domain,
   `friendship' and the language of friends have been prominent in treaties
   and alliances between nations. Database searches on the topic of
   `politics and friendship' locate predominantly references concerning
   relationships between states. However, it has been war and enmity rather
   than friendship that has dominated analysis in international relations
   literature. In this article we provide a history of international
   treaties, focusing in particular on those named as friendship treaties.
   We will discuss the use of concepts and terminology related to
   friendship and the nomenclature associated with international alliances.
   It will be argued that friendship is more a tool of public relations and
   spin, rather than diplomacy and peace-building, and the cynical use of
   friendship does not sit easily with the Nehruvian concept of friendship
   as an important method of diplomacy that can act as a path to peace,
   goodwill and understanding between states and nations. International

Abstract = {The European Union in general and the European Commission in particular
   are characterised by supranational governance. The enlargement policy
   gives the Commission the opportunity to export and promote supranational
   norms and define the boundaries of Europe as a supranational polity
   through the conditionality of membership and intensive contact with the
   candidate countries. This article analyses the discourses of the
   Commission on Turkey and gives us insights into how well Turkey fits the
   supranational model in the eyes of Commission officials. It demonstrates
   how the boundaries of supranationalism are set and even challenged by
   the prospects of Turkey's accession.},

Abstract = {Business and environmental organisations' perceived access to climate
   policy-making is compared in the multi-level, pluralist system of the EU
   and in Norway, a parliamentary system with strong corporatist
   traditions. The extent to which the interest groups consider gaining
   access to climate policy-making to be demanding of resources is compared
   in two different political systems. It is concluded that business
   organisations consider their access to climate policy-making both at the
   EU level and in Norway as better than environmental organisations do,
   and that interest groups at the EU level consider it to be more
   resource-demanding to gain access than interest groups seeking access in
   Norway do.},

Pages = {684-710},
Abstract = {Sacred rituals and symbols can act as force multipliers that motivate
   and constrain the effectiveness of actors. Religious intelligence
   involves an assessment of how these rituals and symbols affect combat
   operations. The fourfold challenge faced by the religious intelligence
   analysts is to ascertain how prominent a role religion will play in a
   given conflict, what the relevant sacred phenomena are, how salient they
   are for the specific religious communities present, and how they will
   affect a given conflict. The case studies that form the core of this
   article highlight three issue areas open to religious intelligence
   collection and analysis, and exhibit variation in the ability of
   intelligence analysts to correctly assess those religious factors.
   Egyptian and Israeli decision making prior to the 1973 Arab-Israeli War
   illustrates how information about sacred time can influence war
   initiation. The diverging outcomes of two counterinsurgency operations
   at the same sacred site, ``Operation Blue Star{''} (1984) and
   ``Operation Black Thunder{''} (1988), demonstrate the utility of
   intelligence about the parameters of sacred space. A final case study
   explores the U.S. failure to grasp the importance of religious authority
   in the Iranian Revolution. I conclude by considering the actors best
   suited for gathering and processing religious intelligence. Religious
   intelligence requires interdisciplinary teams that combine expertise in
   religion, area studies, and military operations.},

Volume = {34},

Pages = {199-211},
Abstract = {In the pages of this journal in 2005, the author argued that the
   dismantling of the Revolutionary Organization 17N did not equate to the
   final elimination of terrorism in Greece. European experience, it was
   further argued, had shown that when a major terrorist organization is
   broken up, after a period of time a new generation of terrorists emerges
   that tends to lack the operational capabilities and scope of the group
   they attempt to imitate, but this does not render them less dangerous.
   Tellingly, the Revolutionary Struggle (RS) picked up the baton of
   violence from 17N before the latter's trial had even come to an end.
   This article examines RS's campaign of violence, explains its selection
   of targets and compares the group's ideological physiognomy and
   operational development with that of the group it aspired to emulate.},

Journal = {STUDIES IN CONFLICT \& TERRORISM},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {34},
Number = {7},
Pages = {556-571},
Abstract = {This article seeks to analyze the life histories of two former members,
   Patroklos Tselentis and Sotiris Kondylis, of the defunct terrorist
   group, the Greek Revolutionary Organization 17 November (1975-2002) in
   order to look for causes of disengagement, dissociation, and repentance.
   Analyzing the life histories of Patroklos Tselentis and Sotiris Kondylis
   offers valuable insights into the development of complex processes of
   involvement in and disengagement from 17 November terrorism. The detail
   stemming from their testimonies provides a more complete picture of the
   group's internal dynamics and challenges a range of simplistic
   stereotypes, not only about the individuals involved in terrorism but
   also about the ways in which they make decisions and reflect on their
   experiences of being part of a terrorist organization.},

Journal = {TERRORISM AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {23},
Number = {4},
Pages = {537-559},
Abstract = {A series of police raids in Principe Alfonso, a Muslim neighborhood
   located in the Spanish enclave of Ceuta, ``confirmed{''} law enforcement
   officers' worst fears: the barrio, long considered a hotbed of Islamist
   radicalization, had succumbed to the influence of extremists, making
   Spain more vulnerable to terrorist attacks. However, the meager results
   of the raids, as well as delays in the ensuing criminal investigation,
   raised troubling questions about the alleged terrorist plot and
   outsiders' perceptions of the Muslim community. Seeking answers to these
   questions, I conducted ethnographic field work in Principe shortly after
   the raids, interviewing residents, activists, and officials and
   observing the community at length. The community I experienced did not
   match the neighborhood I had read about. This article, the first
   ethnographic study of Ceuta to focus on radicalization, challenges
   conventional understandings of Principe Alfonso and highlights the value
   of ethnographic field work in terrorism studies.},

Abstract = {This paper approaches euroscepticism from the perspective of party
   positions and mass-level attitudes. It documents the nature and
   evolution of party euroscepticism from 1976 to 2005. Although the poles
   of party-based euroscepticism can be found, predictably, at the extremes
   of the party system, there is also a dynamic and contingent element to
   party positions that can only be accounted for on the basis of a
   strategic explanation. It also shows that, whenever parties attempted to
   mobilise voters on the basis of a eurosceptic discourse, voters
   responded to such attempts. Under those conditions, citizens' attitudes
   vis-a-vis the EC/EU, in terms of both the economic and the political
   consequences of integration, emerged as a relevant electoral cleavage in
   Portuguese politics.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {22},
Number = {2},
Pages = {131-150},
Abstract = {Purpose - Although the negative consequences of conflict in work
   settings have long been recognized, it is only in recent years that
   researchers have examined its positive effects, and the majority of this
   research has been conducted at the group level. This paper aims to
   examine the positive effects of conflict on individual. work behaviors
   by differentiating between task and relationship conflicts, as well as
   the moderating influence of two contextual variables.
   Design/methodology/approach - A survey was conducted with 166 pairs of
   supervisors and subordinates in China.
   Findings - Results supported the hypotheses that task conflict is
   positively related to both innovative behaviors and knowledge sharing
   behaviors while relationship conflict is negatively related to both
   individual-directed organizational citizenship and knowledge sharing
   behaviors. Support for innovation and reward system for
   relationship-building functioned as contextual factors to moderate the
   relationships between task and relationship conflicts and the workplace
   behaviors studied.
   Originality/value - The hypotheses proposed and most of the findings are
   original.},

Abstract = {Ministerial staff relationships form part of the networks within the
   core executive. This article uses data from a comprehensive empirical
   study of Australian ministerial staff to explore advisers' horizontal
   relationships with each other. It finds that the interactions between
   Australian ministerial advisers are a key part of their role, are highly
   valued by ministers and public servants, and are an important element of
   the cabinet system. The informal links and networks between partisan
   advisers are underpinned by commonly understood norms of behaviour and a
   clear power structure. This partisan arena of the core executive has
   become important to ministers and the collective functioning of
   government.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to analyse terrorism and the phenomena linked
   to it in East Central Europe. In comparison with a number of other
   regions of today's world, this area can currently seem to be a
   relatively oterrorism-free zone.o Although the number of terrorist
   attacks committed in this territory is insignificant, this does not mean
   that the risk of terrorism is entirely negligible in the region. This
   text explains some historical determinants of the current situation and
   describes the consequences both of regime change in the countries in
   question and of their foreign policy decisions after 1989. I also
   analyse the importance of East Central Europe as a logistical space for
   international terrorism (weapons procurement, stays of terrorists,
   etc.). I characterise the threats of Islamic and Middle Eastern
   terrorism in connection with the pro-American and pro-Israeli policies
   of East Central European countries, especially after 9/11, assess the
   risks posed by the domestic extremist scenes in those countries that
   have a relationship with terrorism, and take notice of the accusations
   of terrorism that have been voiced in international politics. On the
   basis of this data, I then provide an overview of the importance of East
   Central Europe for the contemporary study of terrorism.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses regulation by contract in public-private
   partnerships (PPPs) for infrastructure services. Although the benefits
   of competition for the market and subsequent regulatory contracts are
   recognized, the literature also identifies contract design failures.
   When considering these limitations, it is useful to distinguish between
   contracts associated with purely contractual PPPs (concessions) and
   contracts for institutionalized PPPs (mixed company). Two cases from the
   Portuguese water sector are used to illustrate problems arising in the
   preparation of public tender documents: the `best' bidder is often not
   the winner. Often, risks are not allocated correctly nor is effective
   monitoring ensured. Comparisons between the two types of contracts show
   how external regulation can be useful in mitigating contractual
   problems. This examination of bidding procedures and contract design
   yields several implications for policy-makers; in addition, the study
   presents recommendations for improving regulatory contracts.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Pages = {115-132},
Abstract = {There is renewed interest in identifying the causes of deforestation
   because it contributes about 17\% of the annual emissions of greenhouse
   gases. Despite considerable efforts, universal causes of tropical
   deforestation remain elusive. The existing models of tropical
   deforestation are assessed, and the problems involved in approaching the
   issue through the lens of governance reforms are examined. Although
   corruption continues to thrive, global and local economic incentives
   remain powerful motivating forces for deforestation. Because of the
   variation in regional and country causes, it may not be possible to
   derive a more unified theory, and general models of deforestation will
   continue to lack predictive value. Policies that demand reform in
   developing countries with high rates of deforestation will be
   ineffective unless they address the power, incentives and culture of
   local political elites.},

Abstract = {The use of force in asymmetrical warfare, and in counterinsurgency
   operations in particular, has been written off as strategically
   dangerous and politically irrational. The goal of the article is to
   examine the role of force in a modern military context and determine if
   victory through its application is theoretically feasible. This
   hypothesis will be tested against the backdrop of the conflict in
   Chechnya. The work will examine the Russian military and public policy
   as a subordinate subject to the overall inquiry of the article in an
   attempt to show that force was one of the major factors behind Russian
   military success in 2001.},

Abstract = {There is a growing recognition that charitable organizations are
   important actors in the policy process, but research has not, to date,
   systematically investigated whether reporting policy activity influences
   private giving to such organizations. This article develops the argument
   that reported lobbying should be positively related to donations because
   organizations seeking policy change consider such activities to be vital
   to their clients and missions and communicate that belief to potential
   donors. This article tests for the relationship between reported
   lobbying activities and private giving in analyses of 501(c)(3)
   organizations that filed Internal Revenue Service form 990 s in fiscal
   years 2000 and 2001. The results suggest that organizations that report
   policy activity receive more donations in the following fiscal year,
   with some variation across service type. The article concludes with a
   discussion of the implications for the policy process and scholars of
   nonprofit organizations.},

Abstract = {The Kashmir case is a conundrum in the study of women's roles in
   religio-political militancy. While traditional social structure and
   gendered hierarchies have been retained, public spaces have also been
   available to women to don more political and militant roles. This
   article looks at the multiple roles of women in the militancy in Kashmir
   and the discourses around them. Women's participation in the militancy
   has not found any mention in the nationalist narratives and Kashmiri
   women struggle to claim their share in the contemporary political
   discourse. Ambiguities remain about how the male-dominated Kashmiri
   nationalist and conflict discourse may have influenced inclusions and
   exclusions. Through a case study based on interviews conducted in
   Kashmir, this article argues that women's violent activities or their
   support to the militancy is altogether excluded or maneuvered to
   preserve existing gender norms and patriarchal traditions. This has
   dangerous implications as it tends to exclude women's voices in the
   peace processes.},

Abstract = {This article describes the dynamics of the global economy's centre of
   gravity, the average location of economic activity across geographies on
   Earth. The calculations here take into account all the GDP produced on
   this planet. The article finds that in 1980 the global economy's centre
   of gravity was mid-Atlantic. By 2008, from the continuing rise of China
   and the rest of East Asia, that centre of gravity had drifted to a
   location east of Helsinki and Bucharest. Extrapolating growth in almost
   700 locations across Earth, this article projects the world's economic
   centre of gravity to locate by 2050 literally between India and China.
   Observed from Earth's surface, that economic centre of gravity will
   shift from its 1980 location 9,300 km or 1.5 times the radius of the
   planet.},

Title = {A liberal grand strategy in a realist world? Power, purpose and the EU's
   changing global role},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {18},
Number = {2},
Pages = {144-163},
Abstract = {The European Union (EU) is one of the most unusual global political
   actors, and it inspires numerous scholarly debates about its power and
   purpose. One of the most important such debates involves the role of
   material versus non-material/ideational power resources - or hard versus
   soft power - in understanding the EU's `actorness'. Given the
   increasingly wide range of EU policy competencies, and the increasingly
   complex demands placed on the EU, this article embeds this debate in the
   larger context of grand strategy. It first argues that the EU's efforts
   as a global actor do conform to three basic components of grand
   strategy: physical security; economic prosperity; and value projection.
   Second, it analyses the content of the EU's grand strategic goals at
   three levels of analysis: intra-EU; regional (or neighbourhood); and
   global. Finally, it analyses the EU's implementation of its (largely
   liberal) strategic goals, particularly in terms of how they might
   compete with those of other global actors, such as the United States
   (US).},

Abstract = {This article sheds light on the identity and activities of foreign
   fighters who were active in Afghanistan and Pakistan between 2002 and
   2006. This is done through analyzing a series of omartyr
   biographiesoshort biographical stories of killed militantsissued by the
   Al Qaeda network in 2008. The study argues that there was little
   migration of foreign fighters from abroad to Afghanistan and Pakistan in
   this period, and practically no influx of fighters from Iraq. Al Qaeda's
   activities in the region were upheld by fighters who managed to flee
   from Afghanistan during and after the U.S.-led invasion in late 2001.
   After re-settling in the tribal areas of Pakistan, the main concern for
   these fighters was to fight a guerrilla war against U.S. and NATO troops
   in Afghanistan, not to plot terrorist attacks in Western countries. The
   study demonstrates that over time, the foreign fighters became more
   integrated in local communities. These early developments may help to
   explain why Al Qaeda continues to enjoy a strong sanctuary in the tribal
   areas of Pakistan today.},

Abstract = {For most of the first decade of the present century, Moldova was
   governed by the Party of Communists of Moldova, led by Vladimir Voronin,
   who displayed impressive political skills as the president of the
   republic and party leader. In office, the party engaged in a political
   reorientation towards Europe in 2004-5 and an ideological transformation
   in 2008, yet the party remains a superficially reformed, non-transmuted
   communist successor party. During eight years in office, 2001-9, it led
   a semi-consolidated authoritarian regime similar to the neo-communist
   constructs of Ion Iliescu in Romania and Than Videnov in Bulgaria. The
   crisis of 2009 weakened the party, however, with defections of leading
   communists to other parties. Moldova has thus returned to a situation of
   `pluralism by default' and a hybrid political regime, in which the
   communists, though weakened, remain a potent political force.},

Title = {What participants do. A practice based approach to public participation
   in two policy fields},
Journal = {CRITICAL POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {5},
Number = {2},
Pages = {169-186},
Abstract = {The rise of public participation in policy is an integral part of the
   shift from government to governance, and is presented as the best and
   most appropriate answer to requests for democratic policymaking. Both in
   official accounts and in the work of scholars, participation is situated
   in a discourse that combines a deliberative ethics with a managerialist
   pathos. This discourse has two important omissions: the neglect of the
   role of power in participation, and the poor coverage of the activities
   of participants. To remedy these omissions, this paper proposes a
   practice based approach to the study of participation. Two case studies
   of participants' practices are presented: one dealing with spatial
   planning, the other with qualitative water policies. The case studies
   show similarities and differences in practices of participation. These
   are related to the values that participants hold, the roles they adopt,
   and the context in which they are situated. The paper concludes that
   power relations in participation are only fully understood in the light
   of a complex field of practice that stretches beyond formal venues and
   official accounts of participation.},

Title = {Three Waves of BITs: The Global Diffusion of Foreign Investment Policy},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {55},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1047-1073},

Abstract = {Bilateral investment treaties (BITs), agreements that provide extensive
   rights and protection to foreign investors, were first adopted in the
   1960s, proliferated in the late 1980s and 1990s, especially among
   developing countries, and seemingly fell out of fashion after 2001. To
   explain this life cycle of diffusion across the international state
   system, we argue that BIT signing followed a traditional logic of
   diffusion for an innovation albeit here in the policy realm. In the
   first period, BITs provided a solution to the time inconsistency problem
   facing host governments and foreign investors. In the second period,
   these treaties became the global standard governing foreign investment.
   As the density of BITs among peer countries increased, more countries
   signed them in order to gain legitimacy and acceptance without a full
   understanding of their costs and competencies. More recently, as the
   potential legal liabilities involved in BIT signing have become more
   broadly understood, the pattern of adoption has reverted to a more
   competitive and rational logic. Our empirical tests of BIT signing over
   four decades provide evidence for such a three-stage model.},

Abstract = {IR's dominant theoretical and methodological approaches are, to varying
   degrees, compliance oriented. IR needs a theory of resistance if it is
   to survive its current methodological and ethical crisis. Resistance,
   read from a broadly Foucaultian perspective, is a process in which
   hidden, small-scale and marginal agencies have an impact on power, on
   norms, civil society, the state and the `international'. This may be in
   the form of individual or grass-roots critical agency not coordinated or
   mobilized on a large scale but still globally connected. Such agency is
   often discursive and aimed at peaceful change and transformation.
   Through such critical agency a post-colonial civil society has emerged,
   which is transversal, transnational, fragmented, but may be constitutive
   of new, hybrid and post-liberal forms of peace.},

Abstract = {The concept of `health security' has been increasingly apparent in
   recent years in both academic and policy discourses on transborder
   infectious disease threats. Yet it has been noted that there are a range
   of conceptualisations of `health security' in circulation and that
   confusion over the concept is creating international tensions with some
   states (particularly from the Global South) fearing that `health
   security' in reality means securing the West. This article examines
   these tensions but puts forward an alternative explanation for them. It
   begins by looking at the different `health securities' that characterise
   the contemporary global health discourse, arguing that there is in fact
   a good deal more consensus than we are often led to believe. In
   particular there is a high level of agreement evident over what the
   major threats to `health security' are and what should be done about
   them. These are a particular set of health risks which are primarily
   seen as major threats by Western developed nations, and contemporary
   global responses - often couched in the language of global health
   security - have a tendency to focus on containment rather than
   prevention. The article makes the case that to resolve the tensions
   around (global) health security there is the need for a more explicit
   recognition of the primary beneficiaries of the current system, and of
   who is bearing the costs. Only following such a recognition can
   meaningful debates be carried out about the appropriate prioritisation
   of global health security in relation to other global health governance
   priorities.},

   2008-2009 Gaza Conflict},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {55},
Number = {6},
Pages = {938-969},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The lack of temporal disaggregation in conflict data has so far
   presented a strong obstacle to analyzing the short-term dynamics of
   military conflict. Using a novel data set of hourly dyadic conflict
   intensity scores drawn from Twitter and other social media sources
   during the Gaza Conflict (2008-2009), the author attempts to fill a gap
   in existing studies. The author employs a vector autoregression (VAR) to
   measure changes in Israel's and Hamas's military response dynamics
   immediately following two important junctures in the conflict: the
   introduction of Israeli ground troops and the UN Security Council vote.
   The author finds that both Hamas's and Israel's response to provocations
   by the other side increase (both by about twofold) immediately after the
   ground invasion, but following the UN Security Council vote, Israel's
   response is cut in half, while Hamas's slightly increases. In addition,
   the author provides a template for researchers to harness social media
   to capture the micro-dynamics of conflict.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL THEORY},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This paper elucidates a theory of identity formation and applies it to
   the study of international negotiation. The theory acknowledges that
   actors/agents can adopt a multiplicity of identities, and it treats
   changes in the salience of identities as endogenous to the contextually
   dependent processes of interpersonal and intergroup interactions.
   Typically, strong identities are viewed as encouraging conflict and
   exacerbating interstate disputes. Our theory, however, suggests a
   palliative role for identity: third-party mediation can more effectively
   resolve conflicts when it enhances shared, if initially less salient,
   aspects of the disputants' identities. We discuss several causal
   pathways through which the process of enhancing identity salience can
   increase the likelihood of successful conflict resolution, providing a
   complementary mechanism for the effectiveness of mediation to those
   extant in the literature. The paper concludes with a practical method
   for applying the theory's insights to the choice of mediator and the
   mediator's technique.},

Abstract = {Civil conflict and state failure has often been linked to breakdowns in
   regime legitimacy. Trust in government is a critical element of regime
   legitimacy and the state's ability to mediate between the demands of
   competing groups within society. We contend that government capability
   is a primary factor in shaping individuals' ascription of legitimacy to
   the state. Capable governments foster perceptions of legitimacy while
   poor institutional performance decreases the degree to which individuals
   trust their government. While some tests of this relationship exist in
   extant literature, much of the work fails to integrate both micro- and
   macro-level factors, is confined to regions with established state
   performance, or is based on single-country studies. Our approach avoids
   many of these deficiencies by using 32 Afrobarometer surveys collected
   across 16 different countries from 2000 to 2005 and employing
   hierarchical linear models to estimate the effects of temporal-specific,
   state-level variables on levels of individual trust. We find that higher
   institutional capacity is associated with increased levels of individual
   trust in government across African countries. Furthermore, we
   demonstrate that this effect on political trust is independent of other
   individual-level attitudes, socio-economic characteristics, and a
   state's prior internal conflicts.},

Abstract = {This study examines the Internet neutrality issue in Korea by analyzing
   the debates among the stakeholders. It addresses the dynamic discussions
   of the issues by identifying how diverse groups of stakeholders are
   affected by various actions taken by the emergence of Internet
   neutrality. It presents a statistical analysis that reveals the factors
   implicated in the Internet neutrality debate and significant differences
   among individuals on opposing sides in the debate. The findings reveal
   insights into the connection between specific factors and positions in
   the Internet neutrality debate. The findings show that the issue of
   Internet neutrality is complex and as multifaceted as the parties'
   diverse interests. It concludes by proposing an effective model to
   govern Internet neutrality in Korea, based on the typology proposed by
   Strover.},

Abstract = {The article provides an overview of the state of the art of sociological
   research on price formation. The dominant trait of the sociological
   approach to prices is to understand price formation not as the outcome
   of individual preferences but as the result of the social and political
   forces operating within the market field. The article proceeds from the
   concept of market fields and is organized around the three dominant
   approaches in economic sociology: the network approach, the
   institutional approach and the cultural approach.},

Abstract = {A growing body of literature has found that photographs of politicians
   can influence electoral preferences. In this article we assess whether
   candidates rating higher on electoral attractiveness perform better in a
   series of hypothetical elections, and whether their advantage is
   magnified when their appearance is printed not only on campaign
   materials but also on ballot papers. We find that candidate appearance
   only had a significant impact on vote choice when photographs were
   printed on ballot papers, and even then there was an impact on only some
   of the elections, notably those pitting male against female candidates.
   Photographs had most impact on the choices of those least interested in
   politics and least likely to vote, and magnified a tendency (among
   voters of all ages) to favour younger candidates and to penalise older
   candidates. Findings suggest that the addition of photographs to ballot
   papers could affect the outcomes of marginal British constituency races.},

Abstract = {Between 2000 and 2011, Russia and China bolstered their strategic
   partnership. Their principal motive is a shared lack of trust in the
   United States, since Washington's global strategy has fostered a growing
   sense of being under threat from both countries. Political convergence
   (on a bilateral level and in international organizations, especially the
   un) and military collaboration have been the two most important
   manifestations of this reinforcement of China-Russia links. To this may
   be added cooperation on regional security matters (in Central Asia and
   the Pacific Rim countries) and the notable increase in trade and
   financial transactions between the two nations.},

Title = {Fight against Corruption in Peru: Ten Years from Fujimori},
Journal = {REVISTA DEL CLAD REFORMA Y DEMOCRACIA},
Year = {2011},
Number = {51},
Pages = {211+},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {After the regime of President Alberto Fujimori (1990-2000), Peru
   presented an effort without precedent, at a Latin American level, in the
   anti-corruption fight: within Valentin Paniagua's transitional
   government, Peru generates an efficient anti-corruption structure which,
   by its strength and results, is an international reference. What
   happened next? From the Presidency of Alejandro Toledo (2001-2006) and
   during the Presidency of Alan Garcia (2006-2010), the effort diluted:
   organize offices, national commissions and councils of high level, all
   of them with limited effectiveness.
   Why Peru did not hold the proven strategy implemented in Paniagua's
   administration? The experience accumulated in a decade, is the sum of
   discontinuous and scattered actions involving the Executive, the
   Legislative, the Judicial and civil society. At the same time, it is a
   valuable opportunity to reconstruct the events that occur in the
   implementation of public policies against corruption, as a sensitive
   issue..
   Ten years from the fall of the Fujimori regime, period in which this
   study emphasizes, the Alan Garcia's Presidency, suffers a crisis of
   government generated by a corruption scandal, the ``petroaudios{''},
   which led to the fall of the Cabinet of Ministers in 2008. The response
   of the Executive was the preparation and publication in media of the
   ``National Plan of Fight against Corruption 2008{''}; a document that
   could be politically powerful, but limited in the public work
   effectiveness.
   Before and after the ``petroaudios{''} scandal, in the last Peruvian
   presidential administration existed complaints against corruption,
   without an action from the existing organizational structure to suppress
   them, or punish them. Combating corruption is, existing item in Peru. A
   Multiparty Commission that will investigate the alleged cases of
   corruption presented during Alan Garcia's Presidency was recently
   approved in the Peruvian Parliament.
   Using the instrumental case method, and based on interviews and
   documentary sources, it is described what had been done in Peru to
   combat corruption following the fall of the Fujimori regime and for a
   period of ten years. The lessons that can be derived from the particular
   case are, for Latin American region, usable knowledge in the permanent
   aspiration of creating institutions that generate much more egalitarian
   and fair conditions. The present study was conducted in the Institute of
   Peru from the San Martin de Porres University, as a senior visiting
   researcher.},

Journal = {GLOBAL POLICY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {2},
Number = {3},
Pages = {286-296},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This article explores the reasons efforts to attain water security by
   states and the international water policy community often fall short of
   their goals, and suggests a conceptual tool as partial remedy. The main
   shortcomings of prevailing water security policy and thinking are found
   to stem from narrow and determinist analysis that is based on a
   separation of biophysical and social processes of water resources and
   their use. Undue confidence is placed in physical scarcity thresholds,
   for example, while distributive issues are ignored. Water resources are
   also found to be treated in isolation, as if independent of the food,
   climate or energy security of individuals, communities and states. The
   `web' of water security introduced here emphasises combined readings of
   the social and biophysical processes that enable or prevent national
   water security. These processes are mediated by a socioeconomic and
   political context replete with power asymmetries, such that water
   security for some rests on the water insecurity of others. Sustainable
   national water security in the long term, it is suggested, will be
   guided by principles of balance between related security areas, and
   equitability of distribution of resources between the actors involved.},

Abstract = {The paper reviews recent socio-economic changes in the 10 new EU member
   states of Central and Eastern Europe and the earlier and latest debates
   on the emergence of the post-communist welfare state regime. It asks two
   questions: are the new EU member states more similar to each other in
   their social problems encountered than to the rest of the EU world? Do
   they exhibit enough common socio-economic and institutional features to
   group them into the distinct/unified post-communist welfare regime that
   deviates from any well-known welfare state typology?
   The findings of this paper indicate that despite some slight variation
   within, the new EU countries exhibit lower indicators compared to the
   EU-15 as it comes to the minimum wage and social protection expenditure.
   The degree of material deprivation and the shadow economy is on average
   also higher if compared to the EU-15 or the EU-27. However, then it
   comes to at-risk-of-poverty rate after social transfers or Gini index,
   some Eastern European outliers especially the Check Republic, but also
   Slovenia, Slovakia and Hungary perform the same or even better than the
   old capitalist democracies. Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Romania,
   Bulgaria, Poland, however, show many similarities in their social
   indicators and performances and this group of countries never perform
   better than the EU-15 or the EU-27 averages. Nevertheless, the
   literature reviews on welfare state development in the CEE region reveal
   a number of important institutional features in support of identifying
   the distinct/unified post-communist welfare regime. Most resilient of it
   are: an insurance-based programs that played a major part in the social
   protection system; high take-up of social security; relatively low
   social security benefits; increasing signs of liberalization of social
   policy; and the experience of the Soviet/Communist type of welfare
   state, which implies still deeply embedded signs of solidarity and
   universalism. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The

Abstract = {This article starts from the assumption that emotions are inherently
   part of life in the international system, but that this is not as well
   reflected in the discipline of International Relations. The study of
   emotions can be incorporated more systematically into the discipline
   through more rigorous theorizing about how states-as main actors in
   world politics-experience and act on emotions. To do so, I draw on
   intergroup emotions theory, an emerging area of research in social
   psychology. This approach points out the process by which groups come to
   have emotional reactions, and from there how emotions generate
   intergroup perceptions and intergroup behavior-or foreign policies in
   the case of states. Understanding states-as-groups addresses many of the
   criticisms mainstream IR scholars direct toward the study of emotions,
   including how individual-level factors such as emotions matter for
   intergroup relationships.},

Abstract = {Several possible relationships between natural resources and civil
   conflict have been hypothesized and tested in the literature. The impact
   of resources on conflict should depend on the circumstances of the group
   that (potential) rebels see themselves as representing and depend upon
   for support. While `lootable' resources such as alluvial diamonds have
   been shown to increase the likelihood of insurgency, among territorially
   concentrated ethnic groups looting by rebels recruiting from the group
   is counterproductive because it imposes negative externalities on the
   rebel constituency. However, local mineral abundance could encourage
   rebellion indirectly, by promoting the development of secessionist
   objectives, since autonomy or independence would allow the rebel
   constituency to enjoy a larger share of the benefits flowing from
   mineral revenues. On the other hand, mineral abundance could encourage
   the government to exercise greater surveillance and control over
   potentially restive minority populations. On balance, then, mineral
   abundance should affect ethnoregional conflict primarily by encouraging
   ethnic rebels to adopt limited, territorial-autonomy objectives as
   opposed to governmental objectives. This hypothesis is tested with a
   new, global dataset of substate mineral production. Local mineral
   resource abundance is indeed negatively associated with governmental
   conflict among ethnoregional groups and positively related to
   secessionist or territorial conflict. Moreover, it is the total value of
   mineral production that matters, not specific types of minerals such as
   oil or diamonds. The net effect of mineral abundance on the total risk
   of intrastate conflict onset among ethnoregions is essentially zero.},

Abstract = {The U.S. economy and the hegemony of the dollar have for some time been
   sustained by a gigantic infusion of money from the rest of the world.
   The enormous size of its debt raises the prospect of the collapse of the
   dollar as a global reserve currency. Central banks worldwide have almost
   stopped accumulating dollars, and China has been divesting itself of the
   mountain of ``toxic assets{''} that U.S. Treasury bonds have become. The
   fate of the dollar as a reserve currency will depend heavily on the
   effectiveness of the economic policy implemented by the United States in
   confronting the current crisis. The massive intervention undertaken has
   involved placing public funds in the service of a new cycle of
   capitalist profit-making-a new bubble inflated by public expenditures.
   When it becomes clear that the rescue plans and stimulus programs of the
   administration are ineffective and unsustainable, the crisis of
   confidence in the dollar may enter its final phase. The dilemma for the
   countries of the Third World will be to configure the new order that
   follows or be configured by it.},

Year = {2011},
Volume = {21},

Pages = {495-519},

Abstract = {This article examines the institutional motivations underlying
   innovation. Although attention to motivation played a role in early
   theorizing on innovation, the phenomenon is understudied empirically. A
   clearer understanding of the relative importance of differing
   institutional motivations can illuminate why public organizations
   adopting innovative strategies and programs often fail to replicate the
   benefits of earlier implementations. We draw on organizational and
   political theory to identify varying dynamics that may lead to adoption
   of new practices. Specifically, we theorize that organizational
   motivations may relate to efficiency concerns, to management of internal
   bureaucratic politics and external demands, or to the search for
   legitimacy vis-a-vis peer organizations. We test hypotheses based on
   each of these accounts employing data on the timing and breadth of
   e-government innovations by American municipalities between 1994 and
   2003. Our findings suggest that externally oriented motivations appear
   more influential than internal factors such as bureaucratic politics.
   This suggests that over the long run, the evolution of e-governance may
   make local governments more responsive to external constituencies if
   barriers to change may be overcome.},

Abstract = {International Law in its current form is dominated by positivism and
   voluntarism; yet, it has accepted a number of concepts from the Natural
   Law tradition that seem on the face of things to ill-fit the dominant
   normative complex. Of primary concern here are the Natural Law notions
   of categorical obligation that have been brought into International Law
   in the form of jus cogens rules. A number of interesting questions
   present themselves. What are positivists doing talking about
   categoricals? How have they found a way to make this fit within their
   larger doctrine? Have positivists adopted the language of categorical
   obligation, but only the language, not the correlative practices? Is it
   simply a matter of smuggling in alien concepts and shoehorning them
   despite the lack of fit, or have they created something new that only
   seems not to fit? Ultimately, what we find is that International Law has
   accepted this idea in a form that ultimately is limited by voluntarism's
   insistence on the voluntary and specific character of all obligations.},

Abstract = {Villagers' committee elections in Chinese rural areas highlight the
   promise as well as the challenge of democratization in a one-party
   state. Why are there huge regional variations in terms of voter turnout
   rate? Based on a large survey conducted in 2005, we argue that electoral
   procedures have played a crucial role in signaling the democratic intent
   of local governments. Villagers were more responsive to more meaningful
   elections with higher-quality electoral procedures. In addition,
   competitive politics has reactivated traditional social ties and
   networks in village lives, which have mobilized villagers to voting
   stations. The results are robust to endogeneity tests and other model
   specifications. These empirical findings highlight electoral dynamics
   that are common in many transitional democracies. They also imply some
   major challenges facing China's rural democracy.},

Abstract = {Realists have argued that fears over the defection or defeat of an ally
   can draw states into wars against their broader interests
   ({''}chain-ganging{''}). However, the logic underpinning chain-ganging
   theory is flawed, and the paradigmatic case-World War I-is not an
   instance of chain-ganging causing the outbreak of war. The paper draws
   on recent literatures on alliance restraint and the origins of World War
   I to provide the first extensive critique of chain-ganging theory,
   examines the impact on chain-ganging of a number of factors including
   power and interests, and suggests policy implications for an emerging
   multipolar system.},

Abstract = {Many portrayals of the European Union (EU) as an international actor are
   based on selective appraisals of its external activity or restraint.
   This article explores the concept of a pragmatic power EUrope. It
   considers pragmatism as an academic approach or philosophy, and as an
   attitude or method of political practice. It then aims to generate
   interaction between these understandings by applying them to important
   contemporary `partnerships' for the EU: Russia and China. These examples
   reveal the EU as a composite rather than unified actor, with the
   pragmatism of individual components undermining a more influential
   collective power.},

Abstract = {The traditional portrait of civil servants in Italy, as well as in most
   other countries, has always been one of not particularly efficient
   employees yet have the benefit of a secure job and can look forward to a
   comfortable retirement package. In order to change this image, public
   management reforms have largely focused on civil servants since the
   1990s. However, many academics and practitioners claim some inertia in
   the reform implementation. In this article we aim to identify the
   determinants of such inertia in Italy's civil service reforms and we
   analyze data from 885 Italian municipalities expected to adopt the pay
   system reform for senior officials, as required by national legislature.
   Our findings stress the importance of accrued legitimacy, external
   public endorsement, and the influence of key internal stakeholders (like
   administrative leaders) as major vehicles to promote or slow down the
   implementation of administrative reforms in the public sector.},

Journal = {BUSINESS AND POLITICS},
Year = {2011},

Abstract = {A previous study suggests that U. S. Senators trade common stock with a
   substantial informational advantage compared to ordinary investors and
   even corporate insiders. We apply precisely the same methods to test for
   abnormal returns from the common stock investments of Members of the
   U.S. House of Representatives. We measure abnormal returns for more than
   16,000 common stock transactions made by approximately 300 House
   delegates from 1985 to 2001. Consistent with the study of Senatorial
   trading activity, we find stocks purchased by Representatives also earn
   significant positive abnormal returns (albeit considerably smaller
   returns). A portfolio that mimics the purchases of House Members beats
   the market by 55 basis points per month (approximately 6\% annually).},

Abstract = {We argue that new international borders are rarely new. We propose that
   when states choose new borders they use previous administrative
   frontiers to solve a difficult short-term bargaining problem and a
   long-term coordination problem. With a unique new set of data collected
   specifically for this project, we systematically examine the new
   international borders of the twentieth century resulting from secession,
   partition, and the use of force. New international borders, we find, are
   drawn not according to principles of ``nationalism{''} or defensible
   borders, but rather according to previous administrative frontiers. How
   borders are drawn has important consequences for international
   stability: borders drawn along previously existing internal or external
   administrative frontiers experience fewer future territorial disputes
   and have a much lower risk of militarized confrontation if a dispute
   emerges.},

Year = {2011},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Pages = {72-84},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {I examine the roots of ``Responsibility to Protect'' in international
   ethics. International responsibility to protect is as a whole at odds
   with international law, but deeply familiar to Liberal international
   ethics. But, controversially, I argue that even the Realist and Marxist
   traditions include commitments to human respect that make humanitarian
   concerns far from foreign. I then explore how it evolved out of the
   crisis in Kosovo and the question of its policy significance today in
   cases in which it has been invoked, ranging from Myanmar to Kenya and
   Guinea - sometimes explicitly, sometimes implicitly, successfully and
   not. My conclusion is that R2P has contributed to the increasing
   pluralism, contested and contestable, of the normative architecture of
   world politics, and thus has produced confusion. But, this confusion may
   reduce as RtoP norms are accumulated in customary law and reshape the
   discourse of international ethics. In any case, where the alternative to
   pluralism is clarity that either abandons vulnerable populations or
   imposes unrealistic expectations of enforced human rights, confusion is
   a step forward, a resource for responsible policy and the best we are
   likely to get if we continue to care about both vulnerable populations
   and national sovereignty.},

Abstract = {This article discusses Rod Rhodes' contribution to governance theory.
   Rod Rhodes' work on governance has been much quoted. He has contributed
   to setting a new governance agenda and to an ongoing governance debate.
   This debate has also had an impact on political practice. However, as
   this paper argues, Rhodes' definition of governance is problematic in
   that it is narrowly identified with networks, and it is not consistently
   applied. Rhodes' concept of governance remains too narrow for it to be
   able to include a comparative analysis of a variation of governance
   forms. In addition, the governance concept needs to be equipped with
   tools from political economy in order be able to incorporate important
   aspects of interests, power and conflict. The way forward for governance
   theory would seem to involve the inclusion of political economy analysis
   of context as it affects beliefs and dilemmas.},

Abstract = {As a result of the review of the indigenous policy defined by Chilean
   President Michelle Bache let, a proposal on how to prepare and implement
   a public policy in times of crisis and political tension is presented.
   The article emphasizes the description of the phases of the process
   rather than the theoretical discussion of the formulation of public
   policies.
   The political climate in which the formulation of the policy begins is
   defined, as well as the initial phase for defining the basis for public
   intervention. It then outlines the initial steps the government takes in
   reaction to an adverse situation. Next, the work explains how the policy
   is designed and how it receives presidential approval in a very short
   period of time.
   The purpose of this paper is not to present the fundamental concepts of
   the policy ``Re-conocer: pacto social por la multiculturalidad{''}, but
   to explain how this document was formulated and implemented.
   The various issues faced during the implementation phase, the framework
   for this phase as described in the Work Plan -which consists of a set of
   specific action projects-, as well as the way in which an outline for
   the governance of the policy was set are all discussed in the article.
   It describes the forms of action required to develop the policy in the
   execution phase and also explains the political moment in which the
   policy is reviewed by the authorities.
   The illustrated case allows for a review of the traditional process of
   public policy making, drawing conclusions that may help with similar
   processes if a crisis arises: the government authority needs to
   intervene and the time available is not sufficient to take each and
   every step recommended by the traditional method of public policy
   formulation.
   This document helps to understand that in order to effectively respond
   to a crisis, policy making is as important as its implementation. As
   leadership is always necessary for successful public policies, in times
   of crisis leadership becomes a matter of crucial importance. In a
   crisis, successful public policy is directly linked to the importance
   that presidential authority gives the conflict, its own interest in
   finding a solution and to the content that the authority wants to give
   such initiatives.},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This article examines the question of whether international markets in
   allowances conferring the right to emit greenhouse gases are consistent
   with a cosmopolitan approach to global and intergenerational justice.
   After placing emissions trading within the context of both climate
   change policy and cosmopolitan political theory, three normative
   objections are examined to the use of emissions trading to mitigate the
   threat of dangerous climate change. Each objection arises from a
   different application of cosmopolitan thinking: (i) the potentially
   corrosive impact of greater use of emissions allowances markets on the
   environmental values of successive generations of atmospheric users;
   (ii) the awkward relationship between emissions markets and the norms of
   procedural justice endorsed by all prominent cosmopolitans; and (iii)
   the injustice expressed by policy instruments that commodify the
   atmosphere. It is argued that, while each objection should prompt some
   care in the construction and implementation of emissions trading schemes
   to guarantee their legitimacy among existing and future users of the
   atmosphere, they do not generate a decisive normative challenge to the
   use of markets, properly defined and regulated, to slow global warming.},

Abstract = {Demands for the inclusion of children, the youngest citizens, in
   democratic decision making are increasing. Although there is an
   abundance of empirical research on the political orientations of
   adolescents, there is a paucity of research on younger children's
   orientations. Our panel study of more than 700 children in their first
   year of primary school shows that these young children already exhibit
   consistent, structured political orientations. We examine the
   distribution and development of political knowledge, issue orientations,
   and notions of good citizenship. We find achievement differences between
   subgroups at the beginning of the school year, and these differences do
   not disappear. Children from ethnic minorities and lower socioeconomic
   residence areas show relatively less developed political orientations,
   and they do not improve as much over the school year as other children.
   Furthermore, normative political orientations and cognitive orientations

Abstract = {Previous research on Muslims in Christian majority states either focuses
   exclusively on Muslims or assesses public opinion concerning Muslims
   and/or religious minorities but does not assess cross-national trends
   comparing Muslims and non-Muslims. This study compares the extent of
   religious discrimination against Muslim minorities in Christian majority
   countries to the treatment of other religious minorities in the same
   countries as well as to the treatment of religious minorities in
   non-Christian countries. We utilize a new dataset that includes 24 types
   of restrictions placed on the religious practices or religious
   institutions of 590 religious minorities in 175 countries. This measure
   is more detailed than any previous measure and, unlike previous studies,
   we include all religious minorities which meet a minimum population
   threshold. We find that Muslim minorities do not suffer from
   disproportionate levels of religious discrimination when compared to
   other minorities in Christian majority states. This is true both of the
   extent of discrimination and specific types of discrimination.
   Discrimination is relatively low in general in Christian majority
   states, other than those in the former Soviet bloc, when compared to
   non-Christian states.},

Title = {ONE-STOP SHOPS FOR SOCIAL WELFARE: THE ADAPTATION OF AN ORGANIZATIONAL
   FORM IN THREE COUNTRIES},
Journal = {PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {89},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1451-1468},
Abstract = {In recent years welfare services in Western Europe have been criticized
   for poor coordination. In response, seamlessness has emerged as a vision
   for public administration with one-stop shops' viewed as means to reach
   this. This article conceptualizes the one-stop shop and presents a three
   country case study to examine its drivers and its adaptation. In all
   countries the reforms meant mergers driven by hopes for a single
   entrance to services as well as proximity to citizens. However, the
   analysis of task portfolios, participant structure, instruments and
   autonomy reveal important variations in the adaptations. The specific
   configurations of one-stop shops that emerged were partially a product
   of compromises and negotiations influenced by the political and
   performance priorities of central government. The classical trade-off
   between specialization and coordination persists, but by offering users
   ICT-based services one can to some extent maintain specialization behind
   the frontline and still provide services that are coordinated from a
   user perspective.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses the two most important international programmes for
   the voluntary regulation of corporate behaviour: the OECD Guidelines for
   Multinational Corporations and the UN Global Compact. It argues that
   international organizations adopted them mostly for reasons of political
   feasibility: by imposing minimal constraints on constituents the codes
   circumvented the most pressing problems of political acceptability
   associated with standard setting. It finds no clear evidence, however,
   that the network solutions adopted are technically more effective than
   traditional forms of regulation. The paper concludes that while it is
   unlikely that corporate behaviour will change simply as a result of
   participation in these programmes, if the programmes increase their
   ability to consistently discriminate between good and bad performers,
   the resulting `soft' sanctioning power has the potential to alter
   corporate behaviour in the long run.},

   EU demands on democratisation in the region of Western Balkans are
   crucial to achieve the respect for human rights. The human rights
   standards as part of the conditionality criteria of the EU is a clear
   message towards the countries aspiring membership. However, Serbia
   progress in the field has been difficult due to several internal

Title = {Investigating Postmodern Politics in the Philippines Using Reflexivity
   Theory},
Journal = {PHILIPPINE POLITICAL SCIENCE JOURNAL},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {32},
Number = {55},
Pages = {73-102},
Abstract = {A usual reading of postmodern critiques of science, progress, and the
   nation-state, has casted postmodernism as pessimistic, if not
   apolitical. In fact, it is even read as conservative, as it
   unintentionally enables a continuation of the status quo by its
   privileging of local forms of resistance, even as it is critical of
   grand narratives of resistance. While the privileging of micro-politics
   in everyday forms of resistance may enable freedom of and subversive
   acts by individuals, the need for more collective forms of action
   remains a challenge. This article offers the theory of reflexivity as a
   template to imagine the possibility of collective action being enabled
   by postmodern politics. In contrast to the relatively random,
   unorganized, and individualized form of micro-politics which post-modern
   theorists argue for, reflexivity theory allows for more organized,
   coordinated collective action, albeit in domains that are outside of the
   traditional confines of statist politics, taking advantage of postmodern
   venues, such as cyberspace. This essay will inquire into the
   applicability and implications of the theory of reflexivity in the
   Philippines, particularly on the transformation of random,
   individualized interventions in social networking sites into becoming a
   foundation for ``cyber-collective action{''}, thereby enabling the
   creation of new political communities and citizenship in cyberspace.},

   Factors and Threats},
Journal = {TERRORISM AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {23},
Number = {5},
Pages = {711-729},
Abstract = {While terrorist organizations have been analyzed for their motivations
   and tactics, little has been done to develop a systematic understanding
   of what makes some groups more dangerous than others. Knowing what makes
   some groups more threatening than others, or what conditions can
   influence a single group to become more or less of a threat, would help
   governments to prioritize resources during counterterrorism efforts.
   Using an approach similar to Ted Robert Gurr's assignment of a risk
   score to identify impending minority group rebellion, this article
   develops and tests a set of terrorist organizational characteristics. A
   two-phased approach is used. First, the authors identify key
   characteristics that could be anticipated to drive groups to be more
   active or deadly. The characteristics were identified and measured for
   terrorist groups for 1990-1994. The authors test group characteristics
   against subsequent group violence intensity from 1995 to 1999. Findings
   indicate that some group characteristics, such as religious ideology and
   group size, are important to understanding a group's relative level of
   violence. Though the study focused on a relatively short period of time,
   the findings indicate that a more comprehensive study of the impact that
   group characteristics have on violence levels would be a worthwhile
   undertaking.},

Title = {A policy agenda for EU smart growth: the role of creative and cultural
   industries},
Journal = {POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {32},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {365-375},
Abstract = {The argument developed in this paper is that a resilient economy
   requires a growth agenda that is underpinned by a balanced industrial
   mix, the development and adoption of new knowledge or technological
   platforms, and risk taking in radical and incremental innovations as
   well as in soft and hard innovations. In other words, it is desirable to
   promote a sustainable and endogenous way to `reset' the economy -
   borrowing the phrase from this study by Florida - by endorsing a growth
   agenda that includes also creative and cultural industries. It will
   further be argued that a policy agenda for the EU's economic growth
   takes little account of the opportunities and potential of creative and
   cultural industries, favouring hard technologies and services. A growing
   literature is starting to highlight the innovation capacity of cultural
   and creative industries as they intersect the innovation processes of
   other manufacturing and services sectors with innovative and creative
   outputs. The indecision of EU policy-makers on how to take advantage of
   creative and cultural industries for the delivery of a Smart Europe - as
   part of the Europe 2020 agenda - translates into a lack of commitment to
   such industries and indeed to a clear cohesion agenda. We make a strong
   case for EU policy-making to break the deadlock and clearly spell out a
   policy agenda that has an effective spatial dimension and that directly
   interfaces with its innovation policy.},

   and environmental risks},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Pages = {42-59},
Abstract = {The development of environmental security as an academic project is an
   important contribution in theorising the politics of global
   environmental change and shifting security contexts, but there are
   significant problems with the ways in which environmental issues have
   been incorporated into security discussions. Approaches to theorising
   environmental questions in international politics in terms of
   environmental conflict or environmental security tend to reproduce a
   dualistic understanding of human relations to `the environment' in which
   humans are either threatened by or pose a threat to `nature'. An
   approach in terms of ecological security does account for changes in the
   biosphere resultant from human endeavours and understands social
   relations as ecologically embedded, but it underplays the extent to
   which multiple and complex inequalities shape the environmental impact
   of different populations. Drawing on concepts from complexity theory,
   alongside different elements of political ecologism, it is argued that
   human relationships with environments are characterised by social
   intersectionality and complex inequalities. Complexity approaches can
   help capture the patterns of these relations and understand the
   co-constitution of human communities and the `natural environment'.},

   campaign to stop Canada's seal hunt},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {20},
Number = {2},
Pages = {192-209},
Abstract = {Activists use emotional language and images - what Greenpeace co-founder
   Bob Hunter coined `mindbombs' - to convince people that some actions are
   wrong, morally and environmentally. For instance, for over 50 years
   anti-sealing activists have employed mindbombs to transform seal pups
   into babies and seal hunters into barbarians. Although `image politics'
   contributed to the decline of the Canadian sealing industry in the
   1980s, its effectiveness has been - and continues to be - rocky,
   particularly as pro-sealing voices counter with competing claims of
   cultural rights, traditional livelihoods and sustainable use. Drawing on
   Tilly and Tarrow's `cycles of contention' framework, this article argues
   that controlling and predicting the global uptake of messaging is
   becoming harder as activists operate in an increasingly crowded
   discursive landscape, as campaigners and counter-campaigners articulate
   scientific and moral frames that resonate differently across changing
   social and cultural contexts, and in light of globalising markets,
   transnational networks and changing media.},

Title = {Moving from clientelist politics toward a welfare regime: evidence from
   the 2009 assembly election in Andhra Pradesh},
Journal = {COMMONWEALTH \& COMPARATIVE POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {49},
Number = {1},
Pages = {48-79},
Abstract = {Increases in government revenue in the state of Andhra Pradesh, India,
   have enabled provision of welfare benefits without revenue caps, which
   has removed the need for clientelist intermediaries. In this transition
   from clientelism, the government has led the way, a different path from
   other societies where the middle class has initiated political reforms
   leading to the demise of clientelism. The formerly dominant castes,
   which continue to control the government, retain greater expectation of
   clientelist benefits than lower castes, sustaining high-level corruption
   and caste cronyism in the underbelly of the emerging welfare regime.
   This study is based on a survey undertaken during the 2009 election for
   the assembly in Andhra Pradesh that yielded victory for the incumbent
   Congress regime.},

Abstract = {Recent large-N quantitative studies have failed to uncover a link
   between demographic change and conflict. This seems to refute quite
   powerful qualitative evidence from small-scale case studies that such a
   relationship exists. This article attempts to reconcile the conflicting
   evidence by revealing how population change- in this case a major
   decline in the size of the Protestant majority-matters for violent
   conflict, but not in a direct way. In addition, relationships differ by
   level of geography. In the case of Northern Ireland, no significant
   quantitative association exists between ethnic change and violence. This
   holds across both geographic units and years. However, there is a
   significant association between ethnic demography and Protestant
   mobilization into the Orange Order across counties. This in turn is
   related to Protestant resistance to reforms aimed at extending civil
   rights to the Catholic population during the Stormont period. This
   stance was a major factor in generating Catholic support for IRA
   violence. Moreover, in specific locations, a direct link between
   Protestant population decline relative to Catholics and loyalist
   violence against Catholics is evident. Hence demography matters, but in
   conjunction with other factors, and several steps upstream from the
   outbreak of violence.},

Journal = {COMMONWEALTH \& COMPARATIVE POLITICS},

Number = {3},
Pages = {379-426},
Abstract = {This paper explores dependent development, industrialisation and
   transitions to the semiperiphery, examining tensions between
   geopolitics, racial and class conflict that evolved into a `reciprocal
   blockade' in the Central African Federation (CAF), comprising Southern
   Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), Northern Rhodesia (Zambia) and Nyasaland
   (Malawi). The 1923 transfer of power from the chartered British South
   Africa Company to a semi-autonomous, settler-dominated government in
   Southern Rhodesia provided the foundations upon which an asymmetrical
   relationship between capital, white settlers. Africans and other groups
   was built. Incipient African nationalism arose in the 1950s in the
   shadow of an introverted apartheid South Africa and British
   decolonisation. Industry, commerce and the professions embraced the idea
   of a multiracial CAF, but recent white immigrants believed their
   privileged positions to be threatened, setting the stage for the 1962
   election of the white supremacist Rhodesian Front and its unlawful 1965
   Unilateral Declaration of Independence from the UK, despite profound
   misgivings in the security forces, An examination of the geopolitical,
   economic, ideological and institutional dynamics and ultimate failure of
   Rhodesian state-building from 1923 to 1963 places the reciprocal
   blockade in context.},

Abstract = {Families might be an important source of norms that legitimize
   terrorism, an assumption that has yet to be tested empirically. To
   investigate this, surveys were administered to 20 immediate relatives of
   16 Jema'ah Islamiyah (JI) members in Indonesia. Family members were
   found to agree with their kin's involvement in the violent activities of
   JI, and perceived their community as being supportive. Agreement with
   their relative's involvement in JI was predicted by anti-Western
   sentiment, not support for violent jihad. Kinship to a suicide bomber
   predicted less support for their family member's involvement in JI.
   Implications for deradicalization strategies are discussed.},

Abstract = {As with all aspects of public management, the control, financing, and
   regulation of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) are matters subject to
   changing international trends and domestic political imperatives. The
   effects of the global financial crisis (GFC) on the ownership,
   financing, and role of SOEs are still unfolding, but undoubtedly will be
   heavily influenced by a new era of public sector reforms principally
   designed to reassert central political controls, as well as by fiscal
   pressures to balance state budgets. In this regard, the Irish experience
   is instructive, with the findings from two datasets being used here to
   examine various modes of state enterprise control and their
   corresponding autonomy. Significantly, there has been considerable
   variety within and across the SOE sector, demonstrating the need for
   more detailed understanding of how SOEs are managed.},

Abstract = {Vladislav Surkov, the first deputy head of the Russian presidential
   administration and one of the key ideologists during Putin's presidency,
   offers an interesting insight into the Russian political elite and their
   narratives on Russia's past. present and future. The ultimate goal in
   the Surkovian narrative is to make Russia a leader in the world and
   guarantee the well-being of Russian citizens. Modernization should be
   understood as one of the main means in order to achieve this. The
   Surkovian narrative is strongly influenced by neo-liberal ideology and
   accordingly emphasizes the responsibility of citizens for their own
   well-being and happiness. However, Surkov assigns the state a stronger
   role than the conventional neo-liberal logic would suggest, thereby
   partly reproducing the former Russian and Soviet modernization
   discourses by stressing Russia's distinctive path to modernization.},

Abstract = {This paper examines data collected from senior executives in two
   Australian government agencies to identify patterns of adaptive and
   maladaptive responses to change in public sector environments. The
   conceptual categories of passive maladaptive, active maladaptive and
   active adaptive responses are all supported by the interview data, with
   half of the executives expressing predominantly active adaptive
   responses to external change and uncertainty and half displaying various
   kinds of passive and active maladaptive responses. The implications of
   the findings for managers as agents of organizational learning and
   adaptation in public sector environments are discussed.},

Title = {Scientific Credibility, Disagreement, and Error Costs in 17
   Biotechnology Policy Subsystems},
Journal = {POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {39},
Number = {3},
Pages = {513-533},
Abstract = {One of the original objectives of the advocacy coalition framework (ACF)
   was to shed light on the role of science in policymaking. The ACF
   depicts subsystem scientists as political actors just like any other.
   Unfortunately, science has never become a major theme of research within
   the framework and, as a consequence, its role in policymaking remains
   under-theorized, leaving ample room for interpretation. This article
   seeks to explore the validity of three propositions about the role of
   science in policy. The first two are derived from the ACF: (i) the
   capacity of scientists to provide credible advice is affected by the
   harshness of the political debates dividing the policy subsystem; and
   (ii) agreement among scientists is just as common as among other
   groupings of policy actors. The third is derived from an ``error
   costs{''} argument: (iii) Disagreements among scientists are even more
   pronounced than disagreements among other policy actors. Using the
   results of a survey of policy actors in 17 biotechnology subsystems,
   this article finds support for the first and third propositions. Indeed,
   scientists' participation in political divisions might even be
   underestimated by the ACF. The article concludes with attempts to
   clarify the role of scientists within the ACF, including discussions of
   ambiguity regarding the role of professional forums and of scientists in
   between-coalition learning within policy subsystems.},

Abstract = {Public Administration (PA) is a field characterized by great diversity
   in theoretical approaches and methodological tactics. This wide scope
   lends itself to potential epistemological and methodological
   fragmentation, which prevents scholars from adequately appreciating and
   building on each other's work. Although many scholars value PA's
   theoretical and methodological diversity, this intellectual diversity
   brings some important trade-offs that must be acknowledged. We see three
   future challenges for the field as (1) supporting the application of
   diverse and rigorous methodological approaches, (2) continuing to
   encourage theoretical diversity and theoretical depth, and (3) promoting
   relevance without compromising methodological rigor and theoretical
   depth. We believe that a self-conscious, deliberate focus on balancing
   these goals will strengthen and connect public administration. In this
   article, we suggest several practical strategies for accomplishing this,
   such as embracing the public focus of our research, working in
   interdisciplinary teams, and being more explicit about methodological
   assumptions and approaches in our writing.},

Abstract = {This article applies broad conceptual categories of comparative politics

   argument some lines of influence on public sector reform of the features
   of the party system in Italy, the executive-legislative balance, the
   politician-bureaucrat relationship, and the role of administrative law.
   In the search for explanations for the trajectory of administrative
   reform, pre-existing political and institutional factors also have to be
   interpreted through the lens of negotiated change occurring via
   processes of conversion and layering involving new and old institutions
   that has taken place in Italy since the `political crisis' began in
   1992.},

Abstract = {Al Qaeda has developed a coherent strategy for insurgent violence that
   has much in common with the focoism advocated by Che Guevara in the
   1960s. In their strategic writing, explored here, key Islamist
   strategists stress the role of violence in creating revolution, and
   describe the export of committed fighters to focoist enclaves at the
   margins of enemy control. In contrast to some prominent themes in recent
   scholarship, the article argues that physical space is demonstrably
   important to the revolutionaries, that their development of leaderless
   jihad is designed to supplement not replace territorial control, and
   that their violence is avowedly strategic.},

Pages = {329-346},
Abstract = {Despite the ubiquitous nature of these policies, there is disagreement
   in the literature regarding the direction and size of the impact that
   speed limits have on traffic-related fatalities. We argue in this paper
   that the mixed results in previous work may arise because these studies
   have missed an important component of the implementation of speed limit
   laws. More explicitly, they have failed to adequately control for the
   deterrent effect of enforcement and sanctions. We develop the argument
   that the observed impacts of speed limits will be overly large when the
   certainty and severity of punishment are not accounted for. We test this
   assertion in a cross-sectional time series analysis of state-level
   traffic fatalities from the years 1990-2006 and find that lower speeds
   do save a significant number of lives. Interestingly, we find that the
   impact is significantly overestimated for 65-mph limits and
   significantly underestimated for 70-mph limits when enforcement,
   penalties, and the interaction of the two are excluded. The results also
   suggest that fines have a rather modest impact on fatalities unless
   states employ a sufficient number of troopers to enforce posted limits.
   In addition to clarifying previous findings related to speed limit
   policy, therefore, the findings contribute to the general application of
   deterrence theory by empirically confirming that the importance of
   sanction severity is dependent on the perceived certainty of punishment.},

Title = {Reproducing hegemony: US finance capital and the 2008 crisi},
Journal = {CRITICAL POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {5},
Number = {3},
Pages = {219-246},
Abstract = {The financial crisis of 2008 offers an ideal `critical moment' to
   investigate the reproduction of hegemony. In contrast to the widely held
   belief that a crisis undermines the legitimacy, and thus the hegemony,
   of a particular group, this article shows how, before the current
   crisis, finance capital gained in strength through a series of financial
   crises, to the point where it had become hegemonic in a Gramscian sense.
   Using a rigorous conceptualization of hegemony, a detailed study of the
   five phases of crisis management since the outbreak of the 2008 crisis
   here reveals that finance capital has kept its central place in a
   financialized regime of accumulation, and that it has received continued
   support from most other fractions of capital. Its losses have been
   restricted to the area of passive support among the American public;
   whilst it has been able to rely on its institutional power and its
   ability to fund lobbying campaigns to maintain wider support. This has
   meant that the mixture of coercion and consensus underlying hegemony has
   shifted slightly towards coercion in relation to the general public. But
   finance capital's main message - that citizens have the right to keep
   their money and to invest it according to their preferences - continues
   to resonate with a sizeable portion of the American electorate.
   Therefore it is premature to suggest that finance capital has suffered a
   loss of hegemony.},

Number = {3},
Pages = {535-561},
Abstract = {The Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF) has influenced a generation of
   policy scholars with its emphasis on causal drivers, testable
   hypotheses, and falsification. Until recently, the role of policy
   narratives has been largely neglected in ACF literature partially
   because much of that work has operated outside of traditional social
   science principles, such as falsification. Yet emerging literature under
   the rubric of Narrative Policy Framework (NPF) demonstrates how the role
   of policy narratives in policy processes is studied using the same
   rigorous social science standards initially set forth by Paul A.
   Sabatier. The NPF identifies theories specifying narrative elements and
   strategies that are likely useful to ACF researchers as classes of
   variables that have yet to be integrated. Examining this proposition, we
   provide seven hypotheses related to critical ACF concepts including
   advocacy coalitions and policy beliefs, policy learning, public opinion,
   and strategy. Our goal is to stay within the scientific, theoretical,
   and methodological tradition of the ACF and show how NPF's empirical,
   hypotheses, and causal driven work on policy narratives identifies
   theories applicable to ACF research while also offering an independent
   framework capable of explaining the policy process through the power of
   policy narratives. In doing so, we believe both ACF and NPF scholarship
   can contribute to the advancement of our understanding of the policy
   process.},

Abstract = {What contribution can a theorization of friendship offer to the
   understanding of the world of states? It is argued here that the
   contemporary view of friendship eclipses a longer and broader
   appreciation. As such, the view of friendship that identifies it as
   affective, private and particular (here termed the
   contemporary-affective view) is one instance of a much wider cluster of
   ideas sharing overlapping characteristics. So conceptualized,
   `friendship' is the concern with what binds person-to-person. It is a
   concern with the nature and fabric of the political. Seen from this
   vantage point, friendship highlights what an analysis through the state
   tends to overshadow: the enduring affinities, identifications and bonds
   that permeate the dynamics of the world of states. Thus, friendship need
   not remain the preserve of the premodern (Aristotle), nor be usurped as
   an adjunct to sovereignty and power (Schmitt), but investigated as an
   ongoing site of analysis for phenomena within, between and beyond
   states. International Politics (2011) 48, 10-27. doi:10.1057/ip.2010.35},

Title = {THE ORDER OF QUESTIONS IN A SURVEY ON CITIZEN SATISFACTION WITH PUBLIC
   SERVICES: LESSONS FROM A SPLIT-BALLOT EXPERIMENT},
Journal = {PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {89},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1436-1450},
Abstract = {Surveys of citizen satisfaction with local public services have become
   widespread, with the results increasingly used to reorganize services,
   to allocate budgets, and to hold managers accountable. But evidence from
   a split-ballot experiment that we conducted suggests that the order of
   questions in a citizen survey has important effects on reported
   satisfaction with specific public services as well as overall citizen
   satisfaction. Moreover, the correlations of specific service ratings
   with overall satisfaction, and thus the identification of key drivers of
   overall satisfaction, also turn out to be highly sensitive to question
   order. These findings are in line with research on priming and question
   order effects in the survey methodology literature, but these effects
   have not been carefully examined before in the context of citizen
   surveys and public administration research. Policy and management
   implications of these finding are discussed.},

Title = {Why so little strategy? District-level electoral entry in theory and
   practice},
Journal = {COMMONWEALTH \& COMPARATIVE POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {49},
Number = {1},
Pages = {29-47},
Abstract = {General theories of electoral competition often assume that parties are
   `strategic' - that parties pick their battles and pragmatically abandon
   unpromising districts. But most parties in district-based electoral
   systems contradict this assumption, running candidates nearly
   everywhere, with little apparent regard for their prospects. This gap
   between theory and practice has yet to receive focused attention. This
   article examines elections in Canada, Great Britain, Jamaica, the USA,
   and Japan to answer two basic-research questions: How prevalent is
   strategic electoral entry (in established democracies with
   simple-plurality or single non-transferable vote elections)? And how
   does one measure strategic entry in the first place? Although
   strategicness does vary somewhat across and within party systems,
   non-strategic entry proves most common. These results invite further
   research on why strategicness varies and how this variation shapes party
   system development.},

Abstract = {Military leaders, policymakers, and academics have long debated the
   relative merits of volunteer versus conscript armies. They also have
   studied the possible effects of eroding resolve among mass publics in
   democratic states during wartime. In this paper, we use battlefield
   casualty data from the population of interstate wars to compare theories
   of property takings and domestic institutions. We find conscription,
   like other non-market-based property takings, to be a wasteful means of
   mobilizing military manpower. Volunteer armies suffer far fewer
   casualties than their conscripted counterparts. We also find that this
   effect compounds when interacted with regime type. Volunteer democratic
   armies suffer especially few casualties. Finally, we find that
   democratic societies are willing to bear the costs of large-scale
   commitments to maintaining state sovereignty and survival when targeted
   by authoritarian states, at times in the face of certain defeat.},

Abstract = {How do the features of a rebel group and the external political
   environment interact to affect the internal dynamics within a rebel
   group after it transforms into a political party? In this paper we
   combine literature on organizational change in parties in new
   democracies with the emerging literature on rebel group-to-party
   transformation, to develop a framework by which to understand these
   dynamics. Using the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) as a case study,
   we find that the legacies of the conflict, the organizational legacies
   of the rebel group, and the post civil war incentives for electoral
   gain, create political cleavages within parties that generate
   considerable organizational centripetal pressures, pressures that will
   need to be accommodated in new party organizational structures. (C) 2011

Journal = {POLICY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {30},
Number = {4},
Pages = {323-334},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The concepts of public trust and heritage protection offer opportunities
   for refining discourses and practices surrounding governance of water
   resources for under-represented non-market values, particularly values
   that do not lend themselves readily to standard market-based economic
   analyses. Public trust in the United States, though far from a panacea,
   offers insights into how such values may be asserted within particular
   place-based contexts. Outside the U.S., heritage-based governance of
   water resources represents a similar effort for integrating such values.
   In both cases, changes in governance are linked to specific local
   conditions, history, and values. Examination of these two institutional
   frameworks suggests that experimentation drawing upon key concepts and
   mechanisms from both may facilitate better integration of non-market
   values (social, cultural, and ecological) into water and environmental
   governance. (C) 2011 Policy and Society Associates (APSS). Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {The article discusses the impact of national identity on democratization
   and market reforms in Russia and Ukraine. We develop a concept of
   hegemonic national identity and demonstrate its role in Russian and
   Ukrainian post-communist political development. The article argues that
   Russia's slide toward authoritarianism was to an important degree an
   outcome of the notions of national identity adopted by the main
   political players and society at large. In Ukraine, on the other hand, a
   hegemonic identity failed to emerge and the public discussion of issues
   of national identity led to the adoption of much more liberal and
   democratic notions of identity by a considerable part of the political
   elite. Adoption of this more liberal identity, in turn, was one of the
   main reasons for the Orange Revolution. The main theoretical
   implications of this argument are as follows: (a) choices of national
   identity profoundly affect the prospects for democracy in the newly
   democratizing states; (b) institutions do shape identities; (c) elites'
   preference for (or opposition to) liberal democracy is not simply a
   consequence of their understanding of their self-interest in gaining and
   preserving power but also is dependent to a significant extent on their
   choices of political identity.},

Abstract = {In this article, we estimate the total costs of the German participation
   in the Afghanistan war, both past and future. This is a hugely complex
   and uncertain calculation, which depends on several important
   assumptions. These assumptions pertain to the different cost channels
   and the shares of these channels that can be attributed to the German
   participation in the war. By calculating the costs of the German
   participation, we provide a framework for other researchers to do the
   same with respect to other countries. The article can function as a
   roadmap for researchers focusing on this topic. In the end we find that,
   in the most realistic of several possible scenarios regarding the
   duration and intensity of the German participation in the war in
   Afghanistan, the German share of the net present value of the total
   costs of the war ranges from 26 billion Euro to 47 billion Euro. This
   large range reflects the uncertainties with which the costs must be
   estimated. On an annual basis, we estimate that the German participation
   in the war costs between 2.5 and 3 billion Euro. This contrasts with the
   official war budget, which is little over 1 billion Euro for 2010,
   showing that governments may not adequately represent the costs of
   military action.},

Abstract = {Smart power is defined as the effective combination of both hard and
   soft power. The concept is increasingly used in policy and academic
   debates, yet a clear understanding of what it actually means is still
   lacking. As a result, there is little serious consideration of how smart
   power can contribute to long-standing debates about power in
   international relations. This article seeks to clarify the meaning of
   smart power through first analyzing its main components - hard and soft
   power - separately; and second bringing these components together to
   re-conceptualize smart power. The aim is to make smart power more
   analytically useful, and to outline the various ways in which hard and
   soft power can be combined effectively. The author considers the case of
   Europe to argue that it is mainly a soft power and sometimes a smart
   power. International Politics (2011) 48, 691-706. doi:

Title = {Together in the middle: Back-channel negotiation in the Irish peace
   process},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH},

Volume = {48},

Abstract = {This article examines the development of cooperative relationships in
   back-channel communication and their impact on intraparty negotiation.
   It draws on extensive newly available evidence on back-channel
   communication in the Irish peace process to expand the range of detailed
   case studies on a topic which is shrouded in secrecy and resistant to
   academic inquiry. The article analyses the operation of a secret back
   channel that linked the Irish Republican Army to the British government
   over a period of 20 years, drawing on unique material from the private
   papers of the intermediary, Brendan Duddy, and a range of other primary
   sources. The article finds that interaction through this back channel
   increased predictability and laid a foundation of extremely limited
   trust by providing information and increasing mutual understanding.
   Strong cooperative relationships developed at the intersection between
   the two sides, based to a great extent on strong interpersonal
   relationships and continuity in personnel. This in turn produced direct
   pressure for changes in the position of parties as negotiators acted as
   advocates of movement in intraparty negotiations. The article finds that
   this back channel was characterized by a short chain, the direct
   involvement of principals and the establishment of a single primary
   channel of communication and that these features combined with secrecy
   to generate the distinctive cooperative dynamics identified in this
   article. It concludes that the potential for the development of
   cooperative relationships is particularly strong in back-channel
   negotiation for two reasons; first, the joint project of secrecy creates
   an ongoing shared task that builds trust and mutual understanding
   regardless of progress in the negotiations. Secondly, as a shared
   project based on the explicit aim of bypassing spoilers, the process
   creates structural pressures for cooperation to manage internal
   opponents on both sides, pressures intensified by the secrecy of the
   process.},

   Disentangling the Contributions of Person-Organization Fit and

Abstract = {Although most research focuses on person-organization fit to explain
   public service motivation (PSM)'s influence on job choice, this study
   investigates the independent effects of both person-organization fit and
   person-job fit using a policy capturing research design and a sample of
   first-year law students. Our findings suggest that PSM may play a more
   important role in person-job fit than person-organization fit.
   Consistent across three sectors of employment, individuals with stronger
   PSM were more likely to accept jobs that emphasize service to
   others-whether that be pro bono work (private sector), client
   interaction (public sector), or client representation (nonprofit
   sector). After controlling for characteristics that influence person-job
   fit, PSM neither increased the likelihood that individuals would accept
   a public sector job nor decreased the likelihood that they would accept
   a private sector job. Among other things, our findings suggest that
   sector may be an inaccurate proxy for values that are often taken for
   granted in PSM studies.},

Abstract = {There is a great deal of research investigating public servants'
   perceptions of organizational problems (e.g., red tape, bureaucratic
   control); however, there is little research investigating public
   servants who have highly positive perceptions of their organizations.
   This article assesses perceptions of state employees to investigate
   individual- and organizational-level correlates with highly positive
   government workers, which we define as workers reporting high levels of
   pride in the organization for which they work, and who believe that the
   organization provides high-quality public services and operates by
   highly ethical standards. Using data from the National Administrative
   Studies Project III, we draw from formal theories of worker attitude
   formation and change to frame our assessment of these ideal-type public
   managers in terms of contemporaneous perceptions of work and work
   environment, structural job characteristics, and career trajectory. We
   conclude with a discussion of the implications for public management and
   policy.},

Abstract = {Since 2004, white commercial farmers displaced under Zimbabwe's
   fast-track land reform programme have established new successful farms
   near the central Nigerian town of Shonga. This article explores the
   basis of that success. It addresses three key questions: (1) What has
   actually happened near Shonga since 2004? (2) What or who is driving the
   process of agrarian transformation? And (3) What are the long-term
   consequences for the peasantry since Nigerian agriculture is still
   largely peasant-based? It argues that contrary to popular myths of
   `enterprising' white Zimbabwean farmers, the process is driven by a
   complex group of actors, including the national and regional states.
   Comparative evidence from similar transplantations of Zimbabwean farmers
   suggests that active state support is central to the success of Shonga.
   With respect to the relationship between the commercial farms and the
   peasantry, it is argued that all the synergies included in the project
   design to promote a symbiotic development have failed to materialize. As
   a result, the peasantry faces a process of `development by
   dispossession'.},

Title = {Competitiveness what for? Analysis of the Relationship between
   Competitiveness and Human Development in Mexico},
Journal = {REVISTA DEL CLAD REFORMA Y DEMOCRACIA},

Abstract = {Most regions in the world are wondering how to become more competitive
   and implement various projects and initiatives to transform their
   economies and insert or consolidate their positions within the knowledge
   economy, however it is losing sight that competitiveness is a means not
   an end; the key question is competitiveness what for? The answer lies in
   human development; regions want to be more prosperous with the aim of
   providing better living conditions for society. Therefore, rather than
   seeking competition as an end, the State should seek development;
   competitiveness should be seen under the globalizing effects of the
   market as a means (perhaps as a requirement).
   This approach focuses on the local level, the influence of the State to
   create conditions for competitiveness and human development is
   undeniable, since it has powers and abilities that have no other social
   actors. This is why governments must to be very careful when deciding
   the type of behaviors to encourage in their societies, because the
   public policies that they choose to implement are going to have
   far-reaching implications in the process of development of territories.
   This article presents an analysis of the Mexican states on the
   relationship between competitiveness and human development. With the
   empirical analysis developed in this research, it is found that the more
   competitive states (labor productivity, foreign direct investment and
   saving) have a higher degree of human development. It is considered the
   contribution of this work is the separate analysis of the two
   dimensions: competitiveness and human development; as well as the
   approach of the relationship between these dimensions using the most
   relevant variables involved; the above in order to create a framework to
   interpret and to guide decision makers in the areas in which is
   necessary to put attention to influence human development. There is a
   significant relationship between both concepts, so that competitiveness
   is an essential instrument to boost human development in the regions.
   The paper is structured as follows: first; it is reviewed the theories
   of competitiveness and human development, in order to establish a
   theoretical basis. Second, it is presented a socio-economic analysis of
   the regions of Mexico (Mexican states) in order to demonstrate the large
   regional differences within the country. The third part describes the
   methodology followed in the research work to present the results
   immediately. At the end of the document, it is concluded with some final
   remarks.},

Abstract = {Over the past several years, scholars have asked how citizen
   satisfaction with public services might be affected by the expectations
   citizens have for service quality. Might satisfaction with public
   services be affected just not only by the perceived quality of those
   services but also by the quality citizens expect services to have? This
   line of questioning uses the so-called ``expectancy disconfirmation{''}
   model drawn from private sector research, which views consumer
   satisfaction with privately provided goods and services as typically
   deriving from a comparison of perceived performance to expected
   performance. This article extends this research by examining the effects
   of expectations and expectancy confirmation/disconfirmation on
   motorists' satisfaction with road conditions, traffic flow, and safety
   on state highways in Georgia. Expectations were found to have
   consistently negative, though modest, effects on satisfaction, with
   satisfaction declining as expectations increase. Those effects obtain in
   addition to those of perceived performance, grades, and expectancy
   confirmation/disconfirmation, providing further support for the
   expectancy disconfirmation model and clarifying some mixed findings from
   prior research. The conclusions discuss what these findings suggest
   about possible future research.},

Volume = {30},

Abstract = {The digital revolution is a key enabling factor for globalisation. New
   borderless industries like online gambling are said to be the
   beneficiaries of it. States are not. Online gambling providers have
   located their operations in territories that license their operations
   and the industry has developed self-regulatory codes of practice, while
   two of the industry's largest markets have taken dramatically opposing
   regulatory approaches: the US has sought to prohibit online gambling,
   while the UK has regulated and actively encouraged it. We find that US
   prohibition of online gambling is largely the result of a historically
   nationally segmented market and regulatory structure that has been
   lacking in the UK. Rather than the global medium affecting the nature of
   the regulatory approaches, we demonstrate that the intersection of
   private market interests with the national public regulatory context is
   the reason why the UK has formally adopted many of the self-regulatory
   tools developed by the online gambling industry, effectively
   legitimising the industry's own framework for self-regulation, while the
   US has chosen not to do so. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf

Title = {Varieties of neutrality: Norm revision and decline},
Journal = {COOPERATION AND CONFLICT},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {46},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {285-311},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {With the end of the Cold War, the neutral countries of Austria, Finland,
   Ireland and Sweden have grappled with the question of what their
   neutrality means in relation to membership in the European Union's (EU)
   Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) and the North Atlantic Treaty
   Organization's (NATO) Partnership for Peace (PfP). The concept of
   neutrality has continued to inform the foreign and security policies of
   these four neutral EU members to varying degrees, but what explains
   these `varieties of neutrality' and what does neutrality mean in
   relation to membership in the EU's CSDP and NATO's PfP? In this article,
   the primary focus is on neutrality as a norm. Understanding neutrality
   as a norm helps clarify how neutrality becomes embedded in national
   identity, what it shows about the interactions between domestic belief
   systems and international security conditions over time, and how the
   definition of a norm can be revised to allow for desired policy choices.
   To this end, the article asserts that there are four interrelated
   factors key to explaining how and why each state modified its
   interpretation of neutrality vis-A-vis international military
   institutions such as NATO, and the CSDP: the reason for and timing of
   institutionalizing neutrality (coerced or voluntary), the form of
   institutionalization (de jure or de facto), political elite opinion and
   public opinion/belief.},

Abstract = {International technology cooperation promises to help countries exploit
   the potential of new innovations, but commercial rivalry between
   companies and governments raises obstacles to it. In this article, I
   present and solve a model of international technology cooperation. The
   formal analysis shows that a technology agreement must address two
   issues. First, governments must be able to induce companies to innovate.
   Second, governments must credibly commit to penalizing companies for
   failing to share new information produced through research. Based on
   these observations, I show that the potential for technology cooperation
   is maximized in symmetric settings between equally capable governments
   and companies. In practice, this observation warrants a policy focus on
   countries and industries that are already on a level playing ground. I
   also consider extensions to multinational companies and adverse
   selection problems. The formal analysis provides a solid foundation for
   practical policy implementation.},

Abstract = {Executive pay regulation is widely discussed as a measure to reduce
   financial mismanagement in corporations. We show that the professional
   team sports industry, the only industry with substantial experience in
   the regulation of compensation arrangements, provides valuable insights
   for the regulation of executive pay. Based on the experience from
   professional sports leagues, we develop implications for the corporate
   sector regarding the establishment and enforcement of executive pay
   regulation as well as the level, structure, and rigidity of such
   regulatory measures.},

Abstract = {The Bolivian constitution, debated in a Constituent Assembly in 2006 and
   2007 called by the country's first indigenous president, Evo Morales,
   was adopted in a referendum in 2009. Among many other important
   provisions recognizing the country's majority indigenous population, it
   legitimizes the practice of indigenous community justice. Indigenous
   justice differs in important ways from the national justice system and
   from the international human rights regime but it expresses a legitimate
   assertion by the country's indigenous peoples of their cultural
   integrity.},

Abstract = {Policy responses to the tumult of the global financial crisis of 2007-9
   prompt a consideration of the critical dimensions in specifying policy
   change. UK monetary policy between 2007 and 2009 is characterised by a
   remarkable degree of innovation yet counts as a `normal' period of
   policy making under the Hall (1993) framework of policy change, the
   enduring workhorse of the comparative public policy field. This exposes
   its lack of conceptual refinement in describing significant but within
   paradigm policy change. This paper traces this failing to the notion of
   a policy paradigm, both its scale and the ideational mechanisms which
   bind policy change. The paper develops the UK monetary policy case to
   consider the potential of the recently-minted concept of a thermostatic
   policy institution for the development of Hall's framework; but finds
   analytical limitations in coping with significant policy spillovers.
   Suggestions are made to meet this important challenge for future
   research in policy studies on the specification of policy change.},

Abstract = {The 1998 Good Friday Agreement (GFA) led to a major realignment in
   unionist politics in Northern Ireland. The Ulster Unionist party (UUP),
   hitherto the dominant force within the Protestant British tradition, was
   usurped in electoral popularity by the Democratic Unionist party (DUP).
   In its post-GFA rise, the DUP garnered majority support from members of
   the Orange Order, the largest organisation in Protestant civil society.
   Drawing upon a recent membership survey of the Orange Order conducted by
   the authors, this article examines the demographic and attitudinal bases
   of support for unionist political parties among its members, and tests
   whether the locus of support for the DUP is evenly distributed, or
   instead biased towards particular age groups, social classes or
   Protestant denominations within the Order, as well as assessing whether
   attitudinal variations may be influential in determining party
   loyalties.},

Abstract = {In the by now extended debate about the end of the Cold War and its
   causes, very little attention has been paid to the role played by
   historical memory in helping shape the way policy-makers approached the
   collapse of the post-war order. As this article shows, many, if not most
   policy elites at the time, confronted the passing of the old world with
   a great degree of caution and trepidation; and one of the key reasons
   they did so, it is argued here, is because of their reading of the past.
   This reading, I go on to suggest, made many of them especially cautious
   and fearful when faced with great change. In the end of course these
   changes proved irresistible, and for liberals at least seemed to augur
   in more peaceful and prosperous times. However, as we shall see here,
   this unguarded optimism was not much in evidence as the old
   international system and the other superpower collapsed after 1989.
   Looking backwards rather than forwards, policy-makers approached the new
   dawn with much less enthusiasm and optimism than their public
   pronouncements seemed to indicate at the time or later. International

Abstract = {Why are some countries better able to sustain egalitarian outcomes
   attained in past decades in the current inhospitable conditions?
   Moreover, why have egalitarian practices proven fragile in some
   countries with traditionally strong social democratic governments and
   powerful unions and yet have been sustained in countries with disjointed
   unions and right-wing parties in power? Italy and Sweden, the central
   cases examined in this paper, reflect these diverging trends. In view of
   understanding why certain countries better sustain egalitarian
   institutions and outcomes, the paper investigates how two inter-related
   institutional traits set countries apart in terms of how egalitarian
   institutions were constructed and dismantled and how these traits
   influenced the type of institutional remnants and bargaining dynamics
   maintained in the aftermath. The two traits in question are: (a) the
   type of confederal groupings and; (b) the range of wage scale coverage.},

Abstract = {Since the early 1990s, several European countries (and Japan) have in
   turn introduced new long-term care schemes. Our analysis starts with the
   assumption that the policy design of the long-term care schemes can be
   explained by the interplay of factors originating within and beyond
   nation states. Policy changes are determined by internal and external
   factors, including voluntary transfers between countries. Our findings
   highlight the dominance of internal factors, in particular the
   significant impact of the political and social actors on decisions about
   policy design and the adoption of foreign models.},

Volume = {55},

Abstract = {The WTO system and democratic rights are unexpected bedfellows. The
   GATT/WTO requires governments to adopt policies that provide foreign
   products (read producers) with due process, political participation, and
   information rights related to trade policymaking. Because these nations
   also provide these rights to their citizens, a growing number of people
   are learning how to influence trade-related policies. As trade today
   encompasses many areas of governance, these same citizens may gradually
   transfer the skills learned from influencing trade policies to other
   public issues. Thus, the WTO not only empowers foreign market actors,
   but also citizens in repressive states. We use both qualitative and
   quantitative analysis to examine whether membership in the WTO over time
   leads to improvements in these democratic rights. Our qualitative
   analysis shows that these issues are discussed during accessions and
   trade policy reviews. Quantitative analysis examines how members of the
   GATT/WTO perform on these democratic rights over time. We use a
   cross-national time series design of all countries, accounting for
   selection issues of why countries become members of the GATT/WTO regime.
   We find that longer GATT/WTO membership leads to stronger performance on
   our metrics for political participation, free and fair elections, and
   access to information.},

Abstract = {In 1991 Vitaly Churkin, a Soviet Minister for Foreign Economic
   Cooperation, stated that economic links between Russia and Cuba were
   ``doomed{''} to continue. This gave a very negative impression of the
   relationship, but quickly he appeared to be incorrect because by the end
   of 1992 little seemed to remain of the 30-year relationship. However, as
   the 1990s progressed, the relationship continued to function and then
   improve. Fundamental to this were the principles of the realist paradigm
   of International Relations, which has been vital since the
   relationship's inception in the aftermath of the Cuban Revolution, in
   conjunction with a long-term legacy. The outcome is that Russia and Cuba
   are indeed ``doomed{''} comrades. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd on

Abstract = {This article aims to introduce the concept of parallel economies to
   explain the transformation of North Korea's command economy during the
   1990s. The article summarises North Korea's pre-1991 command economy,
   before identifying the collapse of the Soviet Union and the great famine
   (1994-1998) as causes for the splintering of the old command system into
   parallel economies-the official, military, illicit, court and
   entrepreneurial economies-separated from the central planning matrix. It
   concludes that the existence of parallel economies makes system-wide
   economic reform unlikely and increases the importance of foreign aid in
   maintaining the viability of the regime's political architecture. (C)

Abstract = {If patriotism is love of one's country, the attempt to promote it in
   schools must count as a form of emotional education. Emotional education
   is defensible in so far as it consists in offering pupils good reasons
   and effective techniques for fostering or suppressing particular
   emotions. The question is whether we are in a position to offer pupils
   good reasons for loving their countries. In this article I set out an
   account of the rationality of emotions in general and of love in
   particular, and then identify two benefits and one drawback of patriotic
   attachment. I argue that there is room for reasonable disagreement on
   the desirability of patriotism and that we therefore ought not to
   promote it in schools but rather to teach it as a controversial issue.},

   as has been alleged. In making my argument I show that there is no
   general case for (or against) political compulsion. Instead, arguments
   must be predicated on the particular characteristics of different

Abstract = {This article questions the use of immigration as a tool to counter
   global poverty. It argues that poor people have a human right to stay in
   their home state, which entitles them to receive development assistance
   without the necessity of migrating abroad. The article thus rejects a
   popular view in the philosophical literature on immigration which holds
   that rich states are free to choose between assisting poor people in
   their home states and admitting them as immigrants when fulfilling
   duties to assist the global poor. Since the human right to stay is
   entailed by values that feature prominently in the philosophical debate
   on immigration, the article further contends that participants in that
   debate have particular reason to reject the popular `choice view' and
   endorse the alternative position presented in the article.},

Abstract = {The establishment of modern sociology in Brazil was part of a
   thoroughgoing modernization of the country that began in the 1930s and
   the years immediately following World War II. The founding of the
   University of Sao Paulo made possible the systematic training of
   scientists devoted to teaching and research and broadened the way
   learning was understood. Florestan Fernandes was the outstanding
   personality among the first social scientists that the university
   produced, and the picture of the Brazilian sociologist today is largely
   inspired by his career. Enthusiasm and scientific rigor were the
   hallmarks of his approach. His early work reflects intellectuals' shared
   belief in the power of ideas to regenerate the nation, freeing it from a
   past that they condemned. The mature reflection of his later works
   retreats from this optimistic view, recognizing the emergence of modern
   society in Brazil as a complex process with mixed results.},

Abstract = {While military protocol requires that POWs provide only name, rank,
   serial number, and date of birth (the so-called Big 4), it is naive to
   think that all detainees, including terrorists, behave in this fashion.
   Instead, there is evidence that detainees partially cooperate with their
   captors by revealing a limited amount of valuable information during the
   interrogation process. Such a strategy makes it appear that the detainee
   is cooperative and, since interrogations can be costly, serves as a
   disincentive for further interrogation. In order to capture the
   essential differences between the two strategies, we model two different
   types of games between the interrogator and the detainee. Specifically,
   we compare the Big 4 game to a two-stage game (the Little Fish game) in
   which the detainee is permitted to reveal low-level information to the
   interrogator. We formalize both games, derive the optimal rules for each
   player, and show that the Big 4 game may not be optimal for either
   player or for the overall well-being of the interrogating nation. As
   such, the Little Fish game can Pareto-dominate the Big 4 game. Hence, it
   is possible that the al-Qaeda strategy of partial cooperation is
   superior to that used by most standing armies. We also show that the
   level of intensity selected by the interrogator must be balanced by such
   factors as the moral values of the society and recruiting potential of
   the terrorists versus the likelihood of obtaining important information.},

   Transcendental definitions were related to failed ideologies. The

   last 30 years. However, it has now been found wanting because it is too
   permissive of greed and corruption. An instrumental definition must
   include accountability, legality, integrity and responsiveness and
   recognise the role of citizens as the community's governors. Only then
   can a start be made in recovering public allegiance for governments and

Abstract = {Voluntary governance arrangements focusing on responsible business
   behavior have proliferated over the past decades, and in many sectors of
   industry, different governance organizations now compete for business
   participation. This private governance competition has negative
   consequences for the effective functioning of these arrangements. In the
   literature up until now, optimism prevails on how a process of policy
   convergence between organizations may come about that would solve some
   of the problems that arise because of this competition. It is
   remarkable, however, that in one of the key industries referred to in
   this literature, the garments industry, convergence is virtually absent.
   This article explains why this is so and suggests that next to three
   existing approaches to the evolution and possible convergence of private
   governance organizations, actually a fourth, pessimistic type should be
   introduced, taking into account the evolution and perseverance of
   political difference between interest groups creating and supporting
   private governance arrangements.},

Abstract = {Are all issues subject to the same attention from organized interests?
   If not, why not? This article utilizes data on organized interest
   mobilization in Scottish public policy to examine the pattern of
   engagement by policy participants across a large number of policy
   issues. It finds a heavily skewed pattern of mobilization: Most issues
   attract little attention, while a few issues account for the majority of
   attention (they are ``bandwagons{''}). This resembles the findings of
   Baumgartner and Leech, based on U.S. lobby data. Replication outside the
   United States supports the claim that this is a general pattern in
   public policy systems. But what explains such a pattern? After
   scrutinizing the ``size and scope{''} approach, this article proposes
   that positive feedback mechanisms are catalyzing cascades of
   mobilization. Several agents are identified as facilitating cascades in
   the data: keystone groups, the media, civil servants, and campaign
   groups.},
