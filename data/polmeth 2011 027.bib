Abstract = {The Union for the Mediterranean (UfM) has had a troubled infancy. French
   ideas for enhanced Euro-Mediterranean co-operation, influenced by
   functionalism, actually brought increased disputation among the partners
   during its first two years. There has been deep disagreement over
   whether European Union (EU) Mediterranean policy should be based on
   common positions or accommodate French leadership ambitions. Adverse
   external conditions have affected the prospects of the infant UfM, but
   so too have intra-EU differences and problematical institutional
   structures.},

Abstract = {In this article the voting rules in the Council of the European Union
   are investigated. It is known that both the current system, according to
   the Treaty of Nice, and the voting system proposed in the Lisbon Treaty
   strongly deviate from Penrose's square root law, which under certain
   assumptions can be shown to be the ideal power distribution. Since it
   seems easier to make corrections to the current systems than to agree
   upon completely different new voting rules, one may hope that
   adjustments of the quota in the Lisbon Treaty might give rise to a
   system that is close to the square root law. In this article, this
   question is investigated. The computations it contains show that a mere
   change of quota in the treaties of Nice and Lisbon cannot bring the
   system substantially closer to the ideal distribution of power as given
   by the square root law.},

Abstract = {Drawing on the idea of the European Union (EU) representing a natural
   `anchor' for macroeconomic policy measures, this article assess the
   current and upcoming challenges in terms of growth and labour markets
   and the finance and growth nexus in the region. The structural problems
   concerning financial intermediation in the region turn out to be one of
   the major impediments for further economic development. From a political
   economy point of view, Mediterranean Partner Country (MPC) governments
   try to maximize short-run pay-offs in order to sustain political support
   and to trade these financial returns against a minimum of policy reform.
   The EU, on the other side of the bargaining table, tries to reap the
   benefits from policy reform, whereas its willingness to fund these
   compensation schemes can be assumed to be limited. Given these trade-off
   rationales on both sides of the Mediterranean Sea, both actors free-ride
   where possible which leads to suboptimal results. Therefore, this
   ostensible economic problem is analysed in its political economy context
   in order to suggest a macroeconomic co-operation scheme that explicitly
   takes into account political constraints and institutional deadlocks,
   hampering the development of a deeper economic co-operation within the
   Euro-Mediterranean Partnership (EMP) framework.},

Abstract = {One of the most important political legacies of colonialism in Africa
   has been the reliance on the model of centralized bureaucratic
   administration, which has had disastrous consequences for African
   state-building. Like the colonial systems before them, these centralized
   bureaucracies have not functioned effectively. One of the main problems
   is a loose coupling between the formal bureaucratic structure of these
   states and the informal patrimonial elements, mainly patronage, that
   came to permeate them. Many scholars thus referred to these states as
   neopatrimonial. Over the past two to three decades, many governments
   have begun to replace centralized bureaucracies with different forms of
   partially patrimonial systems, including various forms of
   decentralization and partial privatization. This article uses both Weber
   and contemporary agency theory to evaluate the success of these new
   forms of partially patrimonial administration and to suggest ways in
   which they could be made more effective.},

Abstract = {This study explores when, why, and how the Ecuadorian state has
   implemented programs and policies aimed at reaching out to its nationals
   living abroad. The evidence shows an increasing activism on the part of
   the state that has intensified under Rafael Correa's administration and
   acquired some innovative traits; it has also translated into foreign
   policy actions that have placed Ecuador in a leadership role in the
   Andean region. The timing, motivation, and nature of those transnational
   policies do not exactly fit the assumptions and typologies of existing
   literature on the subject. The characteristics of this case, as well as
   some contradictions and tensions in policy content and implementation,
   are better explained by domestic political factors such as the nature
   and internal dynamics of the coalition in government, the political
   discourse that helped to sell and give shape to Correa's political
   project, and the serious institutional instability and fragility in
   which an ambitious new reform of the state has been launched.},

Abstract = {Although depicted as an instrument oriented towards improving European
   governance as well as the democratic quality of European
   decision-making, the application of online consultations (OC) by the
   European Commission is accompanied by scepticism about their actual use.
   Based on a large-N, quantitative analysis, this article examines the
   application of and participation patterns in OC. With regard to the most
   relevant indicators applied in the study - openness, transparency and
   inclusiveness - the analysis reveals rather mixed results: while OC
   enhance the involvement of interested parties and formally offer the
   possibility to give qualitative input, at present, OC are far from being
   inclusive, nor is their practice transparent.},

Abstract = {The subject of the Russian middle class has engaged the attention of
   scholars and policymakers inside and outside Russia. Debate over how the
   middle class should be defined and measured has been contentious. This

   the development of the middle class since the end of communism,
   considers problems in defining and measuring the size of the middle
   class, describes the role assigned to it by the Russian leadership, and
   looks at factors inhibiting the growth of the middle class.},

Abstract = {This article uses the language of governance to explore the
   relationships between the EU and the states around the Mediterranean.
   Against the background of multiple legal, policy and institutional
   arrangements which have been created by the EU since 1995 to frame
   Euro-Mediterranean relations, the article considers how seemingly
   different priorities and methods come together. Of particular interest
   is the EU's stated goal of a `partnership' across the Mediterranean,
   which is promoted by the EU at the same time as it seeks to project its
   own values in the countries just beyond its borders. The article
   considers the changing nature of `the Mediterranean' within EU
   policy-making, as well as the EU's changing priorities, which suggests
   incoherency but which instead underlines the central role of the EU in a
   Euro-Mediterranean system of governance. The positive connotations of
   the language of governance (identified in the first part of the article)
   are not fully present in the overlapping policy frames since the stated
   `partnership' between the two sides of the Mediterranean in a system of
   governance is not borne out in practice.},

   CHARGING THE POLICE WITH SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN EGYPT},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL FEMINIST JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {13},

Pages = {299-328},
Abstract = {This article analyzes sexual harassment politics in the global south as
   a crucial laboratory for testing and reformulating the mix of
   emancipatory and repressive governance practices that constitute
   contemporary gender-sensitive `human security' regimes. In Egypt,
   between 2003 and 2010, internationalist feminist campaigns advocated
   anti-harassment projects that demonized working-class youth
   masculinities as well as `disreputable' public femininities in an
   attempt to intensify the policing of the city and discipline public
   sociability. Through a politics of respectability and `strange
   bed-fellow' processes of NGO-ization, this state-allied, pro-enforcement
   project demobilized class-based movements for democratic change. By
   contrast, inventive Egyptian organizations adapted UN gender doctrines
   and legal mechanisms to their own purposes, mobilizing mass campaigns
   that critiqued frameworks of police protection and social
   respectability. They cultivated forms of assertive female agency that
   came to occupy center-stage during the recent Egyptian Revolution of
   January and February of 2011. By contrasting these forms of global/local
   feminist organizing, this article reveals the queering power of new
   metaphors of masculinity, class struggle and global female insecurity.
   The conclusion generates a critical theory of security-state practice
   and illuminates alternative global-south feminisms that contest rather
   than facilitate securitized and militarized appropriations of
   internationalist gender and security interventions.},

Title = {Doing Feminist Peace FEMINIST CRITICAL METHODOLOGY,
   DECOLONIZATION AND THE WOMEN'S INTERNATIONAL LEAGUE FOR PEACE AND
   FREEDOM (WILPF), 1945-75},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL FEMINIST JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2011},

Abstract = {The history of the oldest international women's peace organization, the
   Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF), presents a
   practical lesson for individuals and organizations interested in
   bringing about social change, as well as a theoretical lesson for those
   concerned with conceptualizing social change. WILPF's positions on
   decolonization between 1945 and 1975 show how historical circumstances
   and ideological environment intersected with the organization's ideas
   about peace to determine different policy choices. An unprecedented
   resolution in the early 1970s on the inevitability of violent
   revolutions resulted from a shift in ideological beliefs. While the
   international environment of the 1960s and 1970s favored this shift,
   WILPF arrived at its new policies thanks to its reliance on a
   theoretically-informed feminist critical methodology. This allowed WILPF
   to increasingly critique entrenched assumptions and reach a better
   informed understanding of peace, thereby contributing to the
   redefinition of the context that had created and shaped the
   organization. An activist-inspired, theoretically-driven feminist
   critical methodology thus makes social change possible.},

Pages = {460-480},
Abstract = {Intellectual property assets and most notably patents are assumed as
   most crucial instruments for an effective commercial exploitation of
   technological inventions. Although both the US and Europe agree in
   principle that an enhanced cooperation between their patent offices
   would foster the economic development, various negotiation rounds to
   harmonize patent application standards have been frustrated during the
   last 30 years. In our article, we claim that neither the US nor the
   member states of the European Patent Organization are willing to invest
   their regulators with a comprehensive negotiation mandate. As long as
   the decision-making substantially remains within the competencies of
   domestic institutions, societal actors in both economic spheres prove
   able to impede any rapprochement. The article concludes with a few
   tentative generalizations about the relationship between transnational
   regulatory networks, their institutional embeddedness, and domestic
   actors' constellations.},

Abstract = {The rights that the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC)
   enumerates include the rights to (1) an adequate standard of living, (2)
   an education directed toward the development of the child's fullest
   potential, (3) the highest attainable standard of health, and (4) the
   child's own cultural identity and use of his or her own language. The
   CRC states that these rights shall be ensured regardless of various
   statuses of children, including race, ethnic origin, national origin,
   and language. This article presents a statistical baseline for assessing
   the diversity of children in the United States with regard to these
   statuses, presents results for statistical indicators of well-being for
   children distinguished by these statuses, and discusses public policies
   to reduce inequalities relevant to these rights.},

Abstract = {Uneven Development endeavours to derive a theory of uneven geographical
   development by putting in motion a `historical dialogue' between Marx's
   critical theorisation of capitalism and the geograhical reality of
   capitalism at the close of the twentieth century, and by theorising the
   relations between material nature and the spatial dynamics of capitalist
   accumulation. The result, however, is a theory of uneven development
   predicated on a logical rather than a historical conception of
   capitalism, which furthermore supersedes the question of the production
   of nature in conceptualising the spatial dynamics of (contemporary)
   capitalism. This article argues for a re-theorisation of uneven
   geographical development that considers the production of nature, namely
   extractive industry, as a point of departure in theorising the spatial
   dynamics of contemporary capitalist accumulation, focusing briefly on
   the concentration and centralisation of capital.},

Abstract = {This article attempts to analyse the political discourse of some of the
   Azerbaijani elite on the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict through the lens of
   the views of leading members of Azerbaijani society. The information is
   based on personal interviews conducted with some influential members of
   the Azerbaijani political society in Baku in December 2001 and April
   2009. The focus of the study was to analyse how Azerbaijanis (re)
   construct their ideas about Armenian identity and community. The
   Azerbaijani narration of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict reveals how they
   have isolated themselves from their neighbours and from Western powers
   and how they legitimise their isolation.},

Abstract = {It's a commonplace that Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke draws his
   policies from Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz's A Monetary History of
   the United States (MH). With that in mind, this article establishes five
   points. First, contrary to conventional wisdom, Friedman and Schwartz
   merely insinuate their claim the Fed caused the Depression in MH.
   Second, their criticisms of Fed policy during the Depression, which turn
   on its refusal to adopt open market purchases (OMPs), repudiate
   Friedman's famed libertarianism and market fundamentalism. Third,
   Friedman and Schwartz don't refute the practical objections of bankers
   who opposed OMPs in the 1930s. Consequently, Bernanke's policies for
   addressing the financial crisis risk doing precisely what Friedman's
   targets warned against-encouraging financial speculation without
   addressing problems of unemployment. Fourth, Friedman and Schwartz's
   prescriptions entail a neoliberal, not a libertarian, state, one
   governed by technocrats and answerable to financial markets. Finally,
   what accounts for and unifies Friedman's contradictions is the
   beneficiary-finance.},

Title = {Waves of Change Within Civil Society in Latin America: Mexico City and
   Sao Paulo},
Journal = {POLITICS \& SOCIETY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {39},
Number = {3},
Pages = {415-449},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {For the past half a century, Latin American scholars have been pointing
   toward the emergence of new social actors as agents of social and
   political democratization. The first wave of actors was characterized by
   the emergence of novel agents-mainly, new popular movements-of social
   transformation. At first, the second wave, epitomized by nongovernmental
   organizations (NGOs), was celebrated as the upsurge of a new civil
   society, but later on, it was the target of harsh criticism. The
   literature often portrays this development in Latin American civil
   society as a displacement trend of actors of the first wave by the
   second wave-{''}NGOization{''}-{''}and even denounces new civil society
   as rootless, depoliticized, and functional to retrenchment. Thus,
   supposedly, NGOization encumbers social change. The authors argue that
   NGOization diagnosis is a flawed depiction of change within civil
   society. Rather than NGOization related to the depoliticization and
   neoliberalization of civil society, in Mexico City and Sao Paulo, there
   has been modernization of organizational ecologies, changes in the
   functional status of civil society, and interestingly, specialization
   aimed at shaping public agenda. The authors argue that such
   specialization, instead of encumbering social change, brings about
   different repertoires of strategies and skills purposively developed for
   influencing policy and politics. Their argument relies on comparative
   systematic evidence. Through network analysis, they examine the
   organizational ecology of civil society in Mexico City and Sao Paulo.},

Abstract = {The emergence of privately owned peasant farms in the early 1990s was
   one of the most important reforms in Russia's agrarian sector. Initially
   failing to become a significant food producer, during its second decade
   private farming emerged as a success in agrarian reform. This success is
   analyzed using two levels of analysis. At the macro-level, economic
   performance, government policy, and AKKOR's relationships with a range
   of actors are examined. The micro-or household level is examined using
   survey data from rural households, looking at private farmers' earned
   income, land holdings, and shifts in employment.},

   to use litigation in these cases, that the alleged failure of litigation
   in these cases might not be failures at all, and that regulation by
   litigation is not the unmitigated evil the authors of the book suggest.},

   experimentalist governance, and supporting coalitions in European Union
   health care policy},
Journal = {REGULATION \& GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {5},
Number = {2},
Pages = {187-203},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The experience of European Union (EU) health care services policy shows
   the importance of supporting coalitions in any effort to effect policy
   change and the extent to which the presence or absence of such
   coalitions can qualify generalizations about policymaking. EU health
   care services law is substantively liberalizing and procedurally driven
   by the courts, with little legislative input. But the European Court of
   Justice (ECJ) has been much better at establishing an EU competency in
   law than in causing policy development in the EU or member states.
   Literature on courts helps to explain why: courts are most effective
   when they enjoy supporting coalitions and the ECJ does not have a
   significant supporting coalition for its liberalizing health care
   services policy. Based on interview data, this article argues that the
   hard law of health care services deregulation and the newer forms of
   health care governance, such as the Open Method of Coordination and the
   networks on rare diseases, depend on supporting coalitions in member
   states that are willing to litigate, lobby, budget, decide cases, and
   otherwise implement EU law and policy. Given the resistance that the
   Court has met in health care sectors, its overarching deregulatory
   approach might produce smaller effects than expected, and forms of
   experimentalist governance that are easy to deride might turn out to
   have supporting coalitions that make them unexpectedly effective.},

Volume = {635},
Pages = {192-215},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This article addresses the reentry challenges faced by low-skilled men
   released from U. S. prisons. The author empirically characterizes the
   increases in incarceration occurring since 1970 and assesses the degree
   to which these changes result from changes in policy as opposed to
   changes in criminal behavior. The author discusses what is known about
   the children of inmates and the likelihood that a child in the United
   States has an incarcerated parent. The article then addresses the
   employment barriers that former prison inmates face, with a particular
   emphasis on how employers view criminal records in screening job
   applicants. Finally, the author discusses a number of alternative models
   for aiding the reentry of former inmates. Transitional cash assistance,
   the use of reentry plans, traditional workforce development efforts, and
   transitional jobs for former inmates all are among the tools used across

Abstract = {This article reports on a quantitative study of 1,117 cases of
   transposition of directives in five EU Member States and eight policy
   sectors between 1978 and 2002. It finds significant cross-sectoral
   performance differences, which complicate generalization from studies of
   only one sector. These differences can be partly explained by systematic
   cross-sectoral differences in transposition deadlines given, the share
   of Council versus Commission directives, and the legal implementation
   measures used.},

Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Pages = {57-84},

Abstract = {Unfavorable views toward a particular state will result in skepticism
   about the legitimacy of IGOs in which that state possesses influence.
   The more extensive the avenues of influence, the stronger this ``guilt
   by association.{''} The rationale is two-fold. First, a state that
   possesses institutionalized influence (e. g., a veto) within an
   intergovernmental organization faces substantial difficulties in
   credibly committing to non-interference with organizational activities.
   Second, even if a state somehow could commit to abstention from overt
   interference, it may exert covert ideational influence if it already has
   embedded its values into an IGO. Elites and laypeople alike recognize
   the avenues of influence that fuel guilt-by-association. With
   statistical analyses of public opinion data from 35,397 people in 23
   countries, I provide the first systematic evidence that
   guilt-by-association exists: for the United States, Russia, Japan, and
   Pakistan, vis-a-vis the United Nations, World Bank, and International
   Monetary Fund. The evidence is robust to numerous alternative
   specifications. The findings contribute to international relations
   scholarship by enhancing our understanding of threats to IGO legitimacy
   and by providing concrete evidence for a mechanism by which antipathy
   toward powerful states matters in the international realm.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF WOMEN POLITICS \& POLICY},

Volume = {32},
Number = {4},
Pages = {275-304},
Abstract = {Quotas are products of interactions between international and local
   factors and should be analyzed through those interactions. This article
   examines the processes of passage and implementation of a gender quota
   on Jordan's municipal councils and the public discourse accompanying
   those processes. Preliminary results show the quota encouraged many
   women to enter the political arena, but public discourse in Jordan does
   not look favorably on international intervention in women's issues.
   Although it is too soon to determine the quota's outcome, the process by
   which the public sphere comes to understand the quota will shape its
   long-term effects in significant ways.},

Abstract = {The United Nations (UN) Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) was
   a by-product of international commitments to human rights, but its
   history lies in the complex and contradictory developments of the
   twentieth century, when elevated expectations regarding the welfare of
   children confronted the realities of war. In the late nineteenth
   century, material conditions and reform efforts redefined the lives of
   children in the Western world and created new sentiments about childhood
   and investments in children's progress. World Wars I and II exposed
   children's acute vulnerability and the myth of inevitable progress.
   After each of these wars, defining what was owed to children and how
   best to meet their needs was part of larger international negotiations
   regarding power and prestige. Throughout this period, the involvement of
   women, a new Swedish presence in international diplomacy, and the
   growing role of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) affected what would
   become a rearticulation of child welfare and protection and a more
   active commitment to children's rights.},

   relations. We find that by the mid-2000s defence enterprises were
   largely able to stop job losses, eliminate wage arrears and restore
   wages to the level prevailing in the civilian economy. The study
   confirms that compared to other sectors of the Russian economy, defence
   enterprises continue to carry a strong legacy of the Soviet system. The
   dominant role of state ownership and government orders, along with the
   relative geographical isolation of defence enterprises and obvious
   factors of secrecy and security, made labour at these enterprises less
   willing to challenge management or owners by strikes and open protests.
   On the other hand, workers of defence enterprises can count on a more
   paternalistic attitude from managers and relatively more generous
   welfare benefits.},

Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},

Abstract = {This paper focuses on the OECD's Strategy, which became a principal
   means for the OECD to promote a neo-liberal model of social and
   employment policy to its member states and it also influenced the
   European Union's employment strategy. Yet important modifications were
   introduced in 2006 with the recognition of an alternative policy path,
   `flexicurity.' While the latter accepted neoliberal macroeconomic
   `fundamentals,' it broke with neoliberalism to the extent that it
   recognized a positive role for labour market regulations and social
   policies in promoting security and social inclusion. The paper analyses
   the politics associated with this shift, using the concept of
   `organisational discourse' to get at the dynamic (and contested) nature
   of the OECD's ideational lens. While the OECD came under pressure from
   some of its member states to alter its `one size fits all' strategy, the
   Economics Department, whose version of the discourse initially
   dominated, was also challenged from within by the Directorate for
   Employment, Labour and Social Affairs (DELSA), which developed its own
   alternative discourse.},

Abstract = {This article contributes to the study of women's entrepreneurship in
   transition economies by examining Russian self-employed women's
   experiences and interpretations of gender in the context of
   entrepreneurship. It traces how gender articulates the opportunities for
   and the constraints on entrepreneurial activities in Russian society. As
   such, this article engages in the theoretical discussion of gendered
   patterns of entrepreneurship. The article employs a qualitative
   methodology and analyses semi-structured interviews with women
   entrepreneurs conducted in St Petersburg and in two towns in the
   Republic of Karelia during the period 2005-2006. The respondents
   represent small and medium-sized enterprises mainly in production,
   retail trade and services.},

Abstract = {This article examines the status of globalization as a causal factor in
   political mobilization and proposes a research agenda for diagnosing the
   impact of global socio-economic dynamics on ideological orientation in
   national polities. Focusing on Europes established democracies, the
   article outlines recent shifts in Europes ideological landscape and
   explores the mechanisms generating a new pattern of political conflict
   and electoral competition. It advances the hypothesis that the knowledge
   economy of open borders has brought about a political cleavage
   intimately linked to citizens perceptions of the social impact of global
   economic integration. In this context, the polarization of life chances
   is determined by institutionally mediated exposure to both the economic
   opportunities and the hazards of globalization. Fostered by the
   increasing relevance of the international for state-bound publics, new
   fault-lines of social conflict are emerging, giving shape to a new,
   opportunity-risk, axis of political competition. As the novel political
   cleavage challenges the conventional leftright divide, it is likely to
   radically alter Europes ideological geography.},

Abstract = {Based on quantitative indicators for fifteen advanced countries between
   1974 and 2005, and case studies of France, the United Kingdom, Germany,
   Italy, Sweden, and Ireland, this article analyzes the trajectory of
   institutional change in the industrial relations systems of advanced
   capitalist societies, with a focus on Western Europe. In contrast to
   current comparative political economy scholarship, which emphasizes the
   resilience of national institutions to common challenges and trends, it
   argues that despite a surface resilience of distinct national sets, all
   countries have been transformed in a neoliberal direction. Neoliberal
   transformation manifests itself not just as institutional deregulation
   but also as institutional conversion, as the functions associated with
   existing institutional forms change in a convergent direction. A key
   example is the institution of centralized bargaining, once the linchpin
   of an alternative, redistributive and egalitarian, model of negotiated
   capitalism, which has been reshaped in the past twenty years to fit the
   common imperative of liberalization.},

Abstract = {The objective of the paper is to examine how firms have dealt with the
   trade-off between flexibility and uncertainty that is characteristic for
   the decision-making of firms in coping with self-regulatory initiatives
   in general and the comply-or-explain principle in corporate governance
   in particular. Using unique data for 126 listed Dutch firms, we find
   that firms respond to this self-regulatory initiative by largely
   complying with the code recommendation, possibly out of fear that the
   firm's reputation may be damaged. Furthermore, we find evidence
   suggesting that firms confine themselves to adopting a specific set of
   code recommendations and use similar arguments to explain
   non-compliance. Our findings indicate uniformity in adopting the
   standard of good governance which is not in line with the logic of
   corporate governance codes and casts doubt on the effectiveness of this
   form of soft law. Overall, the paper's findings indicate that more
   restrictive (regulatory) instruments may be necessary to make firms
   conform to the spirit of codes.},

Abstract = {Premier science largely depends on the quality of the pool of future
   scientists. Women now represent a large part of the talent pool in the
   United States, but many data sources indicate that they are more likely
   than men to ``leak{''} out of the science pipeline before obtaining
   tenure at a college or university. The authors' research examines this
   issue in detail, drawing on multiple sources, including the Survey of
   Doctorate Recipients and several original surveys. Their findings show
   that family formation-most important marriage and childbirth-accounts
   for the largest leaks in the pipeline from graduate school to the
   acquisition of tenure for women in the sciences. The authors also find
   that researchers receive limited benefits when it comes to family
   responsive policies, such as paid maternity and parental leave, and that
   young scientists receive the least. Together, federal agencies and
   universities can make headway in solving this systemic problem.},

Abstract = {Examining debates about the person, place, and meaning of Jesus Christ
   in African American social development, creative expression, political
   thought, civil rights activism, international visions, and economic
   plans, this article suggests that religious discussions have revealed
   robust democratic cultures. From the age of slavery to the era of Obama,
   religious discussions and political cultures have been intertwined.
   Spiritual debates have played a role in community formation;
   individualism and universalism have worked in tandem; and Jesus Christ-a
   provincial figure executed thousands of years ago-became essential to
   international and political visions. This article suggests that Jesus
   functioned historically in two prominent political ways for African
   Americans. First, he stood as a counterpoint to American racism that
   limited the social, legal, political, and cultural rights of African
   Americans. Second, he functioned as a focus of intraracial and
   interracial debate, dialogue, and dissension over the role of religion
   in black politics.},

   litigation},
Journal = {REGULATION \& GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {5},
Number = {2},
Pages = {262-274},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The authors of Regulation by Litigation characterize the US
   Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)'s enforcement action against
   diesel engine manufacturers as an effort to achieve by litigation what
   the Agency was unable to achieve by regulation: immediate reductions in
   emissions of nitrogen oxides. By substituting litigation for rulemaking,
   the authors of the book argue, the Agency avoided political and judicial
   accountability and put itself on a suboptimal policy track. This comment
   argues that the diesel engine litigation may be better understood as
   what it purported to be, an enforcement action, not rulemaking in
   disguise. The authors' characterization of the litigation is
   questionable on at least two grounds. First, it fails to fully
   appreciate the distinct functions of enforcement and policymaking in a
   regulatory setting. The goal of enforcement is not primarily to make
   policy, but to enforce it - to punish violators, deter future
   violations, and mitigate harms caused by violations. That goal supplies
   the proper measure of the litigation's success. Second, in applying
   public choice analysis to create a story of agency circumvention of
   appropriate rulemaking procedures, the authors' account misses key
   features of how agency enforcement decisions are made - and were made in
   this litigation. This latter shortcoming raises broader questions about
   the difficulties of applying public choice analysis in complex
   institutional settings.},

   Explaining the Slovenian Exception},
Journal = {POLITICS \& SOCIETY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {39},
Number = {2},
Pages = {268-295},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Although Slovenia is a small, relatively new nation-state, it has been
   justifiably called ``neocorporatist{''} and a ``coordinated market
   economy,{''} making it unique among postcommunist societies, including
   ten new EU member states. The authors explore how it became so, and in
   the process shed light on the debate between varieties of capitalism
   (VoC) and power resources theories about how coordinated or
   neocorporatist economies emerge. Although several of the elements
   predicted by the varieties of capitalism perspective were present in
   Slovenia, others were not. The authors also find that a significant
   mobilization by organized labor at a crucial point played an essential
   role, and overall find that power resources theory has greater
   explanatory power in this case. However, in turning from explaining how
   the Slovenian model was formed to why it was so unique among
   postcommunist cases, they find that specific historical legacies were
   critical, particularly those from the distinct Yugoslav form of
   communism.},

Abstract = {After reviewing conceptual contributions that address the blurred
   boundary between the war and home fronts and the complexities of
   contemporary political topologies in general, I turn to a reading of
   three artistic texts-the photomontages of Martha Rosler, Paul Haggis's
   film In the Valley of Elah, and Annie Proulx's story, ``Tits-Up in a
   Ditch{''}-to analyze the war front-home front relationship. I end with
   some reflections on the analytic contributions of montage techniques in
   terms of the way they establish equivalences that revalue our
   perspectives on the locations and actualities (presences) of war.},

Volume = {49},

Abstract = {The recent history of financial integration in Europe can generally be
   considered a success story, notwithstanding the crisis that has plagued
   financial sectors in Europe and elsewhere since 2007. There has been
   significant progress in the area of regulatory integration; however, an
   in-depth analysis requires also taking into account what happens on the
   ground - that is, at the market level. As a consequence of this larger
   and more interactive point of view, this article shows that financial
   integration is less uniform than a cursory look at the evolution of
   European Union regulation would have us believe. This is because
   national contexts continue to bear considerable weight. In particular,
   any explanation of the current state of affairs in the EU's financial
   integration needs to take the market-regulation nexus seriously. This
   implies looking at market structure as well as at the political and
   institutional context. This article suggest a framework to explain more
   adequately the contradictions between regulatory and market integration.},

Abstract = {Europeanization is not only top-down and one-dimensional. National
   governments play two-level games, encountering non-state actors that
   seek to shape the national interest positions. Examining migration and
   asylum policy, a domain not yet subject to extensive scholarly
   attention, the role of non-state interest groups and their influence,
   where coalition-building is successful, is highlighted. Empirically, the
   article explores the genesis of the EU's family reunion, asylum
   qualification and the labour migration directives. In theoretical terms,
   the article contributes to the burgeoning literature on Europeanization,
   while seeking to refine it further and apply it to a somewhat neglected
   policy domain.},

Abstract = {A defining theme of defence intelligence in the UK during the early Cold
   War was the Service Departments' resistance to the concept of integrated
   intelligence. This article explains how this capability was achieved
   only with the amalgamation of the three Service Departments within a
   unified Ministry of Defence with overarching strategic and financial
   authority. It offers a critical analysis of the 1960 Templer review of
   Service intelligence, the creation of the Defence Intelligence Staff in
   April 1964, and its further restructuring on a functional basis in
   August 1965 by the Secretary of State, Denis Healey.},

Abstract = {Palestinian women's organized resistance to the Israeli occupation is
   decades old and has been well-documented and analysed by feminists in
   the occupied Palestinian territory (oPt) and outside. Some of the most
   recent attempts to formulate and shape this resistance make reference to
   UNSCR 1325. The application of the Resolution in the work of three
   women's organizations in the Gaza Strip, the West Bank and
   Palestinian-Israeli peace-making attempts are analysed in this paper.
   However, the paper concludes that the disconnects between women's
   activism on the ground and in academia, the intentions stated in UNSCR
   1325, and the Israel-Palestine peace process are so vast that there is
   little evidence that the Resolution offers an effective mechanism for
   women to make their voices heard.},

Pages = {129-154},
Abstract = {This article analyses contemporary forms of extreme-right violence in
   Russia. The authors deal with the traditions and ideological background
   of the militant right-wing extremist scene as well as with its
   contemporary social and political background. The most important forms
   of right-wing extremist violence are identified as ad hoc hate crimes,
   local ethnically motivated conflicts, activities of organised gangs, the
   existence of paramilitary units and terrorist tendencies. Political
   reactions to this violence in Russia are described. The authors come to
   the conclusion that the threat of extreme-right violence will remain an
   important element of Russia's future security development.},

Journal = {INTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {26},
Number = {2-3},
Pages = {203-227},
Abstract = {The concept of `politicization' of the US intelligence services, and in
   particular the CIA, has been debated by scholars for many years.
   However, it has also been easily dismissed by those investigating recent
   US foreign policy, as in the Robb-Silberman Commission's assurance over
   the 2003 Iraq War that `the Intelligence Community needs to be pushed'.
   This essay seeks an extension of the critique of politicization by
   considering the historical context since the formation of the CIA. It
   seeks an application of that critique by putting forth, when evaluating
   the policy and operations of the George W. Bush administration, the
   notion of an `alternative network' within the government. The argument
   is that politicization must be linked to a conception of `Executive
   power', both within the American bureaucracy and in the projection and
   rationalization of US aims overseas.},

Abstract = {Political events can serve as an impetus for civic engagement or
   disengagement. The events of 9/11 have directed attention toward US
   Muslim communities and occasionally inflamed anti-Islam and anti-Muslim
   sentiments. This article explores the impact of the 11 September events
   on hijab-wearing Muslim American women. These events and the negative
   perception of Islam have paradoxically given rise to Muslim women's
   public presence and paved the way for their political engagement. Their
   efforts, however, have been hampered by Orientalist and Islamic
   fundamentalist ideologies, each advancing its own constructs of Muslim
   women; one seeking to `save' them and the other to `protect' them.
   Muslim women have found both ideologies oppressive. As a result, they
   have been actively challenging these ideologies in American society at
   large and within their own Muslim communities. Through civic engagement
   and participation in Muslim organizations, these women have been making
   efforts to redefine themselves, claim their space, secure their rights
   and advance the causes of Muslim American communities.},

Title = {Associations, Deliberation, and Democracy: The Case of Ireland's Social
   Partnership},
Journal = {POLITICS \& SOCIETY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {39},
Number = {4},
Pages = {497-519},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Over the past two decades there has been a burgeoning interest and
   research into experiments and innovations in participatory governance.
   While advocates highlight the merits of such new governance arrangements
   in moving beyond traditional interest group representations and
   deepening democracy through deliberation with a broad range of civic
   associations, critics express concern about the political legitimacy and
   democratic accountability of participating associations, highlighting in
   particular the dangers of co-option and faction. Addressing these
   concerns, a number of theorists identify an important role for civic
   associations in linking deliberations at micro policy levels to those
   within the public sphere more broadly. These normative contributions
   raise an important empirical question-does civic associational
   engagement at micro levels leave scope to engage both laterally across
   associations and vertically with members and citizens more broadly? More
   simply put, is civic associational engagement within micro-policy fora
   ``good{''} for democracy more broadly? Drawing from a study of civic
   associational engagement in Ireland's national Social Partnership
   process over a ten-year period this article argues that, where
   deliberations become overshadowed by more traditional communicative
   norms of bargaining and negotiation, it is not. Evidence is presented
   from the Irish case to show how civic actors, having internalized the
   dominant communicative norms of the process, have contributed toward a
   narrowing of the deliberative space within, but most particularly
   outside, this process. This, it is argued, has resulted in a
   considerably weakened public sphere with neither the institutional
   apparatus nor the discursive capacity to seek accountability from
   political and civic leaders at a time of profound crisis within the
   Irish state.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the recent change of legal status of the
   solicitation of sex services in Cambodia brought about by the recently
   adopted Law on Suppression of Human Trafficking and Sexual Exploitation.
   In Cambodia, the practices associated with the government's handling of
   the issue of prostitution are well-entrenched and are proving to be
   resilient in the face of the changing laws. Amidst the stalemates and
   confusion that abound as a result, Cambodia's sex workers find their
   rights compromised and at times trampled. Non-governmental services
   expected to assist the sex workers in the restoration of their rights
   often exacerbate their plight.},

Abstract = {This paper empirically investigates the economic and political factors
   that affect a country's likelihood to sign an arrangement with the IMF
   and the determinants of the financial size of such a program. Arguably
   the world and the global financial architecture underwent structural
   changes after the ending of Cold War and so did the role of the IMF.
   Hence, we update and extend the work of Sturm et al. (Economics and
   Politics 17: 177-213, 2005) by employing a panel model for 165 countries
   that focuses on the post-Cold War era, i.e., 1990-2009. Our results,
   based on extreme bounds analysis, suggest that some economic and
   political variables are robustly related to these two dimensions of IMF
   program decisions. Furthermore, we show that it is important to
   distinguish between concessional and non-concessional IMF loans.},

Abstract = {This article examines methodologies for human rights impact assessments
   (HRIAs) of trade agreements through a discussion of a recent assessment
   of the impact of the United States-Dominican Republic-Central American
   Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) on access to medicines in Costa Rica. The
   article identifies the methodology for undertaking the assessment and
   discusses the ways in which adopting a human rights framework for impact
   assessment requires certain modifications to existing impact assessment
   methodologies. The article then examines some of the benefits in
   adopting such a framework as a means of analysing the impact of trade
   agreements as well as some of the political and technical challenges
   facing HRIAs. The article concludes with a call for more professional
   attention to HRIAs of trade agreements through the development of
   guiding principles, and for the commission of more HRIAs. The article
   also suggests that the mainstreaming of human rights in other impact
   assessment methodologies such as social impact assessments (SIAs) might
   also be considered.},

   a third internal energy policy package, agreed by the European Union in

   greater will on the part of the Commission to pressure unwilling Member
   State governments, and shifts in Commission leverage vis-a-vis Member
   States as well as a shift in policy networks with clout in EU
   policy-making. This shift in Commission leverage would indicate stronger
   supranational governance in EU energy matters in the future.},

Abstract = {Police reform demonstrated the fragility of the transition process in
   Bosnia and the limitations of the prospect of European Union membership.
   To the two mechanisms of conditionality and socialization commonly
   mentioned in the Europeanization literature, this article adds a third -
   external imposition - which is specific to the case of Bosnia. The fact
   that the High Representative resorted to coercive measures in order to
   implement European conditions needs to be accounted for in any
   explanation of Bosnia's Europeanization. In the case of police
   restructuring, conditionality was monopolized by the High Representative
   and socialization did not take place because the reforms were not
   perceived as legitimate by at least one of the parties. Domestic
   factors, including the complex governance system introduced by the
   Dayton Agreement and recalcitrant nationalist elites, also hindered the
   Europeanization process in Bosnia.},

Title = {Transnational Governance as Contested Institution-Building: China,
   Merchants, and Contract Rules in the Cotton Trade},
Journal = {POLITICS \& SOCIETY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {39},
Number = {1},
Pages = {3-39},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {We are in an era of uncertainty over whose rules will govern global
   economic integration. With the growing market share of Chinese firms and
   the power of the Chinese state it is unclear if Western firms will
   continue to dominate transnational governance. Exploring these dynamics
   through a study of contract rules in the global cotton trade, this
   article conceptualizes commodity chain governance as a contested process
   of institution-building. To this end, the global commodity chain/global
   value chain (GCC/GVC) framework must be revised to better account for
   the broader institutional context of commodity chain governance,
   institutional variation across space, and strategic action in the
   construction of legitimate governance arrangements. I provide a more
   dynamic model of GCC governance that stresses how strategic action,
   existing institutions, and dominant discourses intersect as firms and
   states compete for institutional power within a commodity chain. This
   advances our understandings of how commodity chain governance emerges
   and changes over time.},

Abstract = {This article assesses the thinking behind what is perhaps the single
   most important attempt to depoliticise monetary policy making in postwar
   Britain prior to the Bank of England Act 1998 - the introduction of the
   minimum lending rate (MLR) in October 1972. Drawing on recently released
   primary sources it argues that the MLR was devised to `defuse' the
   political implications of Bank Rate policy and thereby shield the
   government from the consequences of frequent upward shifts in interest
   rates. MLR is considered as an experiment in `governing through the
   market' and it is argued this has implications for how postwar monetary
   policy is viewed and how state/market relations are analysed,
   empirically and theoretically, within IPE.},

Title = {Managing corruption risks},
Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {18},
Number = {2},
Pages = {251-275},
Abstract = {This article investigates the emerging engagement of private actors and
   specifically Western corporations in international anti-corruption,
   drawing on Foucauldian studies of governmentality. It explores this
   engagement as governing practices that have emanated quite independently
   from the interstate system commonly understood to be at the core of the
   anti-corruption regime. It demonstrates how corporate anti-corruption
   ties in with a relatively new way of perceiving corruption. In this
   framing, anti-corruption comes out as risk management, which is latched
   on to notions of corporate social responsibility and business ethics.
   Moreover, the constitution of corruption risk relates to the rise of new
   actors and networks engaged in a wider business of anti-corruption,
   including commercial and hybrid actors that supply corporations with
   managerial instruments, benchmarks for best practice, rankings, and
   information and surveillance systems. This facilitates the enrollment of
   corporations into the anti-corruption cause while cultivating their
   competitiveness aspirations. The article offers a novel perspective on
   international anti-corruption and the position of business herein, and
   in a wider sense, it also contributes discussions about the role of
   private actors and their micro practices in global governance.},

Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},

Volume = {16},
Number = {5},
Pages = {561-584},
Abstract = {International law is currently undergoing a major transformation that
   has provoked a `legal turn' in the field of International Relations. At
   the heart of this transformation are the juridification of international
   politics and subsequently the judicialisation of international law. This
   contribution argues that scholars of critical International Political
   Economy have not yet paid enough attention to this process. What is
   needed is a theory of international law that is able to grasp the
   societal implications of this transformation. In a first step some
   accounts drawing on Antonio Gramsci and Evgeny Pashukanis are presented,
   with a view to making their theory fruitful for analysing international
   law. Against the background of an empirical study that compares the
   global regulation of trade in goods with the trade in services,
   delivered notably through natural persons, some major shortcomings of
   these accounts are outlined. The last part of the contribution presents
   some ideas on how to further develop a critical theory of international
   (trade) law that introduces a communicative dimension into the legal
   turn with a view to distinguishing between different extra-economic
   dynamics.},

Abstract = {This article studies the determining factors of gender composition of
   the boards of large Spanish companies and presents a method to predict
   it. For this purpose, a multivariate analysis is run to identify the
   differences in the characteristics between firms without female
   directors and firms with two or more female directors or one female
   director if she is the chief executive officer (CEO) or chair. This
   research analyzes women's participation on Spanish boards in a period
   prior to the introduction of voluntary measures to boost female
   participation, so its results are not influenced by that development.},

   Transitions, and the Rise of China},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {16},
Number = {2},
Pages = {267-280},
Abstract = {This article surveys and critically assesses the life work of Giovanni
   Arrighi, a renowned historical sociologist and world-systems scholar who
   passed away in 2009. In a trilogy of books published between 1994 and
   2007 Arrighi develops the master concept of his theoretical legacy,
   systemic cycles of accumulation, and advances an original reading of the
   history and dynamics of world capitalism as a succession of hegemonic
   episodes, each one more expansive than the previous and culminating in
   crises and chaotic transitions. He anticipated the rise of a Chinese-led
   East Asia as the emergent twenty-first century centre of a reorganised
   world economy and society. Arrighi is faulted for failing to develop any
   theory of politics, the state and collective agency in his construct,
   for his lack of attention to social forces from below, and for his
   dismissal of recent theorising on globalization.},

Abstract = {The European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR) is often
   considered the jewel in the crown of the European Unions democracy
   promotion. Its mandate encompasses the funding of democratizing civil
   society organizations and thus the facilitation of democratization from
   below. It is argued here that if we apply Foucauldian governmentality
   tools to the analysis of the workings of the EIDHR, we can see that,
   despite the pluralistic rhetoric that guides it, the Instruments
   objectives and management structures facilitate particular kinds of
   democratic visions. Neoliberal governmentality, it is argued, may be
   hidden deep within the expectations set for EU-funded civil society
   democratizers. This has important consequences for how we understand the
   model of democracy that the European Union promotes and the power
   relations of the European Unions locally owned democracy promotion.},

Abstract = {This article explores voting patterns in the Council of the European
   Union between May 2004 and the end of December 2006, studying the full
   set of voting records for this institution. It analyses government vote
   choices in the Council on the basis of ordered logistic regression
   analysis, explaining the propensity of European Union (EU) Member States
   to vote `yes', abstain from voting or vote `no'. The article explains
   voting behaviour in the Council on the basis of selected independent
   variables - notably, governments' absolute and relative positions on the
   left-right policy dimension, support for European integration among
   domestic audiences, Member States' population size, and their positions
   as either net beneficiaries of or net payers into the EU budget. The
   empirical analysis reveals that voting behaviour is markedly different
   for the group of older EU Member States compared to its newer ones, with
   some of the explanatory variables even displaying opposite signs for
   these two groups in the statistical analyses.},

Abstract = {This policy note examines the reasoning and implications of the judgment
   of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in the milestone case of
   Kawas v. Honduras. In its first-ever ruling on environmental defenders,
   the Court found a positive obligation on the part of member states in
   the Hemisphere to protect environmentalists who are in serious jeopardy
   from human rights violations. The Kawas case is a paradigmatic example
   of the constant threats these activists encounter, both in the Americas
   and internationally, and states in the region are now on notice to
   ensure special protection to those most in danger of harm. The Court
   arrived at the remarkable juncture of `making visible and potentially
   punishable what heretofore has been invisible and unpunished'. An
   Epilogue addresses the subsequent ruling in the `Mexican Ecologists'
   case, and offers recommendations to human rights and environmental
   defenders and practitioners both regionally and internationally.},

Year = {2011},
Volume = {637},
Pages = {165-183},

Abstract = {This article examines the relationships between race, class, and
   citizenship in Venezuela's burgeoning grassroots democracy as the
   nation's 2012 presidential election approaches. Although the Venezuelan
   political arena is frequently overshadowed by policies and the
   personality of President Hugo Chavez, recently developing techniques of
   governance permit increased local autonomy. This and an associated push
   to integrate marginalized populations into social and political life
   have played a significant role in the production of community, public
   space, and localized conceptions of citizenship. While emergent
   Caraqueno democratic forms commonly idealize equality and collaborative
   governance, disjunctures among the city's communities are social,
   geographic, and political. This article highlights the varying modes of
   political belonging greatly engendered by race and class in Caracas.
   These experiences of citizenship, in turn, have resulted in increased
   participation and access to power for some as they deny inclusion to
   others. This study of modes of citizenship focuses on the citizen and
   the public sphere, emerging modes of governance and the developing
   Venezuelan state, and dissidence within the democratic process.},

Abstract = {The current financial crisis demonstrated, once again, the need for deep

   partial in scope and rely excessively on an ad hoc body, the G20. It
   thus calls for an international architecture that meets two basic
   criteria. First, it should be comprehensive. This means that a broad
   range of reforms should be undertaken: better macroeconomic policy
   coordination; regulatory reform, including cross-border capital flows;
   ample countercyclical IMF and development financing with limited
   conditionality; global monetary reform; and the creation of an
   international debt court. Second, inclusive institutions should stand at
   the center of the new architecture, structured as a multilayered network
   of global, regional, and national financial institutions.},

Abstract = {This article argues that international criminal law distinguishes
   between `civil society as subject' (expert international nongovernmental
   organizations and transnational networks of activists voluntarily
   entering into the international criminal justice arena) and `civil
   society as object' (objects of the purportedly transformative processes
   of international criminal law). Although the International Criminal
   Court (ICC) has adopted a different approach towards civil society than
   that of the ad hoc Tribunals, it too struggles to provide `civil society
   as object' with a meaningful opportunity to participate, as exemplified
   by continuing difficulties with the operation of victim participation.
   And yet, just as `civil society as subject' has benefited from the
   institutionalization of civil society at the ICC, so has the ICC
   benefited from the mobilization of the expertise of `civil society as
   subject.' The danger is that other voices are thereby excluded to the
   detriment of justice.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SOCIOLOGY},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This paper approaches the ontology of war by asking why, despite its
   constitutive function for politics and society, has war never been made
   the object of an academic discipline? Through an analysis of the
   relationship between war and knowledge about war, we argue that the
   ontology of war is such that it disrupts foundational claims of the kind
   necessary for conventional forms of academic disciplinarity. At the
   center of the ontology of war is fighting, an idea we recover from
   Clausewitz. A moment of radical contingency, fighting both compromises
   knowledge about war and forces the unmaking and remaking of social and
   political orders. These generative powers of war operate through the
   production of systems of knowledge and their institutionalization in the
   academy, the state and wider society. Although of existential
   significance for political authority, these knowledges are vulnerable to
   the very contingency of war that produces them. This complex of
   relations between war, knowledge, and power we term War/Truth. As such,
   an analytical framework adequate to war requires a reflexive relation to
   truth claims. We clear the ground for such a ``critical war
   studies.{''}.},

Abstract = {To be a full member of a country, must one have citizenship, the same
   ethnic or racial background, or the same religion as most citizens? What
   do people of different statuses believe about the criteria for
   inclusion? To answer these questions, the authors analyze the 2003
   International Social Survey Programme survey on national identity,
   focusing on ten wealthy, democratic countries. They find a series of
   mismatches. A strong sense of being included is often coupled with a
   desire to exclude others. Countries with extreme public views are not
   always the countries with political controversy over inclusion. Views of
   citizens or members of the mainstream religion or race often differ from
   views of relative outsiders. Countries often cluster in ways that
   violate standard assumptions about geographic, cultural, or political
   affinities. Enjoying high status does not guarantee feeling included or
   seeking to include others. Given these mismatches, it is no surprise
   that politics and policies around inclusion are contentious, unstable,
   and fascinating.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the prospects of deliberative democracy
   through the analysis of small-scale deliberative events, or
   mini-publics, using empirical methods to understand the process of
   preference transformation. Evidence from two case studies suggests that
   deliberation corrects preexisting distortions of public will caused by
   either active manipulation or passive overemphasis on symbolically
   potent issues. Deliberation corrected these distortions by reconnecting
   participants' expressed preferences to their underlying ``will{''} as
   well as shaping a shared understanding of the issue. The article
   concludes by using these insights to suggest ways that mini-public
   deliberation might be articulated to the broader public sphere so that
   the benefits might be scaled up. That mini-public deliberation does not
   so much change individual subjectivity as reconnect it to the expression
   of will suggests that scaling up the transformative effects should be
   possible so long as this involves communicating in the form of reasons
   rather than preferred outcome alone.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on stratification beliefs and racial policy
   opinions among white and black Americans who differ in religious
   preference. First, it summarizes earlier research on white conservative
   Protestants and outlines characterizations of Black Protestant church
   congregants. It then reports patterns of stratification beliefs and
   racial policy opinions among blacks and whites varying in religious
   preference who responded to the 1996 through 2006 General Social
   Surveys. Comparisons across twelve race-by-religion categories did not
   provide persuasive evidence that white conservative Protestants are
   uniquely conservative in their stratification beliefs, once background
   characteristics are controlled, nor was the Black Protestant group
   distinctive. Compared to blacks, whites were less inclined to
   structuralist explanations of racial inequality, slightly more inclined
   to individualist explanations, and consistently more negative about
   policies and programs to aid blacks. What is more, white Christians were
   more racially conservative in all these ways than non-Christian whites.},

Abstract = {This article uses the concepts of critical juncture and feedback effects
   in historical institutionalism to examine China's role in promoting a
   China-ASEAN Free Trade Area (CAFTA). The first section examines the
   specific combination of structural factors and key intervention from
   Chinese policymakers that triggered the CAFTA process. The second
   section outlines the details of the CAFTA negotiations, analyzing the
   feedback effects that shaped the path and eventual outcomes of the CAFTA
   Agreement. Attention is given to China's initiation of a programme of
   `early harvest' agreements that were added to the CAFTA Agreement
   Framework in order to help persuade the hesitant states in the region to
   enlist in the China-led conception of Asian regionalism.},

Abstract = {Intelligence's activities provoked feelings of threat in the adversary,
   and its capabilities provided reassurance for its own side. Fear of
   espionage (and associated covert action) was common to both sides.
   Intrusive technical collection had a similar effect, principally through
   the scale of Western operations around Soviet territory, and in
   overflights up to May 1960. On the other hand intelligence's
   capabilities provided reassurance for both sides in the mutually
   legitimized verification of the US-Soviet strategic arms control
   agreements. As the Cold War progressed they also increased Western
   governments' confidence that they would not be caught by a Soviet
   surprise attack, or by an overturning of the military balance of power.
   Yet for both sides the threat of the opponent's intelligence activities
   - the enemy within - remained the more important part of Cold War
   psychology.},

Abstract = {This article reviews the role of the state in Ireland's adaptation to
   globalisation and reflects on the changing nature of the Irish state in
   the context of global and EU pressures. It examines two competing
   literatures about conceptions of the Irish state, one which argues
   Ireland is a model of successful development or flexible develpomental
   state, and the other arguing Ireland, as a competition state,
   prioritises economic competitiveness over social cohesion and welfare.
   The article empirically examines the structural direction of policy
   change and shifts in power and policy processes. Both developmental and
   competition logics are found, these are sometimes complementary and
   other times opposing logics. The developmental role of the Irish state
   has been uneven across policy areas, being most evident in policies that
   enable foreign capital thrive and profit and least evident in supporting
   indigenous industry and social inclusion. While there have been temporal
   shifts in developmental and competition logics, examination of recent
   policy responses to recession and economic crisis suggests the primary
   logic informing Irish development is the competition logic.},

Abstract = {This article argues that some leaders within the US antiabortion
   movement are pursuing a frame extension in order to attract new
   adherents to their cause. While the dominant rhetoric of the movement
   today focuses on the fetus and the immorality of abortion, pro-woman
   rhetoric has reemerged that leverages both the language of women's
   rights as well as science in order to propose that abortion is bad for
   women. The frame extension is evident outside even the social movement
   organizations, and if the pro-woman rhetoric resonates with traditional
   opponents of the antiabortion movement, it could allow the movement to
   construct a majority for further restrictions on abortion access and
   rights.},

Abstract = {With the creation of a common foreign and security policy (CFSP), the EU
   has entered the realm of power politics. Although the ambition to become
   a great power has been frequently reiterated, the EU has often failed to
   deliver stated policy objectives. This article has two broad goals. One
   is to outline the strategic behavioural patterns of small powers. The
   lack of scholarly attention to these states - the largest group in the
   international system - is a major omission from the International
   Relations canon. The other is to see how EU patterns of behaviour,
   exemplified in attempts to build up capacities for military
   intervention, overlap with those of a small power. The article argues
   that the concept of a small power best captures the reality of the EU as
   a strategic actor. Consequently, the EU is more comparable to other
   small powers such as Sweden or Argentina rather than to great powers
   such as China or Russia.},

Abstract = {This article explains how microcredit as a policy idea has been
   institutionalized at the transnational level, and what role strategic
   actors play in the institutional change and governance of microcredit.
   Special attention is given to three dominant actors, the Grameen Bank,
   the World Bank, and SKS Microfinance. To explain the emergence of
   microcredit as a transnational policy idea this article explores the
   relations between theories of institutional change and Rosenau's concept
   of spheres of authority.},

Abstract = {There is no consensus in the literature about the nature of terrorism.
   The authors' main claim is that this is ultimately the result of the
   coexistence of two senses of the term, the action and the actor sense,
   which are not fully congruent. Rather than trying to advocate a specific
   conceptualization, the authors provide in this article a map of the
   different ways in which scholars talk about terrorism. They identify
   first the set of terrorist actions and the set of terrorist actors.
   Terrorist tactics are a variety of the power to hurt, based on the lack
   of military power. Terrorist groups are underground ones with no
   territorial control. When the two criteria meet, the core of terrorism
   exists: coercive violence perpetrated by underground groups. The
   ambiguity that surrounds terrorism is caused by two other possibilities:
   actors with some measure of territorial control adopting coercive
   tactics and underground actors adopting military tactics. Although it is
   not possible to remove this ambiguity in empirical research, scholars
   can at least identify it and analyze it. The authors illustrate the two
   senses of terrorism and their interaction by using the most
   comprehensive dataset on terrorist incidents, the Global Terrorism
   Database (GTD).},

Abstract = {Whereas both the literature on globalization and the literature on
   regulatory diffusion stress the pressures that led to policy
   convergence, this article shows how the ideology of incumbents produced
   different regulatory outcomes, even in the face of strong financial and
   technological pressures that constrained policy agency. By looking at
   the regulatory frameworks adopted at the time of electricity
   privatization in Latin America, this article shows that right-wing
   governments adopted regulations that eliminated barriers to entry and
   investment and limited the discretion of regulators (market-conforming
   regulations), and that former statists who had pragmatically converted
   to the market creed instead chose regulations that tended to impose
   higher barriers to entry and investment and gave regulators wide
   discretion in conflict resolution and price setting (market-controlling
   regulations). These findings suggest the need to look at the ideology
   (and ideological legacies) of government coalitions for a more nuanced
   understanding of the process of regulatory diffusion that took place
   across many sectors in most regions of the world.},

Abstract = {The IMF's role in world financial markets increased following the credit
   and housing market crises. One good change was the acceptance of a
   proposal made by the Meltzer Commission to adopt a ``flexible credit

   emergencies. Some mistaken changes gave the IMF a large increase in
   lending resources, relaxed the requirements for reform imposed on
   borrowers, and increased loans to risky borrowers such as Ukraine.
   Borrowing should be used to prevent the spread of financial crises, not
   to bailout imprudent borrowers that mismanage their economy.},

Volume = {49},

Abstract = {The EU's response to concerns about energy security is to diversify
   sources of supply and delivery routes. To this end it seeks to engage
   potential energy partners across the wider Europe in an
   institutionalized regime based on the norms of the internal market. This
   article uses regime theory to evaluate the viability of the strategy.
   From this perspective, the willingness of the EU's partners to make
   commitments to institutionalized co-operation will depend on two sets of
   variables: their interests in resolving the co-operation problems that
   arise across the energy supply chain; and the `pull' of the EU in
   relation to countervailing hegemonic powers in the region. The research
   tests this argument by examining the co-operation interests of energy
   consumers, transit countries and producers, and the architecture of
   emerging institutions in the respective regional contexts. It finds that
   while energy consumers and transit countries in the EU's immediate
   neighbourhood are prepared to commit to binding multilateral
   institutions, co-operation with energy producers is constrained by
   asymmetries of interest and regional geopolitics, and is likely to take
   the form of more flexible bilateral agreements.},

Abstract = {This study assesses the effects of IMF loans on economic liberalization
   in Latin America. Specifically, we are interested in whether the Fund
   receives greater cooperation from Latin American borrowers in the
   initiation of some economic reforms over others. Using a two-stage
   treatment effects model as well as panel-corrected standard error (PCSE)
   regression for 15 Latin American countries from 1980 to 2003, we find
   that IMF participation tends to lead to greater trade and capital
   reforms and less reform in privatization. These relationships are
   tempered by the country's relationship with the United States along with
   domestic group pressures.},

Abstract = {Building on a new data set which is constructed from a combination of
   national micro-data bases, we highlight differences in the structure of
   migrants to four countries - namely, France, Germany, the UK and the US
   - which receive a substantial share of all immigrants to the OECD world.
   Looking at immigrants by source country, we illustrate the important
   role of distance, both geographical and cultural, immigration policies
   and migrant networks. Differentiating immigrants by their educational
   attainments, we observe interesting patterns in the skill composition,
   employment opportunities and wages of migrants to the different
   destination countries. Focusing on migration between the four countries
   in our data set, we find that migration within western Europe is small
   and rather balanced in terms of skill structures, while there appears to
   be a brain drain from Europe to the US.},

Abstract = {The author asks whether there is anything we can do to lessen the
   disappointments and frustrations that often result from our attempts to
   pursue transitional justice. He argues that the best way to respond to
   this challenge is to accept the existence of three factors that arise in
   every attempt to come to terms with past wrongs: the power of precedent;
   the illusion of resolution; and the possibility of a continuous return.
   Examining a well-known example of transitional justice - the use of East
   German secret police files to review the qualifications of public
   officials for employment in unified Germany - the author confirms that
   our search for justice is likely to be far less satisfying than we hope
   it to be. He also lays the foundation for a more upbeat perspective,
   however, by arguing that our disappointment lies in our approach to the
   topic. While most scholars treat transitional justice as a `goal,' they
   may be better advised to conceptualize it as a `process.'.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to address problems with research on the
   `Europeanization' of foreign policy. The first section shows that
   Europeanization defined as a process of incorporation of European Union
   norms, practices and procedures into the domestic level is more useful
   than any of the other `faces' of the concept discussed in the
   literature. The second section shows that while Europeanization is
   applicable to the study of foreign policy, the adaptational pressure
   model is not; that Europeanization should not be identified exclusively
   with socialization; and that it should be distinguished from
   `uploading'. The final section shows how process tracing the observable
   implications of alternative explanations of foreign policy change for
   three dimensions of the policy-making process - the definition of the
   policy problem, the alternatives considered and the manner in which the
   latter were assessed - makes it possible to establish the causal
   significance of the EU.},

Title = {Governing the gap: Forging safe science through relational regulation},
Journal = {REGULATION \& GOVERNANCE},

Volume = {5},
Number = {1},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Designed to close the ubiquitous gap between law on the books and law in
   action, management systems locate the standard setting and
   implementation of regulation within the regulated organization itself.
   Despite efforts to more closely couple aspirations and performance, the
   gap re-emerges because the exigencies of practical action exceed the
   capacity of system prescriptions to anticipate and contain them. Drawing
   on data from a six-year ethnographic study of the creation and
   implementation of an environment, health, and safety management system,
   this article identifies relational regulation as the approach used by
   front-line managers to govern the gap: keeping organizational activities
   within an acceptable range of variation close to regulatory
   specifications. We identify four practices - narrating the gap,
   inquiring without constraint, integrating pluralistic accounts, and
   crafting pragmatic accommodations - and three conditions under which
   actors may develop a sociological orientation to enact relational
   regulation. Overall, the article concludes that the mechanism for
   assuring compliance resides in the apprehension of relational
   interdependencies rather than the management system per se.},

Abstract = {Despite many transitional justice processes claiming to be
   `victim-centred,' in practice they are rarely driven by the needs of
   those most affected by conflict. Indeed, in many contexts the views of
   victims are not sought by those driving the transition. In this article,
   the needs of a representative sample of 160 families of people
   disappeared during Nepal's decade-long Maoist insurgency are studied in
   an effort to understand what such families seek from the transitional
   justice process. The study shows that victims emphasize the need for the
   truth about the disappeared and for economic support to help meet basic
   needs. Whilst families of the disappeared would welcome justice, this is
   not their priority. Nepal's transitional justice process remains
   still-born and discussions are polarized between a human rights
   community that prioritizes prosecutions and a political class that seeks
   to avoid them. An understanding of victims' expectations of the process
   can potentially break this deadlock and allow policies to be driven by
   the needs of those most affected.},

   circles due, in part, to the impact of the South African Truth and
   Reconciliation Commission, advocacy of forgiveness by educational and
   social psychologists and critiques of retributive justice in critical
   legal studies. Drawing on philosophy, psychology, literature, legal
   theory and records of transitional justice in situ, this article argues
   that while advocates claim significant personal and social benefits
   derive from forgiveness, transitional justice should not consider
   forgiveness an a priori good or as commensurate with either
   reconciliation or peacebuilding. Before advocating forgiveness as a form
   of personal healing or social reconciliation, artisans of transitional
   justice mechanisms should consider that the repression of anger or
   resentment may be psychologically harmful and that perceived pressure to
   forgive may cause significant psychic distress. They should carefully
   consider the ways in which rhetoric or practices of forgiveness may
   facilitate perpetrators' ability to do harm, teach victims to make peace
   with their oppression and reinforce structures of inequality.},

Abstract = {This article explores the changing political uses of the memorialisation
   of the 1956 revolution in Hungary since 1989, in written history and in
   public monuments and displays. 1956 was central to the political
   discourse in 1989; merely 10 years later its anniversary publicly
   carried the significance of a bank holiday but within a few more years,
   and especially by the time of the 50th anniversary in 2006, the
   revolution had become a recurring motif in politics, as the political
   parties tried to stake their claim as the heirs of 1956. The article
   illustrates how the 1956 revolution first decreased and then increased
   in importance over the 20 years following the fall of communism, and how
   this was a direct result of the ability to use the revolution's memory
   for political gain.},

Abstract = {In the United States, the lower federal courts frequently determine the
   meaning of statutes through their decisions. Political science research
   has mostly focused on how lower courts make their interpretations in
   light of Supreme Court precedents. This article examines how the federal
   courts have interpreted the Pregnancy Discrimination Act's (PDA)
   ``related medical conditions{''} clause in the absence of legislative or
   Supreme Court guidance. Three primary claims have been litigated as
   conditions related to pregnancy that therefore require protection in the
   workplace-insurance coverage of prescription contraception, inclusion of
   infertility treatments under insurance, and the provision of time and
   privacy for breastfeeding. Besides the PDA's guarantee of formal
   equality in the workplace, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
   also requires employers to make some accommodations for pregnant women.
   In all three policy areas the case law demonstrates a lack of
   consistency and the existence of conflict in the federal district
   courts, but the appellate courts are slowly beginning to provide some
   consistency within circuits. As the courts have considered the statutory
   protection for women extending beyond pregnancy, their responses have
   been ambivalent at best. It is only in the contraception cases that the
   door remains open for explicit PDA protection. The ADA may potentially
   protect women in terms of infertility coverage and breastfeeding;
   however, Supreme Court rulings requiring disabilities under the ADA to
   be permanent may have shut the door on the ADA's protection of any
   aspect of pregnancy.},

Abstract = {This article examines the institutional and governance effects of
   regional policy reforms in Romania and Turkey during their respective
   periods as EU candidate countries. First, the article aims to
   disentangle the relative impact of EU conditionality in the area of
   regional policy in two candidate countries from different enlargement
   rounds. Second, it aims to investigate the outcomes of regional reforms
   while identifying the factors facilitating these reforms. The findings
   suggest that regional reform outcomes in Romania and Turkey show
   striking similarities, despite differences in the credibility of EU
   conditionality. Therefore, it argues that the constellations of domestic
   political actors and the existing domestic institutional structures
   matter more than EU conditionality in explaining the similarity in
   reform outcomes.},

Title = {Conceptualizing the role of politics in the economy: industries and
   their institutionalizations},
Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {18},
Number = {3},
Pages = {358-383},
Abstract = {Recent literature on the persistence or transformation of economic
   models frequently evokes the role of politics. However, such
   publications rarely set out precisely what politics is and how it plays
   out within specific sites of economic activity, particularly individual
   industries. In order to show that politics is the cause of both change
   within industries and difference between them, this article develops an
   institutionalist framework of analysis which seeks to elucidate the
   `thickness' of the relationship between economic and political
   activities. Politics is first conceptualized in a way that opens up for
   research the emergence and evolution of the institutions which constrain
   and make industrial activity possible: behaviour that both discursively
   and interactively seeks to change or reproduce institutions by
   mobilizing values. Building upon existing institutionalist approaches in
   political economy and economic sociology, but also constructivist
   strands of political science, this definition is then used to set out a
   research design with which to conduct in-depth empirical study of the
   `political work' undertaken within industries that lie behind perpetual
   processes of institutionalization. This work, and the intermediary
   concepts developed to study it - problematization and politicization -
   are illustrated throughout the piece by examples from two industries:
   automobile distribution and wine.},

Abstract = {This article argues that from the very start of the transition process
   in Macedonia, a fusion of concerns about security and democratisation
   locked local nationalist elites and international organisations into a
   political dynamic that prioritised security over democratisation. This
   dynamic resulted in little progress in the implementation of human and
   minority rights until 2009, despite heavy EU involvement in Macedonia
   after the internal warfare of 2001. The effects of this informally
   institutionalised relationship have been overlooked by scholarship on EU
   enlargement towards Eastern Europe, which has made generalisations based
   on assumptions relevant to the democratisation of countries in Eastern
   Europe, but not the Western Balkans.},

Pages = {585-608},
Abstract = {With its dilatory and piecemeal fiscal activism and uncharacteristic
   aversion to IMF assistance, the Turkish government's response to the
   global economic crisis of 2008-9 diverged considerably from prevalent
   trends in other major emerging market countries. Underlying this
   intriguing pattern were Turkey's pre-existing policy and macroeconomic
   constraints, cognitive lapses on the part of policymakers, and the
   conjunctural dynamics of domestic politics. The interplay of these
   factors progressively narrowed the policy space for vigorous action,
   leading to a motley combination of reactive initiatives that neither
   offered sufficient protection to vulnerable social groups nor promised
   sustainable growth in the long run despite rapid short-term recovery.},

   Eaton; Julie Guthman; Nik Heynen, Peter Hossler and Andrew Herod; and
   Mazen Labban - for their generosity, not just in taking time to pass
   comment on Uneven Development (UD) but to do so with such critical
   magnanimity. I will resist the temptation to respond to most of the
   points but let me begin with a couple of engagements addressed directly
   to the comments, before taking a wider view. This article briefly picks
   up on several comments made in this exchange concerning the book Uneven
   Development, then raises several issues that emerge from the original
   arguments and extend the theory in light of empirical shifts over the
   last quarter of a century.},

Title = {Theorising the Korean State beyond Institutionalism: Class Content and
   Form of `National' Development},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {16},
Number = {3},
Pages = {281-302},
Abstract = {Although the Korean developmental state has been heavily discussed in
   various disciplines and across diverse political spectrums, the statist
   notion that the developmental state is autonomous from and disciplines
   society, and is therefore effective in achieving `national development',
   has more often been taken for granted than problematised. Statism is
   also pervasive in institutionalism that emphasises the linkages rather
   than dichotomies between state and market and in the recent discussions
   on the transformation of the developmental state. This article proposes
   an alternative conceptual framework by reformulating `the form critique
   of the state' pioneered by Evgeny Pashukanis and further developed in
   the `German state derivation debate' on the one hand, and `world system
   analysis' on the other. Extending the Marxist critique of `commodity
   fetishism' to the theorisation of the developmental state, it inquires
   into the origins of statism and argues that it is the uneven dynamics of
   capitalism as a global system that give rise to statism in the first
   place.},

Title = {The resurgence of German capital in Europe: EU integration and the
   restructuring of Atlantic networks of interlocking directorates after
   1991},
Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {18},
Number = {3},
Pages = {384-408},
Abstract = {European integration is interpreted in this paper as the route by which
   (West) Germany, profiting from close ties with the English-speaking
   West, was able to restore its full sovereignty and economic pre-eminence
   in Europe. Yet in shaping the actual integration process, it was France
   which played the key role. Most of the landmark steps towards the
   current EU were French proposals to pre-empt Anglophone-German
   collusion; creating European structures in which a resurgence of Germany
   (politically and economically) was made subject to permanent
   negotiation. German unification in 1991 removed the one reason why
   successive governments of the Federal Republic had gone along with this.
   Paradoxically, sovereign Germany today finds itself bound by the dense
   networks of consultation and decision-making which make the EU unique in
   the field of regional integration. The paper shows that between 1992 and
   2005, German capital has moved to the centre of the network of corporate
   interlocks in the North Atlantic area. This helps to explain why in the
   post-1991, post-Soviet era of neoliberal, finance-driven globalisation,
   Germany is increasingly `speaking for Europe', as its corporations have
   become nodal points in the communication structures through which the
   responses to the challenges facing the EU and the West at large are
   being shaped.},

Abstract = {This article draws on research by the authors, especially in Latin
   America and Asia, to give concrete sociological meaning to the processes
   of globalization of governing expertise. The article relates
   professional competition, competing discourses of universals, and
   imperial competition to the reproduction of state elites and the
   construction of fields of state and transnational power. The three parts
   of the discussion in the article involve first, the complexity of the
   North-South dimension in the import and export of governing expertise;
   second, the perennial role of imperial processes involving cosmopolitan
   elites acting as double agents; and third, the role of particular state
   elites as gatekeepers facilitating and moderating the imperial
   processes.},

Abstract = {Patriarchal practices and understandings, especially those based on
   religious teachings, are seen as serious hindrances to women's access to
   political power. This obstacle often is seen as greatest in countries
   where Islam is the dominant religion. This study offers preliminary
   insights regarding how the sex of political candidates affects voting
   perceptions and behavior in Turkey, one of the few democratic countries
   with a Muslim majority population. We designed an experiment in which
   university students read speeches by candidates from the two major
   parties (AKP and CHP), randomly varying the sex of the candidates. We
   find that candidate sex influences respondents' evaluations of areas of
   competence and perceptions of individual characteristics. It has almost
   no impact, however, on voting decisions. When it comes to voting, party
   support and policy stands are vastly more important than candidate sex,
   even for religiously observant voters.},

Abstract = {This article looks at collective memory formation-the study of
   monuments, memory, and public space-through a political science lens. An
   explicit theoretical focus on power relations in ``monumental
   politics{''} and a methodological approach featuring large-N comparative
   analysis are combined to examine the process of monument creation,
   destruction, and alteration. Using a new database on monuments in 26
   post-communist states over a 25-year period, patterns of monument
   transformation are identified, and official and private efforts to
   transform monuments are systematically compared across different regime
   types. The complex implications of private provision and alteration of
   monuments is also discussed.},

Abstract = {Human rights education (HRE) is a useful tool to build solidarity among
   youth and activism for social justice at local, national and
   international levels. In order to understand how HRE can be effective in
   accomplishing this daunting task, educators should consider three
   factors: leadership skills, awareness, and empowerment. Two approaches,
   curriculum-based and experiential learning, have the potential to
   contribute to these goals and to break down negative assumptions of
   youth culture, while developing their interests and their capabilities
   in initiating positive change. This article will compare Amnesty
   International's approach to HRE in the capitals of two countries:
   Washington DC in the United States, and Ouagadougou in Burkina Faso. The
   first case study analyzes Amnesty International USA's (AIUSA's) Human
   Rights Education Service Corps (HRESC), which uses a curriculum- based
   awareness approach to working with high school students. The second case
   study examines a transformational approach to experiential learning in
   Burkina Faso through Amnesty International Burkina Faso (AIBF), which
   was charged with hosting Amnesty's first Youth Forum in Africa. Although
   these two programs have the same basic goal of increasing awareness of
   the rights outlined in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights
   (UDHR), the learning outcomes for the youth and communities involved are
   different. Comparing these two approaches to HRE will help educators and
   activists to understand best practices in HRE for youth, and how peer
   education can strengthen outcomes when incorporated into education
   programs.},

Title = {Beyond Transitional Justice: Exploring Continuities in Human Rights
   Abuses in Argentina between 1976 and 2010},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS PRACTICE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {3},
Number = {1},
Pages = {25-48},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The article constitutes an initial attempt to combine the insights
   provided by the disciplines of Transitional Justice (TJ) and human
   rights, and it originates from a concern with the current situation of
   human rights in Argentina. Although there have been significant
   improvements since democratization in the mid-1980s, conditions
   favouring human rights abuses still persist. In particular, specific
   human rights abuses (torture, disappearances, and murder) that resemble
   practices common during the repression under state terrorism (1976 to
   1983) continue to take place.
   The article has four parts. First, it provides a brief literature review
   on TJ and investigates the relationship between TJ and human rights.
   Second, the article offers a concise theoretical background on the
   notion of impunity, considering its nature and sustaining mechanisms.
   Third, the case of Argentina is examined, looking at the years of
   military rule and the reforms undertaken since transition. Fourth, the
   persistence of continuities between past and present human rights abuses
   in Argentina is unpacked, by offering an empirical consideration of
   impunity and its consequences; the lack of successful police reform; and
   a social context that tolerates human rights violence.
   The combined lenses of TJ and human rights can be useful for
   practitioners to spot continuities in human rights violations and enable
   them to develop policies and strategies that better address the causes
   of human rights abuses.},

Abstract = {Multiple social contexts have been shown to affect racial attitudes both
   positively and negatively when considered at different levels. In this
   article, context is simultaneously considered at three different levels:
   the metropolitan area, the census block group, and the interview
   situation (as measured by race of interviewer/race of respondent
   matching). Significant effects can be classified into three categories:
   the effects of the racial composition of the city, the effects of the
   racial composition of the neighborhood, and the effects of a
   ``different-race{''} interviewer. Neighborhood income and race of
   interviewer effects are direct; by contrast, racial composition effects
   are typically cross-level interaction effects. This indicates that the
   modeling of cross-level interactions is essential for future studies of
   the effects of racial composition on attitudes.},

Abstract = {Despite the crucial role of schools and universities in shaping the
   worldviews of their students, education has been a marginal topic in
   international relations. In a plea for more engagement with the power
   and effects of education, this paper analyzes the interplay of
   discipline and knowledge in the formation of geopolitical subjects. To
   this end, it employs material from ethnographic research at the Moscow
   State Institute of International Relations, the premier university for
   educating future Russian elites in the field of international relations.
   The paper draws on Foucault to chart the ensemble of disciplinary
   practices producing ``docile bodies{''} and objective knowledge and
   traces how these practices are bound up with the geopolitical discourse
   of Russia as a great power: while they fashion the great power discourse
   with objectivity, disruptions in the discourse also disrupt disciplinary
   practices.},

Abstract = {This study of human rights activism in Liberia shows how small-scale,
   peaceful advocacy for democracy and human rights can take place even in
   a resource-poor country where activists face considerable danger from
   repressive regimes. When repressive regimes manage to block mass
   campaigns, individually-led, small-scale, nonviolent resistance can take
   root. The study also looks at ways that policymakers can support such
   activism. Driven by courage, commitment to principled ideas such as
   human rights and democracy, and in some cases by political ambition,
   individual activists helped expose human rights abuses to the outside
   world, delegitimizing the regime and attracting international responses
   that eventually brought change. In Liberia, under the regimes of Samuel
   Doe (1980-90) and Charles Taylor (1997-2003), some journalists, lawyers,
   university students, academics, clergy, and others, with only minimal
   international support, risked personal safety to demand freedom of
   speech, assembly, and protection from arbitrary arrest and torture. The
   findings are based on some 60 in-depth interviews by the author, mostly
   with key activists from those periods, and on archival research.},

Journal = {POLITICS \& GENDER},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Pages = {71-89},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Diversity management and gender mainstreaming can be considered
   technologies of government in the Foucaultian sense; that is, they are
   technologies that guide people to conduct themselves in a particular
   manner; their purpose is the ``conduct of conduct.{''} This article
   illustrates the value of applying a Foucaultian ``analytics of
   government{''} to generate insights on the effects of inserting feminist
   knowledge into institutional contexts through the practices of gender
   mainstreaming and diversity management. I first reinterpret these
   strategies as technologies of government that meet the characteristics
   identified in the literature on governmentality. Second, I explore the
   liberal rationality of the contemporary apparatus of gender by
   juxtaposing it to the disciplinary rationality underlying efforts to
   govern women at the turn of the nineteenth century. Third, I tease out
   similarities and differences in the way in which diversity management
   and gender mainstreaming operate, emphasizing, in particular, the way in
   which they make difference productive and outlining how one deploys a
   neoliberal logic and the other a bureaucratic logic. Ultimately, I argue
   that governance feminism should be interpreted as the
   governmentalization of feminist knowledge; that is, feminist knowledge
   has been adapted so that it becomes available for the government of
   conduct.},

Abstract = {The article investigates a critical case from the Bosnian war: the city
   of Tuzla, whose local government managed both to survive politically in
   the 1992-1995 war and to maintain its non-nationalist politics. In
   wartime, new political structures, legacies of the past, pre-existing
   institutions and networks, resources, and creative policymaking were
   used both for fostering and for defusing conflict. The article
   demonstrates that political moderation was difficult to accomplish and
   sustain, but it proved to be possible. The interplay of elite and
   grassroots agency reconstituted the political opportunity structure and
   policymaking was geared towards moderate politics that served to defeat
   powerful radical nationalist opponents.},

Abstract = {In 2011, the OECD turned fifty. To provide a broad foundation for
   further thinking on this organization, we analyse its evolution over
   half a century from two perspectives: phases in the international
   political economy and the literature on IPE. By so doing, we uncover two
   paradoxes. Firstly, we find that the organization's evolution closely
   mirrored major phases in the postwar international political economy
   until recently. However, the OECD's long-term dependence on the West has
   now become an obstacle to its efforts to adapt to the latest phase,
   characterised by the rise of non-Western powers. Secondly, we show that,
   during the OECD's ``golden age{''}, scholars paid relatively little
   attention to the organization but, from the 2000s, as the organization
   faced an unprecedented challenge of its potential economic decline, IPE
   literature on the organization blossomed.},

Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {18},
Number = {3},
Pages = {299-327},
Abstract = {East Asian countries apply lower tariffs on their neighbors' products
   than they are required to under the various trade agreements to which
   they belong, a concession they grant only rarely to countries outside
   the region. The result is a de facto preferential trade area in East
   Asia in which applied tariff rates significantly undercut the legally
   bound rates. This gap, termed binding overhang, is an under-studied
   aspect of international political economy, but provides information
   about the nature of East Asian regionalism. To wit, the regional bias in
   applied tariffs is driven by transnational production networks that must
   move components across borders, not geopolitics or state preferences for
   increased regional integration. This finding supports a `bottom up'
   interpretation of East Asian regionalism.},

Pages = {1323-1355},
Abstract = {The article compares the development of two institutional systems
   organising intergovernmental relations in the former Soviet Union:
   Russian federalism and post-Soviet regional integration. Despite the
   common origins of these two sets of institutions, and the common
   developmental trends they experienced over the first decade of their
   existence, the two systems diverged significantly in the 2000s. The
   article discusses the driving forces behind these differences. It also
   addresses various forms of direct links between centralisation in Russia
   and regional integration in the post-Soviet space; these include
   cross-border cooperation, policy spillovers and perceptions of
   decentralisation by national elites.},

Journal = {EUROPE-ASIA STUDIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {63},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1449-1468},
Abstract = {The article examines the control system that Stalin established to
   enforce his orders. Historical records demonstrate that Stalin designed
   the system's scope, organisation and credentials to maximise its
   cost-effectiveness. On several occasions Stalin deliberately limited the
   system's size and stimulated whistle-blowing in an attempt to mitigate
   running costs. In contrast, distorted preferences and constraints on
   inspectors' loyalty contributed to the multiplication of the number of
   monitoring agencies. Because his orders were incomplete, Stalin
   authorised his inspectors not only to monitor, but also to intervene in
   operational matters wherever necessary.},

Abstract = {Amartya Sen's enlarged conception of freedom has augmented the scope of
   economic analysis but it also has had the surprising effect of being
   more supportive of the free market than conventional welfare economics.
   It is argued here that a comparison of Sen's position with that of the
   American institutionalist, J R Commons, highlights some problems with
   Sen's approach and points to possible ways in which they might be
   addressed.},

   Revisited},
Journal = {INTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {26},
Number = {6},
Pages = {759-777},
Abstract = {The study of the Cold War has undergone a significant transformation in
   recent years, with new critical perspectives, sources and debates. The
   nuclear history of the Cold War has begun to yield new insights on
   fundamental questions about the stability and dynamics of the
   confrontation. Recent evidence about the events of 1983 provides an
   opportunity to explore the risk of nuclear war and the role of
   misperception in Soviet-American relations during the `Second Cold War'.
   Central to this is the study of intelligence. This article examines
   episodes in the autumn of 1983, notably the Able Archer `crisis' of
   November 1983. Attention focuses on aspects of Soviet, American and
   British intelligence. Political and diplomatic consequences are also
   considered. A principal aim is to emphasize that we are at an early
   stage in researching and understanding events, and that a number of
   assumptions about the crisis require further exploration. Broader
   lessons about the role of intelligence in the Cold War are nevertheless
   explored and provisional conclusions reached about the performances of
   intelligence agencies and communities.},

Volume = {13},

Pages = {63-82},
Abstract = {Do women possess the requisite personal qualities and characteristics of
   political leadership needed by a president, characteristics that male
   politicians are often assumed to have? In Chile's historic 2005/6
   presidential campaign, the responses of Michelle Bachelet and her male
   opponents to this question became an explicit area of debate. Drawing on
   participant observation, interviews and analysis of campaign materials,
   I argue that the three candidates, Bachelet, Joaquin Lavin and Sebastian
   Pinera, drew upon specific, if different, gendered definitions of
   political leadership to both present themselves as the person best
   qualified to lead Chile and to question their opponents' capabilities.
   Lavin and Pinera strategically deployed beliefs about accepted
   connections between men, masculinity and politics to promote their
   leadership capabilities and to attack Bachelet's abilities to be
   president. Bachelet explicitly framed her leadership style as more
   feminine and linked her style of leadership to her abilities to promote
   greater inclusion and participation in Chilean democracy. Bachelet
   countered her opponents' attacks on her leadership abilities by claiming
   that these attacks revealed the continuing resistance to women's
   inclusion as political leaders.},

Title = {The parable of the poisoned pork: Network governance and the 2008 Irish
   pork dioxin contamination},
Journal = {REGULATION \& GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {5},
Number = {3},
Pages = {333-349},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The 2008 contamination of Irish pork with dioxins was one of the most
   significant recent food safety incidents in the European Union (EU).
   While the contamination posed no real risk to public health, it tested
   the efficacy of EU food safety regulation and governance which has been
   considerably overhauled in the past decade. The exchange of risk
   information through networks of regulators is an important element of
   the EU food safety risk management framework. Networks are a much-lauded
   form of new governance, though they are not without their problems. In
   this paper, we address the question of why governance networks can fail.
   We examine this issues using the case study of the 2008 Irish dioxin
   contamination and explore the reason for the failure to make more
   substantial use of networks in the governance of that incident. We
   hypothesize that the reason for such failure may be found in three
   inherent tensions which exist in the design and management of networks,
   namely flexibility/stability, inclusiveness/efficiency, and
   internal/external legitimacy. The paper concludes that by ensuring the
   external legitimacy of the EU's Rapid Alert System for Feed and Food
   (RASFF) through increased transparency of communications, the design of
   RASFF has stifled its internal legitimacy with regard to certain types
   of important information exchanges.},

Abstract = {We study whether ADR (American depositary receipt) investors perceive
   the risk that countries such as Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal or
   Spain could leave the eurozone to address financial problems produced by
   the sub-prime crisis. Using daily data, we analyse the impact of
   vulnerability measures related to currency crisis theories on ADR
   returns. We find that ADR returns fall when yield spreads of sovereign
   bonds or CDSs (credit default swaps) rise (i.e. when debt crisis risk
   increases); when banks' CDS premiums rise or stock returns fall (i.e.
   when banking crisis risk increases); or when the euro's overvaluation
   increases (i.e. when the risk of competitive devaluation increases).},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS PRACTICE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {3},
Number = {2},
Pages = {139-161},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This article offers a psychosocial discursive analysis of audiences'
   responses to information about human rights abuses. The analysis of
   focus group members' justifications for their inaction is informed by a
   view of language as social action and Cohen's concept of denial, with
   its focus on the culturally available accounts of justifications and
   excuses that form the vocabulary of moral passivity within our society.
   Positioning theory is applied to study participants' moral positioning
   and the storylines used to account for their passivity, with a specific
   focus on the use of negative positioning of Amnesty International and
   charities in general.
   Four storylines - `trust and truthfulness', `misuse of resources',
   `effectiveness of proposed action', and `money and manipulation' - are
   discussed in terms of how participants use them to weaken the standing
   of the appeal makers and to ascribe a moral position to themselves,
   whilst remaining passive to the appeal.
   The article discusses the implications of such positioning for the local
   moral order, its wider cultural significance, and its implications for
   campaigning. It claims that the relationship between appeal makers and
   potential moral actors is an important factor in fostering or hindering
   social responsibility and collective action. As such, it argues for
   increased attention to be paid to it by researchers.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the institutional constraints for European Union
   finances reform and proposes a decision-making process that incorporates
   these constraints and provides incentives to reorient the budget towards
   more EU public goods. The authors propose separating the budget into a
   redistributive and a public good category. In order to reveal common
   interests, the decision of what is to be considered an EU public good is
   left to the negotiation process. In addition, while public goods should
   be financed proportionally to GNI shares, this is not necessarily the
   case for redistributive policies. Net balances resulting from the
   proposal are calculated.},

Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},

Volume = {18},

Pages = {17-51},
Abstract = {Do requirements for legitimate global governance vary across
   intergovernmental and non-state governance institutions? The author
   introduces a framework to address this question that draws attention to
   the social forces and power dynamics at play in determining what
   standards of legitimacy apply. Rather than beginning with a focus on
   democratic legitimacy, which pre-judges what legitimacy requires, the
   framework posits that what constitutes legitimacy results from an
   interaction of communities who must accept the authority of the
   institution with broader legitimating norms and discourses - or social
   structure - that prevail in the relevant issue area. To illustrate its
   plausibility, the framework is applied to a comparison of
   intergovernmental and non-state institutions in the social and
   environmental issue area: the intergovernmental Kyoto Protocol on
   climate change and members of the non-state International Social and
   Environmental Accreditation and Labeling Alliance, an umbrella
   organization created to develop agreement on `best practices' for its
   members. Implications of the findings for legitimacy of global economic
   governance are also explored.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL FEMINIST JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {13},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {557-575},
Abstract = {Social movement scholars credit feminist transnational advocacy networks
   with putting violence against women on the United Nations (UN) security
   agenda, as evidenced by Resolution 1325 and numerous other UN Security
   Council statements on gender, peace and security. Such accounts neglect
   the significance of superpower politics for shaping the aims of women's
   bureaucracies and non-governmental organizations in the UN system. This
   article highlights how the fall of the Soviet Union transformed the
   delineation of `women's issues' at the UN and calls attention to the
   extent that the new focus upon `violence against women' has been shaped
   by post-Cold War US global policing practices. Resolution 1325's call
   for gender mainstreaming of peacekeeping operations reflects the tension
   between feminist advocates' increased influence in security discourse
   and continuing reports of peacekeeper perpetrated sexual violence, abuse
   and exploitation.},

Abstract = {This project examines the extent to which terrorist threat shapes affect
   assessments of female political leadership and whether these assessments
   are affected by the characteristics of the evaluated leader. Using
   experimental and survey data, we find that conditions of terrorist
   threat increase the expression of certain gender-trait stereotypes and
   negatively affect evaluations of female Democratic leaders. Our analysis
   further suggests that Republican women and/or those with strong national
   security experience may be able to overcome the otherwise negative
   implications of security threats and gender-trait stereotypes.},

Abstract = {This article explores the use and application of experimental
   methodologies in intelligence analysis. Previous experimental work has
   much to tell us about how people process information in making
   judgments. Calibration, and how appropriate levels of confidence might
   be improved with systematic feedback, is addressed. Training around
   uncertainty biases is covered. Extant experimental work suggests
   mechanisms and tests which might be used to better screen potential
   analysts for personality characteristics that might make them more
   suited for some tasks over others. The paradigm of experimental
   manipulation serves as a useful template for exploring alternative
   conceptualizations of uncertain environments.},

Journal = {INTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {26},
Number = {5},
Pages = {676-700},
Abstract = {This article explores the official cover up of the mysterious
   disappearance of naval frogman Lionel Buster Crabb in 1956. Existing
   histories of the affair have tended to focus on the manner of Crabb's
   death, advancing a series of plausible and suitably implausible
   explanations. Using recently declassified sources, this article, in
   contrast, seeks to use the Crabb affair as a window onto government
   secrecy and relations between the press and the intelligence services.
   It is argued that the affair was a climacteric for the intelligence
   community and its relationship with Fleet Street, rupturing
   long-standing taboos about secret service work and bringing to the fore
   a brand of investigative journalist determined to make front-page news
   of intelligence shortcomings and failure.},

Abstract = {This article looks at specific instances of how the United Kingdom's
   strategic culture dealt with two specific perceived security challenges
   - Afghanistan as the home of terrorism and Iraq as the supposed
   possessor of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) - and how the UK's
   cultural background both determined and misled those involved in the
   intelligence cycle. These were not new problems - the UK intelligence
   community had been aware of the potential for cultural bias for decades
   but repeatedly failed to learn the appropriate lessons. In the case of
   Iraq these endemic problems led to failures at all four stages of the
   traditional intelligence cycle requirement-setting, collection,
   assessment and dissemination. The overall result was a loss of public
   confidence in intelligence which may have lessened its overall influence
   in the wider strategic culture for many years. However, the main blame
   attaches to the politicians who misused and abused intelligence to
   justify their purely political decisions to undertake aggression against
   a sovereign state.},

Abstract = {This article examines the intensification, since the creation of the
   so-called Shanghai list of world universities in June 2003, of a
   political struggle in which a variety of actors, universities, national
   governments, and, more recently, supranational institutions have sought
   to define global higher education. This competition over global higher
   education has highlighted issues such as the internationalization and
   denationalization of higher education, the international mobility of
   students, the role of English language as the language of science, and
   the privatization of higher education. In contrast to IPE or Marxist
   analyses, we analyze the symbolic logic of ranking lists in higher
   education, their uses, and the European Commission's initiative to
   create an alternative world university classification (see World Social
   Science Report, UNESCO Publishing; Europa zwischen Fiktion und
   Realpolitik/L'Europe-Fictions et realites politiques, Transcript for
   analysis). This initiative represents a political move in a process of
   rapid restructuration of higher education at the global level.},

Title = {Emerging World Order? From Multipolarity to Multilateralism in the G20,
   the World Bank, and the IMF},
Journal = {POLITICS \& SOCIETY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {39},
Number = {3},
Pages = {347-377},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Many developing and transitional countries have grown faster than
   advanced countries in the past decade, resulting in a shift in the
   distribution of world income in their favor. China is now the second
   largest economy in the world, behind the United States and ahead of
   Japan. As the relative economic weight of China and several others has
   come to match or exceed that of the middle-ranking G7 economies, the
   world economy has shifted from ``unipolar{''} toward ``multipolar,{''}
   less dominated by the G7. How is this change being translated into
   changes in authority and influence within multilateral organizations
   like the G20, the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF)?
   Alarm bells are ringing in G7 capitals about G7 loss of influence.
   According to a WikiLeaks cable from the senior U.S. official for the G20
   process, from January 2010, `` It is remarkable how closely coordinated
   the BASIC group of countries {[}Brazil, South Africa, India, China] have
   become in international fora, taking turns to impede US/EU initiatives
   and playing the US and EU off against each other.{''}
   This essay suggests that the shift in power is much smaller than the
   headlines or private alarm bells suggest. The United States remains the
   dominant state, and the G7 states together continue to exercise primacy,
   but now more fearfully and defensively. China is split between asserting
   itself as ``the wave of the future{''} and defending itself as too poor
   to take on global responsibilities (it is roughly 100th in the per
   capita income hierarchy). The combination of G7 defensiveness and
   emerging states' jealous guarding of sovereignty produces a spirit of
   Westphalian assertion in international fora, or ``every state for
   itself.{''} On the assumption that the world economy is in a
   transitional period, the article suggests reforms in the G20 and the
   World Bank that would boost their role and legitimacy as multilateral
   organizations in a more multipolar world.},

Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {16},
Number = {2},
Pages = {247-251},
Abstract = {Neil Smith's Uneven Development has had profound impacts on the way
   geographers have come to understand questions related to space and
   nature. In this short piece I explain what UD brings to a longstanding
   literature and set of debates that is commonly named `the Agrarian
   Question' and revolves around agriculture's unique relationship to
   capitalist relations of production. Smith's distinctive approach that
   sees nature and space as produced by capitalist relations of production
   helps resolve some of the longstanding debates within the study of
   agriculture. While this piece applies the production of nature thesis to
   one particular social scientific field, I hope it points to the currency
   and significance of this understanding for many other academic fields
   and for political economy more generally.},

Title = {Emotional Engagements with the Field: A View from Area Studies},
Journal = {EUROPE-ASIA STUDIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {63},
Number = {7},
Pages = {1275-1293},
Abstract = {This article underlines the potential for multi-disciplinary area
   studies to provide a stimulating context within which to advance our
   understanding of the role that emotions play within the research
   process. The article seeks to argue for the relevance of emotional work
   with respect to research activity and, drawing from the experiences of
   the two authors, highlights some of the ways in which sensitivity to
   such matters can assist in making sense of our research experiences and
   findings. The article does not make any claim to introduce new ideas
   regarding the challenges involved in confronting the `emotional' and
   `subjective' in social science research; rather it is a response to a
   perceived lack of debate concerning such issues within the
   multi-disciplinary field of area studies, and particularly its published
   output, in spite of the vigorous discussions going on within many areas
   of the social sciences.},

Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},

Volume = {18},

Pages = {592-621},
Abstract = {Civil servants in international secretariats are exposed to numerous,
   crosscutting and, at times, conflicting pressures and expectations. The
   secretariat of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development
   (OECD) is no different. This study reveals a fundamental `misfit'
   between external demands and internal dynamics in the OECD Secretariat.
   On one hand, the OECD analysts are employed on the basis of merit.
   Compared to the employees in the central administrations in many OECD
   member states, the OECD personnel are very competitive in terms of
   experience and academic skills. Thus, the OECD Secretariat can be seen
   as a veritable powerhouse of idea generation, data collection and
   analysis. On the other hand, the OECD member states seem to be reluctant
   to let the OECD do what it does best: produce bright, challenging and
   provocative ideas. In many regards, the OECD personnel are, in practice,
   being reduced to undertaking basic secretariat functions such as
   organizing meetings, writing summaries and arbitrating between
   conflicting national interests. Despite having a vast role repertoire of
   roles at their disposal, this article reveals the paradox when OECD
   officials play out only two roles: the epistemic role, in which creative
   thinking and innovation are rewarded, and the bureaucratic role, in
   which rule following and regularity are rewarded. This paradox is
   characterized as a role dilemma that is compatible with the idea of the
   OECD as an international compound bureaucracy. The article concludes by
   suggesting three scenarios of how the observed dissonance between the
   internal and external dimensions of the OECD identity can be
   accommodated.},

Abstract = {The goal of this article is to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the
   impacts of finance and corporate governance reforms on organised labour
   since 1980. The argument is made that contemporary institutional and
   `Varieties of Capitalism' as well as `Varieties of Unionism'
   perspectives on labour market reform have overstated the power of
   states, institutions and organised interests in deflecting global
   economic pressures. Drawing on a range of recent Organisation for
   Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) statistics and qualitative
   studies, it is claimed that current developments in finance and
   corporate governance mark a fundamental break with post-war
   developments. Capital has reasserted its power over organised labour and
   labour markets not only in the US and UK, but throughout Western Europe
   as well. In assessing how far this reversal has gone, the article
   focuses on three key political economic changes: i) the rise in finance
   and adoption of corporate `shareholder' systems; ii) the expansion of
   mergers and acquisitions and their negative effects on unionisation and
   manufacturing jobs; and iii) the effects of financial pressures and
   corporate reform on collective bargaining and wages. This is the first
   study to report on comparative changes and qualitative reforms to both
   finance and labour in 13 OECD countries between 1980 and 2005.},

Title = {Race you to the Bottom ... and Back Again? The Uneven Development of
   Labour Codes of Conduct},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {16},
Number = {4},
Pages = {445-462},
Abstract = {This article emphasises how labour codes of conduct mediate a series of
   complex and evolving power relations that span the politics of
   consumption through to the politics of production. It argues that codes
   of conduct not only reflect an uneven division of labour - in which
   firms are stratified in size, productivity and labour conditions - but
   actively shape it. Using examples drawn from light-manufacturing
   industries in China, it illustrates how labour codes of conduct feed
   into these processes of uneven development. In their reaction to the
   implementation of codes of conduct across global supply chains, some
   Chinese suppliers at the higher tiers of industrial structure have
   sought to substitute capital for labour as a way to increase
   productivity beyond abusive labour conditions. Simultaneously, many
   smaller firms at lower tiers that are reliant on cut-throat forms of
   discounting have evolved elaborate schema of falsifying code of conduct
   processes and reports. Finally, mid-tier firms tend to display a
   strategically partial degree of compliance. Code provisions that empower
   workers to self-organise are commonly undermined because such trends
   threaten the very political basis upon which the restructuring the
   global division of labour over the past four decades has been
   predicated.},

Title = {Colonising Space: The New Economic Geography in Theory and Practice},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {16},
Number = {3},
Pages = {373-397},
Abstract = {The New Economic Geography (NEG) incorporates social space into
   neoclassical models, and claims to provide an explanation of uneven
   development within the parameters of economic orthodoxy. It is among the
   most influential recent innovations in mainstream economics - Paul
   Krugman was awarded the 2008 Nobel Prize in Economics for his
   contributions to the NEG, and it provided the theoretical inspiration
   for the World Bank's 2009 World Development Report. Drawing on the work
   of David Harvey and Henri Lefebvre, this article interprets the NEG as a
   colonising project in both its theoretical claims and its practical
   applications. Theoretically, the NEG colonises the disciplinary terrain
   of economic geography while replacing its substantive content with the
   abstractions of neoclassical economics. Inpractical terms, the NEG has
   been instrumental in the World Bank's `new spatial approach to
   development', which aims to fully colonise peripheral regions of the
   global economy through constructing the spatial infrastructures
   necessary for globalised production and exchange. The social
   contradictions implicit in this project are revealed in the case of the
   Plan Puebla Panama', a regional development programme for southern
   Mexico and Central America, based on the NEG, and identified by the
   World Bank as a prototype for its spatial approach to development. The
   article thus provides a critique of the NEG as a theoretical approach
   and as a policy tool, demonstrating the increasing significance of the
   production of space within the neoliberal project, and cautioning
   against the transformation of socio-spatial reality in the image of
   technocratic abstractions.},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Phased retirement programs that allow older workers to reduce their
   hours and responsibilities and pursue more flexible work schedules could
   satisfy both the employee's desire for flexibility and the employer's
   need to maintain an experienced workforce. However, few employers have
   established formal programs, because they often complicate the provision
   of other benefits and might violate antidiscrimination rules. For
   example, federal laws limit retirement plan distributions to employees
   who are still working for the plan sponsor, which discourages phased
   retirement because few older workers can afford to reduce their work
   hours unless they can receive at least some retirement benefits. Many
   employers do not provide fringe benefits to part-time employees, and
   making exceptions for older workers could violate antidiscrimination
   rules. Federal laws requiring that benefits provided through
   tax-qualified plans be evenly distributed between highly compensated and
   lower-paid employees also complicate formal phased retirement programs.
   Reforming these policies could promote phased retirement.},

Abstract = {``Workeragency{''}-the idea that workers have free will and will
   exercise it to meet their needs-is a fundamental part of organizational
   psychology and the sociology of work. Drawing on qualitative research
   conducted in a midwestern factory, the authors examine how workers
   create opportunities for short-term flexibility within a workplace
   characterized by shift work, strict production quotas, and team
   organization. Coping mechanisms involve sympathetic supervisors and
   supportive coworkers. Workers also describe taking independent action
   when the structure does not permit them to meet obligations to their
   families. These exercises in worker agency can be understood in terms of
   their legitimacy in the workplace and their potential for disruption of
   work. Worker agency also can be a positive factor in the workplace.
   Workers describe a supportive work environment as a critical factor that
   promotes loyalty and a willingness to go beyond workplace requirements
   for the good of the organization.},

Abstract = {Is Russian foreign policy the foreign policy of a struggling democratic,
   hybrid, semi-authoritarian, rentier, or corporatist-kleptocratic state?
   Russia possesses all the trappings of a state with a long-established
   set of institutions representing state interests abroad, but it also has
   a set of elites whose purpose is both to represent and promote state
   interests abroad and to enrich themselves, very often at the state's
   expense. While Russian foreign policy continues to promote Russian
   national interests abroad, this article examines the - impact of these
   new kinds of elite rules on Russia and states where corrupt Russian
   elites find willing partners. Research in the Wikileaks documents is
   used to study this topic.},

Abstract = {Since 1944, United States financing of the International Monetary Fund
   (IMF) has been appropriated and approved in Congress by roll-call vote.
   If voting to increase funds to the IMF is viewed as an observable signal
   of ``support{''} for the IMF, these votes provide a historical record of
   legislative support for the IMF in the United States. I analyze
   roll-call voting on IMF financing from 1944 to 2009 at both the
   aggregate (congressional) and the micro (legislator) levels. At the
   aggregate level, I show that support for the IMF has fallen over time in
   the House of Representatives but not in the Senate. In the
   micro-analysis, I use a ``natural experiment{''} to establish that this
   intercameral difference is the result of the Senate's larger and more
   heterogeneous constituencies, as opposed to other modeled and unmodeled
   factors. I also find that legislator support for the IMF is shaped
   strongly by ideology: regardless of chamber, left-wing legislators are
   as much as 31 percentage points more likely to support the IMF than
   right-wing legislators. Yet controlling for ideology, senators are more
   likely to support the IMF than representatives, and representatives are
   more sensitive to constituency pressures than senators. I attribute
   these differences to chamber-specific rules governing the size of
   constituencies.},

   assesses the recent development of EU CSR (corporate social
   responsibility) policy, focusing particularly on its evolution during
   the past decade. In so doing, the article scrutinizes the interactive
   processes associated with the policy construction at the EU level and
   explores the main sets of ideas that competed for acceptance. The
   analysis exposes the degree to which the `voluntary' approach prevails
   over the `regulated' mode of policy implementation. The data captured
   trigger a re-examination of some persistent, broader questions about the
   merits and deficiencies in EU policy-making.},

Abstract = {Recent years have seen a surge of interest in applying the sociology of
   Pierre Bourdieu in international studies as part of a more general
   sociological turn observable in both international and European studies.
   However, different from earlier attempts at deploying Bourdieusian
   sociology in the context of international law, economics, and politics,
   most of this new Bourdieu-inspired constructivist political science
   research only marginally addresses what in many ways was the cardinal
   point of Bourdieu's work: his attempt at devising a reflexive sociology.
   This article's basic claim is that the most significant contribution
   Bourdieusian sociology can make to international (and European) studies
   is not achieved by adaptation or transplantation of key concepts (field,
   habitus, and so on) to a set of research objects that remain by and
   large predefined by other disciplines. Instead, I contend that it is by
   deploying the underlying sociological practice of Bourdieusian sociology
   to international objects in terms of conducting a reflexive sociology of
   the international. To substantiate my claim, I make three more specific
   arguments. In the first section, I argue for the need for
   ``objectivizing'' the research object in terms of ``double reflexivity''
   with respect to both object and researcher. In the second part, I
   suggest that key Bourdieusian notions are precisely tools for this
   scientific operation by providing a relational and integrative approach.
   In the third part, I compare this approach with a cross section of
   research on international human rights and thereby suggest how it
   provides a different reading of the international.},

Abstract = {The historical shift from patrimonialism to bureaucracy is the key
   organizational transformation of the past thousand years. Classically,
   patrimonialism was organization based on private households, plus
   alliances among them. But there are two types of patrimonial
   organization: expanded households and patrimonial alliances or
   pseudo-tribes. The latter include ad hoc warrior coalitions, frequently
   organized as fictive kin. The main historical cause of the shift from
   patrimonialism to bureaucracy was the military-fiscal revolution and
   ensuing state penetration into society. But patrimonial politics did not
   entirely disappear. In some areas, the state fails to penetrate, leaving
   the possibility of mafia-style organization. Elsewhere, political
   machines are a mixed form of incomplete bureaucracy. Gangs are
   patrimonial organizations, growing in dialectical conflict with
   bureaucratic penetration and efforts at control. Through a comparison of
   American, Sicilian, and Russian mafias, the questions considered are
   whether crime organization recapitulates the history of the state, why
   some gangs become bigger than others, and why organized crime succeeds
   or fails in varying degrees.},

Abstract = {This article places feminist state theorists in dialogue with the
   Weberian ``bellicist{''} tradition, and argues that locating
   patriarchalism within modern European states remains a worthwhile
   endeavor. By tracing conscription exemptions for fathers and husbands in
   France from the French Revolution's levee en masse through to Napoleonic
   conscription and into the first half of the twentieth century, this
   article shows that consideration for male citizens' patriarchal
   positions was a consistent feature of French conscription. This is
   significant given that conscription was an especially powerful and
   invasive institution of modern states and central to states' survival
   within interstate competition. Yet even this intrusive institution did
   not undermine local patriarchalism in the country many consider to be
   the cradle of modern mandatory conscription. An extractive state
   institution was built on crystallization of male familial authority at
   the level of on-the-ground citizens.},

Abstract = {The completion of the internal market was the EU structural response to
   the so-called `Euro-sclerosis' of the early 1980s. By eliminating the
   existing non-tariff barriers to the free circulation of goods, services,
   workers and capital by the end of 1992, the EU aimed to deliver
   substantial welfare gains in terms of higher productivity and lower
   costs, prices and mark-ups. While there exists some evidence that the
   measures undertaken have increased competition across the EU, the impact
   of such policies on productivity has received less attention and still
   remains an open issue. Using a difference-in-difference approach, this
   article shows that the completion of the internal market significantly
   increased the productivity of the EU sectors which were more likely to
   be affected by these policies, already during the implementation phase
   of the different measures (1992 and 1993). These results point to the
   fact that the firms that were mostly exposed to the reforms seem to have
   reacted promptly to the structural changes deriving from them. The
   estimated gains appear quantitatively important.},

Journal = {ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {634},

Abstract = {This study uses data from the 1996 through 2002 General Social Survey to
   examine whether one variant of modern racial prejudice-{''}color
   coding{''}-explains support for several ostensibly nonracial government
   spending policies regarding crime, urban problems, and drug addiction
   (welfare and race spending are used as baseline measures). Findings
   indicate that color coding does not extend appreciably beyond its
   established focus of welfare and race and operates along a continuum
   with welfare and race at one end (heavily influenced by prejudice),
   addiction spending and urban spending at the other end (not influenced
   by prejudice), and crime spending situated in the middle (moderately
   influenced by prejudice). Possible causes of the continuum, as well as
   emerging aspects of the color coding phenomenon- specifically, its
   possible bidirectional effects and its subordination to political party
   affiliation in explanatory value-are discussed. Directions for future
   research that would shed additional light on the color coding phenomenon
   are also discussed.},

Abstract = {While the three-decade war in Sri Lanka ended in mid-2009, many believe
   that the country has done very little to deal with its violent past,
   with the exception of the ongoing Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation
   Commission, which is regarded by some as an inadequate response. Against
   this background, the article looks at the transitional justice landscape
   in postwar Sri Lanka, surveying transitional justice approaches and
   their past and potential application. It also examines the history,
   dynamics and characteristics of Sri Lanka's conflict(s) and how they
   inform the course of transitional justice in the country.},

Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},

Volume = {16},
Number = {4},
Pages = {501-521},
Abstract = {This article investigates the ways in which a Canadian coalition of
   farmers, consumers, and environmental, health, and industry
   organisations politicised the value of Monsanto's proposed Roundup Ready
   (RR) wheat in the early 2000s. Eventually pressured to withdraw its
   application for unconfined release of RR wheat in 2004, I argue that
   Monsanto's proposed RR wheat economy crossed moral boundaries for the
   groups involved in the coalition against RR wheat. Specifically,
   Monsanto's anticipated RR wheat economy violated producers' expectations
   about their cultural-economic livelihoods: it proposed uncertainty in
   the realms of exchange and use value, moved public surplus into private
   hands and infringed on cultural attachments to wheat. My theoretical
   contribution hinges on the concept of moral economy, which is
   conventionally understood as promoting a `cultural turn' in economic
   explanations. Instead, I show how Marx's labour theory of value
   similarly pointed to the inextricability of economic values and cultural
   processes and their attachment to all commodities including labour.},

Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},

Pages = {436-459},
Abstract = {Taking the European audit profession as a case study, our paper explores
   the role of private actors in transatlantic regulatory relations and
   transnational regulatory harmonization more generally. In the early
   twenty-first century, both the US and the EU tightened the regulation of
   auditors. Due to its extraterritorial effects, the US reform legislation
   sparked a transatlantic conflict. Seeking mutual recognition of the
   respective auditor oversight systems, the European Commission endeavored
   to bring the European regulatory regime closer to the new US model.
   During the reforms of EU audit regulation, the profession, together with
   member states, successfully resisted a far-reaching convergence of
   European regulation to the US model of independent oversight, thus
   impeding the resolution of the transatlantic conflict. We argue that the
   profession's defense of the traditional model of European audit
   regulation results from two intertwined aspects: the profession's
   interest in keeping a share of power in the regulatory regime and its
   institutional embeddedness in distinct national and regional regulatory
   and market structures. In concluding, we discuss the implications of our
   findings for the relevant international and comparative political
   economy literature.},

   government borrowing capacity},
Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {18},
Number = {2},
Pages = {141-167},
Abstract = {This article considers the varied borrowing capacity of emerging market
   governments, a key component of the impact on governments of financial
   globalization. It focuses on the link between the financialization -
   defined here as the ability to trade risk - and borrowing capacity,
   analyzing three case study countries: Brazil, Lebanon and Turkey. Both
   domestic and international bond markets are considered and differences
   in the ownership of government bonds in the three countries are
   highlighted. The financialization of different financial market actors
   is analyzed, concentrating on two of the most important, domestic
   commercial banks and individual investors, and the financialization of
   the structure of each market. It is argued that the greater the
   financialization, the greater the ability to exit or short. This
   increases the cost of borrowing and increases the likelihood, and
   severity, of crisis, thereby reducing government borrowing capacity.
   Comparative event studies from the three countries demonstrate the
   influence of financialization in crisis, or potential crisis,
   situations.},

Abstract = {The article argues that the harmonisation of national memories
   facilitates genuine reconciliation, while memory divergence resulting
   from national mythmaking hampers reconciliation. After World War II,
   Sino-Japanese and West German-Polish relations were antagonised by the
   Cold War structure, and pernicious myths prevailed in national
   collective memory. Then China and Japan brushed aside historical legacy
   for immediate diplomatic normalisation, but their reconciliation was
   impeded by elite mythmaking practices. Since the 1970s West Germany and
   Poland have de-mythified war history and engaged in historical
   settlement, paving the way for deep reconciliation after the Cold War.},

Abstract = {The creation and continued existence of CSDP cannot be understood
   without reference to the institutional environment within which it is
   located. To explain its emergence and design, one needs to study the
   institutional architecture into which this additional institution
   emerged. Once institutional overlap exists, it becomes a crucial
   independent variable explaining not only the strategies that member
   states have at their disposal, but also the development of international
   institutions occupying the same policy domain as well as the impact on
   the policy field at large.},

Title = {Back to the future? The domestic sources of transatlantic regulation},
Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {18},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {III-XXII},
Abstract = {As each others' most important investment and trading partner, the
   European and U. S. American economies are closely interlinked. The
   growing intensity of economic interdependence has spurred the
   transatlantic coordination of rules and standards that could form
   non-tariff barriers to transatlantic commerce. But despite impressive
   government-to-government efforts to eliminate market barriers, the EU
   and the U. S. have frequently clashed over each other's regulatory
   policies. The aim of this special issue is to explore the domestic
   sources of cooperation or conflict in transatlantic regulation. The
   papers analyze the role of domestic factors through three theoretical
   lenses that are well-established in the study of multilevel systems: the
   principal-agent approach, the two-level game metaphor, and through a
   wider concept of institutionalism which emphasizes the interlinkages of
   societal interests and regulatory ideas with institutional frameworks.
   The papers reveal that domestic factors embody more obstacles to than
   opportunities for horizontal coordination. It is argued that
   transatlantic relations will likely undergo a `double movement' of being
   simultaneously shifted upwards to become part of the global governance
   architecture, and downwards towards broader involvement of legislators
   in regulatory matters. Hence, transatlantic regulation might in the near
   future be more shaped by political leaders, rent-seeking interest groups
   and legislators than by networks of technocrats.},

Journal = {EUROPE-ASIA STUDIES},

Volume = {63},

Pages = {857-874},
Abstract = {This article analyses a peculiar form of labour mobilisation, known as
   the `trudarmee', to which ethnic Germans in the Soviet Union, along with
   some other nationalities, were subjected in 1942-1945 after their
   initial deportations from the areas in which they had lived. The labour
   mobilisation of the war years was a form of forced labour obligation
   which existed outside of the immediate realm of the `traditional' forced
   labour of the Gulag. The article considers the compatibility of the two
   forms of labour mobilisation and demonstrates that the `trudarmee'
   labour mobilisation had features of both free and forced labour and thus
   deserves a space of its own in the existing historiography of Stalinism.},

Abstract = {This article does not question whether the EU has a strategic culture,
   but rather asks how one can investigate its nature. It creates and
   utilizes an analytical framework to demonstrate that the European
   Union's strategic culture is based on an extended concept of security
   and on a comprehensive, multilateral and internationally legitimated
   approach to threats, implying the use of military and civilian
   instruments in an integrated manner on over 20 common security and
   defence policy (CSDP) operations. It suggests that the analytical
   framework can also act as a stable reference point to compare and
   contrast the strategic cultures of a range of actors.},

Abstract = {The promise of Bourdieu-inspired analysts to provide a ``different
   reading'' of the international is receiving increasing attention in the
   academic discipline of international relations (IR). This attention also
   generates awareness and of problems inherent in the Bourdieuian approach
   and a desire to develop it further (or abandon it). These discussions
   have often focused on the difficulties that arise for IR as a
   consequence of the structuralism of Bourdieu's approach, and as such
   they dovetail with the discussions between Bourdieu's ``critical
   sociology'' and the ``pragmatic school'' in the French context. This
   article uses these discussions to clarify what it entails to paint a
   different picture-my picture-of the international using Bourdieu's
   thinking tools. More specifically, it argues that Bourdieu's thinking
   can be used as a basis for a non-structuralist staging of the
   international taking on board the critique raised by pragmatists and
   integrating many of the insights developed by them. Bourdieu often
   referred to his own thinking as a ``structuralist constructivism,'' so
   this article takes Bourdieu's thinking in a direction he may not have
   liked to go. However, it sticks closely to the spirit of his contention
   that one should never privilege scholastic theorizing for the sake of
   theorizing nor hesitate to ``read a thinker against himself.''},

Abstract = {The EU is very good at negative integration, removing barriers to
   cross-border activity. But does that automatically mean the creation of
   a common market? We investigate the extent to which EU health care
   policies, which undeniably are negative integration, are creating any
   kind of markets in health care. Using elite interviews in the UK and
   Germany, we find almost no behaviour by states or stakeholders that is
   both competitive and attributable to EU policy. There are multiple
   barriers to entry and weak incentives for patients, providers or
   governments to respond to EU health policy with competition or entry
   into new markets. So there is very little response to EU law, and what
   there is is driven by domestic political agendas.},

Abstract = {A new racism, it is claimed, has become a dominant feature of
   contemporary American politics. According to the theory's originators,
   the new racism has largely replaced the old racism, which was based on
   the alleged biological inferiority of blacks. The new racism, referred
   to as ``symbolic racism{''} or, more recently, ``racial resentment,{''}
   by contrast, is defined as a conjunction of anti-black feelings and
   American moral traditionalism. According to its proponents, this new
   racism now structures and dominates the racial thinking of whites
   generally. Howard Schuman has suggested, however, that the index used to
   measure racial resentment may be fundamentally flawed because it may be
   conflated with the measurement of attitudes toward racial policies. The
   authors' analysis supports Schuman's suggestion. They conclude that
   racial resentment is not a valid measure of racism, which raises
   questions about the extent to which a new racism now dominates the
   thinking of white Americans.},

Abstract = {The determinants of compliance with human rights treaties likely vary
   according to the right in question, yet heterogeneity in the pathways
   through which ratification affects various human rights outcomes has
   received limited attention. This paper first develops an account of
   treaty compliance that incorporates the intrinsic benefits to the state
   of compliance, regime costs associated with certain rights, the
   political costs that NGOs, judges, and others are able to impose for
   non-compliance, and the fiscal and economic costs of compliance. The
   paper argues that for child survival rights, fiscal and economic costs
   are likely to be dispositive, and that as a result richer countries are
   more likely to comply. The paper then uses an instrumental variable
   approach to investigate whether ratification of the Convention of the
   Rights of the Child was associated with stronger effort at the country
   level on child survival rights. It finds that ratification of the CRC
   was correlated with a subsequent increase in immunization rates, but
   only in upper middle and high income countries.},

Volume = {634},
Pages = {16-38},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Lay or commonsense accounts of the origins of criminal behavior may play
   a key role in sustaining a strong public appetite for harsh criminal
   justice policies and undergird large black-white differences in opinion
   in this domain. Using data from the nationally representative Race,
   Crime, and Public Opinion project's 2001 survey, the authors develop an
   explanatory mode typology for accounts of involvement in criminal
   behavior. These include both individualistic and structural accounts of
   behavior in addition to a mixed-mode category. The authors identify key
   differences in the demographic and sociopolitical bases of the
   attributional types and find significant race differences in these
   attributional types. Attributions strongly affect how individuals wish
   to see public policy respond to the problem of crime and explain a small
   but significant fraction of the black-white difference in crime policy
   views.},

Abstract = {This discussion engages with Janet Conway's and Sian Sullivan's comments
   on our article, `Deconstructing Militant Manhood: Masculinities in the
   Disciplining of (Anti-)Globalization Politics'. First, we clarify our
   understanding of global capitalist forms of ordering and of the gendered
   scripts attendant to them as a response to Conway's call for a more
   intersectional analysis and to her point about the relationship between
   the situated practices we explore and the global order within which we
   locate them. In doing so, we defend our methodology based on an
   ascending analysis of power and the usefulness of our particular
   ethnographical approach to carry out such analysis. Second, we address
   Sullivan's concerns about our choice of an academic journal as the site
   for a discussion of the forms of gendered exclusion that we have
   experienced. While we have not been able to engender a space of active
   listening in the activist groups we analyse, developing our own tools of
   analysis of what had happened to us and finding this academic space to
   share them has been part of a process of making sense of our traumatic
   experiences both intellectually and emotionally.},

Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},

Pages = {233-238},
Abstract = {This commentary on Neil Smith's Uneven Development revisits his
   production of nature thesis and uses it as a jumping off point to
   explore how human bodies matter in contemporary capitalism. It argues
   that human bodies are increasingly subsumed within capitalism in ways
   that go beyond the roles of humans as labourers and purchasers of goods
   and services in a system of commodities producing commodities. Bodies

Number = {8},
Pages = {1425-1447},
Abstract = {This study offers a computable general equilibrium methodology to
   analyse the involvement of multinationals in the motor vehicles sector
   in the post-communist Czech Republic. This allows estimating not only
   the economy-wide impact, but also the sectoral adjustments in a unified
   framework. The real levels of foreign direct investment received in the
   motor vehicles sector seem to produce only limited forward and backward
   linkages. Therefore, gross domestic product (GDP) and welfare increase
   slightly-and can even fall-after a certain degree of capital
   accumulation because saturation effects arise. Profit repatriation
   considerably exacerbates the negative effect on GDP and welfare.},

Abstract = {During the 1950s, the United States conducted both overt and covert
   propaganda activities in India. Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru opposed
   these activities as encroachments upon Indian sovereignty. However,
   domestic opposition composed primarily of members of the Praja Socialist
   Party worked closely with US-backed groups, in particular the Indian
   Committee for Cultural Freedom, to generate a political alternative to
   the ruling Congress party. Although receiving covert money from the
   Americans, these Indians did not believe that foreign money determined
   or shaped their opinions. On the other hand, their close association
   with the Americans undermined their claims to represent a legitimate
   domestic opposition.},

   TO ACCESS LEGAL ABORTION IN THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND?},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL FEMINIST JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {13},
Number = {3},
Pages = {390-412},
Abstract = {This article analyses some possible political implications of the case
   and the decision in A. B. and C. v. Ireland at the European Court of
   Human Rights. This case was heard in a public hearing on 9 December
   2009; the judgment was provided in December 2010. I argue that the three
   applicants in this case employed a novel strategy, not previously
   considered, to access legal abortion in the Republic of Ireland. By
   highlighting the varied circumstances of unintended pregnancy in more
   than a single instance, the applicants utilized an offensive manoeuvre
   to which the government is unlikely to respond consistently over time.
   They exposed Irish governments' use of clandestine political
   negotiations in relation to European treaties, the questionable exertion
   of governments' authority to uphold political and moral agendas and
   racialized constructions of Irishness and national interests. The
   applicants also raised serious questions about state practices in the
   Republic of Ireland in relation to its legal obligation to uphold human
   rights under the European Convention. However, I argue that it is
   unlikely that this novel strategy and legal decision and their political
   implications are enough to adequately address the lack of access to
   legal abortion in the Republic of Ireland.},

Abstract = {In late 2005, Suzette Nicolas, then known publicly only as `Nicole',
   alleged that on 1 November of that year she had been gang-raped by US
   Marines in Olongapo City in the Subic Bay area on the island of Luzon,
   site of one of two former large US military bases in the Philippines.
   Thus began what was to become an internationally notorious rape case,
   involving the US and Philippine governments, the US military, the
   Philippine judiciary and a broad feminist-led activist coalition. The
   case, played out against the backdrop of the US state's Asian front in
   the `War on Terror', has become inextricably linked with the ongoing
   Philippine campaign against the US-Philippines Visiting Forces
   Agreement. This article looks at the case, its background, its symbolism
   and the current political debate on the ongoing connections between
   militarism, globalization, US imperialism and violence against women in
   the Philippines.},
