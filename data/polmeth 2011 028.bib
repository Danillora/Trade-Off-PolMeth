Abstract = {International human rights law provides minimum requirements for
   government behavior in all spheres of policy, including a government's
   efforts to deal with the legacy of a previous regime and/or a violent
   conflict. To some extent, the creation of supranational human rights
   protection mechanisms after World War II in itself can be considered a
   transitional justice effort. This is particularly the case in Europe,
   where the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) was adopted in
   1951, only a few years after the end of the war. Since its adoption,
   ECHR case law related to transitional justice has included hundreds of
   judgments and decisions dealing with a wide range of issues, mainly
   compensation and restitution, but also prosecution, lustration, memory
   and truth. Situations that have been addressed include the legacy of the
   World War II, the legacy of Communist regimes in Central and Eastern
   Europe and the aftermath of the war in the former Yugoslavia. This case
   law sets out a number of standards and criteria that warrant more
   attention than they have received in the field of transitional justice.},

   Political Transitions},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {5},
Number = {2},
Pages = {177-197},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The article argues that narratives of transitional justice have been
   placed on a somewhat unexamined pedestal in the social sciences and the
   humanities. Within such narratives, transitional justice, as both a
   phenomenon and a conceptual tool, is regarded as inevitable and
   commonplace for anyone wishing to address the issue of past human rights
   violations. The article suggests that while the concept of transition,
   strictly speaking, is merely descriptive of processes of change and
   thereby assumedly a neutral signifier, it has been positively
   oversignified by various fields of study. The article also examines
   literary narratives that have political transitions as their foci,
   proposing that a literary theory approach to transitional narratives
   should not be dictated only by the privileged themes, forms and
   narrative structures of the normative narratives of transitional justice
   (such as truth commission reports), but be open to fictional narratives
   as having something valuable to contribute within the context of
   political transitions.},

Abstract = {Changing the composition and voting system of the Security Council, in
   an effort to increase the institution's global legitimacy, is proving to
   be one of the most difficult hurdles to overcome for the global
   community of states represented in the United Nations (UN). This paper
   demonstrates that due to institutional hurdles, it is considerably more
   difficult today than it was in the early years of the UN to reach a
   winning coalition in the General Assembly to secure Security Council
   reform. In addition, the paper analyzes the effects that adapted
   patterns of voting, as prescribed by recent reform proposals, would have
   on the distribution of power among UN member states in the Security
   Council and on the probability that this institution can form a winning
   coalition, i.e., reach decisions. Our power and decision capacity
   computations are based on (modified) Penrose-Banzhaf-Coleman measures.},

   laterally related brothers and imperial bondservants to hold Chinese

Title = {Relational regulation in the Brazilian Ministerio Publico: The
   organizational basis of regulatory responsiveness},
Journal = {REGULATION \& GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Pages = {70-89},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Recent research on regulatory enforcement has been showing that the best
   way to enforce protective regulations is to thoroughly adapt the remedy
   to the problem at hand. Unfortunately, this is far from easy, as
   organizations and work environments all too often encourage street-level
   bureaucrats to standardize and simplify their practices. In an attempt
   to bridge this gap, many scholars equate responsiveness to preprogrammed
   escalation. This article analyzes how the Brazilian Ministerio Publico
   (MP) promotes a more ambitious form of responsiveness, here called
   relational regulation. While most of the formal features of the MP
   encourage routinization, groups of reformist prosecutors identify
   important cases, recruit external allies, and jointly devise innovative
   and context-specific solutions to problems of non-compliance. Crucially,
   this mode of action is not an anomaly, the result of individual
   proclivities or specific and formal job assignments. Rather, it is
   systematically produced by a mostly parallel and covert organization
   that operates within and expands beyond the MP itself. These two logics
   - routinized and custom-made responses - compete, cooperate,
   interpenetrate, and find common ground within the same organizational
   umbrella, and through their interaction they create an enforcement
   agency that is more robust, reliable, and responsive than allowed by
   current theory.},

Abstract = {The application of universal ideas to specific settings is a crucial
   aspect of transitional justice. Yet, that application awakens tensions
   between universal and local conceptions of justice. This article
   considers the judicial reform programme carried out in Guatemala after
   its internal conflict. I use Hans-Georg Gadamer's concepts of techne and
   phronesis to assess the programme and to suggest an alternative. I argue
   that the reforms were underpinned by techne, which involves choosing the
   appropriate means to attain an end. This technical approach entailed a
   reliance on indicators and expertise that resulted in a self-defeating
   project, where the process (re) produced the phenomena it strove to
   eliminate: impunity and violence. As an alternative, I suggest a model
   that relies on phronesis, which would establish a dialogical
   relationship between universal values and particular circumstances. It
   would be undertaken in three layers: one involving the universal and the
   local, another embracing the means and the end, and the last engaging
   legal institutions with an ideal justice.},

Abstract = {American intelligence professionals have long understood that the US
   intelligence community is, and always has been, a closed and insular
   society, with each agency within the intelligence community taking pride
   in having its own unique bureaucratic identity, distinct corporate
   culture, operating environments, social dynamics, and internal behavior
   patterns that have been molded and shaped by external events and
   internal forces over the past 60 years. These `strategic cultural'
   factors mean that the agencies comprising the US intelligence community
   are, in many respects, unique bureaucratic entities, operating far
   differently than comparable large American corporations and government
   agencies. These strategic cultural factors shape and define the
   environment within which the US intelligence agency works, dictate how
   American intelligence agencies perform their mission, and also help to
   explain why they repeatedly make the same mistakes and find it difficult
   to fix the longstanding problems which contributed to the failures.
   Within the context of the recent 9/11 and Iraqi weapons of mass
   destruction intelligence failures, this article explores the role played
   by these strategic cultural factors in helping to explain a series of
   historical intelligence failures by the US intelligence community.},

Abstract = {This article examines the effectiveness of private transnational
   regulation of labour standards/rights in the clothing industry. It
   adopts three objectives. First, the study focuses on national states in
   developing countries, explaining their lack of enforcement of labour law
   and the suppression of labour rights. Second, the article examines the
   effectiveness of transnational regulatory networks (TRNs) in raising
   labour standards/rights in producer countries. We conclude that, in a
   fragmented and highly competitive global industry, existing TRNs cannot
   ensure labour decent standards/rights. Third, we investigate the reasons
   for their limited effectiveness. We empirically investigate the
   conditions and rights of labour in the clothing industries of China and
   Turkey. In the case of Turkey, we are able to explain the lack of
   effectiveness of TRNs by drawing on interviews with a variety of actors
   in firms and networks.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF WOMEN POLITICS \& POLICY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {32},
Number = {3},
Pages = {193-210},
Abstract = {Most studies looking at the roll call voting behavior of female
   legislators have investigated this phenomenon at the state legislative
   level and for the US House of Representatives. Very little research has
   looked at the impact of gender on the policy records of US senators.
   With the number of female senators continuing to increase it is now
   possible to undertake such an analysis. This study examines the
   influence of gender in predicting the roll call voting behavior of US
   senators across several recent congresses. To unearth gender effects, it
   employs a longitudinal design based on turnover in the Senate, which
   holds constituency constant while allowing gender and party to vary. The
   results indicate that male and female senators representing the same
   state compile very similar voting records on the basic left/right policy
   dimension. However, when votes on issues of concern to women are
   examined, female senators tend to be more supportive than the male
   senators they replaced, and male senators tend to be less supportive
   than the female senators they replaced.},

Journal = {EUROPE-ASIA STUDIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {63},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1357-1375},
Abstract = {The article presents new survey research, sensitive to local
   understandings of key terms, that helps resolve a longstanding debate on
   whether Russian public opinion generally supports democracy or
   authoritarianism. The central conclusion is that while Russians differ
   amongst themselves, they are best understood not as autocratic but as
   generally supportive of a particular form of democracy that social
   scientists have called `delegative democracy'. This logically consistent
   preference structure reconciles diverse arguments and findings in the
   literature, sheds light on Putin's puzzling decision to cede the
   presidency to Medvedev in 2008, and offers insight into the public
   opinion foundations of `hybrid regimes'.},

Abstract = {American 16- and 17-year-olds ought to be allowed to vote in state and
   national elections. This claim rests upon a line of argument that begins
   with an exegesis of legal and philosophical notions of citizenship that
   identify core qualities of citizenship: membership, concern for rights,
   and participation in society. Each of these qualities is present in
   rudimentary form in childhood and adolescence. Analyses of national
   survey data demonstrate that by 16 years of age but not before American
   adolescents manifest levels of development in each quality of
   citizenship that are approximately the same as those apparent in young
   American adults who are allowed to vote. The lack of relevant
   differences in capacities for citizenship between 16- and 17-year-olds
   and those legally enfranchised makes current laws arbitrary, denying
   those younger than age 18 the right to vote. Awarding voting rights to
   16- and 17-year-olds is important, given the changing age demographics
   in the country, which have resulted in the growing block of older voters
   displacing the interests of younger Americans in the political arena.
   Finally, the authors critically examine claims that adolescents are
   neither neurologically nor socially mature enough to vote responsibly
   and conclude that empirical evidence and fairness suggest that 16- and
   17-year-olds ought to be awarded the vote.},

Abstract = {Drawing on intelligence documents that were recently declassified, this
   article assesses the quality of US intelligence analysis during the
   1980-81 Polish crisis and the impact of the intelligence analysis on US
   policy toward Poland and the Soviet Union. After discussing the value
   and limitations of the declassified materials, the article raises
   questions about US policy during the crisis and discusses how
   intelligence inputs helped to shape policy. The newly available
   documents confirm that the US intelligence community's analytical
   products were often deficient and that these shortcomings put a crimp on
   US policymakers' choices.},

Abstract = {One way to explore the question of whether and how intelligence
   influenced the course of the Cold War is to review its impact within a
   defined arena of political-military activity. This paper investigates
   several areas in which intelligence analysis influenced the superpower
   strategic competition: forging of military doctrines, the design of
   weapons systems, and the progression of international crises. The
   analysis focuses on the United States case, where it finds cases in
   which US intelligence had beneficial effects but others in which
   intelligence performance proved more problematic in either shortening
   the Cold War or reducing its dangers.},

Abstract = {The increasing privatization of security and the changing patterns of
   security governance call into question the foundational lines of
   demarcation between the public and private. This article investigates
   how key actors in the security assemblage at Stockholm-Arlanda Airport
   make sense of their roles in relation to publicprivate distinctions.
   While central to the ways in which security actors understand themselves
   and each other, closer inspection reveals that the drawing of these
   lines is also highly ambivalent and contestedin relation to questions of
   control and regulation, authority, as well as security rationalities.
   Further, privateprivate and publicpublic contestations also are informed
   by the obdurate publicprivate distinction.},

Abstract = {This article examines efforts to account for missing persons from the
   apartheid era in South Africa by family members, civil society
   organizations and the current government's Missing Persons Task Team,
   which emerged out of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission process. It
   focuses on how missing persons have been officially defined in the South
   African context and the extent to which the South African government is
   able to address the current needs and desires of relatives of the
   missing. I make two main arguments: that family members ought to have an
   active role in shaping the initiatives and institutions that seek to
   resolve the fate of missing people, and that the South African
   government ought to take a more holistic `grave-to-grave' approach to
   the process of identifying, returning and reburying the remains of the
   missing.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the ways in which the appropriation of offices
   and positions for personal use ({''}patrimony{''}) shapes incentive
   structures and collective capacity. Within the context of an agency
   relation, patrimonial power characterizes a mode of political dominance
   and resource management excluding accountability. This micro-analytical
   definition identifies three sources of variation: (1) the degree of
   codification, (2) the extent to which allegiance is personal (versus
   office-based), and (3) the extent to which dependence is asymmetrical.
   Patrimonial power enhances collective capacity through the creation of
   nodes of agency. It undermines this capacity by begetting arbitrary
   power and instability, by undercutting incentives for productive
   innovations, and by fostering the downward fragmentation of spheres of
   influence. Actors get out of this structural logic through two conjoint
   processes: (1) groups vying for office regulate the terms of their
   competition (intergroup dynamics), and (2) principals develop an
   incentive to make themselves accountable to fend off their agents'
   possible exit (intragroup dynamics).},

Abstract = {The Putin-Medvedev transition reveals the continuing inability of
   post-Soviet Russian leaders to arrive at any consensual notion of
   Russia's national identity around which ordinary forms of legitimate
   domination might be constructed. In searching for an answer to the
   problem of leadership succession during his second term as president,
   Vladimir Putin tried out all three of the classical types of legitimate
   domination that Max Weber defined-the traditional, the rational-legal,
   and the charismatic-without success. In the end, the 2008 elections
   represented a novel combination of strategies for building state
   legitimacy that we might term ``plebiscitarian patrimonialism{''}: the
   Russian leadership claims the right to rule as if the state were its
   personal property', as long as the results of this arbitrary rule are
   electorally ratified by ``the people{''} as a true reflection of the
   national will.},

Abstract = {The international harmonization of technology-related regulations seeks
   certain norms across diverse contexts. Harmonization efforts are based
   primarily on the promulgation of state-centered command and control
   forms of regulation, though they may also be accompanied by the
   diffusion of more plural approaches that are decentered from the state.
   We contrast the ways in which the ``proper{''} use of transgenic cotton
   seed technologies is understood in harmonizing regulations with the way
   this technology is used in practice in regions of Argentina and China.
   We find divergence that poses challenges for both state-centered and
   decentered approaches to harmonization. While state-centered approaches
   are blind to some critical processes on the ground, decentered
   strategies are found wanting in situations where norms remain deeply
   contested amongst actors situated in very uneven power relations. In
   both cases, we find that establishing and securing norms that are
   socially just and environmentally sustainable means attending much more
   explicitly to the political economies in which technological practices
   actually take root.},

Abstract = {In the search for an optimal institutional design in the European Union,
   efficiency criteria for the allocation of prerogatives to different
   levels of government are greatly needed. The goal of this article is to
   provide a comprehensive framework for the optimal allocation of
   prerogatives by stressing the role of economic convergence in allowing
   for efficient centralization of policies. Harmonization of policies can
   be harmful when local economies are diverging too much. However,
   citizens or governments may agree through deliberation on the
   appropriateness of making their economies converge in order to be able
   to implement an efficient common policy that internalizes externalities.},

Title = {Ratification by the United States of the Convention on the Rights of the
   Child: Pros and Cons from a Child's Rights Perspective},
Journal = {ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {633},
Pages = {80-101},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This article discusses the significance of the United States'
   ratification of the CRC, concluding that even if the treaty is not
   self-executing, ratification would make a major difference. It would
   enable the United States to better promote children's rights abroad, and
   it would push the United States to develop its domestic law in
   dramatically new directions that empower children. The CRC provides
   children with powerful affirmative rights and imposes reciprocal duties
   on nation-states. It provides rights to participate, including rights to
   be heard and to make decisions on personal and political matters; rights
   to receive important benefits, including health, support, and education;
   rights to protection against maltreatment; and rights to nurturing
   parental care. All this contrasts with U.S. law's negative rights
   tradition, its emphasis on parental rights, limited recognition of
   children's rights, and related restriction of state power to protect
   children. U.S. ratification could have a positive impact, particularly
   in connection with parental relationship rights and related maltreatment
   issues. However, there is also a risk of negative impact, given the
   problematic CRC provisions on international and transracial adoption.
   The solution is ratification with a reservation regarding Articles 20
   and 21.},

Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {16},
Number = {3},
Pages = {347-371},
Abstract = {Much research in international political economy (IPE) has been
   criticised for focussing on large and powerful actors in post-industrial
   countries, to the neglect of sites, processes and actors in the global
   South. This article offers a corrective to this bias in two ways: by
   locating the analysis in two rural Central American communities; and by
   exploring the social relations of consumption in these communities. In
   doing this, I challenge assumptions about rural places being excluded
   from global processes and explore the complexities and contradictions of
   how such communities are inserted into global circuits of production and
   consumption. Drawing on extensive qualitative research, the article
   explores the ways in which capitalist development through tourism has
   reconstituted the political economy of consumption in terms of habits,
   attitudes and behaviour in these two communities. Using the community
   and the household as sites of analysis, I explore the complex ways in
   which inequalities have been reconfigured through changing relations of
   consumption. Certain kinds of social hierarchies, in particular
   traditional gendered power relations within the household, have been
   challenged. However, other inequalities - such as class, ethnicity and
   nationality - have been reinforced by these processes.},

Title = {Reflections on CIA Analysis: Is it Finished?},
Journal = {INTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {26},
Number = {1},
Pages = {72-81},
Abstract = {Despite the CIA's improved analytical tradecraft and increased
   resources, the future of its analytic mission remains in doubt.
   Post-9/11 improvements have been coupled with a continued focus on
   current intelligence priorities that minimize attention to the
   development of strategic research and deeper knowledge. Simply
   increasing the number of analysts has not produced deeper expertise. The
   CIA's traditional recruitment and training methods, as well as its
   rewards and promotion system, encourage analysts to avoid concentrating
   on any single area of regional or functional expertise in favor of
   moving around the agency to build a successful career. A continued
   reliance on risk-avoidance security practices also restricts analysts'
   contact with non-government and foreign experts who often have needed
   political and cultural knowledge of intelligence topics. To rectify
   these inadequacies, the CIA's analytic directorate needs to develop
   incentives for analysts who wish to develop more strategic analysis and
   remove the security barriers to closer collaboration with experts

Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-18},
Abstract = {This article addresses the effects of inequality on the globalisation
   process. It is argued that the recent financial and economic crisis is a
   manifestation of a tendency of the aggregate demand to fall relatively
   to aggregate supply, generated by an asymmetric income distribution,
   which in turn both increases, and is reinforced by, the mobility of
   goods, capital and labour, in a process of cumulative causation. This
   process has not become manifest earlier due to counteracting tendencies
   generated by the financial system, that were disrupted during the
   crisis. It is also argued that mainstream economics does not have the
   adequate framework for explaining the crisis, and actually contributed
   to the crisis through its theories and policies. Hence an alternative
   economic framework is suggested for addressing the crisis, drawing upon
   the contributions of several heterodox economic traditions, especially
   post-Keynesianism.},

Abstract = {We ask whether women's descriptive representation in Congress enhances
   women's substantive representation through speechmaking on the House
   floor. Much of the research on women's substantive representation has
   focused on members' votes for and sponsorship of ``women's issues{''}
   legislation. We depart from this research by systematically analyzing
   how members' gender and partisan identities affect gendered rhetoric in
   their floor speeches. In an era marked by significant increases in the
   number of congresswomen and partisan polarization, understanding the
   interactive effect of gender and partisanship on women's representation
   is particularly important. In an analysis of more than 30,000 speeches
   from 1993 to 2008, we find that when members speak about issues of their
   choosing during one-minute speeches, and during specific legislative
   debates over the most important policies considered on the House floor,
   congresswomen in both parties are significantly more likely than men to
   discuss women, enhancing women's representation.},

Journal = {JCMS-JOURNAL OF COMMON MARKET STUDIES},

Volume = {49},

Pages = {1271-1293},

Abstract = {This article analyses the formation and development of Member State
   preferences and positions before and during the European Union (EU)
   Presidency term. The empirical analysis focuses on the Federal Republic
   of Germany's policy concerning EU-Russian relations, especially
   regarding energy policy. The extent to which liberal
   intergovernmentalism (LI) furthers our understanding of state behaviour
   in the context of the EU Presidency is questioned. The findings suggest
   that LI adequately explains the formation of German positions prior to
   assuming office, as its policy objectives are chiefly influenced by
   domestic producers' interests. However, LI cannot satisfactorily account
   for German governmental action after taking on the Presidency role,
   during which time it largely downplayed domestic preferences. Instead,
   Presidency norms dominated its action. In this article, institutionalist
   approaches are drawn upon for a significantly enhanced understanding of
   governmental behaviour during the Presidency. Rational choice
   institutionalism (RCI) highlights Germany's restraint from defending its
   original domestic preferences due to rational calculation embedded in
   normative Presidency constraints. Sociological institutionalism (SI)
   accounts for the reprioritization of objectives through the
   `taken-for-grantedness' of thoroughly internalized Presidency norms.},

   Changes in six critical areas of restructuring are examined: the

   governance; and management. Relations between firms and various levels
   of government are also examined. The degree to which the manufacturing
   sector is market oriented and its potential to drive economic growth are

   differentials in 12 economic and monetary union (EMU) countries. The
   evidence from standard linear unit root tests indicates that inflation
   differentials are highly persistent in the majority of countries.
   However, when one allows for the possibility that inflation
   differentials can be characterized by a nonlinear mean reverting
   process, one finds evidence of stationarity in all cases. The empirical
   results suggest that once nonlinearity is accounted for, inflation
   differentials do not consistently intensify real divergence in the euro

Abstract = {How have the Transnistrian authorities sought to consolidate de facto
   statehood in the absence of international recognition? Starting from the
   idea that the time factor will eventually transform secessionists into
   state-builders, this article traces how the processes of state- and
   nation-building promoted by the Transnistrian de facto authorities have
   evolved since the early 1990s. Drawing on official sources, interviews,
   journalism, and the political science literature, the domestic
   dimensions of state- and nation-building in de facto state conflicts are
   examined. These include fulfillment of basic requirements of state-
   building, development of economic viability, and nation-building
   processes that attempt to create a unifying identity.},

Abstract = {Human rights originated as a political claim made by movements
   contesting state power. Recently, they have become the property of
   states: a juridical right that is for the state to give. I track this
   transformation through changes in responses to humanitarian crises.
   Humanitarian crises are seen to issue from two sorts of states-rogue
   states and failed states-both of whom violate, by commission or
   omission, the rights of their subjects. Given the failure of these
   states to protect the rights of their citizens, policymakers and rights
   advocates call for external intervention, or state-building. In
   understandings of state-building, human rights are for the state; or
   more correctly the state-being-built; to give, reversing the development
   of human rights from a set of political movements that protested unjust
   state power.},

Title = {When BITs have some bite: The political-economic environment for
   bilateral investment treaties},
Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-32},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Political risk frequently impedes the flow of capital into developing
   countries. In response, governments often adopt innovative institutions
   that aim to attract greater flows of international investment and trade
   by changing the institutional environment and limiting the risk to
   outside investors. One primary example of this is the Bilateral
   Investment Treaty (BIT), aimed specifically at increasing the flow of
   foreign direct investment (FDI) to developing countries. Yet the
   literature in political science and economics is inconclusive about
   whether or not BITs do indeed stimulate FDI, and it provides conflicting
   theoretical reasoning for the claimed connection. This article argues
   that BITs do attract FDI to developing countries, but the story is a
   complicated one. Two important factors must be taken into account.
   First, BITs cannot entirely substitute for an otherwise weak investment
   environment. Countries must have the necessary domestic institutions in
   place that interact with BITs to make these international commitments
   credible and valuable to investors. Second, as the coverage of BITs
   increases, overall FDI flows to developing countries increase. However,
   although remaining positive, the marginal effect of a country's BITs on
   its own FDI may fall because of heightened competition for FDI from
   other BIT countries. Using data from 97 countries for 19842007, we
   provide empirical evidence consistent with both of these theoretical
   claims.},

Abstract = {The complex dynamics of inter-ethnic relations in post-communist
   countries leads to a puzzle: why do some ethnic minorities mobilise to
   obtain political representation whereas others do not? We use
   qualitative comparative analysis to capture complex causal patterns
   explaining the formation of ethnic parties and to analyse the combined
   effect of social, economic and political variables. Our article bridges
   a significant gap in the existing literature that usually focuses on
   simple explanations for the existence of ethnic parties. The analysis
   reveals that the political mobilisation of ethnic minorities is
   explained by institutional elements often underemphasised in existing
   theories and research.},

Title = {Asymmetric bargaining and development trade-offs in the
   CARIFORUM-European Union Economic Partnership Agreement},
Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {18},
Number = {3},
Pages = {328-357},
Abstract = {On 15 October 2008, CARIFORUM became the first region among the African,
   Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) group of countries to sign a `full' Economic
   Partnership Agreement (EPA) with the European Union (EU). Although the
   EPA process has generated widespread critical commentary, few analysts
   have stopped to consider the motives of individual ACP countries and
   regions in their approach to the talks. In this article we consider the
   question of motives in relation to the CARIFORUM-EU EPA. Specifically,
   it asks why did CARIFORUM feel it necessary or desirable to sign a
   `full' EPA, containing numerous provisions not actually mandated by the
   WTO, when the rest of the ACP was content to sign far less ambitious
   `goods only' interim agreements? In order to address this question, the
   article goes beyond the extant EU-ACP trade literature to build on wider
   international political economy (IPE) scholarship, which has analysed
   the actions of developing countries in relation to a whole range of
   `WTO-plus' North-South regional and bilateral FTAs. On this basis, the
   article stands back from the complex details of the agreement to analyse
   its wider significance, especially in terms of the presumed trade-off
   between the immediate economic benefits of improved and more secure
   market access, against the longer term costs of sacrificing the
   regulatory autonomy, or policy space, deemed necessary to pursue the
   type of trade and industrial policies deployed successfully in the past
   by both developed and (some) developing countries. Put simply, the
   article seeks to ascertain why ultimately CARIFORUM signed an agreement,
   what it gained from the negotiations and at what cost.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to critically review the work of Andre
   Gunder Frank. This is no easy task given the prolific and controversial
   nature of his life work. His main distinction is as a paradigm breaker
   and a paradigm maker. Frank is one of the founders of contemporary world
   system theory. He coined some memorable expressions such as the
   `development of underdevelopment' and `Re-Orient'. Indeed, these two
   concepts highlight two distinct phases in his work. His first phase is
   characterised by his writings on dependency theory and his initial
   understanding of world system theory broadly in line with Amin, Arrighi
   and Wallerstein. His second phase is distinguished by what he considers
   to be the `Eurocentric' interpretation of world system theory of
   Wallerstein and others as well as by his critique of his own earlier
   work. While some of Frank's analyses and assertions proved to be wrong,
   he provided much inspiration to a new generation of scholars and
   activists, some of whom provided the necessary empirical evidence and
   theoretical rigour lacking in parts of Frank's work. But he excelled in
   his mission of providing the big picture, asking the unimaginable
   questions and exploring hitherto inconceivable interrelationships.},

Abstract = {Through a study of Soviet legal practices, the article examines the
   enforcement of coercive laws and their limitations in the Soviet command
   economy. New archival documentation shows the scale and scope of
   Stalin's coercive machinery. Firstly, we show why labour legislation
   assumed its specific form, based on an economic analysis of the command
   economy. Secondly, we identify four specific limits to the efficient
   enforcement of the legislation: collusion, search costs, administrative
   congestion and in absentia convictions. Thirdly, we provide new input to
   the discussion on the scale of the Gulag apparatus, showing that certain
   data need to be treated cautiously.},

Abstract = {Interdoc, or the International Documentation and Information Center, was
   established in The Hague in early 1963 in order to coordinate a
   transnational network of institutes active in the field of analysing
   trends in communist ideology and societies. The product of deliberations
   between intelligence agencies and the private sector in Western Europe
   during the late 1950s, Interdoc reflected a need to develop and project
   a European stance on Cold War issues separate from an all-dominant US
   influence. Yet the Americans were present from the beginning, and their
   involvement gradually increased over time. This article covers the
   details of this involvement and uses it to comment on how Interdoc
   represents an interesting case of inter-service cooperation in
   anti-communist activities in the West.},

Title = {Resisting Protectionism after the Crisis: Strategic Economic Discourse
   and the EU-Korea Free Trade Agreement},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {16},
Number = {5},
Pages = {627-653},
Abstract = {In 2006 the European Commission announced its Global Europe strategy,
   which proposed pursuing a series of ambitious Free Trade Agreements
   (FTAs) premised on exchanging the EU's remaining `pockets of protection'
   for market access. The first of these agreements was signed with South
   Korea in October 2010. This article asks how the Commission's
   Directorate-General (DG) for Trade could successfully conclude this
   agreement in the aftermath of the Financial Crisis. Given a strong
   mobilisation of protectionists with access to policy-makers, this
   liberal policy outcome cannot be explained purely in terms of
   institutional insulation, as in much of the literature on EU trade
   policy, nor be simply `read off' from the material interests of societal
   actors. This article, therefore, develops a constructivist framework
   which broadens our understanding of the power of strategically invoked
   economic discourses. By developing a novel analytical strategy to
   determine the intentional invocation of such discourses, it is able to
   show how DG Trade constructed an ideational imperative for
   liberalisation in Global Europe, enabling it to overcome opposition to
   the EU-Korea FTA. Beyond its contribution to constructivist scholarship,
   this article draws attention to the neglected dimension of ideas in
   trade policy and highlights the continued purchase of neoliberalism
   after the crisis.},

Abstract = {With a steady release of material into The National Archives (UK),
   scholarly interest in imperial and commonwealth history as well as the
   field of intelligence studies has grown. The Malayan Emergency continues
   to provide a wealth of material, particularly for those interested in
   counter-insurgency. Yet the colonial police, and by extension their
   intelligence branches, have received less attention. This article
   considers new evidence of the organizational changes that occurred and
   the discussions that took place between the Colonial Office, the Malayan
   Government, the Malayan Police and the wider intelligence community
   which led to a restructuring of the Malayan Police and its Special
   Branch. It charts the rise of the Malayan Police Special Branch during
   the early stages of the emergency and its disentanglement from CID,
   reflecting on how police reform was shaped as much by external agencies
   as by local considerations.},

   Economic Development Priorities},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WOMEN POLITICS \& POLICY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {32},
Number = {3},
Pages = {211-236},
Abstract = {We investigate gender-associated differences in the attitudes of city
   leaders regarding local economic development priorities. In so doing, we
   test the thesis that the economic development priorities of women city
   leaders will reflect postmaterialist values; in other words, women city
   leaders will place more of an emphasis on quality-of-life issues than do
   men. We employ results of a survey of more than 150 city leaders in
   Texas. Our findings offer support for our postmaterialist thesis and
   indicate that while women differ little from men in terms of traditional
   economic development considerations, such as the importance of job
   creation and revenue generation, women more than men also consider the
   influence of economic development efforts on a community's environment
   and aesthetics.},

Abstract = {During the past thirty years in the social sciences, there has been a
   wide-ranging discussion of ``class politics{''} in capitalist modernity.
   Several distinct threads have developed, largely in isolation from each
   other. The authors suggest that the various accounts implicitly rely on
   different definitions of class politics and propose a way to classify
   them. The classification is based on two questions: first, whether
   changes in the strength of the left depend on the working class
   specifically or on cross-class dynamics and, second, whether emergent
   class differences in politics are largely spontaneous or constructed.
   The authors use this classification to assess the prospects for testing
   the empirical implications of different accounts and point to the more
   general insights potentially offered by each approach.},

Abstract = {The military regime that controlled Argentina between 1976 and 1983
   sought to radically depoliticize Argentine society through a violent
   campaign of social exclusion. Although this campaign required the active
   participation of the country's major civil institutions, scholars of
   Argentina's dictatorship and subsequent democratic transition have
   largely neglected the behavior of these key groups. This article
   examines the conduct of one such institution, the Delegation of
   Argentine Jewish Associations (DAIA), the Jewish community's official
   political representative. DAIA's drive for normality in the face of
   disorienting violence led the group, like many civil institutions, to
   cooperate with an abhorrent regime. DAIA's cooperation entailed no
   obvious crimes, but it did contribute markedly to the climate of fear
   and isolation central to the military's repressive social project.
   Rather than continue to ignore the critical role played by groups like
   DAIA, transitional justice mechanisms must be developed to account for
   this `political' sort of complicity.},

Title = {Habits of the Heart: Youth Religious Participation as Progress, Peril,
   or Change?},
Journal = {ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {637},
Pages = {78-98},

Abstract = {The landscape of youth religious participation is an underengaged area
   across both the humanities and social science. While the humanities lack
   empirical data on the changing religious life worlds of youths, existing
   empirical work in the social sciences suggests that institutional
   religion buffers criminality and delinquency-a brand of engagement the
   authors refer to as ``buffering transgression.{''} This is a process
   that both conceives and privileges religion as an institutional and a
   moral force responsible for creating prosocial behavior. While empirical
   studies on youths and religion keep religion arrested to institutional
   and moral functions, scholars in the humanities work hard to legitimate
   youth cultural forms, such as hip hop, by conflating its rugged
   dimensions with a quest (and hope) for democratic sensibilities-a motif
   the authors suggest is rooted in ideologies of teleological progress.
   Using the tropes progress, peril, and change, this article explores the
   utility (and limitations) of empirical work and the often misguided
   efforts to moralize religion. Here the authors raise queries regarding
   youth cultural change and religion and quantitatively model youth
   religious change over 16 years. The implications of these theoretical
   and empirical interventions point toward future work at the social
   scientific intersections of religion in culture.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on the political campaigns and career of Edward
   Brooke-the first black senator elected by popular vote and the only
   African American senator ever to win reelection. Brooke stands as the
   pioneer of a specific historical tradition: the history of black
   politicians who have won white votes. This article positions Brooke as
   the most important forerunner to Barack Obama. Indeed, he anticipated
   many of the racial and political currents that Obama has had to
   navigate. Yet this article aims to do more than situate Barack Obama's
   ascent within the broader arc of American political history. It also
   explores Brooke's campaigns and career in an effort to offer a new
   perspective on the history of racial politics in America's northern
   states.},

Journal = {ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {637},
Pages = {148-164},

Abstract = {Apartheid South Africa enacted physical, structural, and symbolic forms
   of violence on racially marked South Africans, and postapartheid South
   Africa has enacted ambitious-though also limited-laws, policies, and
   processes to address past injustices. In this article, the author traces
   the South African political histories of one self-defined group, the
   Lemba, to understand how the violence they collectively experienced when
   the apartheid state did not acknowledge their ethnic existence continues
   to shape their ideas of the promise of democracy to address all past
   injustices, including the injustice of nonrecognition. The Lemba are
   known internationally for their participation in DNA tests that
   indicated their Jewish ancestry. In media discourses, their
   racialization as black Jews has obscured their racialization as black
   South Africans: they are presented as seeking solely to become
   recognized as Jews. The author demonstrates that they have in fact
   sought recognition as a distinct African ethnic group from the South
   African state consistently since the 1950s. Lemba recognition efforts
   show that the violence of nonrecognition is a feature of South African
   multicultural democracy in addition to being part of the apartheid past.
   The author argues that the racialization of religion that positions the
   Lemba as genetic Jews simplifies and distorts their histories and
   politics of race in South Africa.},

Volume = {5},
Number = {2},
Pages = {198-220},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Despite evidence of massive human rights violations during the Soviet
   era, little has been done to come to terms with this violent past in
   Russia: no one has been prosecuted, no one has officially apologized,
   only a few victims have been acknowledged and a small amount in
   reparations has been paid. Worse still, this period of mass violence is
   now being officially rewritten, and the horrors of the past are being
   justified as a necessary step in the building of a great nation. The
   recent release of a teachers' handbook that makes no mention of past
   crimes and President Medvedev's decision to create a `Historical Truth
   Commission' to rewrite history to the country's advantage have
   underlined Russia's difficulties in effectively confronting its legacy.
   What impact has this lack of acknowledgment had on the country's
   democratic consolidation? The author attempts to answer this question by
   looking into the specificities of the Russian transition, analyzing the
   limited transitional justice mechanisms that have been implemented and
   why they failed, allowing the past to be rewritten. The article looks
   specifically at the role civil society organizations have played in
   dealing with the past - without, and often against, the state. The
   Russian case verifies transitional justice actors' assumptions about the
   importance of new democracies confronting their legacies of human rights
   abuses and the potentialities, as well as the limits, of Russian
   initiatives that are emerging from below and operating in a hostile
   environment.},

Abstract = {Regulation scholars have long searched for the best tools to use to
   achieve public policy goals, generating an extensive body of research on
   what has become known as instrument choice. By contrast, analysis of
   options for structuring how officials make regulatory decisions -
   process choice - remains in relative infancy. Notwithstanding the
   emphasis legal scholars and political economists have placed on
   administrative procedures, surprisingly little research has investigated
   why regulators choose among different process options or what value they
   and the public receive from different choices. In their book, Regulation
   by Litigation, Andrew Morriss, Bruce Yandle, and Andrew Dorchak make a
   significant contribution by empirically and normatively examining
   regulators' choices between notice-and-comment rulemaking, negotiated
   rulemaking, and what they call ``regulation by litigation.{''} This
   review article considers three central questions about regulation by
   litigation. First, how if at all does regulation by litigation differ
   from other uses of litigation to achieve policy goals? Second, why do
   regulators choose litigation over other process options? Third, is
   regulation by litigation as bad as Morriss, Yandle, and Dorchak say it
   is? By addressing these conceptual, empirical, and normative questions,
   this review article not only reveals the specific strengths and
   limitations of the book, Regulation by Litigation, but also highlights
   more general opportunities and challenges for future research on process
   choice.},

Abstract = {The outbreak of war is usually explained in terms of utility-maximizing
   behavior on the part of statesmen and states. In this article, I propose
   an alternative model for explaining war, which focuses on the struggle
   for recognition. As I will argue, wars are not only motivated by a
   pursuit of utility maximization but also by the quest to gain
   recognition for the identities and norms of respect to which domestic
   and international lay claim. As I will demonstrate in two case studies,
   peaceful management of international crises depends heavily on the
   capacity of actors to engage in politics of recognition.},

Abstract = {Racial earnings inequalities in the United States diminished
   significantly over the three decades following World War II, but since
   then have not changed very much. Meanwhile, black-white disparities in
   employment have become increasingly pronounced. What accounts for this
   historical pattern? Sociologists often understand the evolution of
   racial wage and employment inequality as the consequence of economic
   restructuring, resulting in narratives about black economic fortunes
   that emphasize changing skill demands related to the rise and fall of
   the industrial economy. Reviewing a large body of work by economic
   historians and other researchers, this article contends that the
   historical evidence is not consistent with manufacturing-and
   skills-centered explanations of changes in relative black earnings and
   employment. Instead, data from the 1940s onward suggest that racial
   earnings inequalities have been significantly influenced by political
   and institutional factors-social movements, government policies,
   unionization efforts, and public-employment patterns-and that racial
   employment disparities have increased over the course of the postwar and
   post-1970s periods for reasons that are not reducible to skills. Taking
   a broader historical view suggests that black economic fortunes have
   long been powerfully shaped by nonmarket factors and recenters research
   on racial discrimination as well as the political and institutional
   forces that influence labor markets.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to analyse one of the very first
   European-level instances of trade union and social movement interaction
   in defence of the public sector, namely, the Coalition for Green and
   Social Procurement, an alliance of European trade unions and green and
   social non-governmental organisations (NGOs), and its campaign for an
   amendment of the new public procurement directives from 2000 to 2003. It
   will be examined to what extent this campaign was able to change the
   directives and counter neoliberal restructuring effectively as well as
   what the possibilities but also limits of trade union and social
   movement cooperation are as exemplified in this particular case study.},

Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},

Volume = {16},

Pages = {303-322},
Abstract = {Recent debates surrounding state transformation in East Asia have tended
   to examine either how transformations in domestic social relations
   undermined the efficacy of the developmental state, or how mobilisation
   of coercion and consent at the international level led to the adoption
   of neoliberal policies. Through an examination of the case of Korea,
   however, this article seeks to move beyond this division between
   `domestic' - and `international' - centred analyses to provide a
   framework wherby mutually constitutive transformations taking place both
   at the level of social relations of production and at the level of the
   international order can be integrated to produce a conjunctural analysis
   of state transformation. Through deploying Gramsci's concept of passive
   revolution, an analysis of social and geopolitical underpinnings of
   korean late development is provided in order to provide an alternative
   explanation of the causes and nature of transition towards the
   neoliberal state since the latter part of the twentieth century.},

Abstract = {``Family law{''} is the term applied to the legal regulation of marriage
   and parenthood within a society, and may serve to express a society's
   accepted ideals concerning male-female relations. Adopting a feminist
   evolutionary analytic (FEA) approach, we hypothesize that nation-states
   with higher degrees of inequity in family law favoring men, codifying an
   evolutionary legacy of male dominance and control over female
   reproduction, will experience higher rates of violence against women.
   This hypothesis is borne out in conventional statistical analysis, both
   bivariate and multivariate, suggesting that policy attention to family
   law so as to make it more concordant with norms of the Convention on the
   Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) may
   have salutatory effects on women's physical security over time. These
   results may also have policy implications for societies with, or
   contemplating, enclaves of inequitable family law.},

Abstract = {This article presents analyses from an original database of 1,164 civil
   society groups that received funding from the European Commission from
   2003 to 2007, compiled from funding documents recently released through
   the European Transparency Initiative, and identifies the empirical
   patterns behind Commission funding behaviour. Based on the literature on
   input legitimacy, one would expect the Commission to seek to achieve
   balance across Member States and across diffuse and specific interests.
   Based on the literature on European integration which argues the EU has
   preferentially supported Euro groups, one would expect the Commission to
   support groups that promote pan-Europeanism and are organized at the
   European Union (EU) level. The data analysis shows that groups which
   promote a European identity, democracy and civic engagement and
   intercultural exchange, as well as those that are organized at the EU
   level, receive stronger support from the Commission. Additionally,
   groups based in the old Member States of western Europe receive
   significantly more funding than those in central and eastern Europe. The
   database is freely available to scholars online.},

Title = {Projecting macroeconomic outcomes: Evidence from the IMF},
Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {6},

Pages = {415-441},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In the process of designing IMF-supported programs, IMF staff members
   prepare projections of the evolution of key macroeconomic variables for
   the participating country. These projections are based on countries'
   initial situations, and are conditioned on the implementation of reforms
   and policy measures agreed in the context of programs. In this paper, we
   examine the accuracy of projections in 291 programs approved in the
   period 1993-2009. We focus on the projections of three macroeconomic
   variables (the ratios of the fiscal surplus to GDP and of external
   current account surplus to GDP, and real GDP growth) during the years
   immediately following the initiation of an IMF-supported program. We
   identify several potential reasons for divergence of projected from
   actual values: (i) mismeasured data on initial conditions; (ii)
   country-specific differences in forming projections, (iii) projections
   that do not reflect the dynamic time-series process of the actual data;
   (iv) policy forecast error; and (v) random errors in the actual data.
   Our data analysis suggests that the incomplete information on initial
   conditions and the country-specific differences in projection error are
   the largest contributors to discrepancies between projection and actual.
   We also consider whether the IMF's forecasts have gotten more accurate
   in recent years; there is evidence that they have for the shortest
   horizons, but the quantitative impact on forecast error is small.},

Abstract = {Power in the world's preeminent international financial institutions-the
   World Bank and the International Monetary Fund-resides in their
   Executive Boards. How do governments get elected to these international
   committees? This study quantitatively explores whether wealthy
   governments provide more foreign aid to poor governments that offer them
   political support. The focus is on Switzerland, which is elected to the
   Executive Board of the Bretton Woods Institutions by a group of
   countries from Central and Western Asia, and Eastern and Southern
   Europe. Results confirm the hypothesis. Implications for governance in a
   multipolar world are discussed.},

Journal = {ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {636},

Abstract = {How useful is the concept of patrimonialism to analyze state formation
   and political dynamics in postcolonial nation-states? Using Tunisia,
   Morocco, and Iraq during critical periods of state-building following
   the end of colonial rule, the author considers this question. The
   purpose of the article is to build on Max Weber by exploring how
   patrimonialism operates in kin-based social contexts where power on the
   basis of kinship ties is exerted not only by a central authority but
   also by leaders of local communities organized along lines of real or
   fictive kinship-as was the case in the three countries in the period
   under examination. Suggesting that Weber undertheorized the way in which
   central authority relates to local collectivities in his analysis of
   patrimonialism, the author identifies three patterns in the strategies
   used by central power toward local patrimonial networks:
   marginalization, integration, and shifts between marginalization and
   integration. The article argues that central patrimonialism can be
   accommodated with all three strategies directed toward local
   patrimonialism.},

Abstract = {As described in earlier articles, children whose parents have higher
   incomes and education levels are more likely to grow up in stable
   two-parent households than their economically disadvantaged
   counterparts. The widening gaps in fathers' involvement in parenting and
   in the quality and stability of parents' relationships may reinforce
   disparities in outcomes for the next generation. This article reviews
   evidence about the effectiveness of two strategies to strengthen
   fathers' involvement and family relationships-fatherhood programs aimed
   at disadvantaged noncustodial fathers and relationship skills programs
   for parents who are together. Fatherhood programs have shown some
   efficacy in increasing child support payments, while some relationship
   skills approaches have shown benefits for the couples' relationship
   quality, coparenting skills, fathers' engagement in parenting, and
   children's well-being. The research suggests that parents' relationship
   with each other should be a fundamental consideration in future programs
   aimed at increasing low-income fathers' involvement with their children.},

Abstract = {Three issues are central to, but underdeveloped in, theoretical debates
   about the welfare state. First, the array of welfare services is of
   equal, or greater, importance than welfare transfers; second, spending
   varies across substantively different domains; and third, the welfare
   state is profoundly shaped by gender. While a comprehensive body of
   research has provided many claims and critiques on these points, their
   potential for empirical examination has not been fully realized. This
   article addresses these points by analyzing development according to
   substantively disaggregated measures of welfare spending, as well as
   theorizing and testing explicit gender-relevant influences alongside
   established indicators. Results from cross-sectional and fixed-effect
   models indicate that established factors are particularly relevant for
   transfer spending, and much less so for services. Notably, gender
   measures emerge as strong determinants of services spending generally,
   but the specific impact of gender varies according to both the
   substantive spending domain and the aspect of gender being measured. The
   findings, overall, show strong support for the broader inclusion of
   gender, and the utility of moving beyond programmatic generalist
   approaches.},

Abstract = {Western governments counted on intelligence's assessments of Soviet
   military power, present and future. Initially these were mixtures of
   accuracy and exaggeration, with important effects on policy.
   Intelligence's quality subsequently improved, and Western defence
   procurement was kept in some contact with reality. Something of this may
   have been true on the Soviet side, in its much easier task of studying
   Western power. On the more important assessment of Soviet intentions, by
   contrast, Western intelligence was never able to develop reliable
   sources at the centre of the Soviet regime, and its contributions were
   secondary and confirmatory; while Soviet intelligence for its part
   selected and presented reports to emphasize the received views of
   Western hostility and threats.},

Title = {From Pragmatism to Dogmatism: European Union Governance, Policy
   Paradigms and Financial Meltdown},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},

Volume = {16},

Pages = {185-206},
Abstract = {Contemporary analyses commonly attribute the global credit crisis to
   faulty regulation. What have been the roots of these deficient rules,
   particularly in Europe, where rapid spill-over from US markets took
   policy makers and observers by surprise? This article focuses on
   regulatory liberalism as the paradigm guiding European Union (EU)
   regulation. It has dominated regulatory thinking for decades, but it has
   been implemented throughout Europe only since the mid-1990s. This shift
   can be traced to political institutions that have filtered policy ideas.
   EU financial reforms have pushed policy from pragmatism, under which it
   was adapted to political contingencies, to dogmatism, which adapts it to
   the intellectual exigencies of rigid policy paradigms. Inadvertently,
   reforms had created an epistemic community in which `professional' rule
   setters systematically ignored external criticisms. The
   institutionalised ambition to craft `intellectually sound' policy-rather
   than policy that simply `works' -generated rules that persistently
   ignored the financial markets' self-reflexivity and thereby aggravated
   the crisis.},

Abstract = {This article explores the influence of socio-economic discontent on the
   determination of decision makers to cut subsidies on natural gas for
   Russian households. The authors outline first the organisation of gas
   supplies and subsidies, and secondly the relationship between
   policymaking signals and public opinion concerning the minor price
   adjustments implemented so far. They then examine previous cases of
   discontent in other sectors, extrapolating implications for a major
   increase in gas prices. The conclusion is that Russian policymaking is
   characterised by a pattern of `two steps forward, one step back':
   decision makers are concerned about discontent, but nonetheless they
   ultimately press on with reform.},

Abstract = {The United States has played a leading role in the international
   population arena for more than four decades. In the early years, support
   among US policymakers for family planning assistance to developing
   countries was strong, bipartisan, and centered on slowing the growth of
   these countries' populations. Since the early 1980s, US assistance has
   been highly politicized and increasingly partisan. Some blame this shift
   on feminists, who sought a role for government based on supporting
   individual freedom and women's health, rather than achieving demographic
   goals. This article suggests that the political shift resulted in large
   part from the growing political influence of the Religious Right in the
   United States.},

Pages = {323-346},
Abstract = {Bulimia Nervosa constitutes a major social problem. There have, however,
   been few, if any, attempts to understand the distinctive features of
   this disorder from within the social sciences. Rather, the increasing
   prevalence of all forms of eating disorders are understood as a product
   of how the concepts of `femininity' and the `controlled body' are
   constructed within contemporary society. Bulimia and anorexia are
   ultimately seen to have their roots in the same social phenomena. While
   recognising the insights that the existing literature offers, we argue
   that in order to fully understand the rise of bulimia we must focus on
   the food system. More precisely, we must examine how the
   commercialisation of food preparation has led to a partial breakdown in
   meal structures and the rise of `everyday' bingeing. The rise of extreme
   forms of disordered consumption associated with bulimia can be related
   to broader changes in the eating regime.},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This article explores the ideas behind the promise of citizenship to
   children in Brazil. The human rights of children has become a very
   important issue in Brazil. This has been especially true since the
   inclusion of Article 227 in the 1988 Constitution referring to
   children's rights and the approval of the Statute on the Child and the
   Adolescent in 1990, less than a year after the ratification of the
   United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC). The article
   examines the changing discourse connected to what was promised and what
   the law actually accomplished. The conclusion focuses on some of the
   most relevant improvements affecting children's lives and some of the
   remaining challenges Brazilians face in the attempt to keep the promises
   made in the Constitution and the statute.},

Abstract = {This article compares the rates of intercountry adoption from 26 sending
   countries of the former Soviet Union and East Central Europe to 25
   receiving countries during the period 2000-2006. While our data confirm
   that countries adopting foreign children have significantly higher
   incomes than those from which they adopt, they show no significant
   discrepancy in birth rates between the two groups, with some sending
   countries actually having lower birth rates than their corresponding
   receiving countries. We then suggest that high sending rates result, not
   from a large `surplus' of children, but from institutions that can
   connect the sending countries' `surplus' children with prospective
   parents in receiving countries, and that the legacies of communist rule
   include such institutions.},

Abstract = {During the late 1990s, two simultaneous conversations occurred on
   Capitol Hill. One focused on a proposed US anti-trafficking law, the
   other on the apparent failure of US assistance policies in the former
   Soviet Union. It is the synchrony of these two political conversations
   that operates as the catalyst for my work here. I ask: Why did US
   legislators' commitment in the late 1990s to halt human trafficking
   coincide with clashes over the apparent failure of US Russia policy?
   Through close textual analyses of a series of Congressional hearings on
   both issues, I argue that these two simultaneous conversations were
   co-constitutive and, consequently, reveal much about the gendered
   dynamics governing the review, creation and implementation of US Russia
   policy at the end of the first post-Soviet decade.},

Abstract = {By comparing US and European efforts at market integration, this article
   questions the commonly held notion that Europe's market integration can
   continue without undermining its nation-based models of social
   protection. Three recent ECJ decisions (Viking, Laval and Ruffert) seem
   to confirm <link rid={''}b27{''}>Scharpf's (2002) assertion that the EU
   suffers from constitutional asymmetry. By contrasting these developments
   with the earlier integration of US markets - where a rough
   constitutional symmetry can be said to exist - the article concludes
   that constitutional symmetry, in itself, is probably insufficient to
   protect the sort of corporatist arrangements that undergird northern
   European social models.},

Abstract = {This article examines democratic practice after the revolution that
   brought an end to authoritarian dictatorship in Portugal in April 1974,
   taking the Portuguese case as an opportunity to theorize democratic
   practice and historical processes that shape its emergence. The argument
   stresses the distinctive features of democracy born in social revolution
   and the explanatory role of the partial inversion of social hierarchies
   and remaking of cultural repertoires in social revolutionary settings.
   The Portuguese case is compared to its larger neighbor, Spain, which
   moved from authoritarianism to democracy at roughly the same time
   following a process of change thoroughly unlike that of Portugal.
   Comparisons with other instances of postrevolutionary democracy and
   implications for more conventional democratic systems are also
   introduced. A central theme concerns the extent to which democracies
   attain the ideal of full political equality among citizens. This article
   asserts that democracies born in social revolution may approximate that
   ideal for reasons rooted in their historical pathways to representative
   government.},

Title = {Addressing the risk, reading the landscape: The role of agency in
   regulation},
Journal = {REGULATION \& GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Pages = {118-144},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The literature pertinent to regulation presents disparate views of the
   role of human agency in regulatory compliance. Some authors assume
   regulators' and regulatees' capacity for agency to be self-evident;
   others show that human agency may be constrained and as a consequence
   tends toward sustaining the legitimacy of their respective organizations
   rather than achieving the risk reduction goals prescribed by the
   regulatory regime. Drawing on Margaret Archer's work (among others'),
   this article explores how the agency of regulatory actors is critical to
   the regulatory project yet contingent. This contingency is explored
   through a comparative analysis of the regulatory responses to an
   industrial disaster and to counterterrorism efforts at seaports and
   airports in the wake of the 11 September 2001 ({''}9/11{''}) terrorist
   attacks. This analysis found that problem solving in the pursuit of
   regulatory goals was most effective when there was political support for
   the authority of the regulators and respect for their expertise and when
   the risk of concern could be narrowly defined. These conditions could
   also reap benefits at the worksite level. However, the capacity of
   regulators to mobilize resources, exert authority, and transform
   constraints into opportunities in order to reduce risk could be limited.
   Tight political control, limited knowledge of the environment to be
   regulated, and a potentially limitless exposure to risk meant that while
   agency could still be expressed, it was aimed at goals that included
   shoring up political legitimacy, enhancing personal authority, and
   allaying public concern.},

Title = {Women Who Win: Social Backgrounds, Paths to Power, and Political

Journal = {POLITICS \& GENDER},

Abstract = {Research on women in Latin American politics in the 1960s, 1970s, and
   1980s showed that very few women ran for and won political office and
   that those who did often did not fit the mold of the typical legislator.
   Yet significant cultural, social, and political changes have occurred
   over the past 30 years, and few studies have reexamined the types of
   women who win political office in the region today. In this article, I
   examine the social backgrounds, paths to power, and political ambition
   of women and men elected to national legislatures in Argentina,
   Colombia, and Costa Rica. I argue that women and men are likely to be
   more similar than different, given the tight constraints imposed on
   legislative candidates in democratic elections, and empirically examine
   this hypothesis with data from an original survey of legislators
   conducted in 2001-2. I find that, indeed, women and men are quite
   similar on an array of characteristics. Women who win elected office in
   Latin America today do so by playing the traditional, male-defined,
   political game.},

Abstract = {Few studies consider the effect of selection procedures on women's
   attainment of mayoral office. This article begins to fill this gap
   through analysis of more than 100 cities in California. The results show
   that selection method of mayor by popular vote exerts a substantial
   negative effect on whether a woman holds the office of mayor. The study
   then explores the negative effect of popular vote on women's attainment
   of mayoral office. There are two possibilities for exploring this
   effect: (1) popular vote creates more opportunity for the negative
   influence of stereotyping and role socialization on women's recruitment
   and election to mayoral office or (2) alternatively, popular vote
   increases the negative influence of sex differences in political
   motivation on women's attainment of mayoral office. The analyses support
   the second interpretation of the negative effect of popular vote on
   women's mayoral office-holding.},

Pages = {1-16},
Abstract = {Legitimacy is an important question to ask of the theory and practice of
   global governance. In this introduction, we make two propositions that
   are used to push thinking about these issues forward. Firstly, in
   analytical terms we outline a spectrum between legitimacy and
   legitimization which is aimed to capture the diverse set of approaches
   to this subject and to develop an engaged and reformist attitude that
   refuses the either-or distinction in favour of a methodologically
   pluralist logic of `both and'. Secondly, in political terms, we argue
   that discussions of legitimate global governance in both policy and
   academic circles can carry a `Trojan horse' quality whereby the
   ambiguity of the term might allow a point of intervention for more
   ambitious ethical objectives.},

   Capitalism framework, I argue that the varieties of capitalism
   literature is premised upon an institutional reductionism which
   necessitates the search for a more holistic approach. In brief, if we
   are to explain convincingly the evolution of national political
   economies, then we must acknowledge that varieties of capitalism are
   also varieties in capitalism. In particular, Antonio Gramsci's writings
   on common sense enable us to focus on the role of institutions as a
   historical force without abandoning the system of production that they
   are part of. I then provide an alternative explanation, compared to the
   varieties of capitalism literature, of the evolution of the Dutch and
   German political economies in order to demonstrate the advantages of the
   framework I develop.},

Abstract = {The British Broadcasting Corporation began recording, translating and
   publishing selected open radio broadcasts by foreign stations at the
   beginning of World War II. This open source intelligence, or `Osint',
   was provided to the United States starting in 1941, and America's own
   monitoring agencies reciprocated, albeit with certain key restrictions.
   By mid-1943 the BBC monitored 1.25 million broadcast words daily. At the
   war's end, questions arose in Whitehall about maintaining the BBC Osint
   operation, but an interagency coalition prevailed over the
   cost-conscious Treasury. US-UK Osint exchanges broadened after the war
   as part of a larger set of bilateral intelligence-sharing agreements.},

Abstract = {The coup against Mossadegh has often been described as the beginning of

   successful in getting rid of Mossadegh, its negative short-term and
   long-term consequences in Iran but also for the United States weigh
   heavily. Without thorough analysis why it nearly failed, the coup became
   a fatal catalyst for other interventions of the CIA that led to the Bay
   of Pigs disaster. If intelligence activities lose their moral dimension
   and if success is exclusively measured by `mission accomplished', in the
   end more will be lost than gained.},

Title = {Managing tied aid competition: Domestic politics, credible threats, and
   the Helsinki disciplines},
Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {18},
Number = {5},
Pages = {646-672},
Abstract = {During the eighties, industrialized countries increasingly used tied aid
   to circumvent international agreements restricting export subsidies for
   capital goods. The 1991 Helsinki Disciplines restricted the use of tied
   aid as a tool of export promotion. In export subsidy competition, donor
   states have a collective interest in avoiding spiraling escalation of
   spending; but, reaching international agreements is difficult when
   preferences over levels of expenditure vary between them. States that
   favor greater restraint on export subsidies can make subsidy competition
   prohibitively expensive by increasing their expenditures. However, this
   requires them to threaten substantial increases in spending when they
   have a demonstrated preference against doing so. Successful cooperation
   can only occur when governments with sufficient budgetary resources
   prefer subsidy reduction, but can mobilize domestic constituencies to
   make subsidy retaliation credible. Despite an apparent decline in
   international influence, the U. S. was able to compel accession to the
   Helsinki agreement by threatening substantial increases in its spending.
   This article uses a process-tracing approach to demonstrate the role of
   domestic politics in making that threat credible.},

Pages = {203-228},
Abstract = {In the context of the rise of radical right-wing parties in most
   European countries, the enduring absence of a far-right group in the
   Ukrainian parliament seems paradoxical. However, recent developments,
   namely the victory of the far-right `Freedom' Party (All-Ukrainian Union
   `Freedom', Vseukrayins'ke ob''ednannya `Svoboda') in the 2009 Ternopil
   regional elections seems to attest to the gradual revival of the radical
   right in Ukraine. The article considers the far-right legacy in Ukraine
   and the reasons why it failed in the post-Soviet period, and then
   focuses on the history of the Freedom Party and discusses its prospects
   at the national level.},

Title = {Generational Politics and Renewal of Leadership in the Moroccan Women's
   Movement},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL FEMINIST JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {13},
Number = {3},
Pages = {329-348},
Abstract = {This article uses generational analysis to discuss generational politics
   and renewal of leadership in the Moroccan women's movement. I argue that
   while assessments of the achievements and challenges of the movement
   abound within and outside academia, there is a remarkable silence around
   issues of generations and intergenerational relationships. How do recent
   gains in women's rights resonate with the younger generation in the
   country? How supportive and involved are young people in consolidating
   these gains? To explore these questions, this article draws on in-depth
   interviews with thirty-two young men and women. While the sample size is
   relatively small, the ethnographies suggest complex ways in which youth
   relate to the gains of the women's movement and women's rights activism.
   I have identified three broad trends in youth's attitudes: willed
   self-distantiation, cautious identification and strategic endorsement.
   They all suggest that the consolidation of recent gains and promotion of
   gender equity are difficult to achieve without a greater involvement and
   inclusion of the younger generation. I conclude that the current
   generation of women activists is challenged into re-connecting with
   youth and re-inventing their strategies to expand their appeal among the
   younger generation.},

Title = {Of executive preferences and societal constraints: The domestic politics
   of the transatlantic GMO dispute},
Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {18},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {506-529},
Abstract = {When the transatlantic trade dispute over genetically modified organisms
   came to a boil in the late 1990s and early 2000s it was widely expected
   to be highly conflictual. The United States was, almost universally,
   expected to challenge fundamentally the European Union's regulatory
   system for GMOs before the World Trade Organisation, and was equally
   universally expected to win the case. The EU was widely, albeit not
   universally, expected to refuse to comply with the ruling. In keeping
   with most of the international political economy literature on trade
   disputes, both of these expectations were rooted in assessments of
   societal demands for action and resistance. Both expectations, however,
   were confounded; the US (and its co-complainants) filed a narrow
   challenge focusing on the EU's failure to apply its own procedures; and
   the EU, somewhat falteringly, has resumed approvals of GMOs. Applying a
   two-level game framework, this article argues that this relatively
   cooperative outcome is explained by the executives of both polities
   exercising their autonomy to pursue policies closer to the preferences
   of the other polity than their median domestic constituents would have

Abstract = {This article investigates the political significance of the orientation
   of Western security relations around critical infrastructure (CI) and
   resilience planning. While the analysis is located in the International
   Political Sociology literature, it departs from recent biopolitical
   accounts of CIs and resilience. These accounts tend to present such
   apparatuses as closed, totalizing, and inevitably successful modes of
   governance. Rather, we argue that resilient CIs are open, vulnerable,
   and often absurd systems that continually falter, backfire, and often
   undermine themselves according to their own logic. By developing what we
   call a molecular security approach, we draw attention to the way in
   which life constantly evades capture. In this sense, we suggest, there
   is always an excess of life in biopolitics.},

Abstract = {Storytelling can be a process of seeking social equilibrium after
   violence. We examine this proposition through the stories of Ajok, an
   Acholi woman who was abducted by the rebel group, the Lord's Resistance
   Army (LRA) in northern Uganda and who was forced into marriage and
   motherhood. We consider how her stories contest discrimination by her
   neighbours and family since her return, creatively reinterpreting the
   past to defend her innocence and moral character throughout the war and
   to defend her rightful place in present society as an Acholi woman and
   mother. The article concludes by reflecting on the value of locally
   based and culturally relevant storytelling for survivors in the field
   and practice of transitional justice.},

Abstract = {Through an exchange between members of community-based organizations
   that document human rights violations in northwest Colombia and northern
   Uganda, this article examines multiple strategies of memory making in
   which an individual or a collective creates a safe social space to give
   testimony and re-story past events of violence or resistance. In
   settings of chronic insecurity, such acts constitute a reservoir of
   living documents to preserve memories, give testimony, contest impunity
   and convey the meaning, or the `truthfulness,' of survivors. The living
   archive disrupts conventional assumptions about what is documentation or
   witnessing in the field of transitional justice and introduces new
   interdisciplinary tools to the field with which to learn from and listen
   differently to survivors.},

Abstract = {The escalation of violence committed by the Revolutionary Armed Forces
   of Colombia (FARC) guerrillas against noncombatant civilians triggered a
   shift in the theoretical orientation of scholars who study Colombia's
   political economy. While previous explanations emphasized the
   sociopolitical ``grievances{''} underlying guerrilla activities, recent
   explanations emphasize the ``greed{''} motive, including guerrilla
   involvement in Colombia's illegal narcotics trade. In this article, the
   author posits an alternative explanation using Charles Tilly's theories
   of state formation to explain FARC activities in Caqueta, Colombia.
   Drawing from a longitudinal data set that documents the war making,
   state making, extraction, and protection activities of the FARC between
   1975 and 2007, in addition to historical sociological methods, the
   author finds that increases in FARC repression stem from the growing
   militarization and paramilitarization of the region, which pressured the
   FARC to extract resources from the local population in a way that no
   longer served that population's legitimate protection interests.},

Abstract = {During the policy process ahead of the 2008 renewal of the European
   Employment Strategy (EES), the European Commission's introduction of
   Flexicurity policies aroused much criticism. Researchers and trade
   unionists claimed that the Commission's embracing of the concept was a
   rhetorical manoeuvre rather than a genuine attempt to substantially
   revise the strategy. This article challenges these claims. Drawing on
   policy learning theory and discourse analysis, the Commission's policy
   recommendations prior to and past the introduction of Flexicurity are
   analysed. The main finding is that one of the policy components subsumed
   by the EES - modern social security systems - has undergone considerable
   revision. Moreover, the article argues that this revision possibly stems
   from a learning process. In relation to the literature on the open
   method of co-ordination (OMC), the study therefore adds that the OMC's
   learning effects should be assessed not only on the national level. The
   European institutions - in this case, the Commission - can also be
   subject to learning.},

Abstract = {Turkey has made significant efforts to fulfil requested accession
   criteria through socio-economic and cultural convergence with EU Member
   States. However, Turkey's eventual membership in the EU depends on the
   support of current EU citizens. This article therefore analyses
   citizens' attitudes towards Turkish accession in the 27 EU Member
   States. The analysis shows that a clear majority of citizens reject the
   idea of Turkey joining the EU. Four factors work rather well to explain
   this rejection: the economic benefit of Turkish accession, cultural
   differences, political ideology and general attitudes towards the EU.},

Abstract = {Patrimonialism has been used to explain the ``backwardness{''} of Middle
   Eastern states, their ``lacks.{''} Patrimonialism, however, may
   undermine its own insights by creating false binaries and false
   histories. The author suggests family/families as a point of departure
   and political familism as a conceptual step toward reframing analysis of
   state/citizen relationships in Lebanon. Political familism refers to the
   deployment of family institutions, ideologies, idioms (idiomatic
   kinship), practices, and relationships by citizens to activate their
   demands in relation to the state and by state actors to mobilize
   practical and moral grounds for governance based on a civic myth of
   kinship and public discourse that privileges family. Political familism
   addresses the processes by which states and citizens mutually constitute
   a set of public practices that reproduce the privileged position of
   ``family,{''} even as specific family relations and practices diverge
   from discursive presumptions.},

Abstract = {Over time, public policy changes have strengthened the private child
   support system while reducing access to public support-welfare. Given
   the especially limited availability of public support, nonresident
   fathers' economic contributions through child support can play an
   important role in helping children to avoid poverty. In this article,
   the authors review evidence on nonresident fathers' ability to pay
   support, provide an overview of the way child support policies affect
   disadvantaged fathers, and propose new directions for child support
   policy. The authors argue that the current work-focused safety net,
   which aims to require and help to enable disadvantaged mothers to work,
   creates a context in which government should similarly require and help
   to enable all fathers, even those who are disadvantaged, to work and pay
   child support. However, reforms are needed to make this a realistic
   expectation, given many fathers' limited employment options and complex
   families.},

Abstract = {In this article, we untangle the relationships among law, power and
   justice as they impact on the lives of ordinary Rwandans brought into
   contact with the state and local officials through the gacaca process.
   Drawing on 37 life-history interviews conducted in 2006, we find that
   gacaca reinforces a particular version of postgenocide justice that
   renders the average Rwandan citizen largely powerless over individual
   processes of reconciliation while serving to maintain a climate of fear
   and insecurity in their everyday lives. Locating the Rwandan case more
   broadly, we caution that a preoccupation with harmonizing traditional
   justice with international standards must look beyond forms of legality.
   While gacaca may be legally acceptable in a harmonized way, it is both a
   product and a producer of relations of state power that operate to
   impact negatively on conflict-affected individuals who bear the brunt of
   government-led initiatives to promote justice and reconciliation.},

Abstract = {Are a hearts and minds approach, reliable intelligence and cultural
   awareness the most important ingredients for success in
   counter-insurgency, as present prescriptions claim? This article focuses
   on some of the notable non-kinetic aspects of counter-insurgency and
   aims to critically reflect on their role and importance. It argues that
   the hearts and minds ideas, the emphasis on intelligence and cultural
   awareness are often problematic both for their methodological
   foundations and empirical weight. The article closes by identifying
   avenues for further research.},

Abstract = {A growing number of scholars argue that the development of the common
   security and defence policy (CSDP) should be analysed as the
   institutionalization of a system of security governance. Although
   governance approaches carry the promise of a sophisticated, empirically
   grounded picture of CSDP, they have been criticized for their lack of
   attention to power. This is because governance approaches focus on
   institutional rules and ideas rather than the social structure that
   underpins them. To refine the notion of security governance, this
   article analyses co-operation patterns through social network analysis.
   Confirming the governance image, it maps out a complex constellation of
   CSDP actors that features cross-border and cross-level ties between
   different national and EU policy actors. It is also found, however, that
   CSDP is dominated by a handful of traditional state actors - in
   particular, Brussels-based national ambassadors - who retain strategic
   positions vis-a-vis weaker supranational and non-state actors. These
   actors are not giving up on state power, but reconstituting it at the
   supranational level.},

Abstract = {Assessments of the CIA's role in Latin America during the 1950s have
   tended to focus predominantly on the twin case studies of Guatemala and
   Cuba. Consequently, the Agency's role - and, more broadly, that of its
   head Allen Dulles has come to be seen as one obsessed with covert action
   and relatively unimportant in terms of policy discussions. Dulles, in
   fact, has been portrayed as an unwilling and disinterested participant
   in policy discussions. The present article will challenge those
   assertions by suggesting that, by examining Dulles's role in the
   Eisenhower administration's discussions on Latin America, a different
   picture emerges - one that paints Dulles as an active and rational
   participant, and which raises important questions for our understanding
   of the CIA's role during the Eisenhower era.},

Title = {From the Right of Asylum to Migration Management: The Legal-Political
   Construction of `a Refugee' in the Post-Communist Czech Republic},
Journal = {EUROPE-ASIA STUDIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {63},
Number = {5},
Pages = {789-806},
Abstract = {International law defines refugees and their rights and the legal
   obligations of states that receive them. However, the actual formulation
   and implementation of asylum law are based on the politically and
   historically contingent constructions of the status of `refugee' that
   are determined largely by nation states. This article analyses the
   legal-political construction of `refugee' in the post-communist Czech
   Republic during and after its accession to the European Union. It
   examines the role of the state and the non-governmental sector and
   explains the gradual shift that took place towards treating asylum as a
   matter of migration management rather than a fundamental human right.},

Title = {THE IMPACT OF ``FORGIVING{''} INTRODUCTIONS ON THE REPORTING OF
   SENSITIVE BEHAVIOR IN SURVEYS THE ROLE OF SOCIAL DESIRABILITY RESPONSE
   STYLE AND DEVELOPMENTAL STATUS},
Journal = {PUBLIC OPINION QUARTERLY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {75},

Month = {WIN},
Abstract = {The use of ``forgiving'' introductions is generally recommended for
   survey questions about sensitive behavior. However, research results on
   the effectiveness of this technique are inconsistent. This study tested
   whether the effectiveness of forgiving introductions depends on
   individual differences in respondents' social desirability response
   style (SDRS) and developmental status. In an online survey among 3,802
   respondents aged 12 to 89 years, we conducted an experiment with a
   one-factor (forgiving introduction vs. no forgiving introduction)
   between-subjects design. Use of sexual media content was our target
   sensitive behavior. Including a forgiving introduction had no main
   effect on the reporting of sensitive behavior overall, but depended on
   respondents' SDRS: when a forgiving introduction was included in the
   questions, respondents high in SDRS reported more sensitive behavior
   than did respondents low in SDRS. This effect further depended on
   respondents' developmental status. Forgiving introductions increased the
   reporting of sensitive behavior among adolescents and emerging adults
   (i.e., 12- to 25-year-olds) high in SDRS, but caused little differences
   in the reporting of such behavior among adults (i.e., people older than
   25).},

Abstract = {This article presents a critique of Will Kymlicka's theory of
   multiculturalism. It examines Kymlicka's theoretical distinction between
   mononational and multinational states and his empirical examples that
   support this theory: Germany as an example of a mononational state and
   Switzerland as an example of a multinational state. By means of a
   content analysis of constitutions, it demonstrates that Danes and Sorbs
   should be characterised as national minorities in Germany, whereas the
   French-and Italian-speaking communities of Switzerland do not constitute
   nations. The distinction between mono-and multinational states proposed
   by Kymlicka does not hold for Germany and Switzerland, and hence must be
   approached anew, theoretically as well as empirically.},

Abstract = {This article extends the analysis of political parties in electorally
   volatile and organizationally weak party systems by evaluating two
   implications centered on legislative voting behavior. First, it examines
   whether disunity prevails where weakness of programmatic and electoral
   commonalities abound. Second, it analyzes whether inchoate party systems
   weaken the ability of government parties to control the congressional
   agenda. The empirical analysis centers on Peru, a classic example of a
   weakly institutionalized party system, and how its legislative parties
   compare to those of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and the United States. The
   results lend support to the view that lower unity characterizes weakly
   institutionalized settings. The agenda-setting power of government
   parties, however, appears to be influenced more by the majority status
   of the government than by the level of party system
   institutionalization.},

Abstract = {This article examines the role of linkage politics in revitalizing the
   largely ineffective UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD). I
   argue that the UNCCD Secretariat has taken a leadership role in driving
   a regime linkage agenda that has focused disproportionately on linkages
   to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). By comparing
   the UNCCD Secretariat's attempts to build desertification-mitigation and
   desertification-adaptation linkages, I propose three criteria for
   predicting whether regime linkages are likely to benefit source regimes
   (here the UNCCD): the linkage's contribution to source governance goals;
   the credibility of knowledge presented by the source regime; and the
   linkage's political feasibility for the target regime. This analysis
   shows secretariats to be important actors in linkage politics whose
   actions can lead to both beneficial and harmful outcomes for the regimes
   they are intended to serve. Finally, by asking whether desertification
   issues that overlap with climate change might be better addressed under
   the UNFCCC, 1 question when regime overlap indicates regime redundancy
   and warrants regime death.},

Abstract = {This article aims to analyze the impact of domestic politics and
   international changes that influence Brazilian positions regarding
   regional integration processes in South America, particularly the
   Southern Common Market, Mercosur. The dynamics of the international
   system and their impact on the evolution of the elite's perception of
   the role the country should play in the world are important variables
   for understanding these positions. The state's postures in relation to
   integration were and are based on a real interest, but this interest is
   also linked with the objective of ensuring better conditions for
   participation in other international arenas. Starting with the
   hypothesis that transformations in the international setting have
   strongly influenced Brazil's positioning, the elements of continuity and
   change in the country's behavior toward Mercosur are identified, with
   domestic politics as the main explanation.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY EUROPEAN STUDIES},

Pages = {409-427},
Abstract = {This article considers women's and men's roles in the labour market and
   the different ways in which care-work is shared in Slovenia and the
   Czech Republic. Effective policy measures can prevent parenting of young
   children becoming one of the greatest risks of falling into poverty. The
   authors discuss to what extent the prevailing ideals of care influence
   the policies in relation to parenting as a source of social risks. The
   two post-communist countries-Slovenia and Czech Republic-show different
   trajectories in the development of childcare policies. The article shows
   that Czech social policies have reproduced the traditional ideal of
   full-time mother-care without preventing poverty and social exclusion of
   families with young children of pre-school age. In contrast to this,
   policies in Slovenia support female employment, with the ideal of
   professional childcare alongside parental care-sharing, which also helps
   to improve the economic situation of families with small children.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN SECURITY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Pages = {117-126},
Abstract = {This article discusses Russian perceptions of and attitudes toward the
   North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Russia has historically
   disliked and mistrusted NATO, seeing it as the primary threat to its
   international aspirations; in practice Russia pursues a dual policy. Its
   harsh condemnation of NATO has not stopped it from cooperating in
   selected areas of mutual interest. The most important among them is
   support for NATO's military operations in Afghanistan. The recent
   rejuvenation of relations between the west and Moscow is known as the
   strategic `reset', meaning a return to diplomatic contacts and limited
   cooperation regardless of disagreements over the invasion of Georgia and
   Moscow's other recent international transgressions. The reset in
   NATO-Russia relations has only tactical significance, however.
   Cooperation will take place on a limited basis, but a genuine reset in
   mutual relations must wait for a reset in Russia's political and
   strategic priorities.},

   little like trying to interpret the univariate results of a single
   survey item when there are no other items with which to compare it and
   few other variables to which it might relate. Rather than attempting
   that impossible task, this essay reflects briefly on what indicators
   there are for how POQ was used during my seven years as editor; more
   importantly, on the articles published in those years that are memorable
   in one way or another to the editor; and most importantly, on how my
   addition of Poll Reviews as a new section of the journal reinforced the
   importance of the connection, but also the distinction, between survey
   results and public opinion.},

Journal = {PUBLIC OPINION QUARTERLY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {75},
Number = {4},
Pages = {761-778},

Abstract = {Using 1996-2000 General Social Survey responses from non-Hispanic
   whites, we test claims of earlier researchers that conservative
   Protestant theology encourages adherents to prefer individualistic
   rather than structuralist explanations for racial inequality.
   Methodological issues are central to this research, as special attention
   is given to the comparisons on which conclusions rely. We use two
   alternate definitions of conservative Protestantism: one based on
   denominational preference, the other on self-identification and beliefs.
   Conservative Protestants defined in each fashion are compared to five
   other religious categories, and results are reported with and without
   controls for such background characteristics as education and region of
   residence. Findings indicate the need for important qualification to
   claims about the influence of religion on attributions for racial
   inequality. Among the large group of denominationally defined
   conservative Protestants, attributions prove to be minimally different
   from those of other demographically similar Christians. Self-identified
   conservative Protestants are more individualistic and less structural
   than other white Christians, even after controls, but this group is
   small. The primary attitudinal divide is between Christian groups and
   the more racially progressive non-Christians-Jews, adherents of other
   faiths, and the unaffiliated.},

Abstract = {Theorists posit that a public-unlike a mass of individuals-forms
   opinions through awareness of multiple viewpoints and recognition of
   opposition in a polity. Whether individuals pursue information on
   others' political preferences is another matter. While some are
   motivated to seek as much information as possible, others seek
   information that supports their own preference. This differential
   pattern of awareness has implications for individuals' assessment of
   collective preferences. This article extends recent research on
   motivated reasoning to test whether accuracy goals (i.e., reaching
   correct conclusions) and directional goals (i.e., reaching preferred
   conclusions) affect perceptions of majority preferences. Results show
   that motivated reasoning affects overestimates of support, of both
   national-level opinion and modal opinion in discussion groups, even
   after controlling for partisan strength, demographics, news exposure,
   political knowledge, and interest. Implications for considered public
   opinion are discussed in the conclusion.},

Abstract = {This article revisits the notion of linguistic diversity and its
   function as a political cleavage. It argues that people's linguistic and
   cultural attitudes are influenced not only by their communicative
   practice but also by their identification with particular language(s) -
   even though they may not always communicate in that language. In
   Ukraine, from which my empirical data is drawn, language identity is
   embodied in the concept of native language that was imposed by the
   Soviet institutionalisation of ethnicity and came to mean ethnic
   belonging as much as linguistic practice. My analysis of survey data
   demonstrates that native language is a powerful predictor of people's
   attitudes and policy preferences with regard to both language use and
   other socially divisive issues, such as foreign policy and historical
   memory. This finding should also be applicable to other societies with a
   large-scale discrepancy between language practice and identity.},

Abstract = {The dangers that future climate change poses to physical, biological,
   and economic systems are accounted for in analyses of risk and
   increasingly figure in decision-making about responses to climate
   change. Yet the potential cultural and social impacts of climate change
   have scarcely been considered. In this article we bring the risks
   climate change poses to cultures and social systems into consideration
   through a focus on places-those local material and symbolic contexts
   that give meaning and value to peoples' lives. By way of examples, the
   article reviews evidence on the observed and projected impacts of
   climate change on the Arctic and Pacific island atoll nations. It shows
   that impacts may result in the loss of many unique natural and cultural
   components of these places. We then argue that the risk of irreversible
   loss of places needs to be factored into decision-making on climate
   change. The article then suggests ways forward in decision-making that
   recognizes these non-market and non-instrumental metrics of risk, based
   on principles of justice and recognition of individual and community
   identity.},

Abstract = {In the 1960s, Senegal's first national leaders narrowly defined how
   artists should practise nationalism through their work, particularly in
   the weaving craft, and enforced this definition through selective state
   patronage. This ideological and stylistic control echoed state control
   over economic markets. As subsequent administrations have restructured
   the economy, leading to a powerful informal business sector, so have
   independent contemporary weavers redefined artistic nationalism. Using
   ethnographic and archival interviews, this article examines nationalism
   in Senegalese weaving, placing the perspectives of contemporary weavers
   alongside those of two arts administrators who helped to develop
   state-sponsored programmes in the 1960s and 1970s. I argue that
   contemporary weavers find inspiration from Senegalese nationalism of the
   mid-twentieth century, yet have modified it to encompass individual
   expression. Because definitions of artistic nationalism in Senegal have
   shifted, it remains a significant ideology within the national arts
   scene.},

Volume = {17},
Number = {2},
Pages = {272-290},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In both popular discourse and many academic works, the existence of
   national identity is largely taken as given. Although researchers
   disagree on whether national identities are modern or perennial, and how
   best to gauge the intensity of identification with a particular nation,
   there is near unanimity on the view that national identities are real
   and perceptible entities. In contrast to this view I argue not only that
   there was no national identity before modernity but also that there is
   little empirical evidence for the existence of national identities in
   the modern age either. While it is obvious that many individuals show
   great affinity for their nations and often express sincere devotion to
   the `national cause', none of these are reliable indicators of the
   existence of a durable, continuous, stable and monolithic entity called
   `national identity'. To fully understand the character of popular
   mobilisation in modernity it is paramount to refocus our attention from
   the slippery and non-analytical idiom of `identity' towards
   well-established sociological concepts such as `ideology' and
   `solidarity'. In particular, the central object of this research becomes
   the processes through which large-scale social organisations
   successfully transform earnest micro-solidarity into an all-encompassing
   nationalist ideology.},

Title = {A New Beginning? Does the Union for the Mediterranean Herald a New
   Functionalist Approach to Co-operation in the Region?},
Journal = {MEDITERRANEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Pages = {155-169},
Abstract = {The UfM is building on an already extensive policy acquis to support
   regionalism and regionalization. Regionalism is understood here as the
   elaboration of formal trade and economic integration agreements between
   governments; whereas regionalization refers to the development of
   relations beyond the governmental level (trade, FDI, joint ventures
   between businesses; and links between other elements of society). These
   interconnected processes play a major role in the EU's vision for the
   region. The EMP envisages bilateral and multilateral free trade
   agreements while the ENP encourages further regulatory harmonization.
   There has also been strong proactive support for regionalization with
   aid and co-operation policies to foster co-operation between businesses,
   technocrats, social organizations and cultural and educational
   institutions. Apart from developing common institutions, the UfM is less
   directly focused on economic regionalism, and more on a form of
   regionalization via support for joint projects in core sectors. There
   appears to be a kind of functionalist ethos of flexible, bottom-up
   project formation. This poses important questions. Does the UfM signal a
   break with the essentially neo-liberal thrust of EU policy and a move to
   a more functionalist and interventionist approach to supporting
   development and co-operation? What is the potential for this to foster
   regionalization and development in the area? From the information
   available, there is little reason to believe that the UfM will be more
   successful than previous efforts at encouraging regionalization. In
   terms of our understanding of it, we must bear in mind that the UfM does
   not replace the EU's core `trade and integration' policy. Therefore it
   is more of an addition to EU policy than a change of direction.},

Title = {Turkey's Path to EU Membership: An Historical Institutionalist
   Perspective},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY EUROPEAN STUDIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {19},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {511-521},
Abstract = {Scholars have drawn heavily on new institutionalist approaches in the
   study of comparative European politics and European integration.
   However, these approaches have been neglected in the study of Turkey-EU
   relations, resulting in a significant gap in the academic literature. In
   particular, the extant literature fails to question the significance of
   domestic political institutional settings and also fails to ask what
   role Turkey's National Security Council (MGK) played in shaping Turkey's
   path towards EU membership. The Historical Institutionalist approach,
   and the associated concepts of path dependence and punctuated
   equilibrium, can help address these failures by highlighting the
   importance of two significant phases of Turkey's European policy: the
   MGK's tendency to rule through states of emergency and its
   incompatibility with EU membership criteria (1983-1997); and the
   curtailment of the MGK's powers and the EU's decision to begin accession
   negotiations (1997-2004). To substantiate the value of historical
   institutionalism, I will first discuss the utility of the approach and
   justify its selection as a framework for explaining Turkey-EU relations.
   I will then discuss, in general terms, the ways in which institutions
   shape political action and maintain long periods of stasis. I will then
   demonstrate the utility of the concept of path dependence in researching
   the interaction between the MGK's use of state of emergency legislation
   and Turkey's path towards EU membership. The final part argues that the
   changes in the MGK and in Turkey-EU relations can be best understood
   with the historical institutionalist concept of punctuated equilibrium},

Abstract = {Using the Europeanization concept as framework of analysis, this article
   examines the interaction of Germany's national policy with Europe's
   collective foreign policy in a central policy area - the
   Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It argues that Germany's conflict
   resolution policy evolved in close interaction with Europe's common
   foreign policy. Germany has relied on EPC/CFSP as a framework to pursue
   national objectives and foreign policy priorities more effectively. What
   is more, four decades of European foreign policy cooperation toward the
   Israeli-Palestinian conflict also impacted on the substance and
   practices of Germany's national foreign policy, providing a cover for a
   more `even-handed' and active policy.},

Abstract = {When he was a soldier during the Spanish Civil War, George Orwell ran
   away-not from the enemy who shot him in the neck, but from ostensible
   friends on his own side. The war began in 1936, when the Spanish drove
   out their king and elected a government of centrists and leftists.
   However, right-wing fascists led by General Francisco Franco refused to
   accept the results of the election and rebelled. The three-year war that
   followed has been called a ``rehearsal for World War II{''} because it
   pitted elected republican forces aided by communists (especially the
   Soviet Union) against a fascist army aided by the dictatorships of
   Benito Mussolini of Italy and Adolf Hitler of Germany. Most notably, the
   Germans sent the Condor Legion to fight on the side of their Spanish
   fascist brothers. The Legion totaled less than 10,000 men at any one
   time, but because of rotation policies it gave over 16,000 German
   soldiers combat experience in this live-action ``rehearsal{''} for World
   War II. The Legion, which included air elements, was notorious for the
   1937 killing of civilians in the northern Spanish town of Guernica. One
   of Pablo Picasso's most famous paintings, Guernica, commemorates the
   destruction of this Basque town.
   To counter the foreign fascist troops, many citizens of countries such
   as the United States, Great Britain, France, and Poland formed
   international brigades-units of volunteers often recruited by local
   communist parties. Orwell, an idealistic young man with some military
   experience (he had been a British police officer in colonial Burma),
   volunteered and fought bravely on the republican side until he was
   wounded.
   Unfortunately for the Spanish people, the communists who came to
   dominate the republican side were as dictatorial and undemocratic as the
   fascists were on the other side. When Orwell pointed this out, the
   communists, always reluctant to accept constructive criticism
   graciously, decided that they would be better off if he were dead. So
   Orwell decamped back to England.
   The Spanish Civil War ended in 1937 with the victory of the fascists
   under Franco, who would continue to rule as a dictator until his death
   in 1975. Orwell fought two wars in Spain: (1) the hot war against the
   Fascists and (2) the cold war against the communists. He lost both his
   wars, wounded in the first and forced to flee home by the second.
   Nevertheless, the wars were a pivotal influence on Orwell. As he wrote
   in his essay, ``Why I Write{''} (1946), `` The Spanish war and other
   events of 1936-37 turned the scale and thereafter I knew where I stood.
   Every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been
   written, directly or indirectly, against totalitarianism and for
   democratic socialism, as I understand it.{''} Thus it was Orwell's
   participation in the Spanish Civil War that inspired the two most
   devastating and influential critiques of rule under totalitarian
   governments, Animal Farm (1945) and Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949)-proof
   positive that if you don't kill critical writers, they will likely
   continue to puncture you with their pen.},

Abstract = {The literature on welfare state legitimacy generally views economic
   egalitarianism and support for the welfare state as closely related
   phenomena that can be measured by means of scales that are considered
   highly interchangeable. This research note argues that economic
   egalitarianism does not necessarily coincide with support for the
   welfare state. Moreover, our findings point out that, especially among
   those with the lowest levels of education, economic egalitarianism is
   related to anti-welfarism-a highly critical view of the welfare state.
   Based on an analysis of recent Dutch representative survey data (2006),
   this article aims to find out whether there are in fact two ideological
   dimensions-support for the welfare state and economic egalitarianism.
   Moreover, it is shown that both dimensions can be explained differently.
   Although both ideological dimensions are rooted in economic security,
   support for the welfare state also is rooted in feelings of anomie.},

Abstract = {This article deals with Swiss nationalism and Swiss nation-building. Its
   main thesis is that Switzerland cannot accurately be described as either
   a nation or a non-nation but is something in between, and could thus
   best be characterised as a `fractured' nation. Switzerland has
   experienced some powerful nationalist moments, from the creation of the
   Swiss state in 1848 to the last few decades. Yet this recurrent
   nationalism among the Swiss, considered alongside their more traditional
   reluctance to consider themselves a nation, make Switzerland a peculiar
   object: a `fractured' nation. This flawed process of nation-building in
   turn reveals some basic characteristics of all nations - inherent
   artificiality, and the tremendous efforts undertaken to hide it.
   Switzerland could be considered an unfinished, incomplete nation, and
   this is precisely why its study can be interesting for scholars of
   nations and nationalism.},

Abstract = {Deliberative theorists emphasize that citizens' capacity to become
   informed when given a motive and the opportunity to participate in
   politics is important for democratic citizenship. We assess this
   capacity among citizens using a deliberative field experiment. In the
   summer of 2006, we conducted a field experiment in which we recruited
   twelve current members of the U.S. Congress to discuss immigration
   policy with randomly drawn small groups of their constituents. We find
   that constituents demonstrate a strong capacity to become informed in
   response to this opportunity. The primary mechanism for knowledge gains
   is subjects' increased attention to policy outside the context of the
   experiment. This capacity for motivated learning seems to be spread
   widely throughout the population, in that it is unrelated to prior
   political knowledge.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we discuss a range of issues concerning developing
   country participation in current global climate change mitigation
   negotiations, especially India and China. We argue that the problem of
   redefining `common yet differentiated responsibilities' in a way which
   allows developing countries room to pursue their individual development
   goals while still achieving the necessary level of carbon mitigation is
   central to the debate. The choice of negotiating instruments, effective
   technology transfer and financial support, and other related issues have
   been raised principally by China and India, and may also be raised by
   several other countries. Kyoto non-compliance by Annex 1 countries will
   also greatly impact the negotiating power of China and India and other
   developing countries. We conclude that, once basic principles are
   clearly defined, the greatest incentive for China and India to
   participate in climate change negotiations is the prospect of future
   negotiating rounds that can be linked to a large number of climate
   change related issues, such as intellectual property, the potential for
   financial transfers and trade/market access.},

Abstract = {American history textbooks for the USA's public schools act as
   quasi-official loci for the renegotiation of national identity and are,
   as such, subject to much controversy. The choice of heroes and the way
   in which textbooks depict them display the interplay between competing
   visions of popular ethno-history and scholarly historiography. This
   article examines contemporary renegotiation of the national narrative
   through an analysis of the evolving representation of the USA's two most
   prominent traditional national heroes - George Washington and Abraham
   Lincoln - in history textbooks for elementary-school students published
   from the early 1980s to 2003. This period marks the development of the
   multiculturalist movement and its subsequent conservative backlash, with
   debates intensifying in the wake of the events of 11 September 2001.},

Abstract = {Efforts to find empirical evidence that campaign money impacts
   policymaking choices have offered scant support for interest group
   influence. A possible explanation is that the hypothesis that those
   receiving campaign monies should adjust their policy choices to favor
   their donor requires the untenable assumption that interest groups and
   legislators can implement contracts. We develop a new, alternative,
   model in which legislators and interest groups cannot engage in any form
   of contracting, and legislators care about both the policy and
   fundraising implications of their policy choices. In our model, an
   interest group gives only to those it believes shares its policy
   preferences. Nonetheless, we show that the group's giving impacts
   incumbent policy choices. Importantly, when groups ideologically match,
   the relationship between actual contributions and bias is not
   straightforward. As long as a group is uncertain about a member's
   primitive policy preference, it can influence her policymaking even when
   it contributes to her challenger or abstains from giving altogether.},

Abstract = {This article questions the persistent view of the Balkans as a place
   where ethnic and national identities were sustained over centuries of
   Ottoman and Habsburg rule. It concentrates on the Serbian historical
   narrative and challenges the picture of the Serbs as an ethnic community
   who gathered around their bards and priests to cherish memories of their
   ancient kingdom. Rather, it is argued that we can speak of two competing
   narratives, one ecclesiastical and the other vernacular, neither of
   which was even remotely national or historical, and that the Serbs, as
   we know them today, are not the product of centuries of cultural
   formation but were carved out of a Slavic mass as were the Croats,
   relatively recently.},

Abstract = {Plumper and Troeger (2007) propose a three-step procedure for the
   estimation of a fixed effects (FE) model that, it is claimed, ``provides
   the most reliable estimates under a wide variety of specifications
   common to real world data.{''} Their fixed effects vector decomposition
   (FEVD) estimator is startlingly simple, involving three simple steps,
   each requiring nothing more than ordinary least squares (OLS). Large
   gains in efficiency are claimed for cases of time-invariant and slowly
   time-varying regressors. A subsequent literature has compared the
   estimator to other estimators of FE models, including the estimator of
   Hausman and Taylor (1981) also (apparently) with impressive gains in
   efficiency. The article also claims to provide an efficient estimator
   for parameters on time-invariant variables (TIVs) in the FE model. None
   of the claims are correct. The FEVD estimator simply reproduces
   (identically) the linear FE (dummy variable) estimator then substitutes
   an inappropriate covariance matrix for the correct one. The consistency
   result follows from the fact that OLS in the FE model is consistent. The
   ``efficiency{''} gains are illusory. The claim that the estimator
   provides an estimator for the coefficients on TIVs in an FE model is
   also incorrect. That part of the parameter vector remains unidentified.
   The ``estimator{''} relies upon a strong assumption that turns the FE
   model into a type of random effects model.},

Abstract = {Semi-presidentialism is a vague term which may refer to several
   different forms of government. This paper explores only one special type
   of semi-presidentialism, and shows that, even under similar
   institutional arrangements, actual practices may differ greatly. The two
   cases, France and Taiwan, share the basic features of such a system,
   though the French president has more powers than his counterpart in
   Taiwan. But interestingly, when the president's party/coalition has been
   in the minority in parliament, the French president has frequently
   chosen to compromise and to cohabitate with a prime minister supported
   by the parliamentary majority, while his counterpart in Taiwan has
   decided to confront the parliament by forming a minority government. As
   argued in the paper, this can be accounted for by strategic behavior on
   the part of the president and the parliamentary majority in manipulating
   the loophole created by such a system. History and the nature of social
   cleavages have something to do with it as well.},

Abstract = {There is widespread consensus that effective leadership will be required
   in order to successfully address the climate change challenge. Presently
   there are a number of self-proclaimed climate change leaders, but
   leadership is a relationship between leaders and followers. An actor
   aspiring to be a leader needs to be recognized as such. Despite its
   fundamental importance for leadership relationships, the demand side of
   the leadership equation has been comparatively neglected by past
   research. In this study we are looking for leaders by analyzing the
   perceptions of climate change leadership among UNFCCC COP-14
   participants. Our results show that the climate change leadership mantle
   will have to be worn by more than one actor. Among the leadership
   candidates the EU was most widely recognized as a leader, however, only
   a small minority reported that they saw the EU as the only leader. The
   data also show that the US and the G77 thus far have failed to impress
   potential followers and it was China that clearly emerged as the second
   strongest leadership candidate.},

Abstract = {In 2010, the EU agreed its third five year programme for internal
   security, with the Stockholm Programme building on pre-existing
   arrangements from Tampere and The Hague. This article seeks, firstly, to
   highlight the nature of the problem that has confronted the EU in the
   area of internal security, by exploring a range of thematic concerns
   regarding both the institutional and conceptual construction of the EU's
   internal security regime, from the lack of an effective statistical
   analysis into the nature of the problem confronting the member states to
   the continued fragmentation of the European level as a practical venue
   for policy-making. Having considered the consequences of these
   continuing structural flaws, in terms of both the EU's wider credibility
   and legitimacy as an actor in this key security field, the second half
   of the article proceeds to critically appraise the solutions contained
   both within the 2010 Stockholm Programme and the Treaty of Lisbon.
   Having considered both, it will be argued that, at best, the `Stockholm
   solution' simply papers over pre-existing cracks, leaving the EU with a
   continued credibility gap in this important and developing area of
   co-operation.},

Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Pages = {39-57},
Abstract = {Mediterranean policies are necessary for the European Union as a whole.
   However, a game of relations and interests exists, where different
   actors attempt to position themselves on the map. Some are able to
   occupy a central role, while others are pushed into the background. The
   Union for the Mediterranean (UfM) is a good example of this, with France
   being the visible head but not able to decide all questions of shape and
   content. This contribution addresses the kind of role played by France
   during the process of presentation and development of the UfM, focusing
   on the relative degrees of individualism and co-operation at different
   stages of this Mediterranean project.},

Abstract = {They are America's sports cathedrals. Mammoth in size and grandiose in
   design, baseball and football stadiums have become centerpieces of the
   urban landscape in the United States. Unlike the towering religious
   cathedrals that have marked American and European cities for centuries,
   stadiums are generally not venerated for their historic value. Instead,
   they are often denigrated for being too old and out of date to
   accommodate how modern games are played and viewed. In the sporting
   world, newer and bigger beats historic and intimate.
   Nowhere was this scenario more true than in the case of the downfall of
   venerable Yankee Stadium in 2009. Built in 1923, New York's Yankee
   Stadium evolved as the most famous and historic sports site in the
   nation. In addition to being the home of the most successful sports
   franchise in U.S. history, Yankee Stadium has hosted events featuring
   Pope John Paul II and Nelson Mandela, and was the site of the famous Joe
   Louis-Max Schmeling Depressionera boxing match. Even with this
   unparalleled history, the stadium met the wrecking ball in 2009 when a
   New Yankee Stadium was opened across the street in the Bronx.
   The new Yankee Stadium, though designed to look like the original one,
   had at least one big difference from its predecessor: The public paid
   about half a billion dollars for it. Back in 1923, the original Yankee
   Stadium's \$2.4 million price tag was covered completely by the Yankees'
   owners. During the construction of the new stadium in the Bronx, the
   Yankees ownership did pony up about half the construction costs (\$400
   million) but turned to the public to cover the rest. Far from an
   exception, the public financing of Yankee Stadium is the latest in a
   series of cases in which the public has been asked to cover the costs of
   construction for sports venues that host privately owned sports
   franchises and their highly compensated athletes. And just as the games
   in the new stadiums display the finest of sports strategy, the deals
   that were made to pay for the new digs involved an equal amount of
   strategic maneuvering on the part of the franchises and the governments
   they dealt with.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses the propaganda of the Algerian terrorist group the
   Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat/Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb
   (AQIM) from 1998 to 2009 and evaluates the repercussions of the group's
   merger with Al-Qaeda on its discourse. The paper argues that integration
   into the Al-Qaeda hierarchy has had little influence on such discourse
   or on the group's strategies. The analysis lends support to the view
   that the group is lukewarm in its commitment to Al-Qaeda. Although the
   content of AQIM propaganda now embraces more countries, individuals and
   issues, the fact is that membership of Al-Qaeda has not brought about
   any significant turning point.},

Title = {Black Sea regional security: present multipolarity and future
   possibilities},
Journal = {EUROPEAN SECURITY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-19},
Abstract = {Three theories that can be usefully employed to analyse the security of
   the Black Sea region are structural realism, security communities and
   supranationality (based on the European Union (EU) model). Given that
   the Black Sea area currently has too many conflicts and rivalries to be
   a truly cooperative region or a `security community', we must examine
   its dynamics in terms of its present realism, especially in the east of
   the region ('what is'), as well as considering its future ('what could
   be'). Regionalisation and Europeanisation are both possibilities for the
   longer term but, for the development of a fully cooperative region,
   possibly based on the EU model, it is posited that a condition of
   `balanced multipolarity' must initially exist. The paper analyses the
   extent to which this type of polarity applies at the moment and then
   uses all the theories to outline possible ways forward for the region.},

Abstract = {The Climate negotiations in Copenhagen in December 2009 witnessed the
   emerging power of Brazil, South Africa, India, and China (BASIC).
   Although still focussed on domestic development goals, BASIC countries
   have made important steps toward a greater engagement in the global
   climate agenda. For India, the shift was marked by a voluntary, but
   conditional, target of reducing emission intensity, away from the past
   normative position based on ``equal per capita,{''} emissions
   entitlements. The new track aims at finding cost-effective mitigation
   strategies that align national development goals and climate actions.
   This paper examines the mitigation potential of a domestic sustainable
   development policy using a suite of integrated assessment models. The
   long-term goal is to keep temperature increase below 2A degrees C. This
   article shows that it is possible to match domestic development goals
   and climate mitigation. Win-win options exist and side benefits-in terms
   of energy security and local pollution-are important. However,
   development policies are not sufficient to achieve the desired emissions
   reductions. We find that it is necessary to introduce a constraint on
   the carbon budget. The price of carbon that emerges is however much
   lower than in a conventional mitigation scenario. Finally, this paper
   proposes to shift the negotiations away from the current climate-centric
   focus toward ``development,{''} in order to reduce conflicts and deliver
   greater global and national benefits.},

Journal = {POLITICAL ANALYSIS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {19},
Number = {3},
Pages = {273-286},
Month = {SUM},
Abstract = {Our goal in this paper is to provide a formal explanation for how
   within-unit causal process information (i.e., data on posttreatment
   variables and partial information on posttreatment counterfactuals) can
   help to inform causal inferences relating to total effects-the overall
   effect of an explanatory variable on an outcome variable. The basic idea
   is that, in many applications, researchers may be able to make more
   plausible causal assumptions conditional on the value of a posttreatment
   variable than they would be able to do unconditionally. As data become
   available on a posttreatment variable, these conditional causal
   assumptions become active and information about the effect of interest
   is gained. This approach is most beneficial in situations where it is
   implausible to assume that treatment assignment is conditionally
   ignorable. We illustrate the approach with an example of estimating the
   effect of election day registration on turnout.},

Abstract = {Experienced interviewers are commonly thought to achieve better quality
   survey data than inexperienced interviewers. Yet few empirical
   examinations of differences in data quality on attitudinal questions for
   experienced versus inexperienced interviewers exist. In this article, we
   examine whether experienced and inexperienced interviewers differ in
   their levels of a commonly evaluated data quality
   measure-acquiescence-in two national surveys. We hypothesize that
   experienced interviewers will have higher rates of acquiescence than
   inexperienced interviewers due to either differential pace or
   differential behaviors. We find that experienced interviewers obtain
   higher levels of acquiescent reports than do inexperienced interviewers,
   even after accounting for potential differences in interviewer and
   respondent characteristics. These differences across interviewers are
   not mediated by differential pace of the interview, as measured by
   interview length, implying that there may be differences in interview
   behaviors for experienced and inexperienced interviewers. We conclude
   with implications for survey practice and interviewer training and
   monitoring.},

Title = {The International Legal Status of Unrecognized Claimants to Statehood: A
   Comparative Analysis of Taiwan and the Turkish Republic of Northern
   Cyprus},
Journal = {ISSUES \& STUDIES},

Volume = {47},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Unrecognized claimants to statehood (UCSs), as referred to in this
   article, are political communities that meet many of the criteria of a
   state according to international law, but whose claims to statehood do
   not receive unequivocal recognition by existing states generally or
   collective recognition by the international community as a whole through
   admission to the United Nations as a member-state. Since the end of
   World War II, a considerable number of UCSs have emerged under varied
   circumstances, such as protracted conflict within a state, secession, or
   as a result of a collective policy of non-recognition by the
   international community. This article suggests that although the lack of
   general recognition does affect the international legal position of a
   UCS and the exercise of its rights and duties, it does not render such
   an entity legally nonexistent. Generally speaking, where the existence
   of a UCS does not involve a violation of international law, other states
   have acknowledged the separate international legal capacity of that
   entity and conducted extensive dealings with it. By contrast, where a
   UCS is created by acts violating international law, a collective policy
   of non-recognition can become a form of sanction that leads to greater
   limitations on the dealings of the entity concerned with the
   international community, to the extent that its separate identity under
   international law may become doubtful. A comparative analysis of Taiwan
   and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus reflects a considerable
   degree of consistency in state practice as regards how the positions of
   UCSs are tackled under international law.},

Journal = {POLITICAL ANALYSIS},

Volume = {19},

Abstract = {Contingency tables are among the most basic and useful techniques
   available for analyzing categorical data, but they produce highly
   imprecise estimates in small samples or for population subgroups that
   arise following repeated stratification. I demonstrate that
   preprocessing an observed set of categorical variables using a latent
   class model can greatly improve the quality of table-based inferences.
   As a density estimator, the latent class model closely approximates the
   underlying joint distribution of the variables of interest, which
   enables reliable estimation of conditional probabilities and marginal
   effects, even among subgroups containing fewer than 40 observations.
   Though here focused on applications to public opinion, the procedure has
   a wide range of potential uses. I illustrate the benefits of the latent
   class model-based approach for greatly improved accuracy in estimating
   and forecasting vote preferences within small demographic subgroups
   using survey data from the 2004 and 2008 U.S. presidential election
   campaigns.},

Journal = {NATIONS AND NATIONALISM},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Pages = {7-24},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Discussions of globalisation and identity have focused on the renewed
   relevance of various post-national frameworks of belonging, including
   the Muslim umma. This article argues against the idea that the umma has
   come to constitute a primary referent in contemporary Muslim debates
   about identity or a form of globalised political consciousness.
   Furthermore, the advent of `post-Islamism' means that Islamic political
   mobilisation rarely seeks to establish alternative political orders
   within the container of the nation-state. However, this does not mean
   that we are seeing a reaffirmation of the nation in Muslim contexts
   today. Rather, transnational Muslim solidarities represent an
   intermediate space of affiliation and socio-political mobilisation that
   exists alongside and in an ambivalent relationship with the
   nation-state. I point to two different socio-religious movements that,
   without positing the primacy or exclusivity of the umma/Islamic
   identity, express discrepant visions of the relationship between Islam
   and the nation: (1) the Fethullah Gulen movement, which serves
   simultaneously as the vehicle for a particular vision of neo-Ottoman
   Turkish nationalism and a critique of the Kemalist national order; and
   (2) the neo-Salafist movement, read here as an effort to embed
   conceptions of public morality and accountability within the discursive
   tradition of orthodox Islam rather than the institutional framework of
   modern polity.},

Abstract = {We begin with a look back at the field to identify themes of recent
   research that we expect to continue to occupy researchers in the future.
   As part of this overview, we characterize the themes and topics examined
   in research about measurement and survey questions published in Public
   Opinion Quarterly in the past decade. We then characterize the field
   more broadly by highlighting topics that we expect to continue or to
   grow in importance, including the relationship between survey questions
   and the total survey error perspective, cognitive versus interactional
   approaches, interviewing practices, mode and technology, visual aspects
   of question design, and culture. Considering avenues for future
   research, we advocate for a decision-oriented framework for thinking
   about survey questions and their characteristics. The approach we
   propose distinguishes among various aspects of question characteristics,
   including question topic, question type and response dimension,
   conceptualization and operationalization of the target object, question
   structure, question form, response categories, question implementation,
   and question wording. Thinking about question characteristics more
   systematically would allow study designs to take into account
   relationships among these characteristics and identify gaps in current
   knowledge.},

Abstract = {The adoption of the euro by Southern European states brought into sharp
   relief the structural problems of their economies, leading to increased
   deficits in their current transactions. Yet, before the onset of the
   world economic crisis, the euro had a beneficial impact on the economic
   growth of these states as a consequence of real interest rates being
   lower than the euro area average. Since the crisis, the flow of funds to
   these countries has sharply diminished, resulting in the crisis shock
   being much stronger in Southern Europe than in the states of the euro
   area that present small deficits or surpluses in their current
   transactions. In Southern Europe the euro makes economic fluctuations
   even more pronounced and the management of recession much harder - to
   the point where the very cohesion of the euro area is at stake.
   The fact that real wages in Germany have not experienced an upward trend
   throughout the 2000s, partly explains Southern Europe's deficit in
   current transactions. But it also explains the economic tensions that
   have arisen within the Franco-German axis. The stagnation of German
   demand has impacted negatively France, whose economic interests are
   rallying in favour of a `competitive' exchange rate for the euro, while
   in Germany a high exchange rate is preferred instead.
   In the long run, the cohesion of the euro area cannot be guaranteed
   unless a complete integration of the Economic and Monetary Union is
   striven for: Through the creation of effective mechanisms to deal with
   asymmetric shocks as well as the coordination of national economic
   policies with the aim of reducing national and social inequalities.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the evolution of family and employment policies in
   France and evaluates the extent to which they may have `stalled'
   France's gender revolution. It considers the `universal breadwinner'
   employment model of women's full-time and continuous participation in
   the labour market evolving in France in the 1970s and 1980s, due to
   early state support for childcare, restrictions on part-time working and
   demand for women's labour in the growing service sector. However,
   according to some commentators, from the late 1980s onwards the
   development of this model was curtailed by the unemployment crisis and
   the attempts of the French state to resolve it both through its
   employment and family policy. The encouragement of part-time work, the
   introduction of paid parental leave, the reorientation of childcare
   services away from collective creches to individualised forms of care
   and the subsidies available for hiring a domestic helper are the
   policies which have provoked most controversy.},

Abstract = {Methods for descriptive network analysis have reached statistical
   maturity and general acceptance across the social sciences in recent
   years. However, methods for statistical inference with network data
   remain fledgling by comparison. We introduce and evaluate a general
   model for inference with network data, the Exponential Random Graph
   Model (ERGM) and several of its recent extensions. The ERGM
   simultaneously allows both inference on covariates and for arbitrarily
   complex network structures to be modeled. Our contributions are
   three-fold: beyond introducing the ERGM and discussing its limitations,
   we discuss extensions to the model that allow for the analysis of
   non-binary and longitudinally observed networks and show through
   applications that network-based inference can improve our understanding
   of political phenomena.},

Abstract = {We conducted two experiments designed to evaluate several strategies for
   improving response to Web and Web/mail mixed-mode surveys. Our goal was
   to determine the best ways to maximize Web response rates in a highly
   Internet-literate population with full Internet access. We find that
   providing a simultaneous choice of response modes does not improve
   response rates (compared to only providing a mail response option).
   However, offering the different response modes sequentially, in which
   Web is offered first and a mail follow-up option is used in the final
   contact, improves Web response rates and is overall equivalent to using
   only mail. We also show that utilizing a combination of both postal and
   email contacts and delivering a token cash incentive in advance are both
   useful methods for improving Web response rates. These experiments
   illustrate that although different implementation strategies are viable,
   the most effective strategy is the combined use of multiple
   response-inducing techniques.},

Abstract = {This article reviews recent trends in modes of survey data collection,
   with a view to speculating on the future of survey modes. I discuss the
   development of the idea of modes, review the many dimensions of mode,
   briefly review some of the research on mode differences, discuss recent
   developments in mixed mode surveys, and offer some thoughts on the
   likely future of modes of survey data collection.},

Abstract = {In August 2009, a man with an assault rifle slung over his shoulder
   walked just outside the gates of a Phoenix, Arizona, convention hall
   where President Barack Obama was holding a discussion about health care
   reform in the United States. Given a history that includes the
   assassination of four U.S. presidents by gunfire, it would seem
   reasonable that the police officers outside the convention hall would
   use all powers at their disposal to subdue the armed man before he got
   any closer to the arena where the president was speaking. However, as
   the man moved around the perimeter of the hall, the Phoenix police
   officers standing guard quietly watched him without taking any actions
   to either disarm or restrain the rifle-toting Arizonan.
   Were the police officers in Phoenix being derelict in their duties? Were
   they failing to recognize the threat that an assault rifle-bearing man
   may pose to the president of the United States? The answer to these
   questions is no. The officers could not do anything to the
   rifle-carrying citizen because he was not breaking any law. This was a
   gun show; the man was showing off his gun to prove that he had one, to
   reassert his right to do so, and to allow his testosterone levels to
   have a public airing. In the state of Arizona, people can carry
   unconcealed guns. So long as no physical or verbal threats were made
   toward a citizen, including the president, the man was acting within the
   legal limits that governed him.
   Of course, the man carrying the weapon was well aware of the Arizona
   statute that protected his right to walk in public with a rifle slung
   over his shoulder. He, along with a number of other men, brought their
   weapons to the area outside the convention hall to assert their right to
   bear arms, and their actions were indeed within the letter of the law in
   Arizona. Even President Obama's press secretary, Robert Gibbs, seemed to
   recognize the legality of the situation when he noted: ``There are laws
   that govern firearms that are done state or locally and those laws don't
   change when the president comes to your state or locality.{''}},

Abstract = {This paper extends models of micro- and macropartisanship in two ways.
   It first develops a model of individual partisanship that accommodates
   changes in partisan utilities. Achen's Bayesian partisan updating is a
   special case of our model. This more general micromodel is then
   aggregated to create a model of macropartisanship. This macromodel is a
   more general version of the models of macropartisanship estimated by
   various authors. The less restricted version incorporates possible
   individual and temporal heterogeneity. We present an example using real
   data that offers a possible way to estimate the parameters in the full
   aggregate model.},

Abstract = {Balancing China's energy needs to fuel its rapid economic growth with
   the resulting potential impacts of climate change presents an enormous
   climate policy dilemma, not simply for China but for the entire world.
   This is the major reason why the role of China is an issue of perennial
   concerns at international climate change negotiations. In response to
   these concerns and to put China in a positive position, this paper maps
   out a realistic roadmap for China's specific climate commitments toward
   2050. Taking many factors into consideration, the paper argues that
   China needs to take on absolute emissions caps around 2030. However, it
   is hard to imagine how China could apply the brakes so sharply as to
   switch from rapid emissions growth to immediate emissions cuts, without
   passing through several intermediate phases. To that end, the paper
   envisions that China needs the following three transitional periods of
   increasing climate obligations before taking on absolute emissions caps
   that will lead to the global convergence of per capita emissions by
   2050: First, further credible energy conservation commitments starting
   in 2013 and aimed at cutting China's carbon intensity by 46-50\% by
   2020; second, voluntary ``no lose{''} emission targets starting in 2018;
   and third, binding carbon intensity targets as its international
   commitment starting in 2023. Overall, this proposal is a balanced
   reflection of respecting China's rights to grow and recognizing China's
   growing responsibility for increasing greenhouse gas emissions as China
   is on its way to becoming the world's largest economy.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to understand why attitudes towards homosexuality in
   Latvia appear to be more intolerant than in all other EU member states.
   It argues that, while the impact of religion, the legacy of communism
   and post-communist transition have all played a role in shaping
   attitudes towards homosexuality in Central and Eastern Europe, these
   factors do not explain sufficiently the divergence among post-communist
   states and, in particular, do not account for Latvia's extreme position.
   While acknowledging that intolerance towards non-heteronormative
   sexuality cannot be explained by a single factor but is the cumulative
   effect of a range of social influences, this study argues that
   homosexuality is particularly reviled in Latvia because it has been
   constructed discursively as a threat to the continued existence of the
   nation in its desired ethnic form and to the core values defining
   Latvian national identity.},

Abstract = {This article advances the idea that coalition formation and maintenance
   in highly fragmented presidential regimes is not only crucial to
   overcoming policy deadlock, but in some cases, critical to ensuring
   government survival. To advance this argument, the article looks at the
   formation and demise of legislative coalitions in Ecuador between 1979
   and 2006. The empirical data suggest that paradoxically, government
   coalitions became more difficult to sustain after the adoption of
   institutional reforms intended to strengthen the president's legislative
   powers. The adoption of those reforms, it is argued, undermined the
   legislative incentives to cooperate with the government and helped to
   accelerate coalition erosion. Not only did the reforms fail
   significantly to avoid policy deadlock, but in some cases they
   contributed to the early termination of presidential mandates. This
   article contributes to the study of coalition survival and how it is
   linked to policymaking.},

Abstract = {This article examines the influence of neoliberalism on President Barack
   Obama's foreign policy agenda and reengagement policy in East Asia.
   Using the basic tenets of neoliberalism, it critiques the Bush
   administration's post 9/11 foreign policy It also compares neoliberalism
   and realism/neoconservatism as U.S. foreign policy approaches to the
   security challenges of the twenty-first century. The article goes on to
   analyze the ideological perspective of President Obama's foreign policy
   agenda in East Asia. Obama's apparently neoliberal campaign statements
   and official pronouncements are concretized in his actual foreign policy
   decisions and actions. This new mode of conducting foreign policy has
   strengthened Washington's relations with its Asian friends and allies,
   but has complicated US.-China relations. In conclusion, the article
   contends that the realization of the neoliberal agenda in US. foreign
   policy in East Asia is contingent on four factors: prioritization of
   East Asia over other pressing foreign policy concerns; the competence
   and skills of the Obama administration's key foreign policy advisers;
   U.S. economic recovery and renewed competitiveness; and President
   Obama's reelection in 2012.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the impact of trade-based social clauses on
   labor rights enforcement. Drawing on insights from recent theoretical
   work on transnational advocacy networks and labor rights, the study
   examines how transnational groups and domestic actors engage the labor
   rights mechanisms under the NAFTA labor side agreement, the NAALC. A
   statistical analysis of original data drawn from NAALC cases complements
   interviews with key participants to analyze the factors that predict
   whether the three national mediation offices review labor dispute
   petitions. This study suggests that transnational activism is a key
   factor in explaining petition acceptance. Transnational advocates craft
   petitions differently from other groups and, by including worker
   testimony in the petitions, signal to arbitration bodies the possibility
   of corroborating claims through contact with affected workers.},

Abstract = {Intellectuals were important to the spread of nationalist ideology in
   nineteenth-century Europe for a variety of reasons. Firstly, their works
   facilitated the international spread of the discourse of nationalism;
   secondly, they mediated between the fields of political institutions and
   cultural reflection. This article looks at the international mobility
   and networks of romantic-nationalist intellectuals, and uses the case of
   August Heinrich Hoffmann von Fallersleben (1798-1874) as an example.},

Pages = {475-487},
Abstract = {This article investigates Europeanization in a candidate country from a
   macro-sociological perspective. From the point of view of sociology,
   extant Europeanization studies treat culture only in a reductionist
   manner. In particular, `sender-receiver' models overlook the domestic
   perceptions that translate, vernacularize or reframe exogenous
   conditionality. Furthermore, `goodness of fit' approaches `bringing
   domestic agency back in' misleadingly reinforce the image that the
   domestic and the external spheres are easily separated. By studying the
   ombudsmanship reform in Turkey, the article concludes that: (1) the
   content of Europeanization is not purely European; (2) the role for
   domestic norm entrepreneurs in leading cultural change is variable and
   constrained; and (3) domestic motivations for Europeanization include
   exogenous factors trespassing upon EU conditionality, that is, global
   culture/world society.},

Journal = {PUBLIC OPINION QUARTERLY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {75},
Number = {5, SI},
Pages = {861-871},
Abstract = {Although survey research is a young field relative to many scientific
   domains, it has already experienced three distinct stages of
   development. In the first era (1930-1960), the founders of the field
   invented the basic components of the design of data collection and the
   tools to produce the statistical information from surveys. As they were
   inventing the method, they were also building the institutions that
   conduct surveys in the private, academic, and government sectors. The
   second era (1960-1990) witnessed a vast growth in the use of the survey
   method. This growth was aided by the needs of the U.S. federal
   government to monitor the effects of investments in human and physical
   infrastructure, the growth of the quantitative social sciences, and the
   use of quantitative information to study consumer behaviors. The third
   era (1990 and forward) witnessed the declines in survey participation
   rates, the growth of alternative modes of data collection, the weakening
   of sampling frames, and the growth of continuously produced process data
   from digital systems in all sectors, but especially those emanating from
   the Internet. Throughout each era, survey research methods adapted to
   changes in society and exploited new technologies when they proved
   valuable to the field.},

Journal = {MEDITERRANEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Pages = {99-116},
Abstract = {This contribution explores differing theories on how the failure of the
   `peace process' featured in the design and goals of the UfM, drawing on
   lessons from the period when the EMP was pursued in parallel with the
   peace process. In each case, institutional overlaps are identified, as
   well as commonalities in the approaches of the actors to both pursuits.
   Crucially, however, the persistence and intensification of the
   Arab-Israeli conflict, in combination with the shift from
   multilateralism to bilateralism embodied in the UfM, has politicized the
   latter at the expense of the functionalist aspirations of its
   architects.},

Abstract = {This article questions the popular assumption that education promotes
   peaceful ethnic relations and explores ways education potentially
   contributes to ethnic violence. It begins by describing mechanisms
   through which education can shape ethnic violence. Next, it provides a
   comparative-historical analysis of Assam, Cyprus, and Sri Lanka. The
   analysis offers evidence that education can promote ethnic violence by
   strengthening ethnic divisions and inter-communal disfavor, increasing
   frustration and aggression, intensifying competition, and providing
   mobilizational resources.},

Abstract = {Since the 1970s, subnational entities such as provinces, states or
   regions have joined together in transnational associations based upon
   common interests, especially in Europe. Such transnational networks of
   subnational governments have also been created in the sphere of
   sustainable development, a policy domain that is largely shaped in
   multilateral decision-making settings and that is characterized by
   complexity and uncertainty, urging policy-makers to learn from other
   governments. Those networks have both external and internal objectives.
   On the one hand, they want to represent their members at international
   organizations and influence multilateral decision-making. On the other
   hand, they are aimed at fostering cooperation between subnational
   governments and at stimulating policy learning. After presenting a
   typology of existing networks in the sphere of sustainable development,
   the article presents a comparative analysis of the participation of the
   Belgian entities Flanders and Wallonia in ENCORE (Environmental
   Conference of the European Regions) and nrg4SD (Network of Regional
   Governments for Sustainable Development). The research shows that
   Flanders and Wallonia use networks mostly for formal and informal
   cooperation but not for influencing multilateral decision-making for
   sustainable development. The external dimension of the networks,
   however, is applied for identity politics. The analysis also
   demonstrates that little political capital is invested in the networks.},

Year = {2011},
Volume = {19},

Abstract = {Political scientists have long been interested in citizens' support
   level for such actors as ethnic minorities, militant groups, and
   authoritarian regimes. Attempts to use direct questioning in surveys,
   however, have largely yielded unreliable measures of these attitudes as
   they are contaminated by social desirability bias and high nonresponse
   rates. In this paper, we develop a statistical methodology to analyze
   endorsement experiments, which recently have been proposed as a possible
   solution to this measurement problem. The commonly used statistical
   methods are problematic because they cannot properly combine responses
   across multiple policy questions, the design feature of a typical
   endorsement experiment. We overcome this limitation by using item
   response theory to estimate support levels on the same scale as the
   ideal points of respondents. We also show how to extend our model to
   incorporate a hierarchical structure of data in order to uncover spatial
   variation of support while recouping the loss of statistical efficiency
   due to indirect questioning. We illustrate the proposed methodology by
   applying it to measure political support for Islamist militant groups in
   Pakistan. Simulation studies suggest that the proposed Bayesian model
   yields estimates with reasonable levels of bias and statistical power.
   Finally, we offer several practical suggestions for improving the design
   and analysis of endorsement experiments.},

Abstract = {Measures of constituency preferences are of vital importance for the

   alternative Bayesian hierarchical approach that exploits minimal

   maps. If at hand, social background data are easily integrated. To
   validate the method, we use national polls and district-level results

Abstract = {This article analyzes how climate change has been strategically linked
   to security issues in recent decades by a variety of actors. I begin by
   elaborating on two general discourses on the relationship between
   environment and security, which I call environmental conflict and
   environmental security. Using discourse analysis, I examine the
   particular ways that security and climate change have been linked by
   scholars, policymakers and the media. I then explore some of the
   potential implications that discussing climate change through each of
   these security discourses have for policy outcomes within the climate
   regime. I conclude that the environmental security discourse is the most
   useful for stressing vulnerabilities and the human security concerns
   linked to climate change.},

Abstract = {This study explores the impact of a momentous political event, the
   election of the nation's first black president, Barack Obama, in 2008,
   on perceptions of racism and opinions about racial policy. A
   representative panel study of Americans interviewed immediately before
   and after the election reveals a roughly 10 percent decline in
   perceptions of racial discrimination. About one quarter of respondents
   revised their perceptions of discrimination downward. We explore several
   explanations for this decline. First, motivated-reasoning theory would
   predict larger declines among those whose priors tell them that racism
   was a diminished force to begin with. Second, changes could be
   concentrated among those who have the least contact with out-group
   members, or who are less knowledgeable about politics, and therefore
   weight Obama's victory heavily in deciding how much racism exists in
   America. Third, based on theories of emotion and cognition, anxiety but
   not anger before the election might trigger substantial updating of
   beliefs. We found the drop in perceived discrimination to be widespread
   across groups in the population, with conservatives but not necessarily
   racially resentful whites exhibiting somewhat larger declines.
   Residential racial context had no effect on changes in perception,
   though declines were larger among the least politically knowledgeable.
   More notably, those citizens anxious but not angry before the election
   displayed much larger declines in perceived discrimination. Finally,
   declines in perceived discrimination were associated with increases in
   negative opinions of blacks and heightened opposition to both
   affirmative action and immigration.},

Abstract = {The third round of talks between Chiang Pin-kung ((sic)), chairman of
   Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation, and Chen Yunlin ((sic)), president
   of China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait,
   established an institutionalized platform for legal cooperation by
   concluding the Agreement on Joint Cross-Strait Crime-fighting and Mutual
   Judicial Assistance (hereafter, the Cross-Strait Judicial Agreement).
   This study will focus on Article 10 of the Cross-Strait Judicial
   Agreement, which contains the only reference in international law to
   Taiwan's and China's responsibility to recognize arbitration awards.
   This article will examine international rules for recognizing judgments
   and will make reference to other similar agreements in China that
   provide models for a future agreement with Taiwan. It is concluded that
   the form of Article 10 of the Cross-Strait Judicial Agreement can only
   be regarded as a first step toward judicial cooperation. A further and
   detailed bilateral agreement would provide safeguards for this
   preferential treatment. The need to avoid controversy cannot be used as
   an excuse for ignoring certain important matters.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN SECURITY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {20},
Number = {4},
Pages = {563-584},
Abstract = {This article comprehensively discusses the maritime dimension of the
   European Union's (EU's) security, which encompasses military and
   civilian aspects, intergovernmental and community components as well as
   institutional and geopolitical elements. First, the article provides a
   narrative of the development of the maritime element in the EU's
   security policy since the adoption of the European Security Strategy in
   2003. By depicting the interrelations between the sea and the EU's
   security, the article shows that the maritime dimension of EU security
   is generally well established, but often obscured by the complicated
   institutional structure of the Union. Thereafter, the article emphasises
   the need to define an effective EU Maritime Security Strategy, which
   would provide a strategic framework for the Union's security-related
   activities regarding the sea that encompass maritime power projection,
   as well as maritime security and safety. Accordingly the article
   provides some recommendations concerning the definition of such a
   strategy and for appropriate constituting elements: the maritime-related
   risks and threats, the maritime strategic objectives, the means to
   implement the strategy, and the theatres of EU maritime operations.},

Title = {Adapting to French `Leadership'? Spain's Role in the Union for the
   Mediterranean},
Journal = {MEDITERRANEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Pages = {59-78},
Abstract = {One might have expected Spain to have been less than enthusiastic about
   President Sarkozy's Mediterranean initiative of 2007-08, given that it
   implied criticism of the Barcelona Process in which Spain had been so
   prominent. Yet Franco-Spanish rivalry has not come to the fore as a
   result of it. Acceptance, adaptation and eventual support have been the
   keynotes to the Spanish response, notwithstanding some ongoing
   differences in outlook between the two countries. A political
   accommodation has been reached, with France guaranteeing Spain a
   visible, though not substantial, role in the Union for the Mediterranean
   (UfM). This builds upon earlier Franco-Spanish collaboration in the
   context of EU Mediterranean Policy, as well as close bilateral
   co-operation in various other policy domains, including migration and
   counter-terrorism. Collaboration with France also finds explanation in
   the wider EU context where it is now more difficult for any single
   country (even France) to achieve strategic policy changes. Besides
   analysing Spanish reactions to the assertion of French `leadership' in
   the Mediterranean, this contribution considers Spain's potential to
   exert influence on the UfM in the future by looking at its EU Presidency
   during the first half of 2010.},

Abstract = {The analysis of the bumpy Turkish EU accession reform process has
   largely been steeped either in a Rational Institutionalist logic of
   `opportunity costs' both for the EU and for Turkey, or assessed as a
   question of the Turkish (in) compatibility with European values. We
   have, in contrast, chosen to focus on a different variable-the changing
   Turkish national identity-in the context of the Turkish EU accession and
   democratization reforms. Exploring the dynamics of the Turkish national
   identity has allowed us to gain additional and tentatively more nuanced
   understandings about the Turkish reform process. The article discusses
   the advances and set-backs which the Turkish democratization reforms
   have experienced in the years spanning 2002-2010.},

Title = {Constructing Turkey Inc.: The Discursive Anatomy of a Domestic and
   Foreign Policy Agenda},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY EUROPEAN STUDIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {19},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {463-473},
Abstract = {The article draws on speech act theory to argue that Turkey's ruling
   Justice and Development Party (AKP) wields a discursive repertoire that
   consists of four main narratives: a democratization, a (post-)Islamist,
   an Ottomanist and a Turkey Inc. story. It examines the illocutionary
   intent, that is, the ways in which discourses are used to co-ordinate
   policy and strategically project appeals to specific constituencies. It
   also examines the perlocutionary uptake of these discourses, namely, the
   ways in which they are received by target audiences. This makes it
   possible to unpack the tensions which obtain within and across
   narratives, and account for the apparent contradictions in AKP positions
   on a range of issues. The overarching argument of the article is that
   the party's prime purpose is to establish Turkey Inc., that is to
   position Turkey as a (soft) power hub and gateway for transactions
   across its multiple regions and hinterlands, the other discourses in the
   repertoire, the article contends, are harnessed to this end.},

Abstract = {Every aspect of human endeavor, from acting to zookeeping, has its
   philosophy, its fundamental beliefs that form its core of understanding.
   However, all philosophy is inherently intellectual. It is just a way of
   thinking. To actually do something with it, to turn thought into action
   or to make a policy, you need doctrine. A doctrine is a teaching. Note
   that it has the same Latin origins as doctor (originally a teacher).
   Doctrine is a mediating force between philosophy and policy. This case
   explains how doctrine takes philosophy, often so vague and theoretical,
   and makes it operational so that specific policies can be derived from
   it. Thus doctrine consists of the fundamental principles of how lives
   are to be lived or how things are to be done. However, it always
   reflects an underlying philosophy-whether of a political party, a
   religion, or an organization. When it is codified, it becomes a
   political party's platform, a religion's book of scripture, or an
   organization's manual of standard operating procedures. When things are
   to be done ``by the book,{''} it means that the doctrine-as written and
   as subdivided into lots of policies-is to be followed without deviation.},
