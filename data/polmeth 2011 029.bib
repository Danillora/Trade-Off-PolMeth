Abstract = {This study deals with the effects of authoritarian regimes on state
   capacity or the quality of government (QoG): do some types of
   dictatorship (military, monarchy, and civilian) perform better than
   others? More importantly, which are the mechanisms through which
   different authoritarian rulers produce better government? The article
   argues theoretically, first, that single-party regimes are more
   responsive to citizens' demands than other types of authoritarian rule
   because they have a structured mechanism to channel citizens'
   ``voices{''} (the single party). As a consequence, they will provide QoG
   following societal demands, which are low in low-income countries and
   high in high-income ones. Second, the effect of the other relevant
   authoritarian types-monarchies and military regimes-is exclusively
   conditional on rulers' self-interests. We predict that with
   short-sighted rulers, monarchies and military regimes will tend to
   under-provide QoG. In contrast, when monarchs and military rulers have
   long-term horizons, these types of authoritarian regimes will have a
   positive effect on QoG. Employing a sample of over 70 authoritarian
   countries from 1983 to 2003, we find empirical support for these
   interactive effects. In single-party autocracies, the higher (lower) the
   average income, the higher (the lower) the QoG; while albeit weaker
   support than the first finding, in monarchies in particular, the longer
   (shorter) the government's time horizon, the higher (the lower) the QoG.},

Abstract = {While the leadership role of the European Union (EU) in the climate
   change regime has been largely acknowledged, less attention has been
   paid to identifying the reasons why the EU often fails in climate change
   negotiations. Such an undertaking is deemed imperative following the
   negative for the EU turn of events at the 2009 Copenhagen climate
   summit. There is sufficient literature to be found on the link between
   the Union's unique and complex organizational structure and its
   inability to act cohesively and purposefully. This study seeks to add to
   this corpus by looking at the extent to which the EU has been able to
   learn from its mistakes and incorporate timely remedial action. Even
   though important, the EU's failures as a global actor cannot be
   explained by only looking at its ineffective institutional architecture.
   A more systematic understanding of the reasons behind EU's failures in
   climate talks is in fact needed. By using Underdal's theory of
   `negotiation failure', this study tries to explore the extent to which
   negotiation theory could help with better comprehending the obstacles
   that prevented the Union from getting more out of the climate
   negotiation process.},

Abstract = {The design of climate policy architectures depends on how its multiple
   designers identify the climate problem, on the principles they adhere
   to, and on the criteria they apply for assessing the performance of the
   constructed agreements. This article presents five core features of the
   climate policy problem, five principles demanding respect when designing
   policy, and a particular specification of the four general criteria:
   efficacy, efficiency, equity, and institutional feasibility. The central
   policy problem of climate change is the phasing out of non-sustainable
   energy use by orchestrating trillions of decisions by billions of
   people. Principles like universality, realism, and transparency are
   important, but when balancing a global agreement, taking into account
   diversity and sovereignty are outstanding. For addressing the climate
   change challenges, the equity criterion should be taken more seriously
   by the negotiating countries than at present. In a diverse world, equity
   conflicts are likely to be further exacerbated by attempts to impose
   uniform approaches like global carbon trading or a harmonized global
   carbon tax rate. The uniform approaches, lauded by economists and policy
   makers as superior, are also criticized here as not being so effective
   and efficient as pretended.},

Abstract = {Drawing upon the framework of ``fragmented authoritarianism,{''} this
   article attempts to formalize existing bureaucratic behaviors in the
   Chinese political apparatus through the inclusion of the logic of
   ``collusive behavior{''} amongst the various bureaucratic levels. Policy
   crafting is posited as a more comprehensive notion to describe Chinese
   energy policymaking.
   Additionally, policy crafting addresses center-local internal dynamics
   from a new angle to better grasp the domestic conditions under which
   energy policy is ``crafted{''} and implemented throughout China's
   bureaucratic apparatus. The main contributions of this article are
   theoretical and analytical. It begins by defining policy crafting and
   noting the explicative limits of the existing approaches to China's
   ``informal{''} bureaucratic politics. The article then develops a
   theoretical reappraisal of the fragmented authoritarianism model in
   order to push it forward and supplement it with ``collusive behavior{''}
   to form a new analytical tool. It concludes with a description of the
   policy elaboration process, which encompasses the translation, drafting,
   and formulation of China's energy policy. In addressing how energy
   policy is ``made{''} in China, the article supplements current
   approaches to Chinese policymaking by elucidating the complexity of the
   policy elaboration process; that is, from its extensive bargaining and
   consensus-building dynamics to its inherent incremental nature and
   bureaucratic resistance.},

Abstract = {Researchers in comparative research are increasingly relying on
   individual level data to test theories involving unobservable constructs
   like attitudes and preferences. Estimation is carried out using
   large-scale cross-national survey data providing responses from
   individuals living in widely varying contexts. This strategy rests on
   the assumption of equivalence, that is, no systematic distortion in
   response behavior of individuals from different countries exists.
   However, this assumption is frequently violated with rather grave
   consequences for comparability and interpretation. I present a
   multilevel mixture ordinal item response model with item bias effects
   that is able to establish equivalence. It corrects for systematic
   measurement error induced by unobserved country heterogeneity, and it
   allows for the simultaneous estimation of structural parameters of
   interest.},

Abstract = {Through the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol, a
   developed country actor with a binding emission reduction target can use
   emission reductions from a project implemented in a developing country
   to meet this target. At the same time, CDM projects are meant to
   contribute to sustainable development in the host country, as defined by
   this country. The CDM is often taken to illustrate a broader
   contemporary turn in environmental policymaking toward market
   liberalism, flexibility, and pluralism, where the governance of the CDM
   involves `agency beyond the state' at different political levels and
   across various jurisdictions. While such an image of the CDM certainly
   identifies important aspects, it also downplays the ways in which states
   govern the CDM, not at the international level but at the domestic level
   through the host country prerogative to define its sustainable
   development priorities. Early on in the scholarly debate on the CDM,
   fears were raised about a `race to the bottom' with regard to
   sustainable development requirements on CDM projects. Our research on
   Chile confirms that hypothesis, with the important addition, that the
   `race' is not simply a structural feature of the CDM, but a deliberate
   strategy. We argue that Chile has actively chosen to put only marginal
   emphasis on securing the CDM's contribution to sustainable development,
   and instead uses the CDM primarily as a tool to attract foreign
   investments, treating carbon credits as just another export product.},

Abstract = {Climate change adaptation presents a paradox: climate change is a global
   risk, yet vulnerability is locally experienced. Effective adaptation
   therefore depends on understanding the local context of vulnerability,
   which requires deliberative and participatory approaches to adaptation
   policy-making. But, how can local inclusiveness be achieved in the
   context of global environmental risk, and what sorts of institutions are
   needed? This article examines one avenue for the participation of
   vulnerable groups in adaptation policy-making: National Adaptation
   Programmes of Actions (NAPAs). Drawing on the case study of Bangladesh,
   this article shows that the ``adaptation paradox{''} creates a tension
   between local and global definitions of climate change risk, affecting
   the legitimacy of participatory processes under the NAPA. I propose that
   early analysis and engagement of existing local institutional frameworks
   as a starting point for national adaptation planning is one possible
   entry point for meaningful local deliberation in global climate change
   policy-making processes.},

Abstract = {This contribution analyses the set of conditions that made the Union for
   the Mediterranean (UfM) possible, highlighting the change vis-a-vis the
   Euro-Mediterranean Partnership (EMP) and the European Neighbourhood
   Policy (ENP). First, it develops a conceptual framework for the analysis
   of the actors contributing or opposing the initiative, according to
   their attitude, motivation and resources invested in the process.
   Second, it examines the institutional logics that underpin the UfM. It
   suggests that the UfM was launched because a very small group cajoled an
   uninterested majority into yet another initiative for the Mediterranean.
   The outcome represents a shift away from regionalism as conceived in the
   EMP. At the same time, the Arab-Israeli conflict has politicized and
   disrupted the agenda of the UfM, as national interests have come to the
   fore and democracy and human rights have receded.},

Abstract = {Today, a new breed of charismatic and media-savvy religious figures are
   reinvigorating internal debates on Islam by drawing large audiences
   across the Muslim world and the Muslim diaspora in the West. Using
   satellite media, websites, blogs and video blogs, these new religious
   celebrities are changing the nature of debate in Islam from a
   doctrinaire discourse to a practical discussion that focuses on
   individual enterprise as a spiritual quest. These leaders have become
   religious entrepreneurs, with sophisticated networks of message
   distribution and media presence. From Amr Khaled and Moez Masood, two
   leading figures of Arab Islamic entertainment television, to Baba Ali, a
   famous Muslim video blogger from California, Islam has never been more
   marketable. Satellite television and the internet are becoming fertile
   discursive spaces where not only religious meanings are reconfigured but
   also new Islamic experiences are mediated transnationally. This
   delocalisation of Islamic authority beyond the traditional sources of
   Egypt and Saudi Arabia is generating new producers and locales of
   religious meaning in Dubai, London, Paris and Los Angeles. This article
   examines the impact of celebrity religious figures and their new media
   technologies on the relativisation of authority in Islam and the
   emergence of a cosmopolitan transnational audience of Muslims. I ask if
   this transnational and seemingly apolitical effort is generating a new
   form of religious nationalism that devalues the importance of national
   loyalties.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the diverse approaches of EU members'
   integration with the EU through modelling, and assesses the
   applicability of each model to Taiwan-China relations. Building upon two
   variables: `the association with national identity and reorientation or
   not', and `being the leading or founding member or not'-four EU members'
   integrative models stand out. The German model is proved to be the most
   integrationist, followed by the Finnish and the French models. The UK
   model appears to be the least committed. Due to sovereignty
   controversies, the visionary German and French models are not applicable
   to Taiwan-China integrations and the prospects are for the pragmatic
   Finnish model at best, and the UK model at worst. These modelling
   outcomes can then explain why the growing economic integration between
   the two sides has not produced spillover effects into the political
   arena. This paper therefore argues that it would be in China's interest
   to make Taiwan an equal leading player in Taiwan-China integrations, and
   to transform its `one-China policy' from the current political and
   sovereignty contents to a cultural and value-laden concept. Among the
   theories being examined, (neo) realist-constructivism demonstrates more
   applicability than two mainstream integration theories-neofunctionalism
   and intergovernmentalism.},

Abstract = {William Shakespeare's contributions to literature and the development of
   the English language have long been acknowledged and thoroughly
   documented, but his insights into modern management and administration
   have been all but ignored until now. This is a surprising oversight when
   you consider that many of his plays deal with issues of personnel
   management and organizational behavior.
   Remember Hamlet, the poignant case study of a too sensitive young
   executive who fails to move up in the organizational hierarchy because
   of his inability to make decisions. What is Julius Caesar if not a very
   hostile takeover attempt by disgruntled stockholders? The tragedy of
   Macbeth was that the title character was a ruthless workaholic who
   allowed his overly ambitious wife to egg him on to the top, only to find
   that he couldn't hack it in the end. Who has not felt compassion when
   seeing Othello, the tale of a minority manager who incurs resentment
   because of his personnel policies and then finds that jealousy at the
   office leads to murder. And is not King Lear a warning to all executives
   of family businesses on the perils of divestiture and early retirement?
   Modern management has its gurus such as Peter Drucker and Tom Peters.
   William Shakespeare is certainly, if not chronologically, their peer. He
   just needs a bit of interpretation. Remember the character in Moliere's
   1670 play, The Would-Be Gentleman, who suddenly says to himself one day,
   `` Good Heavens! For more than forty years I have been speaking prose
   without knowing it.{''} It is the same with Shakespeare. Most managers
   have read or seen at least some of his plays, but have yet to realize
   that they have been reading organization lore. The interpretive
   commentary that follows merely seeks to bring out the management
   concepts that were always there.},

Abstract = {Although a growing number of political scientists are conducting
   randomized experiments, many of them only report the average treatment
   effects and do not systematically explore the variation in treatment
   effects across subpopulations. This is unfortunate from a scientific
   point of view because heterogeneous treatment effects can provide
   additional substantive insights. This current state of affairs is also
   problematic from a policy makers' perspective since such studies do not
   identify subgroups for which treatments are effective. In this paper, we
   propose a formal two-step framework that first identifies heterogeneous
   treatment effects from a randomized experiment and then uses this
   information to derive an optimal policy about which treatment should be
   given to whom. Our proposed method avoids the risk of false discoveries
   that are likely in post hoc subgroup analysis routinely conducted in the
   discipline. We discuss our methodology in the context of getout-the-vote
   randomized field experiments and show how the proposed two-step
   framework can be applied in real-world settings.},

Abstract = {This article explores the conditions under which regional fisheries
   management organizations (RFMOs) adopt climate actions. I test a series
   of hypotheses to explain when RFMOs move beyond their classic management
   approaches-assignment of property rights, catch limits, and gear
   restrictions to include climate change in their research and management
   plans. I introduce a new data set that compares fisheries-climate
   linkages since 1992 in all available RFMO annual reports and meeting
   minutes. The analysis reveals a series of patterns surrounding linkage
   politics in RFMOs. Importantly, this study finds that climate linkages
   in RFMOs do not simply follow scientific knowledge or regional climate
   vulnerability. Instead, climate action coincides with member country
   efforts to avoid catch regulations, and secretariat efforts to exhibit
   organizational relevance.},

Abstract = {Ceremonial initiatives linked to nation-building projects are highly
   visible in multiethnic states, where governments seem to have adopted a
   Durkheimian approach in which ceremonies contribute to the strengthening
   of communities. However, national ceremonies are not invented or
   exported to other nations easily, as seen when outlining the pattern of
   a successful national day. A unifying narrative (sometimes the
   historical genesis) is significant in the establishment of successful
   national days, as is the nature of the national day design. The
   celebrations of the constitution in Norway - and the 77 year struggle to
   get the Norwegian flag officially recognised - became part of resisting
   the enforced union with Sweden (1814-1905). Therefore, the growth of
   Norwegian nationalism must be understood in the context of rival
   nationalisms in Scandinavia. However, Constitution Day (17 May) has
   remained a powerful component of Norwegian nationalism long since the
   constitution ceased to be threatened because of its incorporation in
   primary and secondary school curricula and, more recently, within the
   debate on multiculturalism.},

Abstract = {How do welfare regimes function when state institutions are weak and
   ethnic or sectarian groups control access to basic services? This paper
   explores how people gain access to basic services in Lebanon, where
   sectarian political parties from all major religious communities are key
   providers of social assistance and services. Based on analyses of an
   original national survey (n=1,911) as well as in-depth interviews with
   providers and other elites (n=175) and beneficiaries of social programs
   (n=135), I make two main empirical claims in the paper. First, political
   activism and a demonstrated commitment to a party are associated with
   access to social assistance; and second, higher levels of political
   activism may facilitate access to higher levels or quantities of aid,
   including food baskets and financial assistance for medical and
   educational costs. These arguments highlight how politics can mediate
   access to social assistance in direct ways and add new dimensions to
   scholarly debates about clientelism by focusing on contexts with
   politicized religious identities and by problematizing the actual goods
   and services exchanged.},

   Welfare of Informal Reciprocity in Rural Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire},

Abstract = {This paper examines the consequences for equity of different patterns of
   non-state social welfare provision, specifically the informal
   institutions of reciprocity among families, friends, and village
   neighbors in rural West Africa. Based on over 18 months of fieldwork in
   similar regions on either side of the Ghana-Cote d'Ivoire border, this
   paper challenges many existing assumptions in the literature, revealing
   that the informal institutions of reciprocity were not only less vibrant
   overall, but also differed strikingly in terms of who was helping who
   and how in particular localities. The paper argues that the informal
   institutions of reciprocity were more exhausted in the Ghanaian villages
   and more exclusive in the Ivoirian ones. The study highlights that the
   informal system of non-state social welfare provided by the family,
   friends, and neighborhood did not simply expand to fill the functional
   gaps left by the neoliberal retrenchment of the state. The paper
   concludes that when policies are designed based on an overly
   romanticized image of kinship and communal reciprocity in Africa, it is
   the very poor that increasingly fall through the gaps of the state and
   non-state system of social welfare.},

   routinely made by prominent political figures, academics, journalists,

   sets of actors policymakers, academics, journalists, and NGO activists
   each have different incentives to stress and even exaggerate the
   probability of war over water. This confluence of incentives has likely
   contributed to an overemphasis in public discourse of the likelihood of

Abstract = {The debate around the viability of the so-called `Two-State Solution'
   and the perspective of an alternative `One-State Solution' began to
   attract renewed the attention after the collapse of the Oslo process. We
   suggest that instead of debating the viability of rival constitutional
   schemes, a more fruitful approach to the issue of peace making in
   Israel/Palestine should focus on the structural elements of the picture
   more than on future possible outcomes of the diplomatic process. This
   article focuses on the role of the two leaderships by analysing their
   historical background, discourses and policies in order to understand to
   what extent the debate on the TSS/OSS dichotomy reveals the hidden logic
   of the alternatives. Our aim is to describe the `primordial soup' that
   enables discussion and decisions with respect to the different scenarios
   addressed by the debate. We conclude that the TSS/OSS alternative hardly
   identifies meaningful coalitions for peace making and the attainment of
   either of the two solutions seems to be unlikely without a dramatic
   change the very identity of Palestinian and Israeli leadership; the
   rhetoric about the `missed opportunities' of negotiation contributes
   instead to obscure the resilience of the status quo.},

Abstract = {This article explores the willingness of the Benelux countries to
   co-ordinate Russiarelated policies at the EU level, contrasting their
   traditional pro-integrationist disposition and national economic
   interests. At the rhetorical level all three states display a
   willingness to coordinate policies within the EU. In practice, however,
   this is dependent on the individual country's economic interests, with
   energy being of particular importance in Dutch-Russian relations. There
   appears to be considerable inter-state competition in obtaining
   lucrative commercial contracts, undermining a coherent EU approach
   towards Russia. The traditional sources of influence of small states in
   the EU are limited in the case of the Benelux and Russia. With their
   traditional prointegrationist attitudes having undergone substantial
   change, the Benelux states lack the leadership and the credibility to be
   seen as impartial brokers of a coalition for a coherent Russia strategy.
   Ad hoc coalitions on the basis of converging economic interests appear
   to be more determining for the co-ordination of Russia policies within
   the EU.},

Abstract = {The New Strategic arms reduction treaty nuclear arms control agreement
   signed by US President, Barack Obama, and Russian President, Dmitry

   Even successful ratification of this agreement is, at best, an important
   but incremental part of the US-Russian policy `reset' and the larger
   agenda for both states with respect to arms reduction and
   nonproliferation. Further reductions in both states' inventories of
   strategic nuclear weapons are a necessary preface toward credible
   leadership in stopping the spread of nuclear arms - especially in the
   looming test cases of Iran and North Korea. In addition, both states
   have to decipher a policy-strategy nexus for emerging missile defense
   technologies: in particular, whether missile defenses should be seen as
   possible means of cooperative security, as between NATO and Russia, or
   whether they are firewalls in the way of further progress in offensive
   nuclear arms reductions.},

Abstract = {Public Opinion Quarterly at its outset focused heavily on the influences
   on public opinion, predicated on the assumption of its strong impact on
   politics and policymaking. Has this assumption been borne out? This
   essay reviews the research on the influence of American public opinion
   on policymaking that began to use survey data first to examine the
   legislative representation and then national-level and state-level
   policies. POQ's assumption has been confirmed by a substantial
   connection, overall, between public opinion and policymaking in the
   United States. Although this general finding is striking, there are
   limits to what we can conclude from it about American democracy. This
   raises important questions for future research and in ongoing debates
   about major issues before the nation, for which the public holds its
   leaders accountable.},

Abstract = {Many studies in economics and political science include the concept of
   ethnic diversity as a key independent variable in empirical studies. To
   date, however, only single-dimensional measures of ethnic diversity,
   such as ethnic fractionalization, have been available. In this paper, I
   define and measure three multidimensional characteristics of social
   structure-cross-cuttingness, cross-fractionalization, and subgroup
   fractionalization and present a new cross-national data set comprised of
   indices along combinations of five cleavages: race, language, religion,
   region, and income. After addressing important definitional and
   measurement issues, I discuss the data and show how their inclusion in
   economic growth regressions reopens the theoretical debate regarding the
   influence of ethnic diversity, indicating the potential for these new
   indices to shed light on the role of ethnic diversity (and social
   structure more generally) with regards to a number of phenomena of
   concern to political scientists. The data set is publicly available from
   the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research data
   archives and the Institute for Quantitative Social Science Dataverse
   Network.},

   REDD+},
Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},

Volume = {11},
Number = {4},
Pages = {66+},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the role of forest tenure in creating a
   sustainable and effective mechanism on Reducing Emissions from
   Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+). It draws together existing
   knowledge and experience of forest tenure issues as they play out in
   real contexts, and evaluates their implications for REDD+. In
   particular, it challenges the argument that simply harmonising different
   tenure systems will lead to improved tenure security and ensure that
   REDD+ does not disenfranchise local communities. By bringing to light
   the ways in which local tenure could shape the implementation of REDD+,
   this paper provides insights that can contribute to the design of a
   sustainable, effective and equitable REDD+ agreement. The findings
   suggest that a more nuanced and locally specific understanding of tenure
   security and ownership are required in order to create favourable
   grounds for REDD+ implementation.},

Abstract = {This article explores why some societies witnessed less political
   liberalization during the Third Wave of democratization than others, and
   importantly, the conditions under which opposition forces may refrain
   from pressing for political reform. Focusing on the Muslim world, it
   also presents a more complete understanding of when and how political
   Islam hinders democratization. Specifically, historical experiences with
   Islamists in the 1970s and institutional structures established by the
   1980s created a condition of uncertainty that enabled some incumbents to
   thwart liberalization during the Third Wave. Incumbents exploited the
   fear of political Islam, convincing many secularist opponents that they
   were better off with the current regime than with Islamist rule. The
   extent to which incumbents could succeed varied, depending on whether or
   not Islamist movements had been allowed to mobilize openly and the
   extent that the regime based its legitimacy on Islam. The argument
   extends beyond the Muslim world. What is fundamentally at stake is not
   whether Islam exists as a mobilizing ideology, but whether
   democratically-minded opponents believe that non-democratic opposition
   groups exist that would potentially subvert a democratic opening.},

Abstract = {Negotiations concerning the quality of international rivers are not
   easy, as incongruence in preferences between upstream and downstream
   countries generally exists. The Rhine Chlorides dispute is a clear
   example of this. The chloride issue has been on the international water
   agenda of the Netherlands and the upstream Rhine riparian states for
   more than 70 years. The aim of this paper is to give a historical
   overview of the settlement of the Rhine chlorides dispute in order to
   draw some lessons for negotiators who have to work under comparable
   conditions of asymmetrical international water pollution. The case not
   only shows the complexities in reaching acceptable solutions for
   asymmetrical transboundary pollution, but also the importance of sound
   argumentation, institutions, side payments, issue framing, issue linking
   and arbitration.},

Abstract = {In public discourse and survey research, global climate change is
   sometimes referred to as ``global warming{''} and sometimes as ``climate
   change.{''} An analysis of web sites of conservative and liberal think
   tanks suggests that conservatives prefer to use the term ``global
   warming{''} whereas liberals prefer ``climate change.{''} A question
   wording experiment (N = 2267) illustrates the power of these frames:
   Republicans were less likely to endorse that the phenomenon is real when
   it was referred to as ``global warming{''} (44.0\%) rather than
   ``climate change{''} (60.2\%), whereas Democrats were unaffected by
   question wording (86.9\% vs. 86.4\%). As a result, the partisan divide
   on the issue dropped from 42.9 percentage points under a ``global
   warming{''} frame to 26.2 percentage points under a ``climate change{''}
   frame. Theoretical and methodological implications are discussed.},

Title = {An Alternative to the Response Rate for Measuring a Survey's Realization
   of the Target Population},
Journal = {PUBLIC OPINION QUARTERLY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {75},
Number = {1},
Pages = {89-98},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {A survey's response rate-defined as the number of completed interviews
   divided by the number of eligible units in the sample-is often taken to
   be the primary measure of quality when assessing the validity of survey
   data or comparing different surveys. However, the response rate suffers
   from several major limitations: the estimated response rate (1) is based
   on the sample, not the population, and so does not account for the
   sampling frame's undercoverage of the target population; (2) can be
   sensitive to the choice of e, the assumed proportion of eligible units
   among the units for which eligibility status has not been determined;
   (3) can be sensitive to the definitions used when assigning final
   disposition codes; and (4) does not account for misclassification of
   eligible units as ineligible. Because of these limitations, the response
   rate may be inadequate for comparing different surveys' ability to
   identify and complete interviews for the target population. In recent
   years, this inadequacy has become more apparent due to an increase in
   sampling-frame options that have differing and often unknown coverage
   properties, and to an increase in the use of data-collection modes with
   differing nonresponse mechanisms. In this article, I describe a
   ``realization{''} rate-a frame-independent, assumption-free measure of a
   survey's ability to identify and interview the target population, based
   on an external measure of the size of that population. I argue that the
   realization rate is superior to the response rate for comparing surveys
   that use different sampling frames or modes of data collection.},

Month = {SPR},
Abstract = {Analysts agree that political corruption is an obstacle to democratic
   consolidation but disagree about how to measure the extent of corruption
   in individual nations. This analysis of the Central American countries
   demonstrates that the most important competing quantitative measures of
   political corruption produce strikingly different rankings. These
   contradictory results are caused less by poor measurement techniques
   than by the existence of two different dimensions of corruption that do
   not always coincide. Statistical indicators based on expert perceptions
   of corruption and alternative indicators based on ordinary citizens'
   firsthand experiences with bribery measure, respectively, grand
   corruption by senior officials and petty corruption by lower-level
   functionaries. This study attempts to explain why several Central
   American nations suffer primarily from one or the other rather than
   both. It advances recommendations for future research and future
   anticorruption policies that may be applied to Latin America as a whole.},

Abstract = {Public opinion polls have long played an important role in the study and
   conduct of elections. In this essay, I outline the evolution of polling
   as used for three different functions in U.S. presidential elections:
   forecasting election outcomes, understanding voter behavior, and
   planning campaign strategy. Since the introduction of scientific polling
   in the 1936 election, technology has altered the way polls are used by
   the media, public, candidates, and scholars. Today, polls and surveys
   remain vital to electoral behavior and our understanding of it, but they
   are being increasingly supplemented or replaced by alternate measures
   and methods.},

   Towards an Expanded Mediterranean Model?},
Journal = {MEDITERRANEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {16},
Number = {3},
Pages = {343-363},
Abstract = {This paper examines the global and structural forces facilitating the
   movement of female migrant domestic workers (FMDWs) from developing
   regions to southern Europe and the Levant. At the intersection of
   welfare state, childcare, gender and migration regimes, we can identify
   a cross-Mediterranean domestic worker model. It has important
   implications for the magnitude, composition (in terms of national
   background and live-in vs. live-out work), legal status and mobilization
   of the region's FMDWs. Their roles in global migration flows and
   national labour markets, as explained in the existing literature, are
   examined, followed by case comparison of Spain, Greece, Cyprus, Israel,
   Lebanon and Jordan.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN SECURITY},

Pages = {243-264},
Abstract = {Although EU-NATO institutional relations have been evolving since the
   Saint-Malo Declaration in 1998, efficient and coherent cooperation is
   still lacking. This article goes beyond the narrative of blockage caused
   purely at the political level in order to illustrate both formal and
   informal EU-NATO cooperation at both the centre (Brussels) and on the
   ground (missions). This article addresses cooperation in terms of the
   actors involved at three different levels: state actors, international
   staff, and military personnel. Although, much has been done to advance
   cooperation between international staffers in Brussels and between those
   on the ground in common mission areas, the lack of a political agreement
   - one that moves beyond the limited scope of Berlin Plus - is causing
   severe fatigue, most notably at the level of international staff.
   Furthermore, the informal and ad hoc cooperation that has been the
   underlying facilitator of synergy between the two organisations could
   start to atrophy if a grand or intermediary bargain is not achieved in
   the near future.},

Title = {An Empirical Bayes Approach to Estimating Ordinal Treatment Effects},
Journal = {POLITICAL ANALYSIS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1},
Pages = {20-31},
Month = {WIN},
Abstract = {Ordinal variables categorical variables with a defined order to the
   categories, but without equal spacing between them are frequently used
   in social science applications. Although a good deal of research exists
   on the proper modeling of ordinal response variables, there is not a
   clear directive as to how to model ordinal treatment variables. The
   usual approaches found in the literature for using ordinal treatment
   variables are either to use fully unconstrained, though additive,
   ordinal group indicators or to use a numeric predictor constrained to be
   continuous. Generalized additive models are a useful exception to these
   assumptions. In contrast to the generalized additive modeling approach,
   we propose the use of a Bayesian shrinkage estimator to model ordinal
   treatment variables. The estimator we discuss in this paper allows the
   model to contain both individual group level indicators and a continuous
   predictor. In contrast to traditionally used shrinkage models that pull
   the data toward a common mean, we use a linear model as the basis. Thus,
   each individual effect can be arbitrary, but the model ``shrinks{''} the
   estimates toward a linear ordinal framework according to the data. We
   demonstrate the estimator on two political science examples: the impact
   of voter identification requirements on turnout and the impact of the
   frequency of religious service attendance on the liberality of abortion
   attitudes.},

Title = {Theory Driven Bias in Ideal Point Estimates-A Monte Carlo Study},
Journal = {POLITICAL ANALYSIS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1},
Pages = {87-102},
Month = {WIN},
Abstract = {This paper analyzes the use of ideal point estimates for testing pivot
   theories of lawmaking such as Krehbiel's (1998, Pivotal politics: A
   theory of U.S. lawmaking. Chicago, IL: University of Chicago) pivotal
   politics and Cox and McCubbins's (2005, Setting the Agenda: Responsible
   Party Government in the U.S. House of Representations. New York:
   Cambridge University Press) party cartel model. Among the prediction of
   pivot theories is that all pivotal legislators will vote identically on
   all successful legislation. Clinton (2007, Lawmaking and roll calls.
   Journal of Politics 69:455-67) argues that the estimated ideal points of
   the pivotal legislators are therefore predicted to be statistically
   indistinguishable and false when estimated from the set of successful
   final passage roll call votes, which implies that ideal point estimates
   cannot logically be used to test pivot theories. I show using Monte
   Carlo simulation that when pivot theories are augmented with
   probabilistic voting, Clinton's prediction only holds in small samples
   when voting is near perfect. I furthermore show that the predicted bias
   is unlikely to be consequential with U.S. Congressional voting data. My
   analysis suggests that the methodology of estimating ideal points to
   compute theoretically relevant quantities for empirical tests is not
   inherently flawed in the case of pivot theories.},

Title = {CELL-PHONE-ONLY HOUSEHOLDS AND PROBLEMS OF DIFFERENTIAL NONRESPONSE
   USING AN ADDRESS-BASED SAMPLING DESIGN},
Journal = {PUBLIC OPINION QUARTERLY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {75},
Number = {4},
Pages = {613-635},
Month = {WIN},
Abstract = {Identifying and contacting cell-phone-only (CPO) households in an
   efficient and cost-effective manner is critical for many studies to
   ensure the representativeness of final survey estimates. With the advent
   of address-based sampling (ABS)-that is, the sampling of addresses from
   a database with near universal coverage of residential
   households-researchers have an alternative to cell-phone frame sampling
   for identifying and surveying these households. Using a large ABS
   mixed-mode study, we explore three key questions. First, how effective
   is an ABS design in identifying CPO households? Second, is there
   significant differential response across the ``matched'' (address and
   telephone number) and ``unmatched'' (address only) portions of the
   sample, given that CPO households are nearly all found within the
   ``unmatched'' sample where first contact is limited to mail only? Third,
   can traditional sex-age-race/ethnicity post-stratification reduce
   potential bias due to differential nonresponse or are additional
   measures required? For this latter question, we examine the potential
   biasing impact of differential nonresponse where CPO homes are shown to
   be significantly different in attitudes and behaviors from the more
   prevalent homes that have both landline and cell-phone access. Data come
   from a study of 87,034 Nielsen Radio Audience Measurement adult
   respondents conducted in spring 2009. The study shows that, while CPO
   homes can be reached and interviewed using an ABS design, it is
   important to assess and correct for the potential biasing effects of
   differential nonresponse.},

Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {11},
Number = {4},
Pages = {43+},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Due to the localized nature of mountains, their great diversity, and the
   fact that their specificity is rarely taken into account by national
   policies, their inscription on the world's environmental agenda can be
   considered a tour de force. Through the case study of mountains, this
   paper focuses on the process of framing an environmental object as
   ``global.{''} While ``global{''} is usually considered a descriptor, I
   here look at it as a contingent, constructed, and contested notion. The
   construction of an object and its framing as environmental and as global
   are political acts. The goal of this paper is not to demonstrate whether
   the elaboration of a global mountain agenda is ``right{''} or
   ``wrong{''} but to demonstrate that it is contingent, i.e. relevant for
   certain actors in certain contexts. The identification of mountains as a
   global issue has proven to have implications for certain actors
   harboring specific agendas and to be a powerful motor for collective
   action in a globalized world.},

Abstract = {In this article I argue that, the Secretariat of the Convention on
   Biological Diversity (CBD), led by its autonomously entrepreneurial
   Executive Secretary, influences overlap management by strategically
   linking biodiversity and climate change issues. Specifically, the
   Secretariat marketed (filtered, framed, and reiterated) strategic frames
   of the biodiversity-climate change interface that reframed biodiversity
   from a passive victim of climate impacts, to an active player in climate
   response measures (i.e. adaptation). This reframing is significant in
   that a major hurdle to selling the benefits of biodiversity conservation
   to countries with more pressing development concerns has been the
   perceived limited relevance of conservation to human well-being. In
   emphasizing biodiversity's role in human adaptation and security, the
   Secretariat has begun to shape member state discourse surrounding the
   biodiversity-climate change linkage. Ultimately aimed at enriching our
   emerging theoretical understanding of the role of international
   bureaucracies in global governance, this article illuminates: (1) how
   the Secretariat understands and manages biodiversity-climate linkages;
   (2) the origins of the Secretariat's understanding and activities
   surrounding this issue; and (3) how Secretariat participation in overlap
   management is beginning to influence CBD political processes and
   outcomes.},

Abstract = {The Shapley-Owen value (SOV, Owen and Shapley 1989, Optimal location of
   candidates in ideological space. International Journal of Game Theory
   125-42), a generalization of the Shapley-Shubik value applicable to
   spatial voting games, is an important concept in that it takes us away
   from a priori concepts of power to notions of power that are directly
   tied to the ideological proximity of actors. SOVs can also be used to
   locate the spatial analogue to the Copeland winner, the strong point,
   the point with smallest win-set, which is a plausible solution concept
   for games without cores. However, for spatial voting games with many
   voters, until recently, it was too computationally difficult to
   calculate SOVs, and thus, it was impossible to find the strong point
   analytically. After reviewing the properties of the SOV, such as the
   result proven by Shapley and Owen that size of win sets increases with
   the square of distance as we move away from the strong point along any
   ray, we offer a computer algorithm for computing SOVs that can readily
   find such values even for legislatures the size of the U. S. House of
   Representatives or the Russian Duma. We use these values to identify the
   strong point and show its location with respect to the uncovered set,
   for several of the U. S. congresses analyzed in Bianco, Jeliazkov, and
   Sened (2004, The limits of legislative actions: Determining the set of
   enactable outcomes given legislators preferences. Political Analysis
   12:256-76) and for several sessions of the Russian Duma. We then look at
   many of the experimental committee voting games previously analyzed by
   Bianco et al. (2006, A theory waiting to be discovered and used: A
   reanalysis of canonical experiments on majority-rule decision making.
   Journal of Politics 68:838-51) and show how outcomes in these games tend
   to be points with small win sets located near to the strong point. We
   also consider how SOVs can be applied to a lobbying game in a committee
   of the U.S. Senate.},

Abstract = {Although rarely studied, international accounting standards shape what
   information regarding a firm's environmental performance is communicated
   to international financial markets. This article builds on scholarship
   describing the influence of international accounting standards on
   private financial markets to show that nominally technical choices
   regarding how to recognize and measure firms' environmental impacts hold
   the potential to reduce these impacts. Obscure accounting debates within
   the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) mask important
   political choices about what a firm must disclose to investors about its
   environmental liabilities and risks. IASB decisions about how these
   appear on corporate balance sheets change the link between a firm's
   environmental performance and its economic value and, thereby,
   contribute to steering private financial markets toward rewarding
   sustainable behavior within the global economy. This analysis
   demonstrates the authority of the IASB as an overlooked source of global
   environmental governance.},

Abstract = {This paper seeks to broaden the analysis of transboundary water
   interaction, by examining and interpreting the influence of `soft' power
   therein. The `soft' power of persuasion is understood to be exercised
   through discursive and to a lesser extent ideational means, and is
   interpreted in terms of compliance related to distributive (conflictual)
   or integrative (consensual) ends (after Scott (1994)). The focus is on
   inter-state water conflicts in hegemonic political contexts, where, it
   is found, the `first among equals' has a greater ability to exploit
   `soft' power and to determine the outcome. `Soft' power is also seen to
   influence the choices states make or avoid in their transboundary water
   interaction, which explains in part how treaties intending to manage
   conflict may in fact delay or perpetuate it. For example, `soft' power
   can be used by the basin hegemon to frame inequitable forms of
   cooperation in a cooperative light, such that unfair and ultimately
   unsustainable transboundary arrangements are replicated by the
   international donor community. Non-hegemonic riparian states also employ
   their capacity of `soft' power, though may find themselves with little
   choice other than to comply with the arrangement established by the
   basin hegemon. The findings stress the importance of analysts
   questioning claims of interaction promoted as `cooperative', and of
   examining the `soft' power plays that underlie all transboundary water
   arrangements. Exemplification is provided through transboundary river
   basins and aquifers around the globe.},

Abstract = {Unrecognised states are among the least likely candidates for
   democratisation: they tend to be driven by ethno-nationalism, many are
   marked by the legacy of war and most are facing international isolation.
   Nevertheless, the claim to democracy has become a central part of their
   legitimising narrative. This article examines this apparent paradox and
   finds that neither ethno-nationalism nor non-recognition represents
   insurmountable barriers to democratisation. However, what we tend to
   find in these entities is a form of stagnated `ethnic democratisation'.
   These findings throw new light on the relationship between democracy and
   nationalism; they highlight the importance of (lack of) sovereignty; and
   they are used to evaluate Sammy Smooha's concept of `ethnic democracy'.},

Abstract = {This article will focus on the development of the bilateral relations
   between Russia and Denmark, Finland and Sweden and related implications
   on wider EU-Russia relations. It firstly identifies the key factors
   influencing these countries' relations with Russia and those policy
   areas that are most important in bilateral relations. The second central
   question is to what extent the three countries' relations with Russia
   hinder or contribute to the formulation of a `European' Russia policy.
   In this context it is also to be examined to what extent these three
   small countries are able and willing to make an impact on the
   formulation and implementation of a common EU Russia policy. The article
   concludes with an outlook into future bilateral relations between the
   three countries and Russia as well as wider EU-Russia relations.},

Journal = {NATIONS AND NATIONALISM},

Number = {1},
Pages = {45-64},

Abstract = {Sri Lanka's Sunni Muslims or ``Moors'', who make up eight percent of the
   population, are the country's third largest ethnic group, after the
   Buddhist Sinhalese (seventy-four per cent) and the Hindu Tamils
   (eighteen per cent). Although the armed LTTE (Tamil Tiger) rebel
   movement was defeated militarily by government forces in May 2009, the
   island's Muslims still face the long-standing external threats of
   ethno-linguistic Tamil nationalism and pro-Sinhala Buddhist government
   land and resettlement policies. In addition, during the past decade a
   sharp internal conflict has arisen within the Sri Lankan Muslim
   community between locally popular Sufi sheiks and the followers of
   hostile Islamic reformist movements energised by ideas and resources
   from the global ummah, or world community of Muslims. This simultaneous
   combination of ``external'' ethno-nationalist rivalries and ``internal''
   Islamic doctrinal conflict has placed Sri Lanka's Muslims in a double
   bind: how to defend against Tamil and Sinhalese ethnic hegemonies while
   not appearing to embrace an Islamist or jihadist agenda. This article
   first traces the historical development of Sri Lankan Muslim identity in
   the context of twentieth-century Sri Lankan nationalism and the south
   Indian Dravidian movement, then examines the recent anti-Sufi violence
   that threatens to divide the Sri Lankan Muslim community today.},

Abstract = {Germany, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic have always been loyal
   members of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership (EMP). Yet they have never
   shown enthusiasm for it or displayed noteworthy activism within a
   co-operation framework that is perceived by their foreign policy elite
   as a necessary concession to southern EU member states in order to
   secure the latter's support for continuing pro-active EU engagement in
   eastern Europe. With this in mind, this study provides a comparative
   analysis of the foreign policy of Germany, Poland, Hungary and the Czech
   Republic toward the southern Mediterranean and discusses in particular
   the different responses of their governing, economic and societal elites
   to plans to create a Mediterranean Union (UM).},

   What is true is that in 1889 Germany became the first state to adopt an
   old-age social insurance program. The idea was first put forward, at
   Bismarck's behest, in 1881 by Germany's Kaiser William I, in a letter to
   the German Parliament stating that ``those who are disabled from work by
   age and invalidity have a well-grounded claim to care from the
   state.{''} Many thought that Germany adopted age 65 as the standard
   retirement age because that was Bismarck's age. In fact, Germany
   initially set age 70 as the retirement age (and Bismarck himself was 74
   at the time). It was not until twenty-seven years later (in 1916) that
   the age was lowered to 65. By that time, Bismarck had been dead for
   eighteen years.
   According to the U.S. Social Security Administration, the German system
   was not the major influence on the Committee on Economic Security (CES),
   the committee created in 1934 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to make
   recommendations for Social Security legislation, when it proposed age 65
   as the retirement age. The decision was in fact not based on any
   European precedent. It was primarily pragmatic and stemmed from two
   sources. One was a general observation about the retirement ages of the
   few private pension systems in existence at the time; the second, and
   more important, was the thirty state old-age pension systems then in
   operation. Roughly half of the state pension systems set age 65 as the
   retirement age; half set seventy as the retirement age. The new federal
   Railroad Retirement System created by Congress earlier in 1934 had also
   set 65 as its retirement age.
   Taking all this into account, the CES planners made a rough judgment
   that age 65 was probably more reasonable than age 70. This judgment was
   then confirmed by actuarial studies, which showed that age 65 could be
   self-sustaining with only modest levels of payroll taxation. So, these
   two factors, a pragmatic judgment about prevailing retirement standards
   and the favorable actuarial outcome of using 65, were the real reasons
   that age 65 was chosen. Bismarck had nothing to do with it.},

Abstract = {Research on the basis of political ideology indicates that psychological
   variables influence ideological positions. In particular, the role of
   authoritarianism is of long-standing interest to political scholars.
   This article looks at how political expertise conditions the ideological
   implications of the authoritarian predisposition. Although theories of
   authoritarianism imply that it is a constraint mechanism for the
   uninformed, research on the role of expertise in the formation of
   ideology suggests otherwise. In line with this, examination of the 2000
   and 2004 American National Election Studies revealed that the relation
   between the authoritarian predisposition and conservatism was stronger
   among experts; that relations between the authoritarian predisposition
   and two components of conservatism- opposition to equality and support
   for traditionalism-were also stronger among experts; and that the
   tendency for the authoritarian predisposition to be more strongly
   related to traditionalism than opposition to equality was stronger among
   experts as well. These findings suggest that the linkage between
   authoritarianism and ideology is contingent on one's understanding of
   politics and indicate the need for a more nuanced understanding of what
   expertise contributes to democratic citizenship.},

Abstract = {Over the past decade, carbon trading has emerged as the policy
   instrument of choice in the industrialized world to address global
   climate change. In this article I argue that a transnational business
   coalition, representing mostly energy firms and energy-intensive
   manufacturers, actively promoted the global rise of carbon trading. In
   this process, business was able to draw on the support of government
   allies and business-oriented environmental groups, particularly in the
   UK and the US. Alongside its allies, the coalition had pivotal influence
   in the internationalization of carbon trading through the Kyoto
   Protocol, in the U-turn of the EU from skeptic to frontrunner on carbon
   trading and in the re-import of carbon trading to the US. While business
   was not able to prevent mandatory emission controls, it was able to
   critically affect the regulatory style of climate policy in favor of
   low-cost, market-based options.},

Abstract = {In contemporary global environmental governance, private companies are
   both recipients of as well as contributors to the development and spread
   of environmental practices, norms, standards, and legislation. One
   sector that seems to be of particular significance is the environmental
   consultancy industry. It assists public and private actors in developing
   environmental solutions and ensuring implementation and compliance by
   providing particular knowledge, management, and assessment skills.
   However, little attention has been paid to the environmental authority
   and agency of companies active in this field. This exploratory study on
   global environmental consultancy firms is guided by the basic research
   questions on agency in earth system governance: What is agency? How do
   actors acquire authority and become agents? How can we evaluate the
   effects these agents generate?},

Abstract = {How and to what extent do different citizens experience democratic
   governance on a day-to-day basis? What agencies do they utilize in order
   to have their voices heard and grievances addressed? How do they gain
   access to government agencies responsible for delivering social welfare
   services, such as education, security, health care, and poverty relief?
   Investigations conducted in two states of India inquired about the
   manner in which different social groups living in rural areas gain
   access to the welfare services of the Indian state. These results show
   that an intermediary is required for gaining access. Different types of
   intermediaries are consulted by separate segments of society. For a
   large majority of poorer individuals, a newly arisen type of mediator,
   the naya neta (literally, new leader), is the intermediary of choice.
   Neither usually low status nor high status, but younger and better
   educated than other types of village leaders, naya netas play important
   roles in shaping welfare consequences in these villages of Rajasthan and
   Andhra Pradesh, most importantly, by affecting equity of access.},

Abstract = {In view of urgent social and environmental problems, it is important to
   understand the political dynamics that may promote sustainable
   development and to identify the agents that make changes in this
   direction happen. We examine the role and authority of a new type of
   actor that has recently emerged on the global stage-the social
   entrepreneur, who tackles social and ecological problems with
   entrepreneurial means. We consider them as agents that perform functions
   and provide services that have been considered to be the sole authority
   of states. For instance, the provision of water services has long been
   considered an exclusive task of the state. The water sector therefore
   serves as a good example to explore how these agents come up with their
   own missions and political agendas. Via an illustrative sample of social
   entrepreneurs from around the world, we explore their relation to water
   governance in general and the hydraulic mission in particular. We
   propose that their innovative potential serves as their main source of
   authority. Their local embeddedness along with their educational
   efforts, participatory goals, and accreditation as ``social
   entrepreneur{''} provide additional sources of authority.},

Abstract = {The twentieth century saw a dramatic change in the way information was
   generated as probability sampling replaced full enumeration. We examine
   some key events of the past and issues being addressed today to gain
   perspective on the requirements that might steer changes in the
   direction of survey sampling in the future. The potential for online Web
   panels and other methods that do not use probability sampling are
   considered. Finally, we conclude with some thoughts on how the future of
   survey sampling might be shaped by unpredictable factors.},

Booktitle = {MAX STIRNER},
Series = {Critical Explorations in Contemporary Political Thought},
Year = {2011},
Pages = {143-164},
Abstract = {Max Stirner has often been considered a Young Hegelian, or even the
   `last Hegelian'. Such a reading implies that Stirner drew the logical
   conclusions of Hegel's philosophy, thereby ignoring the way his thought
   marks a fundamental break with the philosophical tradition as a whole.
   Stirner's notions of `egoism', `ownness' and `Der Einzige' ('the ego')
   were not philosophical concepts but, in a Foucauldian sense, tools to
   dismantle the subject-object dichotomy and its social and political
   bearings in the wake of modernity. It is argued, furthermore, that his
   ideas cannot be reduced to a traditional philosophy of the subject
   (existentialism). This chapter analyses both Stirner's quest to
   `dissolve' philosophy, as well as its radical implications for political
   theory as a whole. Stirner's notion of Der Einzige not only questions
   the revolutionary subject in a strictly Marxist sense, but eventually
   any form of (political) subjectivity. Stirner's radical criticism of the
   emancipatory claims of his contemporaries allows us to question and
   rethink the concepts of contemporary social and political theory, not
   only by criticizing the way political power is commonly conceived and by
   refraining from positing essentialist guarantees, but also by laying
   bare the problem of political subjectivity.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN SECURITY},

Volume = {20},
Number = {3},
Pages = {405-430},
Abstract = {Three European Union (EU) member states - the UK, France and Germany -
   have played a central role in the Iranian nuclear issue since 2003.
   However, their contribution cannot be understood without consideration
   of America's hard-line approach regarding its recent non-proliferation
   policies in the Middle East and its past policies toward the Islamic
   Republic. I argue that these policies have highlighted Iran's military
   and energy insecurity, and that they cast doubt on the limited nature of
   the demands made to Iran by the Security Council. The fact that European
   positions have in recent years moved closer to the US also with respect
   to the key issues that contribute to Iran's lack of trust can actually
   be seen to undermine the goals of non-proliferation diplomacy.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN SECURITY},

Abstract = {This article analyzes which role the Atlantic Alliance plays in the
   Arctic and whether it can contribute to the security and territorial
   integrity of its members in the region. In a dramatic change from the
   cold war era, the Arctic is no longer at the center of a conflict
   between two hostile superpowers. But what can a basically military
   organization such as NATO - though with proven political functions -
   contribute to stabilizing the Arctic region if its major challenges are
   non-military? With regional challenges resulting mostly from
   globalization and climate change, it is open to question whether a
   military alliance such as NATO has the will and the capability to cope
   with them. We might thus need to look also at individual members'
   interests and abilities besides searching for joint alliance action. If
   we find NATO not up to the challenges, which alternative institutions
   offer themselves for coping with the political conflicts and
   controversies in the Polar region?},

Abstract = {We investigate the impact of historically rooted domestic constructions
   of purpose and ambition on the patterns of discord and collaboration in
   the Franco-American relationship over the course of the postwar and
   post-cold war periods. We stress the importance and tenacity of domestic
   historical constructions for explaining and understanding the foreign
   policy strategies that would otherwise confound a power-based analysis.
   The Franco-American bilateral relationship, in particular, illustrates
   the persistence and tenacity of each nation's historically constructed
   foreign policy conception during the bipolar distribution of power
   during the cold war and the contested unipolarity of the post-cold war
   era. We conclude with an assessment of the salience and relevance of
   domestic elements of foreign policy role and purpose for explaining and
   understanding how their bilateral relationship has affected the European
   security order into the second decade of the twenty-first century.},

Abstract = {This article examines the proliferation of communities that
   self-identify as indigenous peoples by looking at the Ogiek, Sengwer,
   Endorois and Pokot of western Kenya. It shows how community leaders have
   self-consciously employed a global discourse of indigeneity - and
   associated ideas of territorial association, marginalisation and
   especial vulnerability - to strengthen moral and legal claims to land
   and resources, to access new domains of action and cultivate new
   channels of patronage. The analysis also highlights how this process,
   together with similar developments across Africa, Asia and the Middle
   East, has prompted a re-evaluation and stretching of this global
   signifier at the supra-state level. Finally, the article reveals how the
   emergence of a new global space has provided new opportunities and
   strong incentives to renegotiate local ``nationalisms'' in a struggle
   for ownership and control of communal terroir, while factionalism has
   fed into, supported and fundamentally altered supra-national
   definitions.},

Abstract = {This study assessed the accuracy of telephone and Internet surveys of
   probability samples and Internet surveys of non-probability samples of
   American adults by comparing aggregate survey results against
   benchmarks. The probability sample surveys were consistently more
   accurate than the non-probability sample surveys, even after
   post-stratification with demographics. The non-probability sample survey
   measurements were much more variable in their accuracy, both across
   measures within a single survey and across surveys with a single
   measure. Post-stratification improved the overall accuracy of some of
   the non-probability sample surveys but decreased the overall accuracy of
   others. Higher completion and response rates of the surveys were
   associated with less accuracy. Accuracy did not appear to change from
   2004/2005 to 2009 for any of the methods, and these conclusions are
   reinforced by data collected in 2008 as well. These results are
   consistent with the conclusion that non-probability samples yield data
   that are neither as accurate as nor more accurate than data obtained
   from probability samples.},

Abstract = {Justice, by and large, implies greater legitimacy and can persuade
   parties with conflicting interests to cooperate more closely on
   collective actions. Therefore, the aim of this article is to investigate
   the role that ethical arguments have played in restoring mutual trust
   between the developed and the developing countries in negotiations on
   the Kyoto Protocol Adaptation Fund and in transforming the patent
   failure of the Subsidiary Body for Implementation Bonn May 2006 meetings
   on its management into the encouraging success of the Nairobi December
   2006 round. These meetings are analysed from the perspectives of
   procedural and distributive justice in order to interpret the
   negotiating dynamics and their outcomes. More specifically, procedural
   and distributive justice are, respectively, sought in the Bonn and
   Nairobi formal meetings through reference to, and the emergence of,
   principles and criteria of participation, recognition and distribution
   of power among Parties, and of Parties' responsibility for, and
   vulnerability to, climate impacts.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the emerging state-business alliance and its impact
   on international trade policy making through interplays between China
   and the United States. The paper examines the dispute over intellectual
   property rights between the two economies based on Putnam's two-level
   game approach. It analyzes the policy option chosen by China, and its
   impact on Washington's shift of policy preferences in result of the
   rival competition between the Boeing Corporation and the Microsoft. The
   findings suggest that (1) the intercompany contest drives a politically
   rival market, where the government sides with one state-business
   alliance, other industries are forced out of this contest in influencing
   trade policy preference; (2) rival states might acknowledge and utilize
   such competition to press the target state to change its policy
   priority, and (3) companies tend to compete to form such state-business
   alliances for creating favorable conditions in international trade.},

Abstract = {There are legitimate concerns about the health and sustainability of the
   Taiwan Studies field. However our understanding of the contours of the
   field, indeed our understanding of what Taiwan studies means, is
   limited. Using newly collected empirical data on research output and a
   survey of the attitudes of Taiwan scholars in the west and in Taiwan,
   this article provides a starting point for mapping the field. The
   article finds that, while generally buoyant, Taiwan studies faces
   several divisions, for example between western and Taiwan-based
   scholars, between English and Chinese language research and between area
   specialists and disciplinary specialists. These divisions contribute to
   a research field that, as we show empirically, is relatively low on
   collaboration, is dominated by political science, and is disseminated in
   lower impact journals. The article concludes with some suggestions for
   addressing these problems.},

Title = {Choice or Circumstance? Adjusting Measures of Foreign Policy Similarity
   for Chance Agreement},

Abstract = {The similarity of states' foreign policy positions is a standard
   variable in the dyadic analysis of international relations. Recent
   studies routinely rely on Signorino and Ritter's (1999, Tau-b or not
   tau-b: Measuring the similarity of foreign policy positions.
   International Studies Quarterly 43:115-44) S to assess the similarity of
   foreign policy ties. However, S neglects two fundamental characteristics
   of the international state system: foreign policy ties are relatively
   rare and individual states differ in their innate propensity to form
   such ties. I propose two chance-corrected agreement indices, Scott's
   (1955, Reliability of content analysis: The case of nominal scale
   coding. The Public Opinion Quarterly 19:321-5) pi and Cohen's (1960, A
   coefficient of agreement for nominal scales. Educational and
   Psychological Measurement 20:37-46) kappa, as viable alternatives. Both
   indices adjust the dyadic similarity score for a large number of common
   absent ties. Cohen's kappa also takes into account differences in
   individual dyad members' total number of ties. The resulting similarity
   scores have stronger face validity than S. A comparison of their
   empirical distributions and a replication of Gartzke's (2007, The
   capitalist peace. American Journal of Political Science 51: 166-91)
   study of the `Capitalist Peace' indicate that the different types of
   measures are not substitutable.},

Year = {2011},
Volume = {11},

Abstract = {Despite international calls for data and information sharing in
   transboundary waters and basin-specific evidence of its importance to
   cooperative management, no systematic research has been undertaken to
   answer questions of where, how frequently, and which water resources
   data and information are exchanged. This paper examines all available
   transboundary water agreements signed between 1900 and 2007 to determine
   the degree to which water resources data and information is exchanged in
   the world's regions, how the level of exchange has developed over time,
   and the different ways in which data and information sharing has been
   codified in practice. In doing so, we reveal important trends regarding
   the mechanisms, types, and frequencies of water resources data and
   information sharing-as well as differences across temporal and spatial
   scales, by treaty type and function, and regime type. The results
   indicate that data and information exchange as already practiced is more
   nuanced and, in some senses, widespread than may commonly be recognized.
   Further, the results reveal key linkages between democracy and data and
   information exchange and provide a basis to test analogous linkages
   related to data sharing and other variables in transboundary water
   settings.},

Abstract = {By imagining their audiences, intellectuals invented and constructed the
   collective identities of nations and transnational communities like
   Europe or humankind. Four ideal types of intellectuals are outlined by
   describing them in their relation to politics: the intellectual as
   cosmopolitan ascetic; the intellectual as enlightened legislator; the
   intellectual as revolutionary; and the intellectual as the voice of a
   traumatic memory. These ideal types change over time in response to
   their focus of attention and their mode of communication. Because of
   changes in their media (from handwritten to printed books) and changes
   in their written language (from Latin to French and Italian, and further
   to vernacular languages), intellectuals were able to change views on
   past, present and future times. Today, they are involved in (civic)
   resistance but rarely in politics per se. By renewing the tension of the
   sacred and profane - the so-called axial-age revolution - contemporary
   intellectuals in Eastern Europe are decoupled from direct political
   power.},

Title = {Kurdish Transnational Politics and Turkey's Changing Kurdish Policy: The
   Journey of Kurdish Broadcasting from Europe to Turkey},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY EUROPEAN STUDIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {19},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {523-533},
Abstract = {The bulk of scholarship on EU-Turkey relations has focused mainly on
   intergovermental or state-society relations, while the larger literature
   on enlargement and Europeanization has hardly paid any attention to the
   role of diasporas and immigrant communities as relevant political
   entrepreneurs in Europeanization processes. In this article, I examine
   the role and impact of the Kurdish diaspora and the transnational
   politics of Kurds on recent policy changes in Turkey, with respect to
   Kurdish broadcasting. Until 1990, the Turkish state officially denied
   the very existence of Kurds, today Turkish state television broadcasts
   programs in the Kurdish language. Other reforms have taken place as
   well. This has often been explained as a result of EU conditionality,
   yet, no studies have explored the fact that all of these different
   aspects of Kurdish cultural and educational activities that have begun
   to take shape in Turkey were actually first developed and implemented in
   Europe, by Kurdish organizations themselves. The analysis of ROJ-TV in
   Europe shows that this Kurdish satellite channel is a paradigmatic
   example of how `the diaspora strikes back'. I argue that the emergence
   of a state-sponsored Kurdish channel in Turkey is a further reaction by
   the Government to the existence of ROJ-TV in Europe, after initial
   efforts to shut down the station failed. I conclude that for a
   comprehensive understanding of Turkey's reform process the transnational
   activism of the Kurdish diaspora has to be taken into account.},

Title = {The European Union's counter-terrorism policy towards the Maghreb:
   trapped between democratisation, economic interests and the fear of
   destabilisation},
Journal = {EUROPEAN SECURITY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {20},
Number = {3},
Pages = {431-451},
Abstract = {This article sheds light on the European Union's counter-terrorism
   policy in the Maghreb taking into account the diverse influences and
   interests shaping its strategic thinking. To explain the complex web of
   opportunities and constraints, the article refers to Terry Deibel's
   framework for the analysis of foreign and security affairs. The author
   concludes that the Union's counter-terrorism policy in the Maghreb has
   been shaped more by the desire for regional stability and greater trade
   relations and energy security than by the goal of promoting democratic
   values and human rights. Moreover, the promotion of democracy is
   perceived by EU policy-makers as a destabilising factor that could
   endanger counter-terrorism efforts.},

Title = {Making sense of EU comprehensive security towards conceptual and
   analytical clarity},
Journal = {EUROPEAN SECURITY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {20},
Number = {2},
Pages = {221-241},
Abstract = {European leaders frequently vaunt the European Union's distinctiveness
   in adopting and pursuing a comprehensive approach to security. The EU's
   profile as an international actor is designed to span across all
   dimensions of security. As a result, its security policy portfolio
   involves a large number of institutional actors and policies that need
   to be coordinated. The ambition of the EU to provide security in a
   comprehensive manner raises challenges at the politico -strategic level,
   at the level of operational and policy planning and in day-to-day
   implementation. So far, the field is lacking an inclusive analytical
   framework for the analysis of providing security through a distinctively
   comprehensive civil - military, economic and political organisation.
   This article seeks to close this gap by providing suggestions for how
   the wide range of issues related to comprehensive security could be
   structured, and by framing the matter theoretically and with reference
   to existing conceptual work and empirical research.},

Abstract = {The Aegean conflict is the main bilateral bone of contention between
   Greece and Turkey. The paper presents the little-known two instances of
   meaningful Greek-Turkish talks on the Aegean (in 1975-81 and 2002-3)
   highlighting points of convergence. The parameters of a settlement are
   obvious yet the conflict remains in place after 40 years, not permitting
   Greek-Turkish reconciliation. The main reason for the impasse is that
   behind the tangible interests at stake lie mutual fears and mistrust as
   to the intentions of the other party in the Aegean. This is but the tip
   of the iceberg of what is a deeply engrained antagonism founded on
   historical memories, real or imagined, that depict the `Other' as the
   implacable enemy.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY EUROPEAN STUDIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {19},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {535-546},
Abstract = {This article examines an overly optimistic portrayal of the EU and its
   relationship with Turkey within the context of an essentialist framework
   for the dynamics of Turkish politics. It critically scrutinises
   conventional understandings of the dynamics of Turkey's domestic
   politics. It professes that relying upon outdated models of domestic
   political cleavages is not sufficient to understand the key dynamics of
   Turkey's EU accession process. The article analyses Turkey's interaction
   with Europe by incorporating, but also moving beyond, the narrow
   confines of dichotomous thinking: the West-East divide, modern versus
   traditional, global-local and secular pitted against Islamicist. Drawing
   upon the contemporary academic literature in Europe and Turkey, the
   article advances an alternative analytical perspective in order to
   understand better the dynamic changes within Turkey and Europe.},

Abstract = {We report results from two statewide experiments in Washington designed
   to test potential methods for using postal mail to obtain survey
   responses over the Internet from address-based samples of general public
   households. The five methods we test are: 1) sending Web and mail modes
   of response sequentially; 2) providing a prepaid \$5 incentive; 3)
   offering an instruction card for responding over the Web; 4) sending the
   follow-up request by Priority Mail; and 5) providing an additional \$5
   incentive with this follow-up request. Results are evaluated from the
   standpoint of response rates, demographic representativeness of
   respondents, and survey costs and data collection times for Web and mail
   modes. We find that a ``Web-plus-mail{''} design-mailing an initial Web
   request followed by a mail request-with the prepaid incentive offers
   much potential for obtaining Internet responses. In addition, the mail
   follow-up to the initial Web request significantly increases overall
   response rates and improves respondent representativeness. However, the
   results also show that a mail-only design consistently obtains higher
   response rates and a demographically similar sample compared to
   Web-plus-mail. We also find significant challenges in obtaining a
   representative sample of respondents with either Web or mail modes and
   in realizing the potential cost and speed benefits of the Internet in
   using postal mail contacts.},

Abstract = {Mainwaring and Scully's concept of party system institutionalization
   (PSI) has greatly influenced the literature on parties and party
   systems. This article contributes to the ``revisionist{''} literature on
   PSI by exploring the recent evolution of the concept's four dimensions
   in Chile. It finds that the Chilean party system is not homogenously
   institutionalized (as conventionally argued) but is simultaneously
   frozen at the elite level and increasingly disconnected from civil
   society. In this regard, it approaches some recent descriptions of the
   Brazilian party system, a prototypical example of an ``inchoate{''}
   party system that has gained stability over time without developing
   roots in society. This article argues that the current
   operationalization of the concept of PSI is problematic. Not only should
   all four dimensions of the concept be simultaneously measured, probably
   through multiple indicators for each one, but their trends across time
   and space should also be better integrated into the concept's
   theoretical structure.},

Abstract = {In some Latin American nations, policy change occurs frequently, while
   in others it is stable, less prone to shifts with the prevailing
   political climate or shocks. The conditions under which institutional
   rules and the powers of key actors influence the capacity for governance
   vary, and this variation is seldom addressed in the literature. This
   project examines the effects of the interactions between key
   policymakers (the executive and the legislature) in Latin America on
   policy stability across different institutional frameworks. Countries
   with simultaneously strong executives and weak legislatures are shown to
   have unstable policy environments, as are countries with a history of
   unified government and, to a lesser extent, candidate-centered electoral
   systems.},

Abstract = {Ordinary citizens often welcome nonstate provision of public goods and
   social welfare, but government officials, particularly in nondemocratic
   and transitional systems, may view nonstate actors as political
   competitors. Drawing on a combination of qualitative and quantitative
   data from rural China, this paper finds that some kinds of nonstate
   participation in public goods and social welfare provision can actually
   make local officials more optimistic about their ability to implement
   state policies and elicit citizen compliance. Local officials often
   believe that coproduction of public goods and services with community
   groups in particular, often with community actors taking the lead, can
   build trust and social capital that can spill over into increased
   citizen compliance with state demands, a central element of state
   capacity. Simply increasing levels of public goods provision, however,
   is not associated positively with optimistic perceptions of local state
   authority and capacity. Moreover, other forms of nonstate participation
   such as coproduction between private businesses and local officials or
   substitutive provision by nonstate actors have less potential for
   building trust between officials and citizens and are not seen by
   officials as beneficial for increasing citizen compliance.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN SECURITY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {20},

Pages = {185-204},
Abstract = {This article examines the interplay of international institutions in
   Kosovo and aims at disentangling and explaining the emergence and
   persistence of this international `interim' regime. In 1999, the UN
   mission to Kosovo (UNMIK) and the Organisation for Security and
   Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) were the leading institutions in the
   civilian area following NATO's deployment of Kosovo Force (KFOR).
   Following the failed status talks on Kosovo, the EU's rule of law
   mission (EULEX) and the establishment of an International Civilian
   Office (ICO) have been set up in addition for increasing institutional
   complexity. The article analyses how institutional complexity is
   emerging and what strategies international institutions are applying
   when confronted with policy overlap. The paper finds that the emergence
   of institutional complexity in Kosovo is largely a result of historical
   lock-in effects. International institutions have developed two dominant
   strategies to cope with dense institutional spaces. First, they show
   signs of a functional convergence and a coordinated pooling of
   resources. Second, institutions have developed niche competences to
   avoid competition.},

Abstract = {The Wright brothers, Orville (1871-1948) and Wilbur (1867-1912), tested
   the first fixed-wing, motor-powered, heavier-than-air flying machine in
   1903 on the beaches of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. By 1911 they had
   improved their machines to such an extent that they were able to sell
   them to the U.S. Army. This also involved teaching some officers how to
   fly. This is why, the Wright Brothers taught First Lieutenant Henry
   ``Hap{''} Arnold (1886-1950) how to pilot an airplane. Arnold, a 1907
   graduate of West Point, over the next four decades, would rise to be the
   chief of the U.S. Army Air Corps throughout World War II, obtain the
   rank of a five-star General of the Army, then, as the founding head of
   the U.S. Air Force, in 1947 become the five-star General of the Air
   Force-the only person to hold such exalted rank in two services. In 1946
   Arnold initiated Project RAND to create a civilian organization that,
   under contract to the military, would undertake studies on the future
   role and capabilities of air power. Thus we have a direct line of
   continuity from the Wright brothers teaching Arnold the basics of
   aviation to Arnold contracting for an organization of intellectuals to
   continuously think about the prospects of aviation in the future. It is
   universally acknowledged that Arnold is the ``father{''} of the RAND
   Corporation; what is less widely known is that the Wright brothers are
   the ``grandfathers.{''}},

Abstract = {This article explores the different scalar dimensions of Berber
   masquerades in southeastern Morocco. By ritually performing Jewish
   characters and demonstrating philo-Semitic nostalgia for a former Jewish
   presence, Berber (Amazigh) activists simultaneously engage different
   audiences at a local, national and transnational scale. In the first
   place, they assert themselves as moderate (even secular) Muslims for a
   transnational audience for whom Muslims' supposed anti-Semitism has been
   a mode of excluding them from modernity. At the same time, their
   performances underline the specificity of Berber culture as part of a
   national folkloric archive, welcome to a Moroccan national state
   interested in forging an authentic, national Islamic practice distinct
   from pan-Islamic Wahhabism. Thirdly, in allying themselves with Jews,
   Berber activists distance themselves from a variety of rivals to local
   political and economic dominance, particularly black ``Haratin'' whose
   demographic and economic strength in the southeastern oases has
   increased since Moroccan independence. In exploring the confluences and
   contradictions between these different scales of activism, this article
   points to the internal fractures within social movements organised
   around religion or ethnicity.},

Title = {Constraints on and Options for Taiwan's Meaningful Participation in the
   Specialized Agencies of the United Nations},
Journal = {ISSUES \& STUDIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {47},
Number = {4},
Pages = {63-99},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In 2009 Taiwan became an observer to the World Health Assembly (WHA),
   the first time it had officially participated in a United Nations
   (UN-affiliated body since 1971. Encouraged by this success, Taiwan has
   sought to replicate the WHA model for other UN bodies such as the UN
   Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the International
   Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). Unfortunately, this breakthrough has
   not yet paved the way for Taiwan's participation in more UN-affiliated
   bodies. This paper analyzes (1) the WHA model and the concept of
   meaningful participation; (2) the four parameters (title, status, where,
   and how) Taiwan needs to consider in order to apply the WHA model to the
   specialized agencies of the UN; and (3) Taiwan's options for the future.
   This paper argues that to maximize Taiwan's chances of UN participation,
   the approach will not only have to take Mainland China's concerns into
   consideration, but also needs to be within the boundaries of the
   existing statutes and conventions without the need for a special
   exception to be made in Taiwan's favor Hence, it is suggested that
   Taiwan should seek to join the ICAO, IMF, WBG, WHO, and WMO with
   official governmental representation while simultaneously encouraging
   its civil society organizations (CSOs) to participate as
   non-governmental organization (NGO) observers in the FAO, ILO, IFAD,
   IMO, ITU, UNESCO, UNIDO, UPU, WIPO, and UNWTO. It is hoped that this
   two-pronged approach will maximize and accelerate Taiwan's participation
   in the specialized agencies of the United Nations.},

Year = {2011},
Volume = {75},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {The gender gap in support for war represents the largest and most
   consistent policy gender gap in public opinion polling. We know little
   about the causes of this gap, however, because scholars have not
   effectively isolated how or why the gender gap changes in response to
   the characteristics of different wars. We conducted two controlled
   experiments on demographically representative samples of U.S. adults to
   see if systematically varying the stakes of war (economic/strategic vs.
   humanitarian) or multilateral support for the action (U.N. approval vs.
   U.N. rejection) affects the size of the gender gap. We propose an
   interactive theoretical perspective that explicitly links these
   characteristics with key individual-level characteristics that might be
   driving the gender gap. Our findings indicate that the gender gap is
   strongly dependent on the specific context of the war. In fact, we find
   that the gender gap reverses when the war has U.N. approval or if the
   stakes of the war are humanitarian.},

Number = {2},

Abstract = {This article deals with the connection between nationality and democracy
   and explores the role Switzerland plays in the scholarly debate on this
   question. It identifies three main theses - liberal-nationalist,
   liberal-multinationalist and liberal-postnationalist - and shows that
   each of them uses the Swiss case to claim empirical support. It then
   analyses the connections between nationality and democracy in
   Switzerland and demonstrates that the country is neither multinational
   nor postnational, but is best characterised as a mononational state.
   These findings expose the fallacy of using Switzerland to claim support
   for either the multinational or the postnational thesis and call for a
   reconsideration of them. Additionally, they show that ``civic
   nationalism'' and ``civic republicanism'' can be conflated and that a
   predominantly civic nation is viable and sustainable and is not
   necessarily an ethnic nation in disguise. The Swiss case thus provides
   qualified empirical support for the liberal-nationalist thesis.},

Title = {The symbolism of the Arab flag in modern Arab states: between

Journal = {NATIONS AND NATIONALISM},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {17},
Number = {2},
Pages = {419-442},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The national flag, anthem and emblem are the three symbols through which
   an independent country proclaims its identity and sovereignty. Although
   each state has its distinctive flag, there are similarities in the flags
   of certain countries, such as in Scandinavia (the cross) and Africa
   (colours). These symbolise certain propinquity in terms of ideology,
   culture and history. Similarity is also to be found in the flags of the
   Arab countries: out of the twenty-two current members of the Arab
   League, ten share the same colours on their flags (green, white, black
   and red), while a certain Islamic symbol (eagle, star) in some flags
   represents the uniqueness of that country. Of the other twelve
   countries, most rely on one colour of the four (usually red or green)
   while nine use Islamic symbols (stars, crescent and sword) on their
   flags. In spite of the importance of this national symbol, the study of
   the modern Arab flag is almost non-existent. This article explores the
   modern evolution of the Arab flag and the reasons for the similarities
   in many Arab flags. In particular, it will deal with the pan-Arab flags
   of the Hashemites Kingdom of the Hijaz (1916-26), Jordan, Iraq,
   Palestine, Syria and Egypt.},

Abstract = {The patterns characterizing relations between Israel and the European
   Union comprise, firstly, repeatedly tense political ties that contrast
   with constantly deepening economic relations. Secondly the practice of
   bilateral relations markedly differs from their rhetoric. Thirdly,
   disagreements usually revolve around Middle East peacemaking. Finally,
   unlike the EU, Israel prefers disconnecting bilateral ties from regional
   politics. These patterns explain Israel's position and strategy toward
   the Union for the Mediterranean (UfM) and permit an assessment of the
   relevance of the latter for EU-Israeli relations. The conclusion is that
   the UfM is unlikely to alter the basic patterns of bilateral ties.},

Booktitle = {CASES IN PUBLIC POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION},
Year = {2011},
Pages = {104-113},
Abstract = {In every country and in every jurisdiction within that country, the
   public policy-making and administrative systems are different. There are
   always different leaders, different laws, different customs, and
   differing levels of corruption influencing the system. At the same time
   as they are different, however, they are also the same in that all
   policy-making systems share common elements. The first of which is that
   they are systems.
   The newest thing about systems thinking is theorizing about it as if it
   were new. However, ancients such as Aristotle and poets such as
   Shakespeare understood systems instinctively. Perhaps the best
   description of the human social system is that of the English poet John
   Donne (1572-1631). When he wrote that: ``No man is an island, entire of
   itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main,{''}
   he provided the preamble for modern social science. And when he
   concluded that `` any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved
   in mankind; and therefore, never send to know for whom the bell tolls
   {[} announcing a death]; it tolls for thee,{''} he explained why
   everyone has to understand the doctrines of systems theory. When Donne
   wrote that ``any man's death{''} diminished him, it was because he was
   `` involved in mankind{''}-meaning part of the same system. You are too!
   That is why, the following story from ancient China will help explain
   your place in the myriad systems in which we all live.},

Booktitle = {CASES IN PUBLIC POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION},
Year = {2011},
Pages = {211-219},
Abstract = {Dwight David ({''}Ike{''}) Eisenhower (1890-1969) was elected president
   of the United States in 1952 and reelected in 1956. He initially earned
   the confidence of his fellow citizens the same way George Washington,
   Andrew Jackson, and Ulysses S. Grant did: by being a victorious general.
   Eisenhower commanded all U.S. and Allied forces in Western Europe and
   the Mediterranean region during World War II. This case tells the story
   of how a now-obscure mentor taught Eisenhower what he needed to know to
   advance as a career military officer and eventually to the presidency.
   Both historians and Eisenhower himself agree that without this mentor's
   efforts at a critical point in Eisenhower's early career, D Day would
   have had a different commander and Eisenhower would not now be admired
   as one of the better presidents of the United States.},

Abstract = {We examine the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) market as form of
   cooperative involvement between developing-host and developed-investor
   countries, likely to evolve into a form of Foreign Direct Investment
   (FDI) with opportunities for further collaboration. We use three
   variables to measure the level of cooperation, namely number of joint
   CDM projects, volume of CO2 abatement realized from the CDM projects,
   and volume of investment in the CDM projects. We rely on international
   economics and international relations literature to suggest that the
   levels of economic development and institutional development, energy
   structures of the economies, country vulnerability to various climate
   change effects, political constraints, trade, and historic relations
   between the host and investor countries are good predictors of the level
   of cooperation in CDM projects. The main policy relevant conclusions
   include the importance of simplifying the CDM project
   regulation/clearance cycle as an essential policy option for further
   growth of joint CDM projects; improving governance structures in the
   host and investor countries that would lead to higher political
   stability and trust between the countries for business, including CDM;
   and strengthening trade or other long-term economic activities that
   connect the countries for fostering CDM cooperation.},

Abstract = {This paper appraises the state of the field on hybrid regimes by
   depicting the tensions and blurred boundaries of democracy and
   authoritarianism ``with adjectives.{''} An alternative conceptualization
   and ordering of regimes are subsequently introduced using a
   configurative approach. Rather than place regimes on a linear continuum
   from authoritarianism to democracy, it highlights the multi-dimensional
   arrangements possible for the construction of regime types. The
   configurative approach also provides an analytically useful way to
   measure and integrate hybrid regimes into our classificatory schemes. As
   a result, it helps alleviate the conceptual confusion in the literature
   and contributes to a discussion of hybrid regimes beyond the framework
   of authoritarianism. The paper concludes by presenting a list of all
   hybrid regimes in the world between 1990 and 2009 identified with this
   method.},

Abstract = {An increasing number of developing and emerging economies have adopted
   an inflation targeting framework for monetary policy during the last two
   decades. This article investigates the politics of inflation targeting
   by focusing on the case of Brazil. I argue that the decision to
   implement an inflation targeting system in 1999 did not only reflect the
   concerns of political leaders with maintaining electoral support and
   external credibility. In addition, the choice of this new policy
   approach was informed by a shift in the technical consensus among
   Brazilian economists about the most effective way to tame inflationary
   pressures in a context of high capital mobility. The shift to inflation
   targeting thus reflected a process of social learning among technical
   elites, facilitated not only by the failure of the previous policy but
   also by the successful experience of other inflation targeting
   countries. Moreover, the evidence presented here suggests that, as the
   first country to adopt inflation targets in the context of an
   IMF-supported program, Brazil became a test case and a natural
   experiment for the redefinition of IMF conditionality and surveillance
   mechanisms. The paper thus sheds light on a process of reciprocal
   learning, whereby the IMF not only contributed to collective learning
   but also learned from the Brazilian case, subsequently becoming an
   active promoter of inflation targeting among developing countries.},

Abstract = {While much has been written about democracy and democratization, far
   less attention has been paid to the institutional organization of
   authoritarian regimes. Scholars have focused on the causes, economic
   policies, societal support, intra-elite conflicts, or human-rights
   violations of authoritarian regimes. More recently, political scientists
   have also studied the role of elections and legislatures on the survival
   of authoritarian regimes. However, the very different ways in which
   authoritarian regimes, and military regimes in particular, organize the
   government, occupy the state apparatus, and modify the country's
   political institutions have largely gone under-theorized. This essay
   contributes to fill in this void by analyzing how the last military
   regimes of Argentina (1976-1983) and Brazil (1964-1985) organized power
   within the state and the legacies of such organization on the
   institutions of federalism. The essay argues that variation in the
   organization of the state under the military regimes accounts for the
   divergent origins of post-developmental decentralization, which in turn
   explains the contrasting evolution of intergovernmental relations in
   each country. The article contributes to the recent literature on
   electoral authoritarian regimes by showing that elections and
   legislatures matter not only to regime survival but also to policy
   outcomes.},

Abstract = {Survey researchers have asserted several reasons why responses in cell
   phone interviews may be less accurate than responses in landline
   interviews. Somewhat surprisingly, studies comparing response quality
   from landline and cell phone interviews have found minimal differences.
   These studies were not entirely conclusive, however, because landline
   and cell RDD respondent samples are known to differ systematically with
   respect to more than just the device. It is possible that differences in
   sample composition confounded prior device comparisons. This study
   reduces that confound substantially by randomly assigning people to be
   interviewed on either their landline or their cell phone in a two-wave
   experimental design. The findings are generally consistent with the
   literature, showing no evidence of a device effect on most metrics.
   These results are encouraging for researchers designing surveys that
   feature cell phone data collection.},

Abstract = {Some researchers have argued that respondents give more extreme answers
   to questions involving response scales over the telephone than in other
   modes of data collection, but others have argued that telephone
   respondents give more positive answers. We conducted a meta-analysis
   based on 18 experimental comparisons between telephone interviews and
   another mode of data collection. Our analysis showed that telephone
   respondents are significantly more likely than respondents in other
   modes to give extremely positive answers (for example, the highest
   satisfaction ratings in a customer satisfaction survey) but are not more
   likely to give extremely negative responses. This tendency to give
   highly positive ratings appears to be related to the presence of an
   interviewer, and it may reflect respondents' reluctance to express bad
   news, a tendency some social psychologists have dubbed the MUM effect.},

Abstract = {The three Rio Conventions-the United Nations Framework Convention on
   Climate Change, the Convention on Biological Diversity, and the United
   Nations Convention to Combat Desertification-face the challenge to
   create synergies at different levels. The objective of this article is
   to describe how we have assessed synergies between the Rio Conventions
   at the project level in the forest sector. Since the complexity of the
   decision problem is high, we adopted the Multicriteria Decision Aid
   approach, which can provide a broad insight into the decision problem
   and find a compromise solution to a problem with multidimensional and
   conflicting criteria including social, economic and environmental
   features. The ELECTRE TRI model was used for assessing synergies at the
   project level, and has been a useful tool to quantify the performance of
   afforestation and reforestation projects into three categories
   (synergistic, reasonably synergistic, and not synergistic). For the
   first time, afforestation and reforestation projects have been assessed
   in a comprehensive way through decision criteria that reflect global and
   local interests using a non-compensatory multicriteria method.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the impact of different models of public/private
   partnerships for refugee relief. Through case studies of different
   refugee relief programs in China, the paper shows that philanthropists
   are attractive but risky partners for state officials in welfare
   provision. Their cooperation can indeed expand access to welfare,
   improve state capacity, and enhance state/society relations. But because
   philanthropists can control significant resources and gain considerable
   social prestige, weak states can find it very difficult to control and
   contain them. In some circumstances, the relationship can turn
   competitive, and philanthropists can even threaten the state's efforts
   to expand its capacity and build up its own legitimacy. The key to the
   balance of power between state officials and private philanthropists is
   control over the funding for the partnership.},

Abstract = {This article discusses the transformation of the Moroccan state under
   contemporary neoliberal globalization, and considers what this
   transition means for the ways in which scholars view state-society
   interplay in Morocco and the Arab world more generally. Specifically, it
   examines the protest of unemployed graduates in Morocco, suggesting that
   public demonstrations are not only a means to communicate and mobilize
   demands, but also a technology to reclaim and reproduce a particular
   `truth' in public. This truth does not necessarily equate with the
   reality of the neoliberal state as a dispersed material force. As such,
   by looking at the case of Morocco, we hope to instigate further debate
   on the nature of the state and its specific relation to phenomena as
   globalization, society and social protest.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN SECURITY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {20},
Number = {2},
Pages = {205-219},
Abstract = {Drawing on a neoclassical realist approach, this article analyses the
   foreign policy conduct of different Italian governments from 1994 to
   2008. Pressured by the post-cold war international system, these
   governments have been compelled to raise Italy's profile within the
   international system. However, the way in which successive governments
   have responded has differed markedly. By looking at variables located at
   the domestic level - elite perceptions of the distribution of power and
   government instability - it is possible to explain these differences.
   Neoclassical realism is seen as an advance on Waltzian neo-realism
   precisely because it allows room for domestic as well as international
   (or systemic) variables, and because it has a very specific focus on
   foreign policy as such.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN SECURITY},

Volume = {20},

Pages = {529-546},
Abstract = {The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation's (NATOs) changing role was
   debated in the face of the Strategic Concept adopted in late 2010. Two
   main roles can be identified in the debate; that of NATO as a defence
   organisation and a security organisation. The article analyses the
   implications of these roles for security governance and the Alliance's
   legitimacy - with emphasis on the novelties associated with the role of
   NATO as a security organisation. This development suggests an increasing
   need for security governance, something which is reflected in the
   debate. However, how for instance decision-making and implementation
   function in a more fragmented environment is unclear. If NATO develops
   its role as a security organisation new audiences are introduced that
   determine its appropriateness and the basis of the Alliance's input and
   output legitimacy changes.},

Title = {Care, Gender and Migration: Towards a Theory of Transnational Domestic
   Work Migration in Europe},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY EUROPEAN STUDIES},

Volume = {19},

Pages = {349-364},
Abstract = {In this article the authors discuss their analytical concept, developed
   through and for the exploration of forms and dynamics of transnational
   labour and care arrangements in domestic work migration. Firstly, on the
   institutional level they highlight the interplay between three national
   regimes (of migration, gender and welfare/care) to clarify the specific
   dynamic of transnational care migration. Secondly, based on
   intersectionality analysis, the institutional level is linked to the
   meso and micro levels of networks/organizations and individuals, to
   explore how these institutional regimes act as an
   opportunity/obstruction structure - either as a source of assets or a
   cause of marginalization, or both. Thirdly, by adopting the dual
   transnational perspective of both the sending and the receiving society,
   transnational social spaces are shown as the migrants' action frame of
   reference. Finally, a cross-national comparative study of two cases of
   transnational East-West migration (from Ukraine to Poland and from
   Poland to Germany) can provide new insights into the relationship
   between transnational migration, gender and care regimes on the one
   hand, and the migrants' arrangements for labour and care on the other.},

Abstract = {In POQ's early years, survey data appeared only occasionally in articles
   and a focus on methodology was even less common. Today, by contrast, it
   is rare to find a POQ article that is not based on survey data, and many
   social scientists think of the journal as the leading forum for research
   on survey methodology. This sea change would have surprised the
   journal's founders and seems far from inevitable. An account of how and
   why the change occurred must answer at least two questions. First, what
   led a journal whose mandate was the study of public opinion in its
   widest sense to publish analyses based almost exclusively on sample
   surveys? Second, given the concentration on survey research, what led to
   an emphasis on methodology? This article focuses on the second question
   by examining the balance between substance and method over the journal's
   three-quarters of a century. It considers four kinds of evidence: the
   papers published in POQ; the POQ papers that have been the most
   influential; the POQ editors; and the authors who have appeared most
   often in POQ.},

Abstract = {Through a comparison of three periods of health and pension reform in
   Chile, this article develops an explanation for the incremental form of
   social policy change that some Latin American nations have witnessed in
   recent years, despite the dramatic rise of left governments. It
   describes postretrenchment politics, which constitutes a realignment in
   the way politics plays out in countries that have undergone social
   policy retrenchment. In postretrenchment politics, the strengthened
   position of private business interests, combined with political learning
   legacies and lock-in effects generated by reforms, results in
   incremental political change, despite renewed efforts by left parties to
   address inequality. Global capital also plays an important contextual
   role, and may influence postretrenchment politics. In postretrenchment
   politics, newly reformed systems may achieve greater equity, but they do
   so in fragmented form.},

Abstract = {How do societies make complex choices about concrete energy
   alternatives? Can citizens play effective roles in balancing risks and
   benefits? This article proposes that energy choices can be best
   understood as the result of a balance of power between state-society
   coalitions that aim to either block or enable the project. Environmental
   licensing and financing decisions are two decision points where the
   coalitions face off-and where energy projects go forward or are stopped.
   The article demonstrates that environmental licensing has become an
   unexpectedly stringent process in Brazil, with both formal opportunities
   and historic practices increasing the influence of blocking coalitions.
   Yet case studies of the Belo Monte hydroelectric dam and massive new
   petroleum reserves in the ``pre-salt{''} region show that blocking
   coalitions emerge inconsistently in the same institutional context,
   illustrating the hazards of relying on public mobilization for
   addressing certain kinds of risk situations. An ``anticipatory state{''}
   may also pre-empt mobilization by proactively responding to the concerns
   blocking coalitions are likely to raise.},

Abstract = {This article studies voter behavior in Argentina. Do voters vote based
   on issues? Do they vote based on economic performance? What segments of
   the population are more or less likely to do so? What is the relative
   impact of issues and the economy in vote choice? To provide a reliable
   answer to these questions, this study uses a mixed-logit model of
   spatial voting with nonpolicy components. Contrary to the common belief,
   the analysis finds that issue voting is a statistically significant and
   important factor. Economic voting is prevalent in the middle and upper
   classes, but not among poor voters.},

Abstract = {China's policy in Darfur offers a significant case study of how Beijing
   reconciles the pursuit of short-term gains with the need to secure its
   long-term interests by responding to the expectations of the
   international community. Oil is important but no longer the sole
   strategic factor in China's foreign policy calculus. China's prosperity
   and strength and the respect it commands in the international community
   are now the most important sources of its regime's legitimacy. In this
   way, China's quest for international recognition as a major power
   constitutes on important part of the Communist Party's mandate to rule
   domestically. China's traditional claim of non-interference in the
   domestic affairs of other states is giving way to a broader definition
   of national interests and a greater willingness to embrace global
   institutions and international norms. China's engagement in Darfur
   should therefore be perceived as part of its wider foreign policy
   adjustment process involving a changing attitude toward ``rogue
   states,{''} multilateral diplomacy, and human rights issues.},

Abstract = {Despite the recent shift to democratic regimes and market-based
   economies, in many Latin American countries the military retains
   important economic roles as owner, manager, and stakeholder in economic
   enterprises. Such military entrepreneurship poses a challenge to the
   development of democratic civil-military relations and, by extension, to
   the development of liberal democracy in the region. While scholars have
   noted this situation with concern, they have given little attention to
   distinguishing the different types of military entrepreneurship, which
   reflect distinct historical patterns and implications. This article
   identifies two major types of military entrepreneurs in Latin America:
   industrializers, determined to build national defense capabilities and
   compete for international prestige; and nation builders, seeking to
   promote economic development that can foster social development and
   cohesion. Case studies of Argentina, Brazil, Cuba, and Ecuador
   demonstrate important differences between these two types in their
   origins, paths, and political consequences.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to decide whether a preemptive strike is
   a better option for a weaker power at the beginning of an asymmetric
   military conflict. The author examines five possible situations in the
   Taiwan Strait crisis via normal form game, extensive form game, and
   mixed strategy, in order to discover why a weaker power might choose to
   launch a preemptive strike under certain circumstances. The findings
   show that no matter whether two or three countries are involved in armed
   conflict in the Strait or whether such an asymmetric conflict is
   initiated by Taiwan or China, it would always be in Taiwan's interest to
   assert preemption, assuming conflict has become inevitable. Given
   situations of incomplete information, the results still hold. This
   presents strong evidence that a weaker power facing unavoidable armed
   conflict should strike first. This study also proves that the threat
   need not be ``imminent{''}; it need only be ``inevitable.{''}},

Abstract = {This article examines the nexus between financial activism and global
   environmental governance, analyzing the emergence of what we call
   ``investor-driven governance networks{''} (IGNs). Our paper seeks to
   probe the significance of IGNs as a particular manifestation of
   responsible investor activism and more generally as a financial
   instrument of environmental governance and sustainability. We argue that
   IGNs, many of which are concerned with climate change governance, have
   become important actors in the global economy and deserve more analysis
   by scholars concerned with new forms of authority in global
   environmental politics. As an example of emerging transnational private
   governance, IGNs utilize the power of the financial sector to shape the
   discourse on climate change within the business community and to link
   the long-term viability of environmental sustainability to the core
   strategic interests of corporations and investors.},

Abstract = {In recent years, a system of ``province leading counties{''}
   (sheng-guanxian) is rising in most Chinese provinces. The main features
   of this administrative reform, which took place during the period
   2002-2008, were the expansion of counties' administrative and economic
   powers and the implementation of a ``province leading counties{''}
   fiscal system. The depth of this reform, in terms of the number of
   powers devolved to counties and the type of local fiscal system, varied
   widely between provinces. This article explores the experiences of the
   provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Jilin and seeks to explain why and
   how the ``province leading counties{''} policy has become increasingly
   popular. The article suggests that even though the stated aim of the
   reform is to promote the economic development of counties, the
   significant local variation in its implementation is the result of
   provincial political-economic factors, that is to say, interaction
   between the provincial leadership, private business, and the varying
   capabilities of prefecture-level cities and counties. This contrasts
   with the view of some scholars that variations in the intensity of the
   reform can be attributed to differing levels of marketization and
   economic development among provinces.},

Abstract = {Although methodologists have provided us ample notice of both the
   problem of nonproportional hazards (NPHs) and the means of correcting
   for them, less attention has been paid to the postestimation
   interpretation. The suggested inclusion of time interactions in our
   models is more than a statistical fix: These corrections alter the
   substantive meaning and interpretation of results. Framing the issue as
   a specific case of multiplicative-interaction modeling, I provide
   detailed discussion of the problem of NPHs and present several
   appropriate means of interpreting both the substantive impact and the
   significance of variables whose effects may change over time.},

Journal = {LATIN AMERICAN POLITICS AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {53},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {This article addresses the relationship between institutionalized
   citizen participation at the municipal level and clientelism. It argues,
   contrary to what the literature has suggested, that the
   institutionalization of local citizen participation does not necessarily
   lead to the erosion of clientelism. Drawing on a comparative case study
   of participatory experiences in two Mexican municipalities, Leon and
   Nezahualcoyotl, this study argues that participation does matter, but
   that not all types of participation have the same effect on
   state-society relations. Institutional design is important in assessing
   the significance of popular participation in defining the relationship
   between the state and its citizens, but informal practices are even more
   important determinants of citizens' level of autonomy in
   institutionalized participatory mechanisms. This level of autonomy, in
   turn, determines the potential for such local institutions to become a
   means to overcome clientelism as the mechanism traditionally
   characterizing state-society relationships in Mexico.},

   secure ethics},
Journal = {EUROPEAN SECURITY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {20},
Number = {3},
Pages = {453-471},
Abstract = {This article argues that Critical Security Studies (CSS), exemplified by
   Ken Booth's Theory of World Security, has outlined an ethics of security
   as emancipation of the `human', but also a highly problematic security
   of ethics. After drawing out how the ethics of CSS operates, we examine
   the security of this ethics by examining it against a hard case, that of
   the 1998-99 Kosovo crisis. Confronting this concrete situation, we draw
   out three possibilities for action used at the time to secure the human:
   `humanitarian containment', military intervention and hospitality.
   Assessing each against Booth's requirements for ethical security action,
   we counter that, in fact, no option was without risks, pitfalls and
   ambiguities. Ultimately, if any action to promote the security and the
   emancipation of the human is possible, it must embrace and prioritise
   the fundamental insecurity of ethics, or else find itself paralysed
   through a fear of making situations worse.},

Volume = {19},

Pages = {547-561},
Abstract = {France is well known for providing working parents with formal childcare
   arrangements and generous benefits aimed at reducing costs for families.
   Currently, and despite a general tightening of purse strings in the
   social security administration, childcare policy has continued to see
   increases in funding and remains a growth area in the French welfare
   state. Yet reforms introduced periodically since the mid-1980s
   illustrate clearly the growing influence employment policies are having
   on childcare provisions. For all the rhetoric devoted to the promotion
   of `freedom of choice' for parents in the childcare sector evidence
   suggests a different set of priorities. In reality, the impetus to
   increase the number of options for the placement of children in
   supervised care derives from the desire to bring more mothers into the
   workforce while at the same time satisfying the increasing demands
   placed on employees through the development of flexible work schedules
   and in particular non-standard work hours.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN SECURITY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {20},

Pages = {103-116},
Abstract = {The determination of the USA to `reset its relationship' with Russia has
   been a major security policy objective for the current US
   Administration. An admirable objective, it has proved more illusive than
   anticipated. But a focus on `cooperative engagement'(1) that selectively
   addresses areas of common interests such as Iranian nuclear
   developments, a range of issues dealing with nuclear arms control,
   missile defense, and NATO-Russian relations (among others) could prove
   fruitful for both lessening tensions and establishing common agendas to
   resolve contentious issues. Important to that process will be enhancing
   institutions in order to assure longer-term productive relations that
   engage and vest both the USA and Russia. This more realistic approach of
   `cooperative engagement' within existing, but strengthened organizations
   would both `reset' the relationship and encourage relations that reach
   beyond cold war military thinking to sustained future cooperation.},

Abstract = {While economic explanations for the ``resource curse{''} are well
   established, the political factors explaining why governments fail to
   take corrective action remain poorly understood. Research demonstrates
   that if governments save oil profits abroad and slowly re-introduce the
   oil-generated revenue into the domestic economy once the rate of return
   on investment is greater at home than abroad and the quality of project
   implementation developed, many of the economic problems that plague
   oil-rich countries can be avoided. Political time horizons shape the
   incentives of governments to pursue this strategy. Unstable leaders rely
   on oil revenue to maintain positions of power. They also have less
   incentive to save oil windfalls abroad as they fear they will not be in
   office long enough to benefit from such decisions. This paper uses both
   quantitative data and case study analysis of Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan
   to demonstrate that leaders with longer time horizons save a greater
   proportion of oil windfalls abroad than their less stable counterparts,
   helping avoid the economic pitfalls of oil abundance.},

Abstract = {We argue that historically the official Turkish nationalism and
   citizenship regime have been marked by an ambiguity that arises from the
   simultaneous existence of - and repeatedly occurring swings between -
   the ethno-centric and civic-political understandings of citizenship. We
   also suggest that the concept of territoriality, which took precedence
   over other factors in the creation of a new state in 1923, has
   functioned as a hegemonic reference in the official conceptualisations
   of the Turkish nation and self. The territorial focus, over time, has
   been conflated with the ethnic conceptualisations of the nation: both
   become the underlining elements of the discourse of official nationalism
   in Turkey, and are utilised in the successive reformulations of
   citizenship into the 2000s. Through the analysis of schoolbooks and
   curricula, we further argue that the major oscillations in nationalism
   nevertheless coincided with the ruptures that characterised the making
   of modern Turkey: modernisation, democratisation, globalisation and
   Europeanisation.},

Abstract = {In the face of global environmental change, a key question for the
   social sciences is how to organize the co-evolution of societies and
   their natural environment. In this context, a new long-term research
   program, the Earth System Governance Project, proposes several key
   issues to be examined: architecture, agency, adaptiveness,
   accountability, and allocation and access. The contributions to this
   special issue have focused on the analytical problem of agency. For
   example, they have examined newly emerging or understudied agents of
   global environmental governance, or offered a fresh assessment of agency
   in the context of existing governance mechanisms such as the Clean
   Development Mechanism. This concluding article outlines several insights
   provided by the contributions to this special issue regarding four key
   questions underlying the study of agency in global environmental
   governance. First, they call attention to the ingredients or processes
   that characterize agency in the first place and thus distinguish actors
   from agents. Secondly, the authors highlight the differences among
   agents and how they interact with each other. Thirdly, they point toward
   variation in the ways that agents may acquire authority. Finally, the
   contributions to this special issue suggest that there may be several
   approaches to evaluating agency, with different consequences. Thus,
   taken together, the contributions to this special issue provide a
   starting point for broadening our understanding of agency in earth
   system governance.},

Abstract = {This article explores the link between language policies and
   nation-building by focusing on the Turkish case during the early
   Republican period (1920-38). As opposed to conceptualising nation
   builders as seamlessly and strategically forming a nation out of the
   remnants of an empire, this article emphasises the complex and, at
   times, ambiguous nature of the nation-building process using Turkey as a
   case study. The article is also critical of ethno-symbolic accounts of
   nations and nation formation that tend to emphasise the cultural at the
   expense of the political sphere. Instead, by looking at the process and
   content of the formulation of language policies, this study demonstrates
   how culture was highly politicised during the formative period of the
   Turkish nation.},

Abstract = {This article is a critical comparison of the development in
   apprenticeship training in Britain with that in other European
   countries, particularly Germany. In both countries, the apprenticeship
   system displays high levels of gender segregation where men dominate the
   `traditional' apprenticeships in craft, technical and engineering
   occupations, while women dominate the mainly service or care sector
   occupations. Attempts to improve and expand apprenticeships in the UK,
   including tackling occupational segregation, are now unfolding in a
   climate of severe economic recession and public finance restraint. The
   article explores the extent to which increased financial investment and
   policy developments over recent years have improved apprenticeship
   training in Britain, with specific reference to gender-based
   occupational segregation and the impact of the global economic
   recession.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN SECURITY},

Volume = {20},

Pages = {363-383},
Abstract = {This article examines European and US approaches to police assistance in
   Afghanistan through the lens of strategic culture analysis. It is widely
   assumed that the Europeans are engaged in establishing a democratic,
   civilian police force in Afghanistan, while the US aim to transform the
   Afghan National Police (ANP) into a militarized auxiliary force of the
   Afghan army. Drawing on Kagan's famous dichotomy of Mars and Venus, the
   article first outlines the concept of strategic culture analysis with
   regard to US and European foreign policy strategies. It then describes
   the historical experiences of Western powers with police assistance in
   the so-called Third World in order to explore historical patterns of
   police assistance that have shaped specific strategic cultures of police
   assistance. Against this background European and US approaches to police
   assistance are contrasted with the practices of reforming the ANP on the
   ground. The article concludes that, contrary to the `Mars-Venus divide',
   the US and the EU both pursue police assistance policies on the ground
   that produces a highly militarized ANP.},

Abstract = {Three central themes that have persisted throughout the history of
   research on communication and public opinion are examined in light of
   past, present, and future research. These themes include (1) ongoing
   concerns surrounding the political diversity of the communication
   environment; (2) selective exposure to political communication; and (3)
   the interrelationship between mass and interpersonal political
   communication. We explore the importance of these themes with an
   emphasis on how technological changes have made them, if anything, more
   relevant today than they were when first identified as central concerns
   of the discipline.},

   not know it had successfully created such a weapon until July 1945, when
   it was tested in New Mexico. This was several months after the defeat of
   Germany. So, with President Roosevelt dead, his successor, Harry S.
   Truman, had to make the decision of whether to use this weapon on Japan
   when it had been created to deter or use on Germany. This case deals
   with how the decision to use the fist nuclear bomb, the atomic bomb, was
   made.},

Abstract = {This article examines the transformations in the cultural sphere of
   Tijuana, one of Mexico's largest and fastest growing cities, in order to
   emphasise the border as a crucial site of nation-building in northern
   Mexico. I propose that cultural and intellectual actors, through
   particular sites, are changing the way the city is positioned in
   relation to the national political space of Mexico. Two institutions are
   considered specifically, both of which are integral to the propagation
   of an array of representations of Tijuana. In looking to articulations
   of nationhood and practices of knowledge production, this article
   delineates how urban identities reclaim and reconfigure key aspects of
   national identity in a region heretofore unrecognised as central to the
   creation of a national imaginary.},

Journal = {ISSUES \& STUDIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {47},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1-42},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This paper complements the traditional realist perspective (TP) with the
   strategic triangle theory (ST) in analyzing alliance formation and shift
   in East Asia. Alliance is perceived as a marriage triangle, and is
   subject to the dynamics of strategic actions taken by players to elevate
   their roles in the game. During the Cold War two hierarchically
   structured alliance systems opposed each other in East Asia. Power shift
   in the continental system disrupted the Sino-Soviet pact, while
   hegemonic stability in the maritime system buttressed the U.S.-led
   alliance. The division in the continental system offered Washington
   opportunities to befriend Beijing and buttress its position in the
   U.S.-Soviet-PRC strategic triangle. Washington's allies were prompted to
   act likewise. The tension in competitive rapprochement was absorbed by
   the hegemonic structure of the maritime system. The result was
   collective hedging (balancing-cum-engagement). In the post-Cold War era,
   the predominance of the United States caused the revival of the
   Beijing-Moscow nexus, now constructed as an equal partnership. Again one
   finds the continental and the maritime systems facing each other
   Cross-system hedging is inevitable as this would increase the payoff of
   strategic players. Russia and Taiwan are examined in the above context,
   combining the perspectives of both TP and ST The rise of China is
   expected to cause tension in the continental system, as predicted by the
   internal security dilemma. The rise of China also impacts on the
   maritime system by both increasing the tendency to balance it (as
   predicted by TP), and to improve relations with it (as predicted by ST),
   hence prompting hedging. However, hedging is difficult for Taiwan, for
   it is only loosely connected to the maritime alliance..},

Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {11},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This article explores the saga of the campaign to save the
   Ishpingo-Tambococha-Tiputini (ITT) block of the Yasuril National Park in
   Ecuador's Western Amazon, a story of the complex transnational networks
   and global governance mechanisms that have emerged to create post-Kyoto
   solutions for the planet. Ecuador's Yasuni-ITT Initiative to keep nearly
   900 million barrels of oil underground in exchange for global
   contributions for avoided emissions presents an alternative norm for
   global environmental governance in line with the indigenous concept of
   buen vivir, or the good life. This means living in harmony with nature,
   and is embodied in the Ecuadorian Constitution of 2008. These changes,
   however, are not without pressures and inconsistencies at the domestic
   and international levels. Ultimately, the Yasuni-ITT Initiative and
   subsequent UNDP Yasuni Trust Fund offer replicable models for other
   fossil fuel dependent and megadiverse countries in the developing world.},

   this paper, I show that Lewis and Schultz's claim is not true and their
   model admits multiple equilibria under some parameter settings. Monte
   Carlo analysis shows that when there are multiple equilibria, the
   parameter estimates may not converge to their true values even if the

Abstract = {The Union for the Mediterranean (UfM) has been furnished with a more
   ambitious institutional structure compared to the Barcelona Process, in
   the hope that this will provide non-EU partners with a greater say over
   co-operation processes. This contribution examines the different
   components of the institutional structure and explores the UfM's
   potential for achieving its stated ambition to reinforce co-ownership.
   The essay concludes, nevertheless, that a host of obstacles currently
   stand in the way of making inroads into co-ownership in
   Euro-Mediterranean relations.},

Abstract = {This article, prepared for the 75th-anniversary issue of Public Opinion
   Quarterly, observes some trends in the articles published in the journal
   from 2002 to 2008 and examines marked shifts brought about by changes in
   academic publishing. Methodological publication trends include a major
   focus on nonresponse in sample surveys and mode of survey
   administration. Trends in substantive articles include a focus on
   homosexuality and gay rights, on public opinion-policy linkage, and on
   historical analysis of public opinion. Changes in publishing led to
   fully electronic manuscript processing and publication, space for
   supplementary content, and a fully accessible electronic archive
   containing all issues of the journal. These developments and a new
   AAPOR-publisher relationship enable POQ to better fulfill its mission to
   advance the field of public opinion research.},

   Responses to the Global Economic Crisis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY EUROPEAN STUDIES},

Volume = {19},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {47-62},
Abstract = {The current global financial and economic crisis has led to widespread
   calls for multilateral policy co-ordination. However, national
   strategies towards financial market regulation and domestic stimulus
   programmes considerably diverge in cross-country comparison. Why do
   policy reactions to the crisis differ? Following a societal approach to
   preference formation, I argue that national strategies are strongly
   shaped by value-based ideas and by sectoral interests. While ideas on
   the role of politics in governing the economy can, for example, lean
   more towards trust in market forces or instead favour governmental
   regulation, interests may influence governmental positions according to
   the economic relevance of the respective sector. An analysis of the
   discourse and the measures regarding stimulus packages and financial
   market regulation in Britain and Germany supports this argument and
   shows that ideas as expectations, institutionalised ideas and material
   interests reinforced one another in influencing governmental strategies.},

Title = {Muckrakers and Reformers to the Rescue HOW THE PROGRESSIVE MOVEMENT
   CREATED MODERN PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION FROM THE MUCK OF CORRUPTION,
   INDIFFERENCE, AND IGNORANCE},
Booktitle = {CASES IN PUBLIC POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION},
Year = {2011},
Pages = {11-22},
Abstract = {Muck is what animals leave behind from their behinds. As it accumulates,
   it becomes increasingly unpleasant, especially when it is in a confined
   space such as a stable. Muck happens! Therefore, it must be shoveled or
   raked out periodically.
   Most people are familiar with muck because they have stepped in it or
   have had to put up with a lot of it, but few have been able to rise
   above it to see its strong historical relationship to public
   administration. To be specific, contemporary U.S. public administration,
   as both an academic discipline and a professional practice, has its
   origins in the early twentieth-century investigative journalism of a
   group of reporters known to history as the muckrakers.
   This story starts in 1906, when President Theodore Roosevelt
   figuratively put a muck rake into the hands of those investigative
   journalists who were gaining ever-increasing fame for exposing
   government corruption. For inspiration, Roosevelt called on John Bunyan
   (1628-1688), an English preacher and notorious nonconformist (meaning he
   did not conform to the teachings of the Church of England), who, while
   serving time in jail for his nonconformity, wrote Pilgrim's Progress
   (1678), a religious allegory that for centuries was one of the most
   widely read books in the English-speaking Protestant world.},

Abstract = {In one of the most influential of all economics books, The General
   Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money (1936), John Maynard Keynes
   (1883-1946) wrote: ``The ideas of economists and political philosophers,
   both when they are right and when they are wrong, are more powerful than
   is commonly understood. Indeed the world is ruled by little else.
   Practical men, who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any
   intellectual influences, are usually the slaves of some defunct
   economist.{''} ``Defunct{''} might be too strong a word here. Because
   while Friedrich A. Hayek (1899-1992) is certainly defunct, meaning
   ``dead,{''} he is far from defunct, meaning ``finished.{''} Indeed, when
   George W. Bush became the U.S. president in 2000, the ideas of this
   Austrian-born economist became exceedingly influential, so much so that
   they nearly caused the Free World economy to collapse into another Great
   Depression.},

Volume = {19},
Number = {3},
Pages = {379-392},
Abstract = {This article considers the reproduction of gender inequality in Italy
   today. The post-Fordist regime is seen to exclude the former
   relationship between capital and labour: the absence of social and
   economic regulation assigns to the international division of labour the
   affliction of redistribution and reduces government's interest and
   efforts to produce social cohesion and remove discrimination.
   Accordingly, the unavoidability of the work of social reproduction, the
   transformations of family structures and the inadequacy of state
   intervention in social policies present significant challenges to the
   welfare system. The analysis of the working and living conditions of
   Italian women illustrates the close relationship between the structure
   of the labour market and social reproduction, and allows us to examine
   the impact of economic and social changes on the role of both men and
   women in public life and in the private sphere.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN SECURITY},

Volume = {20},
Number = {4},
Pages = {585-603},
Abstract = {The article asks what the evolution of NATO-Swedish relations signifies
   for the understanding of the evolution of security communities. Given
   the astonishing evolution of NATO and Sweden as a community of practise,
   it is logical to imagine the two as forming part of the same security
   community. It could then be argued that common practise can bring about
   new security communities rather hastily. Analysing NATO's and Sweden's
   recent discourses on security, the author identifies a significant gap
   between a principally realist and a predominantly idealist discourse
   that indicates that the two parties do not share key characteristics of
   a security community - identities, values and meanings. However, if
   Libya is the case of the future, the discursive differences may fade and
   Sweden could more easily pursue its journey towards inclusion in NATO,
   not as a member of an Alliance, but as a member of NATO as a security
   community.},

Abstract = {It has become common for scholars of nations and nationalism to use
   banknotes, coins and postage stamps as passing examples of everyday
   objects expressive of nationalism. Until recently, however, it has been
   less common for these objects to form the focus of empirical enquiries
   that substantiate their contribution to the creation and transmission of
   national symbolism. This article addresses this lacuna through an
   empirical investigation of over 300 years of Scottish banknote
   iconography. In their symbolic content, banknotes are shown to be
   amenable to the service of both national and non-national political
   agendas. To explain this phenomenon, we advance three interrelated
   arguments. First, we contend that variations in banknote iconography
   reflect the different political contexts in which notes were produced
   and the distinctive loyalties and customer constituencies of the banks
   that issue them. Second, we argue that changes in banknote imagery
   reflect changes in the scale of their circulation. Third, we argue that
   Scottish banknotes have always included iconography that constructs the
   image of the bank and advertises its reliability, often through
   association with national images. The article concludes by addressing
   Scotland's place in wider understandings of the iconographic power of
   banknotes.},

Abstract = {This paper makes a normative argument for the greater strategic
   utilization of human rights institutions, practices, and discourses by
   those seeking a robust response to climate change. Bandwagoning between
   these two regimes is hardly a new thing. The environmental movement has
   long looked to the human rights movement for ideas and support, and vice
   versa. Here, we argue that there is potential for even more explicit
   bandwagoning in ways that will most directly benefit those who are
   suffering, and will continue to suffer, from climate change's greatest
   impacts. The human rights framework offers a guide to more effective
   climate action via two interconnected arenas: a legal arena that
   provides an established set of tools for climate activists, and a
   political arena that provides a normative underpinning for a range of
   judicial and non-judicial actions in support of `climate justice'.
   Ultimately, moral and strategic guidance from the human rights movement
   points the way to a more equitable and enduring climate politics, with
   fairness at its heart.},

Abstract = {This article examines how the Mexican state drew upon nationalist
   discourse for legitimacy following the 1982 debt crisis. The analytical
   framework situates Mexico within the context of Latin American
   nationalism and explores the structural and conjunctural factors that
   contributed to the endurance and effectiveness of Mexican revolutionary
   nationalism as a hegemonic nationalist discourse. Historical
   commemorations during the Miguel de la Madrid administration (1982-88)
   are then examined to show how the state evoked nationalist motifs as it
   dealt with economic crisis, pressure from the USA, domestic political
   opposition and the implementation of neoliberal reforms. The relative
   effectiveness of sometimes counterintuitive appeals to nationalist
   legitimacy is found to be neither wholly `rational' nor `irrational', in
   this case having its basis in a history of elite and popular negotiation
   through the revolutionary nationalist framework, the continuity of the
   post-revolutionary Partido de la Revolucion Institutional (PRI) state
   model and the lack of a viable competing paradigm.},

Abstract = {Contemporary theories of opinion dynamics-exemplified by Zaller's
   ``receive-accept-sample{''} model-tend to assume that attitude change
   should occur only following exposure to new, attitude-relevant
   information. Within this prevailing view, the expected direction and
   magnitude of opinion change is largely a function of the tone and
   content of the new information to which one is exposed. In contrast,
   social identification theories show how opinion change can occur when a
   person's environmental context activates social knowledge stored in
   long-term memory. These theories propose that attitude change can result
   merely from increasing the perceived salience of a social conflict. They
   further propose that the direction and magnitude of opinion change
   should be unrelated to the tone or content of the information that draws
   attention to the conflict. This study examines how the ebb and flow of
   war news on the front page of the New York Times is related to changes
   in levels of domestic public support for major American military
   conflicts from 1950 to the present. We find no consistent or compelling
   evidence that levels of aggregate war support change in ways predicted
   by information updating models. To the contrary, a social identification
   process appears to be underlying the aggregate dynamics of war support.},

Abstract = {Despite great concern over declining rates of survey cooperation, few
   polling organizations collect trend data on possible causes of its
   decline. We gather these data in order to examine the causes of
   declining survey cooperation, such as confidentiality and privacy
   concerns, the rise of telemarketers, popular understanding of survey
   accuracy, biases of polling organizations, and attitudes toward the
   societal benefits of survey research. Although the proportion of people
   who have participated in at least one survey has increased, knowledge of
   sampling procedures has not. Meanwhile, a wide variety of attitudes
   toward polling have grown more negative. In 2006, pollsters fell in
   measures of trust in occupational categories to levels similar to
   members of Congress and union leaders. Overall, there has been a
   markedly negative shift in attitudes toward public opinion researchers
   and polls across several dimensions between the mid-1990s and the first
   decade of the 2000s.},

Abstract = {Fixed effects vector decomposition (FEVD) is simply an instrumental
   variables (IV) estimator with a particular choice of instruments and a
   special case of the well-known Hausman-Taylor IV procedure. Plumper and
   Troeger (PT) now acknowledge this point and disown the three-stage
   procedure that previously defined FEVD. Their old recipe for SEs, which
   has regrettably been used in dozens of published research papers,
   produces dramatic overconfidence in the estimates. Again PT concede the
   point and now adopt the standard IV formula for SEs. Knowing that FEVD
   is an application of IV also has the benefit of focusing attention on
   the choice of instruments. Now it seems PT claim that the FEVD
   instruments are always the best choice, on the grounds that one cannot
   know whether any potential instrument is correlated with the unit
   effect. One could just as readily make the same specious claim about
   other estimators, such as ordinary least squares, and support it with
   similar Monte Carlo assumptions and evidence.},

Journal = {ISSUES \& STUDIES},

Volume = {47},
Number = {1},
Pages = {107-152},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Because of its diplomatic isolation, Taiwan has used, and continues to
   use, public diplomacy as a vital medium for presenting its values and
   utility in the international community while bypassing issues of
   recognition. This article examines Taiwan's public diplomacy and soft
   power projection. It analyzes Taiwan's public diplomacy outreach and
   evaluates its public diplomacy strategies and tactics by focusing on
   Taiwan's ability to present its utility, relevance, and values to the
   international community. It assesses Taiwan's public diplomacy
   institutions and tools, and the instruments employed to implement public
   diplomacy outreach. Furthermore, it examines Taiwanese soft power and
   the elements that enhance its `Power of influence.{''} The author
   categorizes Taiwan as a ``middle power{''} and compares its public
   diplomacy efforts to those of similar middle power states, especially in
   relation to the public diplomacy strategy of niche diplomacy.},

Journal = {NATIONS AND NATIONALISM},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Pages = {188-206},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This article challenges the theoretical opposition between nationalism
   and cosmopolitanism with empirical research on the ways in which a group
   of ordinary Australians talked about multiculturalism in the 1980s and
   again in the 2000s. It shifts attention from identity work to the
   understanding of day-to-day social relations: it finds that they are
   strongly nationalist and yet also display a cosmopolitan embrace of the
   benefits of cultural diversity. They draw on the inclusionary resources
   of Australian nationalism and its history to strengthen their
   cosmopolitanism and calm their anxieties about living with diversity.
   Their commonsense conceptualising of Australia's contemporary
   multicultural society in terms of a mix of individuals rather than an
   ensemble of groups is crucial to understanding why cultural diversity
   has been embraced within the framework of the nation.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY EUROPEAN STUDIES},

Volume = {19},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {63-81},
Abstract = {The Great Recession of 2008 is having a devastating effect on
   unemployment and output in Spain. Hence, the first challenge for
   economic policy should be driving the economy back to pre-downturn
   figures. However, the prospect is rather gloomy since Spain faces
   several constraints which drag output, as a consequence of accumulated
   imbalances during the previous prosperity period, from 1997 to 2007.
   This article shows the shortcomings of the current strategies of
   economic policy undertaken in Spain (fiscal austerity and supply-side
   reforms) for reaching this goal, and argues for an alternative strategy
   at a European level, consisting in increasing fiscal spending and,
   simultaneously, balancing trade surplus and deficit countries within the
   euro zone.},

Title = {The Rising Public Debt in the EU: Implications for Policy},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY EUROPEAN STUDIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {7-20},
Abstract = {The current financial and economic crisis is of unprecedented
   proportions and intensity. Given the piecemeal approach of the EU
   institutions to economic policy, their reaction to the mounting crisis
   has been slow and hesitant.
   The much feared financial meltdown in the E.U. has been avoided. However
   this came at the cost of increasing pressure on public finances in most
   member states, leading to a public debt crisis in a number of them.
   Financial liberalization and the lagging financial policy reform
   exacerbated such pressure, bringing certain member states such as Greece
   to the verge of default. Even more importantly, the stability of the
   eurozone appears to be in danger.
   This has led to an avalanche of new measures, including the newly
   instituted ``European Stabilization Mechanism{''}, as well as proposals
   for the adjustment of fiscal policy co-ordination, under the general
   heading of `reinforcing economic governance in Europe' as announced by
   the European Commission in May 2010.
   So, what next? Past experience confirms that a financial crisis is
   usually followed by a sovereign debt crisis. Is this what is happening
   in the EU? With what social and economic implications? Further, what are
   the implications of rising sovereign debt for economic policy?
   These are some of the questions we discuss in the present article. In
   particular, we examine (i) the concept of the sovereign debt and its
   relevance to the EU and to the eurozone; (ii) the historical experience
   of crises; (iii) the response of the EU to the current crisis and (iv)
   the prospects for policy.},

Abstract = {With their post-Soviet history and conflictual relationship with the
   Russian Federation, the Baltic States sought entry into the European
   Union (EU) for more political clout, economic stability and geopolitical
   reinforcement. However, what Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania discovered
   was a great deal more complex and less coherent political community than
   they had hoped. This paper looks at how the Baltic States have affected
   and been affected by EU-Russian relations. We seek the elusive `Baltic
   factor' in EU-Russian relations. In looking at how Baltic foreign policy
   has changed from pre-enlargement to post-accession, we find that the
   Baltic States, still haunted by their relationship with Russia, are more
   likely to be perceived as agenda-spoilers than agenda-setters.},

Title = {Prevail or perish: Anglo-German naval competition at the beginning of
   the twentieth century},
Journal = {EUROPEAN SECURITY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {20},

Pages = {65-79},
Abstract = {British politicians often argued that Britain maintained its navy only
   in order to secure its own survival by keeping sea communications open,
   while Germany in no real need of a powerful navy, threatened this
   legitimate British policy-goal by pursuing expansionist politics. German
   leaders, emboldened and a little dazzled by the tremendous industrial
   and economic success of the newly unified Reich, held that Britain was
   maintaining its economic dominance in the Empire by military means and
   thus blocking the progress Germany hoped to make in its aspiration to
   parity status and economic prosperity, with all that that entailed. This
   paper will explore the underlying rationale of the arms race between
   Britain and Germany shining through in those different positions on
   legitimate (military) policy aims. It will go beyond the visible
   symbols, as it were, of the Dreadnought and the Two-Power standard.
   These very concrete matters will also be dealt with here but, more
   importantly, this essay is meant to give some answer as to whether an
   archetypal differentiation between survival on the one hand and
   domination on the other can be made out as the predominant logic that
   led the two countries to embark on the road to the Great War.},

   coordination and the future of the EU OHQ},
Journal = {EUROPEAN SECURITY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Pages = {81-102},
Abstract = {The presented article focuses on key issues and developments in the
   European Union (EU)'s comprehensive crisis management planning,
   civil-military coordination and cooperation, as well as the future of
   the EU Operational Headquarters (OHQ). The article begins with a short
   overview of key changes in the EU's external action after the Lisbon
   Treaty, and focuses on the area of Common Foreign and Security Policy
   (CFSP) and Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP). The impact of the
   European External Action Service on CSDP-CFSP cooperation in planning
   and on EU's crisis management is being examined. Further on, the article
   continues by addressing the issue area of EU crisis management. After
   the evolution of the concept and practice at the EU level is examined
   and different phases are discussed, the article analyses the main
   political, strategic and operational trends in this field. Indeed, this
   part reflects on the implications of the Lisbon Treaty for crisis
   management. What follows is an assessment of the civil-military
   coordination in the EU's crisis management structures. In order to
   contextualise the most recent transformations that are investigated at
   length, basic concepts and terms are outlined, and the evolution of
   civil-military coordination at the EU level is presented. The final
   substantive part tackles current and future EU OHQ options. After the
   necessary contextualisation, the characteristics and shortcomings of the
   three current options are analysed, and based on these limits, the case
   for the establishment of a permanent strategic planning and conduct
   structure in Brussels is put forward. Finally, concluding remarks and
   recommendations are attached.},

Abstract = {The paper investigates the sources of the EU position in the G20
   meetings convened in response to the global financial crisis of
   2007-2009. In particular, the paper investigates the factors that led
   the EU to campaign for strengthening the role of public authority and
   for giving priority to financial stability and social protection in
   international financial regulation. The argument of the paper is that
   the sources of the EU position lie in the convergence of views of the
   largest EU member states around a specific approach to financial
   capitalism. Indeed, the crisis has shifted the EU away from the
   `neoliberal' towards the `regulated' model, as attested by the content
   of EU financial sector policies.},

Abstract = {Imagine the following scenario. Revenues plummeted and interest
   requirements mounted. Many claimed that default was inevitable. The
   precarious situation existed for nearly two years. Attempts were made to
   refinance the government's bonds in an effort to relieve the financial
   strain. However, it became increasingly difficult to convince new
   creditors to buy the new bonds. No assistance was forthcoming from the
   federal government. Finally, on March 1, the first of the major defaults
   on bond obligations occurred when the government could not make its
   regular interest payment.
   Many analysts claimed that the situation had been untenable from the
   start, given the demographics of the area. Others assessed it as a
   miscalculation of revenue capacities balanced against an impulsive
   borrowing spree. Critics observed that the jurisdiction's financial
   policy was foolishly designed to not have enough revenue from taxes to
   cover expenses.
   The legislative body was called into session and a Refunding Act was
   passed that reduced the bond interest rates by nearly 35 percent and
   extended their maturation dates. At the same time, new constitutional
   amendments were passed that prohibited any increase in tax rates or
   future bond issues except by voter approval. Irate bondholders lost
   little time in filing a host of suits against the government. Several
   asked for receiverships of toll bridges so that their revenues could be
   used exclusively to pay off their bonds. The State Supreme Court
   rejected such requests. Undaunted, the bondholders appealed to the
   federal courts and began winning appeals. A receiver was actually
   appointed for one toll bridge.
   The issue became even more acute when several state governments that
   held the jurisdiction's bonds for trust funds filed suit in federal
   court to compel the government to raise its taxes in oder to pay off its
   obligations. When confronted with this pressure, a special session of
   the legislature agreed to pay off, in full, all interest on bonds held
   by state governments only. In the meantime, the private bondholders
   continued their suits, and by November 1 had obtained a federal
   injunction against disbursement of government funds for certain
   purposes. Finally, a federal court produced a landmark ruling; the
   refunding law was deemed unconstituional. Furthermore, the court forbade
   the jurisdiction's treasurer from paying out funds to service the new
   bonds. The court held that if officials invade contractual rights
   guaranteed by the federal Constitution, they are bound by federal court
   remedies available to the injured parties.
   Now the government was in total chaos. Its funds were tied up, the
   refunding law was void, and it could not even service bonds at the new
   35 percent lower interest rate. Another legislative session was called.
   A second refunding law was passed. This time the bonds were given their
   old, higher interest rates and a ten-year extension of their maturation
   dates. Almost needless to say, the government's credit rating was a
   shambles.
   The events recounted above actually happened to the state of Arkansas in
   1933, when it went ``bankrupt{''} by excessive borrowing to finance
   highways and the pensions of Confederate Civil War veterans and their
   dependents. Caught up in the depths of the Depression, its falling
   revenues resulted in default of its debt.
   Unlike the private sector, where a corporate default may result in the
   end of the corporation and division of all remaining assets, the fiscal
   organizations of government inevitably live on. There is life after
   default-but it is a hell of litigation.},

Abstract = {Every cognitive interview pretest designer must decide how many
   interviews need to be conducted. With little theory or empirical
   research to guide the choice of sample size, practitioners generally
   rely on the examples of other studies and their own experience or
   preferences. We investigated pretest sample size both theoretically and
   empirically. Using a model of the relationship of sample size to
   question problem prevalence, detection power of the cognitive interview
   technique, and probability of observing a problem, we computed the
   sample size necessary, under varying conditions, to detect problems.
   Under a range of plausible values for the model parameters, we found
   that additional problems continued to be detected as sample size
   increased. We also report on an empirical study that simulated the
   number of problems detected at different sample sizes. Multiple outcome
   measures showed a strong positive relationship between sample size and
   problem detection; serious problems that were not detected in small
   samples were consistently observed in larger samples. We discuss the
   implications of these findings for practice and for additional research.},

Abstract = {Vietnam and China have had a long, if not always amicable, historical
   relationship. This relationship continued to be important even as
   Vietnam began its transition from a command economy to greater market
   orientation using the same strategy of pragmatic gradualism adopted by
   China when the latter began its own transition a decade before. As this
   strategy appears now to have lost momentum following the onset of the
   2008 global financial crisis, Vietnam's economic planners, preparing the
   country's Socioeconomic Development Strategy for the new decade
   (2011-2020), have proposed new initiatives to achieve sustained growth.
   China's successful experiments, specifically with enterprise groups,
   special economic zones, and technology and industrial policies, again
   loom large among these proposed initiatives. To be successful, however,
   Vietnamese planners will need to be aware of the particular
   circumstances that favored China's experiments, to draw lessons from
   China's successes and failures, and to overcome the major challenges
   that Vietnam especially faces. These include, in comparison with China,
   a less competitive state enterprise sector, weaker implementation
   capacity at the subnational level, and pervasive corruption.},

Abstract = {This article reviews how major theorists of nationalism - from Ernest

   that Swiss nationalism and the Swiss state present in view of the
   monoethnic states that surround it. I will argue that this puzzle
   disappears when assuming a political sociology perspective that
   highlights the networks of political alliances underlying nationalist
   movements and the power structure of recently formed nation-states.
   Studying an `outlier' case such as Switzerland helps us to gain insight
   into the general processes and mechanisms at work in the rise of
   nationalism and the nation-state.},

   Nations endowed with specific and potent constitutional rights. This
   legal status has made Canadian First Nations into models for indigenous
   demands around the world, including in Taiwan. The goal of this paper is
   (1) to reflect on Canadian and Taiwanese examples to understand how
   indigenous communities have constructed national identities and achieved
   recognition as First Nations with inherent legal rights; (2) to explore
   how indigenous peoples in Canada and Taiwan have achieved recognition as
   participants in democratic politics and as sites of constitutional
   rights: and, last but not least, (3) to appreciate what lessons they can
   learn from one another},

Journal = {NATIONS AND NATIONALISM},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {17},
Number = {3},
Pages = {561-580},

Abstract = {This article argues for a close relationship between national identity
   and the institutionalisation of the visual arts in Grenada. Art, which
   is intrinsic to all humans, predates its institutionalisation: it is
   only institutionalised in societies with a strong sense of national
   identity. In order to explain the role of national identity in the
   formation of national art, the article begins by examining the period
   following World War II, when Grenada still under British colonialism was
   undergoing intense social and political changes. To understand these
   changes, the analysis of the stratification system is paramount. The
   article delineates three groups on the basis of the value systems
   developed historically: the elite, the masses and a small, growing
   middle class situated between these two groups. The works of three
   prominent Grenadian artists illustrate the argument that
   institutionalisation of art requires a strong sense of national
   identity, and through this process the artistic development of a society
   occurs. Furthermore, understanding this process requires a focus on the
   ways in which social and political groups or classes impeded the
   development of a national identity, preventing the institutionalisation
   of the arts.},

Abstract = {Latin America is a region of sharp ethnic inequalities. Uruguay has
   usually been considered an exception to this pattern, although no data
   were available to confirm this assumption until recently. This article
   uses the Household Survey of 2006 to analyze the wage gap between
   Afro-descendants and whites through OLS equations, decompositions, and
   quantile regressions. The analysis finds that discrimination explains
   approximately 50 percent of the racial wage gap for men and 20 percent
   for women. Discrimination operates partly through occupational
   segregation. Differences in schooling are the most important explanatory
   factor for the rest of the gap. Quantile regressions show that
   discrimination declines across percentiles for men.},

Abstract = {While the canonical literature on oil wealth suggests that hydrocarbon
   windfalls encourage repressive despotism, Kuwait provides a case of an
   oil-rich autocracy governing instead through popular rentierism-that is,
   through a broad coalition of social forces, one that furnishes enduring
   loyalty from below while constraining abuses of state power from above.
   This paper provides a theoretically guided explanation for this
   exceptional outcome. I argue that the Kuwaiti regime's coalitional
   bargains originated in the pre-oil era, when domestic opposition and
   geopolitical constrictions compelled it to forge new social alliances at
   the dawn of modern statehood. This inclusionary strategy mediated the
   subsequent effect of oil rents, which the regime used to
   institutionalize its mass base with costly material and symbolic side
   payments. Such popular incorporation bound large constituent classes to
   the regime's survival, precluding the need for widespread repression.
   After 50 years, these coalitional bargains have also proven remarkably
   resilient, as social actors have continued to endorse the autocratic
   leadership despite economic crisis and wartime defeat.},

Title = {The Fall of the House of California HOW THE RICHEST STATE IN THE COUNTRY
   CRATERED INTO BUDGETARY CHAOS AND A FISCAL NIGHTMARE},
Booktitle = {CASES IN PUBLIC POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION},
Year = {2011},
Pages = {242-252},
Abstract = {California is not just any state. If it were a country, it would be the
   world's eighth biggest economy. However, it is not a country, so it
   faces the same public financial test that all subnational governments
   face in the United States. Each year it must submit and pass a balanced
   budget. What the state of California experienced from 2008 to 2009 is
   widely regarded, according to The Economist (July 11, 2009), as
   ``America's worst budget crises.{''} This fiscal collapse actually began
   with a tax revolt through voter referendum, Proposition 13, over thirty
   years ago, which altered local government financing and led to a budget
   situation in which projected deficits reached almost half of expected
   revenues, the state's credit rating fell to barely above junk bond
   status, and IOUs were issued to pay contractors and creditors. The
   actual day-to-day events of this continuing crisis, frequently producing
   front-page headlines, have left California residents wondering whether
   they were reading a horror story in the style of Edgar Allen Poe's
   masterpiece, The Fall of the House of Usher (1839)-an eerie tale of dire
   events as a once-wealthy family falls into decline and madness.},

Abstract = {Global conservation has changed over the last two decades. As
   conservation NGOs have grown in size and stature, they have increasingly
   turned to businesses and market mechanisms and they are increasingly
   replacing the state in delivering conservation programs. This article
   argues that at the heart of global conservation lies a small,
   well-connected elite, made up of directors and senior staff of key
   conservation NGOs, state politicians and bureaucrats, corporate
   directors, scientists, celebrities, and media actors. This elite network
   works as influence, ideas, and money are spread in formal spaces, such
   as conferences and meeting rooms, and in informal occasions such as
   social events. Drawing on emerging studies of conservation bureaucracies
   and NGOs, this article outlines the workings and structure of this
   elite, illustrated through four detailed vignettes. It situates the
   elite in the emerging literature on neoliberalism, arguing that this
   elite is at the forefront of driving the neoliberalization of
   conservation.},

Abstract = {Asian countries are building domestic institutions in response to
   climate change at both the international and domestic levels. Many
   countries have adopted the inter-agency coordination mechanism (IACM) as
   a national institutional approach to adjust the functions of various
   governmental agencies to tackle climate change. This article compares
   and contrasts national IACMs in four countries: Japan, the Republic of
   Korea, China and India. It examines (1) the structure and function of an
   IACM; (2) agencies and their specific roles in IACMs; (3) measures to
   empower the participation of other stakeholders including local
   governments, private sector, civil society and academia; and (4) changes
   in IACMs and reasons for such changes. Four success factors drawn from
   our comparative study suggest that an effective IACM should feature (1)
   strong overall coordination by the President/Prime Minister; (2)
   empowerment of the industry and environment agencies as joint lead
   agencies coordinating mitigation and adaptation; (3) involvement of all
   major sectoral agencies related to mitigation and adaptation; and (4)
   maximisation of the use of the comparative advantages of other
   stakeholders. The article highlights successful practices in Asia that
   can be emulated by other governments considering reform of their own
   domestic institutions in response to climate change.},

Abstract = {Why has Ecuador been much more successful at implementing participatory
   policy than Peru despite the similarity between the two countries'
   policies and despite their similarly low state capacity? To answer this
   question, this article draws on insights from implementation literature
   that point to factors such as incentives written into policy, the
   commitment of administrations and bureaucratic agencies, and few veto
   points in the chain of implementation. While this article does not
   challenge such findings, it suggests that we must look further back in
   the causal chain to understand what brings such facilitating conditions
   about. Through an examination of ethnodevelopment policy in Ecuador and
   Peru, I find that the strength of social movements is most responsible
   for creating the conditions that foster implementation. Neither civil
   society nor the state alone can bring about successful participatory
   policy implementation. Rather, strong social movements can make the
   state comply with its own laws.},

Abstract = {When evaluating an ongoing military conflict, the public has the
   advantage of observing, at least partially, outcomes of the conflict.
   Because there are no outcomes to observe, by their nature, potential
   conflicts add an additional dimension of uncertainty to the evaluation
   process. This research note examines the effect of risk priming on the
   evaluation of potential military conflicts. Using an experiment from the
   2008 Cooperative Congressional Election Study, we find that priming less
   risk-tolerant individuals to consider risk lessened their support for a
   potential military intervention in Darfur, while the prime appeared to
   increase uncertainty among risk-tolerant individuals.},

Abstract = {To measure the importance of political issues, scholars traditionally
   have relied on a survey question that asks about the ``most important
   problem{''} (MIP) facing the nation. Increasingly, scholars are relying
   on a variant that asks about the ``most important issue{''} (MII). While
   we have learned quite a lot about what MIP captures, especially over
   time, we know little about MII. Using newly compiled data from the
   United Kingdom, this article examines differences in the two items and
   their dynamics. The results of our analyses reveal that MII responses
   are strikingly similar to MIP responses. While they may be slightly
   closer to a valid indicator of issue importance, MII responses mostly
   reflect variation in assessments of problem status. An effective measure
   of issue importance remains elusive.},

Abstract = {For those championing an international institutional solution to climate
   change, the forest-climate linkage through reduced emissions from
   deforestation and forest degradation and forest enhancement (REDD+) may
   be one of the most promising strategic linkages to date. Following a
   series of forest-focused interventions that did not live up to their
   promise, global forest politics have now, through REDD+ deliberations,
   been institutionally subsumed into the climate regime. We argue that to
   realize its potential, REDD+ policy mechanisms must be careful to move
   away from the commodification of forest stewardship that reinforces
   short-term strategic positions of powerful producing and consuming
   interests whose current activities are the culprits of global forest
   decline. To achieve such an outcome, we argue that institutions must
   develop on the basis of a ``logic of problem amelioration{''} in which
   the rationale for achieving clearly defined environmental and social
   goals is rendered transparent. This could be achieved through the
   formalization of a ``dual effectiveness test{''} in which interventions
   are evaluated for their potential to simultaneously ameliorate both
   global climate change and forest degradation.},

Abstract = {Are the national laws regulating access to genetic resources that
   countries have enacted in exercise of their sovereign rights accorded by
   the Convention on Biological Diversity jeopardising food security by
   failing to take into account the distinctive features of genetic
   resources for food and agriculture? If so what can be done about it?
   What are the obstacles to doing so? And how can they be overcome,
   especially in the context of the present ongoing negotiations for an
   international regime on access and benefits sharing under the
   biodiversity convention? This article examines the impact of the
   national access laws and other instruments on the free access and
   exchange of these genetic resources and hence on the maintenance of
   agricultural biological diversity upon which food security hinges so
   critically. It highlights the obstacles that stand in the way of
   developing countries facilitating access to their genetic resources and
   proposes a multilateral non-market-orientated approach to overcome them.},

   world knows that a deerstalker cap on the head, a drooping pipe in the

   in the hand mean that Sherlock Holmes is afoot. The demand for Sherlock
   Holmes stories, both original and derivative, has been unrelenting ever
   since this intellectual action hero first appeared in London's Strand
   Magazine in 1891. Untold numbers of novels, stage plays, films, radio
   dramas, and television programs have used the Holmes character both
   seriously and in parody. However, the following case offers something
   that has never been seen before: Sherlock Holmes coming to life and
   taking his place on history's stage.},

Journal = {POLITICAL ANALYSIS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {19},

Month = {WIN},
Abstract = {Political scientists have increasingly focused on causal processes that
   operate not solely on mean differences but on other stochastic
   characteristics of the distribution of a dependent variable. This paper
   surveys important statistical tools used to assess data in situations
   where the entire distribution of values is of interest. We first outline
   three broad conditions under which stochastic process methods are
   applicable and show that these conditions cover many domains of social
   inquiry. We discuss a variety of visual and analytical techniques,
   including distributional analysis, direct parameter estimates of
   probability density functions, and quantile regression. We illustrate
   the utility of these statistical tools with an application to budgetary
   data because strong theoretical expectations at the micro- and
   macrolevel exist about the distributional characteristics for such data.
   The expository analysis concentrates on three budget series (total,
   domestic, and defense outlays) of the U.S. government for 1800-2004.},

Abstract = {Anti-ship ballistic missiles (ASBMs) are thought by many to be a
   ``game-changer{''} for the People's Republic of China (PRC) in future
   military conflicts with the United States around Taiwan, but critics
   refute this ``game-changer{''} notion. The arguments on both sides are
   myths. Missile defense cannot be one hundred percent effective in
   intercepting incoming ASBMs, and an aircraft carrier is bound to be
   spotted if it is going to be a useful war-fighting machine. Nonetheless,
   ASBMs do not change the game in the PRC's favor Carriers are not crucial
   to a US. intervention. Other assets immune to ASBMs can stop a military
   takeover of Taiwan. Sinking US. carriers would also be counterproductive
   for the PRC, as it would escalate a conflict which Beijing has little
   chance of winning.},

Abstract = {This article examines how electoral competition, in the form of
   district-level campaign expenditures, affects voters' opinions about
   elections. We direct our attention at how voters perceive competition,
   and at how electoral competition affects how people perceive elections.
   Although people generally overestimate the competitiveness of U.S. House
   races, we demonstrate that perceptions of competition are connected to
   actual levels of campaign activity. We also find that electoral
   competition may have contradictory democratic effects. District-level
   spending is associated with greater attention to news about the local
   campaign, but also with greater dissatisfaction with election choices.},

Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},

Abstract = {Civil society organizations were disenfranchised, as were many
   countries, at COP-15 in Copenhagen in December 2009. The main forces
   that contributed to this disenfranchisement were not, however, increased
   registration and the merging of movements within civil society. Poor
   planning did contribute to the disenfranchisement; however, in
   cooperation with state actors, this was also to some extent overcome at
   COP-15. The unusual process by which the Copenhagen Accord was developed
   did disenfranchise civil society and many countries. Major concerns
   regarding the undemocratic nature of this process and the inadequacy of
   the Accord were raised by some countries in the final plenary of COP-15.
   These countries were backed by a number of civil society organizations
   that had already denounced the Accord as a non-deal, contributing to the
   COP not adopting the Accord as a formal decision. The Accord's existence
   was eventually only noted by the final COP-15 plenary, reflecting this
   widespread disaffection.},

Journal = {MEDITERRANEAN POLITICS},

Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Pages = {171-192},
Abstract = {Can the UfM make a distinctive contribution to development in the
   Mediterranean region? How innovative are its priority project themes? In
   an attempt to answer these questions, this contribution examines the
   relationship between the priority project themes of the Union for the
   Mediterranean and the substance of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership
   (EMP) and the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) which preceded it. It
   explores the extent to which, by establishing the six priority project
   themes, the UfM has broken with the previous focus of the economic
   reform programmes and projects promoted by the EMP and the ENP. It then
   reviews the potential contribution of the themes to economic development
   and examines selected factors which may influence project implementation
   and goal attainment, including funding access and the impact of the
   UfM's institutional innovations on the effective pursuit of project
   themes. The conclusion is that there is scope for the UfM to enhance
   development in the Mediterranean region but outcomes so far have been
   limited and future outcomes depend on a range of variables including
   geo-political tensions, national priorities of partner states and
   funding availability.},

Pages = {135-153},
Abstract = {What impact does the Union for the Mediterranean (UfM) have on the
   future evolution of Euro-Arab relations? This contribution first
   reflects on Arab reactions to the UfM, and subsequently analyses what
   alterations the UfM brings to existing Euro-Arab relations in terms of
   actors, institutional arrangements, and policy contents. In sum, the UfM
   caters well to Arab regimes' priorities, namely the maintenance of
   authoritarian rule: The UfM tends to exclude societal voices and leads
   to a re-governmentalization of relations; the institutional set-up
   elevates Arab regimes to become formal veto-players, and the prioritized
   policy areas have - from an Arab regime perspective - the advantage of
   being de-politicized and stripped of any ambitious macro-political goals
   such as democratization. The UfM can thus be considered a triple victory
   for authoritarian Arab rulers in re-shaping their relations with Europe,
   and casts serious doubts on the hypothesis of the EU acting as a norm
   entrepreneur.},

Abstract = {All political decisions are made at one level of government or another,
   sometimes even by several at the same time. Consequently, the level of
   analysis is one of the classic issues in the study of politics because
   it poses an eternal question: Should the focus of political analysis be
   the individual political actor (a lone citizen or organization), a local
   government (a municipality, county, or special district), a national
   government, or the international political system as a whole? The forces
   at play and the links within and between these levels make single-level
   analysis problematic at best. So there is really no point in undertaking
   a political analysis of a political actor in isolation-because that
   actor is never in isolation. He or she is always a citizen of a state
   and/or a member of other large groups, and there are always a large
   number of links and interactions among the various levels of government
   and other social groupings.
   Doctrine as organizational policies presents a similar level-of-analysis
   problem. It is inherently hierarchical with a seemingly sacrosanct chain
   of command. The most general notions come down from the top to be
   implemented at various stages leading to the bottom. When the president
   orders ``justice{''} for America's enemies, that order travels down the
   chain of command until a soldier pulls the trigger on his rifle and
   administers a full measure of such justice to a deserving person.
   Doctrine sets into action the ways and means by which people are
   ultimately shot, or given food stamps, or provided health care. Whether
   the end result is bullets or bedpans, the doctrine involved travels a
   similar route toward implementation: from the grand strategic (the
   national policy-making) level to the strategic (the highest
   organizational level) to the operational (the planning or
   administrative) level to the tactical (the service-delivery) level. Each
   level accepts doctrine from above but uses discretion to create
   subdoctrine or level-specific doctrine that facilitates implementation.
   The whole history of public administration since antiquity is, in
   essence, just tinkering with this core concept. It explains how
   societies as large as a state and as small as an office work to do their
   assigned tasks. Consequently, what follows is absolutely essential for
   an understanding of how to succeed in a world of organizations.},

Pages = {260-270},
Abstract = {Remember Oedipus? In the ancient Greek tragedy by Sophocles (Oedipus
   Rex), he is the man who unknowingly kills his father, then, by an
   equally strange set of convoluted circumstances, marries the victim's
   widow, his own mother. This is why, more than two millennia later,
   Sigmund Freud, the ``father{''} of psychotherapy, would say that a boy
   who loved his mother too much had an Oedipus complex. Meanwhile, back at
   the tragedy, the widow, now wife, after having had four children with
   Oedipus, discovers the truth and kills herself. Oedipus, upon learning
   that he had been, until recently, happily married to his now-dead
   mother, pokes out his own eyes. This isn't called a tragedy for nothing!
   And then there are the sequels. In Oedipus at Colonus, the blind Oedipus
   is led about by his daughter Antigone as they discuss the great issues
   of philosophy and incest. With Oedipus dead at the end of this second
   episode in the life and times of this dysfunctional family, Sophocles
   completes his trilogy by making Antigone the star of her own tragedy.
   In Antigone, the heroine defies the king who has ordered her dead
   brother's body to lie unburied, because he was a traitor who died in a
   revolt against the state. Now this is the point at which the play gets
   really interesting and contemporary. Antigone defies the king, citing a
   higher law-a higher obligation to the gods-and buries her brother,
   thereby forcing the king, in order to maintain his authority and uphold
   the law, to have her killed. With Antigone dead, her fiance, the king's
   son, overwhelmed by grief, kills himself. Thereupon the boy's mother,
   the king's wife, kills herself over the loss of her son.
   The law has been upheld, but at a huge cost to the king. This story has
   resonated with relevance ever since. Antigone offers the classic
   justification for defying the laws of the state: There is a higher law
   that must be obeyed. The core question here is which is more ridiculous;
   obeying a law that you consider immoral or disobeying the law and
   suffering the consequences. Many ordinary and some famous people have
   been subject to considerable ridicule for doing the latter.},

Abstract = {It appears that the latest crisis on the Korean Peninsula, triggered on
   November 23, 2010, by North Korea, has led the Chinese leadership to
   revisit its relationship with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
   (DPRK) with a renewed sense of urgency. In this paper, I argue that in
   light of China's wider regional ambitions in particular, such a
   reexamination is becoming more and more necessary.
   It has been correctly asserted that the most important source of
   conflict between China and the United States lies in Beijing's ambition
   to reclaim China's historical place as a leading power in the world and
   the Washington's refusal to surrender the United States' position as the
   sole superpower Here, I argue that the likelihood of this conflict
   erupting in the long term is increased by North Korea's recent
   aggressive and violent foreign policy because this threatens to further
   anchor the United States in East Asia, primarily in the context of
   security affairs.},

Abstract = {NGOs comprise over half the cumulative number of delegates attending the

   Conference of the Parties (COP) for the 1995-2009 period. These NGOs
   represent a wide array of issues, including sustainable development,
   business, and higher education, to name just a few. Based on UNFCCC
   publicly available participation statistics, this article analyzes NGO
   participation from a quantitative issue-based perspective, and compares
   the results with the relevant conclusions drawn by the other
   contributors to this special issue. The findings of this analysis
   confirm informed expectations about issue-driven NGO participation. In
   particular, three main findings are that: (1) environment and
   conservation, academic, business, and energy NGOs dominate civil society
   participation in the UNFCCC; (2) UNFCCC constituencies do not adequately
   capture the range of issues addressed by observer NGOs; and (3) since
   2007, NGO participation has significantly increased and diversified.},

Abstract = {One of Max Weber's most well-known achievements was the formulation of
   three concepts of legitimate authority: traditional, legal-rational and
   charismatic. However, there are particular problems with the last of
   these, which is not historically grounded in the manner of the other two
   concepts. The charisma concept originated with Weber's sociology of
   religion, was pressed into service in pre-war writing on the sociology
   of domination, shifted focus in his wartime political writings and
   changed meaning again in his post-war writing on basic sociological
   concepts. To use the concept in historical-political analysis, I argue,
   one must distinguish between a pre-modern and modern form of charismatic
   domination. I argue that doing this enables us to understand features of
   the leadership of colonial nationalist and fascist movements.},

Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Pages = {36+},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The establishment of international environmental institutions is often
   predicated on the assumption that cooperation is politically feasible
   and that regime formation is viable. However, the provision of many
   environmental services remains vulnerable to asymmetries in interests
   that impede both cooperation and adaptation. We examine governance
   structures that internalize externalities under asymmetrical conditions
   aggravated by abrupt and/or significant changes in political
   circumstances (in this context, the eruption of political violence
   which, in this article, we refer to as political variability). We
   analyze the change over time in Israel's strategies for stream and river
   rehabilitation undertaken as a response to continued runoff of
   wastewater from Palestinian territories. We find that abrupt political
   changes that negatively affect relations among the parties undermine the
   foundations for cooperative solutions. In the Israeli-Palestinian case,
   Israel has responded by adopting a position of ``unilateral
   environmentalism.{''} Such a non-cooperative policy was deemed the best
   possible option for addressing the transboundary pollution problems, in
   stark contrast to the model of cooperation that underlies most IEAs.
   Yet, we find that while unilateral environmentalism may safeguard a
   country's immediate political and environmental interests, it also
   entails various risks in the medium and long term.},

Title = {Militarism versus Security? The Double-Bind of Israel's Culture of
   Bereavement and Hierarchy of Sensitivity to Loss},
Journal = {MEDITERRANEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {16},
Number = {3},
Pages = {365-384},
Abstract = {Can there be any contradiction between militarism and security? This
   paper explores the implications of a derivative of cultural militarism
   in Israel - the panic set off by military casualties - and shows that it
   undermines the value of security and, in the process, prevents the army
   from providing civilians with security. Recent research into military
   policy and doctrine and conduct cites the phenomenon of phobia over
   losses, with accompanying moral panic, as a product of strategic
   culture. This approach contains a noteworthy paradox: military
   campaigns, whether proactive or defensive responses, tend to prioritize
   safeguarding soldiers' lives over those of the civilians they are
   committed to protect. This orientation has penetrated Israel's highest
   political and military echelons and reveals a remarkable reversal of
   values among the Israeli elite, that traditionally promoted heroism and
   sacrifice in the line of duty. An emergent strategic `counter-culture'
   has appeared, seeking to liberate the current military policy from this
   paradox. In either paradigm, the article indicates culture rather than
   geostrategic interests as the key determining factor in forming military
   policy and conduct.},

   Qualitative Comparative Analysis},
Journal = {MEDITERRANEAN POLITICS},

Pages = {405-426},
Abstract = {This article examines the determinants of aid allocation by the European
   Union to its southern neighbours within the framework of the
   Euro-Mediterranean Partnership and the European Neighbourhood Policy.
   Starting from the observation that in the two periods 2002-06 and
   2007-10 the European Commission committed a considerably larger amount
   of aid per capita to Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco and Tunisia than to
   Algeria, Egypt and Syria, four models regarding aid allocation are
   identified from the literature and EU documents: donor interest,
   recipient need, good governance and economic reforms. Subsequently, the
   hypotheses of these models are tested using a fuzzy-set qualitative
   comparative analysis. The article concludes that the economic reforms
   model proves to have the most explanatory value. The EU's aid policy in
   the Mediterranean has a long-term objective - the promotion of
   market-based reforms. In addition, a high score for control of
   corruption is identified as a sufficient condition for receiving a large
   amount of funding.},

Title = {Why Advancement in Public Administration Has Always Been an Essay
   Contest PROOFS FROM THE PRESIDENCY AND THE BUREAUCRACY},
Booktitle = {CASES IN PUBLIC POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION},
Year = {2011},
Pages = {200-210},
Abstract = {In 1938, a teen-aged Henry Kissinger fled Nazi Germany with his family
   and arrived in the United States. This Jewish refugee then proceeded to
   write his way to the top of his new country's political and social
   elite. However critical one may be about the policies he espoused while
   he was managing U.S. foreign affairs in the administrations of Richard
   M. Nixon and Gerald R. Ford, it cannot be denied that he is the living
   embodiment of the American dream, of advancement through merit and the
   ability to write one's way up into high office no matter how low one
   started.
   The contention of this chapter is that real life in the world of public
   policy and administration is an essay contest. Those who win very often
   do so by writing their way to bureaucratic or policy-making success.
   Kissinger not only won, he had to play the game in a foreign language.
   He did not learn English until high school and never lost his trademark
   German accent. The turning point of his youth was 1943. In that year, he
   became a U.S. citizen and was drafted into the U.S. Army. The army was
   the making of him.
   It was while he was serving in Germany as a translator in military
   intelligence and rising to the rank of sergeant that he had his
   ``Alexander Hamilton moment.{''} Hamilton, as a young man on the
   Caribbean island of Nevis, so impressed the men he worked for that they
   gratuitously arranged for him to leave the island and attend Kings
   College (now Columbia University) just in time to join the American
   Revolution and earn his place on the \$10 bill. In a parallel
   development, Kissinger so impressed the Army officers he worked for that
   they saw to it that, upon being discharged from service in 1946, he
   entered Harvard University as an undergraduate. This was a far more
   difficult proposition then than now, because Harvard was at that time
   swamped with applications from returning servicemen and, significantly,
   it had a quota on the number of Jews it would admit. Nevertheless, for
   Kissinger the Army led directly to Harvard, because his highly
   influential and academically connected organizational superiors were so
   taken with his native brilliance, engaging personality, and ability to
   write-in both German and English. Once at Harvard University, he never
   left until he left for the White House. After earning his Ph.D. in 1954,
   he was invited to join the faculty.},

Abstract = {Why does Nicaragua have less violent crime than Guatemala, El Salvador,
   and Honduras? All these countries underwent political transitions in the
   1990s. Many explanations point to the legacies of war, socioeconomic
   underdevelopment, and neoliberal structural reforms. However, these
   arguments do not fully explain why, despite economic reforms conducted
   throughout the region, war-less Honduras and wealthier Guatemala and El
   Salvador have much more crime than Nicaragua. This article argues that
   public security reforms carried out during the political transitions
   shaped the ability of the new regimes to control the violence produced
   by their own institutions and collaborators. In the analysis of the
   crisis of public security, it is important to bring the state back. The
   survival of violent entrepreneurs in the new security apparatus and
   their relationship with new governing elites foster the conditions for
   the escalation of violence in northern Central America.},

Abstract = {Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods have facilitated an explosion of
   interest in Bayesian methods. MCMC is an incredibly useful and important
   tool but can face difficulties when used to estimate complex posteriors
   or models applied to large data sets. In this paper, we show how a
   recently developed tool in computer science for fitting Bayesian models,
   variational approximations, can be used to facilitate the application of
   Bayesian models to political science data. Variational approximations
   are often much faster than MCMC for fully Bayesian inference and in some
   instances facilitate the estimation of models that would be otherwise
   impossible to estimate. As a deterministic posterior approximation
   method, variational approximations are guaranteed to converge and
   convergence is easily assessed. But variational approximations do have
   some limitations, which we detail below. Therefore, variational
   approximations are best suited to problems when fully Bayesian inference
   would otherwise be impossible. Through a series of examples, we
   demonstrate how variational approximations are useful for a variety of
   political science research. This includes models to describe legislative
   voting blocs and statistical models for political texts. The code that
   implements the models in this paper is available in the supplementary
   material.},

Abstract = {Address-Based Sampling (ABS) is increasingly viewed as a potential
   remedy for the rising costs associated with in-person surveys of the
   U.S. general population, and for the dwindling coverage associated with
   telephone surveys. For small and moderate-sized surveys, ABS can help
   make in-person interviewing a viable mode of data collection. For
   large-scale studies, ABS can enable the transfer of resources from frame
   development to activities like training for refusal conversion, an
   examination of total survey error, or a nonresponse follow-up study. A
   synthesis of research studies estimating ABS coverage for in-person
   surveys shows nearly complete coverage of the household population in
   urban areas and varying degrees of undercoverage in rural areas. Less is
   known about ABS coverage of non-household populations, such as college
   students living in dormitories or persons residing in other group
   quarters. This research suggests the holistic question: Does the
   expediency of ABS outweigh the undercoverage that may accompany its use?
   The answer depends on the population being studied, the mode of data
   collection, and the effectiveness of frame supplementation methods. This
   article summarizes the current literature on the advantages and
   challenges of using ABS for in-person surveys as well as for mail and
   mixed-mode surveys.},

Abstract = {Over the past half century, scholars have utilized a variety of
   theoretical and methodological approaches to study the attachment or
   identification voters have with political parties. However, models of
   partisan (in)stability ignore its bounded character. Making use of Mixed
   Latent Markov Models, we measure the change and stability of
   individual-level West German partisan identification captured over a
   24-year period via the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSEOP). Results
   suggest that distinctive subpopulations exist that follow different
   patterns of partisan stability. One party's loss is not necessarily
   another party's gain.},

Abstract = {Spatial statistical methods in political science provide a tool to deal
   with spatial and other forms of interdependence in observational data.
   In this article, I derive a statistical model from a game of impure
   public goods provision. The resulting strategic autoregressive model
   (StratAM) allows the researcher to systematically explore the sources of
   free-riding behavior in the provision of public goods. The StratAM model
   is tightly related to the well-known spatial autoregressive (SAR) model
   and can be estimated in a maximum likelihood framework. I demonstrate
   the use of the StratAM model by analyzing free riding in the provision
   of foreign aid. Indicators of developmental needs and good governance
   strongly increase free-riding during the 1990s. Free-riding patterns in
   the 2000s are more similar to Cold War patterns.},

Abstract = {The fate of missing persons is a central issue in post-conflict
   societies facing truth recovery and human rights dilemmas. Despite
   widespread public sympathy towards relatives, societies emerging from
   conflict often defer the recovery of missing for decades. More
   paradoxically, in post-1974 Cyprus, the official authorities delayed
   unilateral exhumations of victims buried within cemeteries in their own
   jurisdiction. Analysis of official post-1974 discourses reveals a
   Greek-Cypriot consensus to emphasise the issue as one of Turkish
   aggression, thus downplaying in-group responsibilities and the legacy of
   intra-communal violence. We compare the experience of Cyprus with other
   post-conflict societies such as Spain, Northern Ireland, and Mozambique
   and explore the linkages between institutions and beliefs about
   transitional justice. We argue that elite consensus initiates and
   facilitates the transition to democracy but often leads to the
   institutionalisation of groups opposing truth recovery even for in-group
   members.},

Title = {USING A ``MATCH RATE{''} MODEL TO PREDICT AREAS WHERE USPS-BASED ADDRESS
   LISTS MAY BE USED IN PLACE OF TRADITIONAL LISTING},

Abstract = {For decades, traditional listing has been the standard method for
   constructing address-based sampling (ABS) frames. Address lists compiled
   by listers generally are believed to provide good coverage of
   residential units in the sampled area. Nonetheless, the time and
   resources associated with creating these address lists have led survey
   practitioners to consider the use of the U.S. Postal Service (USPS)
   Computerized Delivery Sequence File listings as an alternative. Previous
   studies have yielded an abundance of information about the utility of
   ABS frames. In our recent investigation (Montaquila et al. 2009), we
   found coverage of the USPS-based address lists to be generally good in
   urban areas but inadequate in some rural areas, and also poorer in
   high-population-growth areas. Resources, time, and effort could be
   conserved if we are able to use the USPS list as a sampling frame in
   areas where it provides adequate coverage. In this article, we develop a
   ``match rate{''} model that uses multiple regression to predict the
   match rate (the proportion of traditionally listed addresses that would
   have been obtained from a USPS list) based on characteristics of the
   geographic areas of interest. We discuss the feasibility of using USPS
   lists for household surveys, drawing on results from our previous work
   and the match rate modeling. We describe an approach for setting
   threshold values of predicted match rate to determine when to use USPS
   lists in lieu of traditional listing. Finally, we assess the model's
   external validity based on the application of the model to an
   independent dataset.},

Month = {SPR},
Abstract = {This paper analyzes the properties of the fixed-effects vector
   decomposition estimator, an emerging and popular technique for
   estimating time-invariant variables in panel data models with group
   effects. This estimator was initially motivated on heuristic grounds,
   and advocated on the strength of favorable Monte Carlo results, but with
   no formal analysis. We show that the three-stage procedure of this
   decomposition is equivalent to a standard instrumental variables
   approach, for a specific set of instruments. The instrumental variables
   representation facilitates the present formal analysis that finds: (1)
   The estimator reproduces exactly classical fixed-effects estimates for
   time-varying variables. (2) The standard errors recommended for this
   estimator are too small for both time-varying and time-invariant
   variables. (3) The estimator is inconsistent when the time-invariant
   variables are endogenous. (4) The reported sampling properties in the
   original Monte Carlo evidence do not account for presence of a group
   effect. (5) The decomposition estimator has higher risk than existing
   shrinkage approaches, unless the endogeneity problem is known to be
   small or no relevant instruments exist.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN SECURITY},

Pages = {155-184},
Abstract = {The thrust of this paper concerns the case of the European Battlegroup
   (BG) non-deployment in late 2008, when the United Nations requested
   European military support for the United Nations Organisation Mission
   peacekeeping force in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The
   argument is built on the fact that when, in official documents, the EU
   approaches the European security and ESDP/CSDP's military crisis
   management policy and interventions, it makes strong references to the
   United Nations and the UN Charter Chapter VII's mandate of restoring
   international peace and security. Such references make it seem that
   supporting the UN when it deals with threats and crises is a primary
   concern of the EU and the member states. These allusions lead to the
   main contention of this paper, that there is much ambivalence in these
   indications. The paper develops its argument from one key hypothesis;
   namely, that the non-deployment of a European BG in the DRC, at the end
   of 2008, constitutes a useful case study for detecting a number of
   ambiguities of the EU in respect of its declarations in the official
   documents establishing the European military crisis management
   intervention structure.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to explain variations in public support for the
   deployment of military troops to Afghanistan by means of the strategic
   narratives employed by national governments. Focusing on the UK, Canada,
   the Netherlands and Denmark, we argue that strong narratives about the
   why-what-and-how of overseas military missions increase the likelihood
   of popular support, while weak story lines are likely to result in a
   souring public opinion environment. Contrary to most current studies of
   public opinion and the support for international missions, we thus
   emphasise the role played by political leaders in shaping public
   attitudes towards the projection of military power. Surely, politicians
   are affected by polls and the wishes of public opinion - but popular
   attitudes are far from immune from political elites' attempts to
   rationalise the use of military force via strategic narratives.},

Abstract = {On January 20, 1953, Dwight D. Eisenhower, the five-star general who led
   the Western Allies to victory against Nazi Germany in World War II, took
   the oath of office as president of the United States. A few hours later,
   he was handed a sealed envelope. According to Eisenhower biographer
   Geoffrey Perret (1999), ``Eisenhower was annoyed.{''} He told the man
   who gave him the envelope, ``Never bring me a sealed envelope again.{''}
   Perret wrote that this sealed envelope was ``concrete proof of something
   he already believed-that this place {[} the White House] was badly
   organized, badly run. Hundreds of letters addressed to him arrived each
   day. Just opening them would have been a chore. More than that, though,
   they had to be screened so that only those that he had to read, whether
   to conduct government business or to keep old friendships in good
   repair, were placed before him.{''} To deal with the problem that was
   symbolized by the sealed envelope, Eisenhower adopted a variant of the
   system-the general staff system-that was pioneered and perfected by the
   Germans whose army he had so recently defeated. (To be completely
   honest, Eisenhower's forces only confronted about a quarter of the
   German Army; the rest were defeated by the Red Army of the Soviet
   Union.) President Eisenhower's variant of a German invention is the
   beginning of the widespread use of the civilian chief-of-staff system
   that has since been so widely copied by governments at all levels.},

Abstract = {The Internet has changed the way people get their information, becoming
   more popular for news purposes than any other single element of the mass
   media, including television. Far more than half of the adult population
   of the United States are online regularly, and that number continues to
   grow. It has significantly changed the way people get political and
   policy information. Even twenty-four-hour news programs such as MSNBC,
   Fox News, and CNN refer constantly to their Internet sites for
   additional coverage of a topic. The variety of news sources available
   online, with virtually every newspaper having an online edition and
   every browser having a list of up-to-date headlines, is massive.
   The Internet is also changing the way policy gets made-no longer behind
   closed doors or in tedious public hearings that no one but the policy
   makers, lobbyists, and obscure professors attend. Policy makers, for
   better or worse, have immediate access to millions of voters and vast
   amounts of information that was not previously available in a timely
   fashion. Practically every major government agency, every executive, and
   every legislator now has a website on which they continuously present
   information, often distort information, and obtain feedback from the
   public.
   Most users of the Internet appreciate what it is now and not what it
   was. Those with a limited understanding of its early beginnings may not
   be aware that early policy decisions about ``the Net{''} made it what it
   is today. And as with most policy decisions, it was not something that
   happened in a straight line. No policy maker said, as President John F.
   Kennedy did in 1961, ``I believe that this nation should commit itself
   to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on
   the moon and returning him safely to the earth.{''} There was no policy
   decision, as with the moon landing, to create the modern Internet. It
   just evolved from a series of ``smaller{''} decisions that were inspired
   by the necessities of the Cold War.},

Abstract = {Today the Crimean War of 1853 to 1856, fought by Great Britain, France,
   and Turkey (then the Ottoman Empire) against Russia, is all but
   forgotten save for two things: the classic poetic description of
   military incompetence, and a nurse. The 1854 poem, ``The Charge of the
   Light Brigade,{''} by Alfred Lord Tennyson (1809-1892) still resonates
   as a ``tribute{''} to misunderstood military orders and the sacred duty
   of obedience notwithstanding the stupidity of the orders: ``Theirs was
   not to reason why, theirs was but to do and die.{''} Many generations of
   young men had this poem as their mantra as they traveled ``into the jaws
   of death, into the mouth of hell{''} when it became their duty to charge
   during the wars of the twentieth century.
   However, this poem, perhaps the most memorized and most influential of
   all war poems, pales in significance compared to the incomparable nurse
   and the inspiring story of her professional accomplishments and
   self-sacrificing personal example. We speak, of course, of the women
   whose name has come to epitomize both the invention and practice of
   modern nursing, Florence Nightingale (1820-1910).},

   Education},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY EUROPEAN STUDIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {19},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {489-500},
Abstract = {The Turkish Republic that emerged from the collapsing Ottoman Empire
   offers an instructive example of a self-conscious deployment of history
   by political elites to build a nation fitting the new state. The purpose
   of official history has been to tie the population to the land and the
   State, and to the project of `modernization' (meaning, mostly,
   Europeanization). It encompasses many apparent contradictions that
   nevertheless have had to be reconciled in the historical narratives
   presented to schoolchildren and what has been omitted from those
   narratives, such as the role of Europeans as wartime enemies versus the
   new Republic's European orientation. In order to explain how Turkish
   republican official history selectively synthesized and mobilized
   disparate potential historical sources of a modernizing national
   identity, I analyze history textbooks and curricular materials from the
   1930s through the 1950s, applying a four-way analysis drawn from
   Nietzsche. Following the schema presented in his early essay `History in
   the service and disservice of life' I show examples of how different
   elements of Turkey's past, as well as key events in European history,
   are deployed in monumental, antiquarian, and critical modes of
   representation. I discuss Nietzsche's main preoccupation in that essay,
   the importance of forgetting, and apply it to some of the occlusions in
   the history curriculum of the early Republic. The article sheds light on
   the content of the history curriculum and the challenges facing
   reformers today, and also illustrates an analytic schema that could be
   applied to other cases of national identity construction.},

Abstract = {What is the relationship between voting and individual life satisfaction
   in Latin America? While studies of Western Europe suggest that voters
   are happier than nonvoters, this relationship has not been explored in
   the younger democracies of the developing world, including those of
   Latin America. Using multilevel regression models to examine
   individual-level survey data, this study shows a positive correlation
   between voting and happiness in the region, noting, however, that the
   relationship is attenuated in those countries that have enforced
   compulsory voting. We then explore the causal direction of this
   relationship: while the existing literature points to voting as a
   possible determinant of individual happiness, it is also possible that
   happier individuals are more likely to vote. Three different strategies
   are used to disentangle this relationship. On balance, the evidence
   suggests that individual happiness is more likely to be a cause rather
   than an effect of voting in Latin America.},

Abstract = {In this article, I explore the subject of Switzerland's nationhood in
   light of a theoretical approach based on normative principles. This
   approach has the advantage of avoiding the definitional conundrum
   arising from the plurality of purely descriptive (often historical)
   definitions of nationhood. Instead, in accordance with certain normative
   inferences concerning what the nation ought to be given the principles
   of democracy, law and inclusion, it portrays the nation as a political
   entity having the largest possible group of individuals instituting a
   space of public discussion within a state. In this normative definition,
   attention should be drawn to the concept of `space of public
   discussion', which, to my mind, entails the existence of a common public
   language used by its citizens - something notably different from either
   the multilingualism of the elite or a common parliamentary language.
   Proceeding in this way, I will defend the idea that Switzerland is a
   multinational state on the basis that cantons may be considered small
   nations, although certain pressures on the boundaries of the cantonal
   public spaces tending to expand them to the whole of the linguistic
   region must also be taken into consideration.},

Title = {Coping with deviance: Swiss nationhood in the long nineteenth century},
Journal = {NATIONS AND NATIONALISM},

Volume = {17},
Number = {4},
Pages = {756-774},

Abstract = {This article highlights two processes that shaped Swiss nationhood in
   the long nineteenth century. The first concerns the competition between
   different nation-states and the nationalist visions these contests
   engendered. In a Europe dominated by the norm of the culturally and
   ethnically homogenous nation, the Swiss authorities, public
   intellectuals and various political representatives were desperate to
   display an image of national authenticity to the outside world. The
   result was a nationalism that combined voluntaristic and organic
   elements. In the second and main part of this article, the focus turns
   on citizenship; it is conceived not only as a social and legal
   institution, but also as a cognitive prism through which people defined
   their membership in the national community. Remarkably, the authority in
   granting national citizenship to foreign nationals remained firmly in
   the hands of the cantons and, above all, the Swiss municipalities. In
   practical terms, this meant that the Gemeinde provided the institutional
   and cognitive frame through which nationhood was primarily experienced,
   imagined and defined. While Switzerland represents a particularly strong
   case of a communalist polity, it should not be treated as unique.
   Instead, it should alert us to a potentially fertile yet little-explored
   area of research: what might be called the communal embededdness of the
   national(ist) imagination.},

Title = {A Leader Without Followers? The Growing Divergence Between the Regional

Abstract = {Brazilian diplomats and academics alike have long regarded regional
   leadership as a springboard to global recognition. Yet Brazil's foreign
   policy has not translated the country's structural and instrumental
   resources into effective regional leadership. Brazil's potential
   followers have not aligned with its main goals, such as a permanent seat
   on the UN Security Council and Directorship-General of the World Trade
   Organization; some have even challenged its regional influence.
   Nevertheless, Brazil has been recognized as an emergent global power.
   This article analyzes the growing mismatch between the regional and
   global performance of Brazilian foreign policy and shows how both
   theoretical expectations and policy planning were ``luckily foiled{''}
   by unforeseen developments. It argues that because of regional power
   rivalries and a relative paucity of resources, Brazil is likely to
   consolidate itself as a middle global power before gaining acceptance as
   a leader in its region.},

Journal = {LATIN AMERICAN POLITICS AND SOCIETY},

Volume = {53},
Number = {2},
Pages = {61-86},
Month = {SUM},
Abstract = {As indigenous movements around the world seek to strengthen their
   collective voice in their respective political systems, efforts continue
   to design political institutions that offer both sufficient local
   autonomy and incentives to participate in the broader political system.
   The state of Oaxaca, Mexico, offers a test case of one such effort at
   indigenous-based institutional design. This article argues that such
   reforms often fail to confront the tension between local autonomy and
   citizen engagement in politics outside the borders of the community.
   Testing this theory through a comparative analysis of voter turnout
   rates in municipalities across the state of Oaxaca and the neighboring
   state of Guerrero, this study finds that the adoption of indigenous
   institutions at the local level is associated with significantly lower
   voter turnout rates for national elections.},

Abstract = {For some time now, Beijing has been known as a climate change laggard,
   refusing to commit to binding emission reduction targets at the
   international level. Although the Hu-Wen administration has elevated the
   energy and climate issue to the highest domestic political level, the
   rationale behind this move derives mainly from economic and energy
   security considerations. The framework of climate-relevant measures has
   been tightened, ambitious domestic targets to slow the growth of
   greenhouse gas output have been set out, and measures to promote the
   development and deployment of climate-friendly technologies implemented,
   thus suggesting that Beijing is increasingly incorporating environmental
   considerations in its policy formation. However, clearing the path
   toward an eco-modernized society requires major transformations in
   political, economic, and social institutions. This study analyzes
   developments in China's climate policy from an ecological modernization
   perspective. Although China has undertaken some remarkable
   climate-relevant action, this study concludes that its transition can
   only be partly explained by concepts of ecological modernization.},

Abstract = {This article reinforces our 2007 Political Analysis publication in
   demonstrating that the fixed-effects vector decomposition (FEVD)
   procedure outperforms any other estimator in estimating models that
   suffer from the simultaneous presence of time-varying variables
   correlated with unobserved unit effects and time-invariant variables. We
   compare the finite-sample properties of FEVD not only to the
   Hausman-Taylor estimator but also to the pretest estimator and the
   shrinkage estimator suggested by Breusch, Ward, Nguyen and Kompas
   (BWNK), and Greene in this symposium. Moreover, we correct the
   discussion of Greene and BWNK of FEVD's asymptotic and finite-sample
   properties.},

Abstract = {This article relies on cases from new EU member states in postcommunist
   Europe to integrate two overlapping debates about majority-minority
   relations. Since the Second World War, political theorists and
   international institutions have tended to discourage group-rights
   approaches in favour of individual rights; meanwhile, policy-makers who
   achieved interethnic peace in postcommunist Europe have often opted for
   group-rights approaches. On the basis of political theory, international
   norms and the conduct of political elites in this region, we argue that
   both the individual-rights and group-rights approaches can be
   differentiated internally along the dimension of pluralism - that is,
   their willingness to accommodate multiple processes of cultural
   reproduction. Moreover, both group-rights and individual-rights
   approaches can offer justifications for restricting minority cultural
   opportunities; furthermore, restrictive group-rights approaches
   sometimes cloak their efforts behind `Western-sounding'
   individual-rights rhetoric. Likewise, both group-rights and
   individual-rights approaches can permit group accommodation that can
   lead to political integration. We find that de facto pluralist
   approaches to minority accommodation often spearheaded by moderate
   parties of the majority in coalition with minority-group parties -
   encourage ethnic peace, regardless of their foundation in individual or
   group rights.},

Journal = {MEDITERRANEAN POLITICS},

Pages = {193-211},
Abstract = {Energy co-operation has appeared as a priority area on the EU's
   Mediterranean policy agenda since the promulgation of the
   Euro-Mediterranean Partnership (EMP) in 1995. The Union for the
   Mediterranean (UfM) has pledged to do more than previous policy
   frameworks in the area of energy co-operation, and has specifically
   identified renewable, particularly solar, energy as a possible catalyst.
   This study aims to assess the prospects for Euro-Mediterranean energy
   co-operation within the framework of the UfM. To this end, it will
   examine the reasons behind the failure of both the EMP and the ENP to
   achieve meaningful progress in their equally sanguine enunciated policy
   objectives in this area, comparing their respective approaches with that
   of the UfM. It will be argued that the prospects for Euro-Mediterranean
   energy co-operation under the UfM will hinge more on the shifting
   priorities of European consumers and SMC producers, informed in
   particular by concerns over climate change, the need to diversify
   sources of primary energy supply and the depletion of proven
   conventional fossil fuel reserves, than on the attributes of the UfM per
   se.},

Abstract = {It was a dark and stormy night somewhere, but it was mainly dark on the
   night of May 11, 1960, in Argentina. Three men in a car were waiting for
   a bus bringing commuters home from jobs in the city to a distant
   working-class suburb of Buenos Aires. As the bus pulled away from its
   stop, a middle-aged balding man with glasses began walking in their
   direction. As he approached the car, two of the men jumped out,
   overpowered the astonished commuter, and shoved him into the back seat.
   The car then drove away as fast as it could without attracting
   attention. This was a kidnapping. The man taken was Adolf Eichmann, one
   of the leading public administrators behind one of history's greatest
   crimes, the murder of more than 6 million European Jews. His kidnappers
   were Israeli agents. This quest for vengeance had a surprising result.
   The kidnappee, who was thought to be the personification of evil, turned
   out to be so ordinary that subsequent events caused people to question
   the nature of evil itself-and where it comes from.},

   five major foreign policy models of the region with regard to Washington

   dynamics of Latin American insertion into world affairs. Then it
   introduces three new alternatives for handling U.S. Latin American
   relations in the coming years. It concludes by pointing out the
   importance of understanding the scope of the hemispheric challenges for
   both the region and Washington.},

Title = {Address-Based Sampling for Subpopulation Surveys},
Journal = {PUBLIC OPINION QUARTERLY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {75},
Number = {3},
Pages = {409-428},
Month = {FAL},
Abstract = {In this article, we describe the use of address-based sampling (ABS) for
   conducting a mail survey of a subgroup. Although ABS has been
   investigated as an alternative household sampling frame, its use for
   sampling subgroups is limited. Some researchers have used ABS to select
   households but then recruit households by telephone to the extent
   possible to screen for members of the subgroup. The approach we describe
   uses a two-phase methodology with mail as the primary mode of
   recruitment and data collection for all households. Facing declining
   response and coverage rates in its landline RDD surveys, the National
   Household Education Surveys (NHES) program embarked on a redesign
   effort. The two-phase ABS design using mail as the primary mode of data
   collection was chosen for the NHES:2009 Pilot Study. In the first phase,
   all sampled households were mailed a screener that identified members of
   the eligible subgroup (children) and provided the data needed for
   sampling among them. A second-phase substantive questionnaire was mailed
   to the sampled members of the subgroup. This use of the ABS and mail as
   the primary mode of data collection is new and largely untested. The
   findings from the NHES Pilot Study revealed that this approach is a
   feasible alternative for surveying targeted subgroups. Although the
   methods must undergo more robust and rigorous tests, it is an approach
   that may be able to fill some of the void created by the low response
   and coverage rates that afflict RDD surveys.},

Title = {Elections and the Regression Discontinuity Design: Lessons from Close US
   House Races, 1942-2008},
Journal = {POLITICAL ANALYSIS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {19},
Number = {4},
Pages = {385-408},
Month = {FAL},
Abstract = {Following David Lee's pioneering work, numerous scholars have applied
   the regression discontinuity (RD) design to popular elections. Contrary
   to the assumptions of RD, however, we show that bare winners and bare
   losers in U.S. House elections (1942-2008) differ markedly on
   pretreatment covariates. Bare winners possess large ex ante financial,
   experience, and incumbency advantages over their opponents and are
   usually the candidates predicted to win by Congressional Quarterly's
   pre-election ratings. Covariate imbalance actually worsens in the
   closest House elections. National partisan tides help explain these
   patterns. Previous works have missed this imbalance because they rely
   excessively on model-based extrapolation. We present evidence suggesting
   that sorting in close House elections is due mainly to activities on or
   before Election Day rather than postelection recounts or other
   manipulation. The sorting is so strong that it is impossible to achieve
   covariate balance between matched treated and control observations,
   making covariate adjustment a dubious enterprise. Although RD is
   problematic for postwar House elections, this example does highlight the
   design's advantages over alternatives: RD's assumptions are clear and
   weaker than model-based alternatives, and their implications are
   empirically testable.},

Abstract = {The case of the European Union shows that regional integration can make
   significant contributions to peace and prosperity; however where
   regional integration in Northeast Asia is concerned the dominant
   opinions are more skeptical. The main obstacle to regional integration
   is that the initiative has been limited to intergovernmental agreements.
   This paper contends that a community-building project at the state level
   will be likely to gain momentum if multiple levels of regional
   cooperation are emphasized at the local level. I have selected South
   Korea and China for this case study, with particular reference to
   Gyeonggi Province (do) and Shandong Province (sheng), due to their
   intensive inter-regional exchanges. The examination of various
   interactions observed at the trans-regional level provides a perspective
   on the roles of local governments and leads to an invaluable rediscovery
   of the merits of a bottom-up approach.},

Title = {The Origins and Implications of Language Effects in Multilingual
   Surveys: A MIMIC Approach with Application to Latino Political Attitudes},
Journal = {POLITICAL ANALYSIS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {19},
Number = {4},
Pages = {434-454},
Month = {FAL},
Abstract = {The study of Latino public opinion has renewed interest in the
   relationship between language and survey response. However, extant
   research generally relies on statistical methods that cannot distinguish
   between two related yet distinct types of language effects in Latino
   surveys: (1) differences in attitude and (2) differences in measures of
   attitude. The former reflects varied levels of a latent attitude between
   English and Spanish interviewees. The latter-formally known as
   Differential Item Functioning (DIF)-refers to linguistic differences in
   the interpretation of survey items, which lead Latino respondents to
   misreport their level of attitude. This paper proposes Multiple
   Indicators Multiple Causes models to decouple these two types of
   language effects. Using this modeling framework, I examine language
   differences in measures of subjective and factual political attitudes
   from the Latino National Survey (2006). I find that the language of
   interview systematically colors Latinos' interpretation of survey items,
   even after controlling for measurement error and individual differences
   in the latent variable being assessed. I then show through an applied
   analysis how ignoring language DIF can yield misleading inferences about
   hypothesized relationships between variables. Together, these findings
   highlight a need for greater theoretical work on the psychological
   origins of language effects in multilingual political surveys.},

Abstract = {This article examines the potential effectiveness of socially
   responsible investment (SRI) and investor environmentalism through
   carbon disclosure in terms of their key goal of creating real financial
   incentives, through share price performance, for firms to pursue climate
   change mitigation. It does so by theoretically assessing the two main
   assumptions which underpin investor environmentalism as promoted by SRI
   funds and NGOs such as the Carbon Disclosure Project: those concerning
   the power of institutional investors, and the ``business case{''} for
   climate change mitigation. In doing so, it argues that the potential of
   using institutional investors to create real financial incentives for
   climate change mitigation, in the form of share price performance, has
   been considerably overestimated and that there is not even a strong
   theoretical case for why carbon disclosure should work in this regard.
   This is argued based on the structural constraints faced by most
   institutional investors, as well as the fundamentally incorrect
   assumption about climate change, that it is a form of market failure,
   which theoretically underpins these initiatives.},

Abstract = {In several respects, the European Union (EU) represents both a novel
   system of quasi-supranational governance and a novel form of political
   community or polity. But it is also a relatively fragile construction:
   it remains a community still in the making with an incipient sense of
   identity, within which powerful forces are at work. This article has
   three main aims. Firstly, to analyse the reasons and key ideas that
   prompted a selected elite to construct a set of institutions and
   treaties destined to unite European nations in such a way that the mere
   idea of a `civil war' among them would become impossible. Secondly, to
   examine the specific top-down processes that led to the emergence of a
   united Europe and the subsequent emergence of the EU, thus emphasising
   the constant distance between the elites and the masses in the
   development of the European project. Finally, to explain why the EU has
   generated what I call a `non-emotional' identity, radically different
   from the emotionally charged and still prevailing national identities
   present in its member states.},

Journal = {PUBLIC OPINION QUARTERLY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {75},
Number = {1},
Pages = {125-138},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {For decades, numerous surveys have asked Americans the ``Most Important
   Problem{''} (MIP) question: ``What do you think is the most important
   problem facing this country today?{''} Global warming and the
   environment have rarely been cited by more than a small number of
   respondents in these surveys in recent years, which might seem to
   suggest that these have not been the most important issues to Americans.
   This paper explores the possibility that an additional method of
   assessing the public's priorities might support a different conclusion.
   Three experiments embedded in national surveys (two done via the
   Internet, the other done by telephone) show that when asked the
   traditional MIP question, respondents rarely mentioned global warming or
   the environment, but when other respondents were asked to identify the
   most serious problem that will face the world in the future if nothing
   is done to stop it, global warming and the environment were the most
   frequently mentioned problems. Furthermore, a large majority of
   Americans indicated that they wanted the federal government to devote
   substantial effort to combating problems that the world will face in the
   future if nothing is done to stop them. Thus, future surveys might
   include both versions of the MIP question to more fully document
   Americans' priorities.},

Abstract = {Climate change has disastrous impacts in the developing world and
   confronts countries like India with immense challenges. The dilemma of
   addressing these challenges encourages the appearance of new modes of
   agency. However, the extent to which new agents are able to address
   these challenges depends on several factors. The aim of this article is
   to examine these factors and how they affect the ways in which climate
   change-related challenges to development are tackled in the case of the
   Indian wind energy sector. By firstly examining the attributes and
   capabilities of the different actors and secondly applying a stakeholder
   network analysis, the article identifies different characteristics that
   support the effective and efficient deployment of wind energy in one
   Indian state and hinder it in another.},

Abstract = {In the 1980s and 1990s, economic crisis produced ideological convergence
   in many Latin American party systems. Much scholarship explores how this
   convergence frequently provoked system change that enabled renewed
   ideological differentiation, but little research examines instances
   where convergence persisted without destabilizing the system. Through
   comparative historical analysis of Dominican continuity amid regional
   change, this study identifies factors that sustain or challenge party
   systems. Then, through analysis of Americas Barometer surveys, it
   assesses the causal mechanisms through which these factors shape support
   for the traditional Dominican parties. The findings demonstrate that
   maintaining programmatic and clientelist linkages facilitates
   continuity. In addition, the article argues that the threats political
   outsiders pose to existing party systems are constrained when people
   excluded from the system are divided and demobilized. In the Dominican
   case, Haitian immigration divides the popular sector while Dominicans
   abroad sustain ties to the parties, with both migration flows
   facilitating party system continuity.},

Abstract = {Within the next few years, NATO will need to make a collective decision
   about the future of US tactical nuclear weapons (TNW) in Europe. While
   opinion about the value of these weapons is not as split as conventional
   wisdom might suggest, and while NATO will remain a nuclear alliance
   irrespective of this decision, balancing politics and strategy looks
   likely to be a difficult task. This decision is made far more complex by
   the determination of NATO officials to link the withdrawal of these
   weapons to reciprocal reductions in Russian TNW in Europe, and by the
   possibility of substituting the key strategic and political link they
   provide with a ballistic missile defense (BMD) system. This article
   shows how we have arrived at this position, highlights the potential
   benefits to NATO Europe of BMD, and considers the key questions that the
   Alliance will face in achieving this. Ultimately, this article shows how
   the future of TNW in Europe is likely to be linked to whether NATO
   values arms cuts with Russia, or the deployment of missile defenses, as
   its central priority.},

Title = {Balancing beyond the horizon? Explaining aggregate EU naval military
   capability changes in a neo-realist perspective},
Journal = {EUROPEAN SECURITY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Pages = {45-64},
Abstract = {The present paper seeks to make sense of recent European Union (EU)
   naval capability changes by applying neo-realist theory to the EU as a
   collective actor in the global balance of power. The paper compares two
   different strands of neo-realist theory by deducing key predictions
   about the expected naval posture of the Union and the corresponding
   expected changes in capabilities. These predictions are subsequently
   held up against post-cold war data on naval acquisitions in the EU. The
   paper concludes that the observed patterns are best explained not as
   bandwagoning with the USA, but as a long-term balancing strategy aimed
   at bolstering the autonomy and international influence of the Union
   vis-a-vis other major powers, including the USA.},

Abstract = {Dating back to the mid-1950s, questions regarding school integration
   have become a staple of public opinion polls. As the United States
   transitions to an era where virtually all integration efforts must be
   voluntarily adopted by school boards, public support for integration is
   more important than ever. To understand the public's shifting view on
   this topic, we review poll questions in three broad areas: public
   support for school racial integration, public preferences for an ideal
   school composition, and beliefs about the outcomes of school
   integration. Additionally, we consider the public's opinion relative to
   Supreme Court cases. The variety of question types, formats, and nature
   of the topic make interpreting the public's views challenging, but some
   generalizations are possible: widespread support for the ideal of
   integration is consistent, but more ambiguity emerges about the
   specifics of accomplishing desegregation.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on the plight of the Jews in Turkey during the
   Second World War, with the intention of analysing specific historical
   events through the lenses of leading theories of nationalism. First we
   review recent developments in historiography that contribute the
   framework for understanding both the hermeneutical possibilities and
   limitations when addressing historical texts. Then we employ three
   theories of nationalism - the ethno-symbolist, instrumentalist and
   social constructivist - as a means of analysing and interpreting the
   historical events of the Jewish predicament vis-a-vis the Republic of
   Turkey. We conclude by suggesting what impact our findings may have on
   the narratives from this time period, and the way in which we can
   understand narratives today.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we introduce an innovative method to diagnose electoral
   fraud using vote counts. Specifically, we use synthetic data to develop
   and train a fraud detection prototype. We employ a naive Bayes
   classifier as our learning algorithm and rely on digital analysis to
   identify the features that are most informative about class
   distinctions. To evaluate the detection capability of the classifier, we
   use authentic data drawn from a novel data set of district-level vote
   counts in the province of Buenos Aires (Argentina) between 1931 and
   1941, a period with a checkered history of fraud. Our results
   corroborate the validity of our approach: The elections considered to be
   irregular (legitimate) by most historical accounts are unambiguously
   classified as fraudulent (clean) by the learner. More generally, our
   findings demonstrate the feasibility of generating and using synthetic
   data for training and testing an electoral fraud detection system.},

Abstract = {By analysing school memorial ceremonies in Israel, this article
   demonstrates how dominant groups in Israeli society (upper- and
   middle-class, secular, educated Jews of European origin) exploit their
   historical monopoly over the Israeli warrior ethos in order to retreat
   from their unconditional commitment to the state and the military, which
   stands at the very core of traditional `heroic nationalism'.
   Nonetheless, despite their withdrawal from the military ethos, analysis
   of the school ceremonies shows that rather than distancing themselves
   from the national collective, they are promoting a different kind of
   nationalism - one that I term `traumatic nationalism'. This model
   departs from the warrior ethos and places mourning and a feeling of
   victimhood at its centre. Thus, through the arena of education, the
   dominant groups - which mark out the global as their sphere of action -
   promote a model of nationalism that meets the demands of the
   post-national discourse.},
