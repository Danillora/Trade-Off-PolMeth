Abstract = {This article examines recent ageing policies and the way they are
   framed. Here it identifies underlying but sometimes contradictory
   narratives of growth and decline. It concludes that the overall aim of
   such policies is to reconstitute elderly subjectivities, conduct and
   everyday experience in light of neoliberal ambitions for sustained
   economic growth and geopolitical anxieties about regional decline
   nurtured by an unprecedented demographic process of population ageing.
   As a consequence, the language of inclusion is judged to be of ambiguous
   value for elderly people. Although the article is critical of the ways
   older people are perceived as a problem and of the solutions such as
   pension reform, biopolitical-cum-economic behaviour modification and
   pronatalism that are being pursued, in response it also finds some
   potential in current thinking for a more radical reappraisal of the
   elderly lifestyle and of the life cycle as a whole in relation to work
   regimes. It speculates that the generation of post-war baby boomers now
   approaching retirement just might rediscover resources in its
   counter-cultural memory to imagine a more emancipatory elder life
   congruent with a more sustainable environment. Contemporary Political

Abstract = {The right to oblivion, equally called right to be forgotten, is the
   right for natural persons to have information about them deleted after a
   certain period of time. The Internet has brought with it a need for a
   new balance between the free dissemination of information and individual
   self-determination. This balance is precisely what is at stake with the
   right to oblivion. This right has three facets: the right to oblivion of
   the judicial past, the right to oblivion established by data protection
   legislation and a new, and still controversial, digital right to
   oblivion that amounts to personal data having an expiration date or
   being applicable in the specific context of social networks. This paper
   analyses each of these facets within the Internet environment.},

Title = {Thinking politically about HIV: political analysis and action in
   response to AIDS},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY POLITICS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {18},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {127-140},
Abstract = {AIDS has a uniquely political history. Its early association with
   stigmatised homosexual behaviour and more liberating gay identity
   activism set the precedent for highly effective mobilisation. The
   results were unparalleled in global health. AIDS was briefly treated as
   high politics and attracted increased funds to achieve the ambitious
   goal of universal access to HIV prevention and treatment. If AIDS is to
   maintain its visibility and contribution to global solidarity, human
   rights and dignity, its politics must evolve to reflect the profound
   geo-political, economic and social transformations currently underway.
   `Thinking politically about HIV', an initiative of UNAIDS and the
   International AIDS Society, was convened in recognition of the need to
   better understand these politics and consider how the political sciences
   can further engage. This paper, and the edited volume it introduces,
   provides some insights into the Thinking Politically discussions as well
   as the wider scholarship on the challenges facing the AIDS response. The
   authors argue that while mainstream political science has largely
   ignored the epidemic, other disciplines and traditions provide rich
   accounts of the exceptional response. Given the changing context, the
   authors present an agenda of practically oriented, politically informed
   research to identify the levers that can be used to maintain the
   viability of the response.},

Journal = {AFRICAN JOURNAL ON CONFLICT RESOLUTION},
Year = {2012},

Abstract = {The formation of the African Union (AU) was precisely aimed at finding
   African solutions for African problems. The AU's institutions, powers
   and objectives were meant to bring about fundamental shifts away from
   the constraints imposed on actions under the Organisation of African
   Unity (OAU) charter. When the crises in Cote d'Ivoire and Libya began,
   it was hoped that the AU would be the one to find solutions under its
   much cherished notion of `African solutions to African problems'.
   However, the organisation has sometimes taken half-hearted measures, and
   suffered from internal divisions among its members on how to react to
   the crises and their consequences, which rendered the notion of `African
   solutions to African problems' moot.},

Title = {The constitutional reform and economic governance of the European Union},
Journal = {TEORIA Y REALIDAD CONSTITUCIONAL},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {30},
Pages = {59-88},
Abstract = {This article analyzes the reforms adopted by the EU and its Member
   States addressed at introducing and consolidating in their respective
   legal systems the basic principle of financial or budgetary balance,
   commonly known as the ``golden rule ``; that is to say, the requirement
   by which the whole of the public administration, at its different levels
   of government, must keep on a regular basis a situation of balanced
   budget or with surplus. In this line, this article analyzes firstly the
   precedents of this legal requirement in comparative constitutional law
   and then the amendments made by Germany, Spain and Italy on their
   constitutional texts, but also the frustrated constitutional reform
   initiated in France. And secondly, this article analyzes the reforms
   made in the economic governance of the EU by means of both
   politicalstrategic documents -which establish the general framework and
   the basic governing principles -and legal provisions which develop and
   implement them. In this respect, this article analyzes
   political-strategic documents such as the Stability and Growth Pact,
   Europe 2020, the Euro Plus Pact; and the legal provisions of Art. 126 of
   the TFEU and the excessive deficit procedure; the amendment of Art. 136
   of the TFEU and the European Stability Mechanism; the set of six legal
   instruments commonly known as ``The Six Pack ``: and the new reinforcing
   set of two legal instruments -still under discussion - commonly known as
   ``The Two Pack ``. Finally, this article analyzes also the Treaty on
   Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Un
   ion, agreed outside the framework of the EU legal system, and the recent
   proposals adopted by European Council of June 28-29, 2012, concerning a
   new ``Compact for Growth and Jobs{''}and the President of the European
   Council report ``Towards a Genuine Economic and Monetary Union ``},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS IN LATIN AMERICA},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {4},
Number = {3},
Pages = {3-37},
Abstract = {During the first decade of the 2000s, Bolivia occasionally turned
   violent. Yet the causes of these episodes of sustained violence have not
   yet been identified. To this end, this article tests which mechanisms
   theorized by existing scholarship produced two prolonged episodes of
   violence. It concludes that both episodes emerged from the same causal
   pathway: the national government provoked violence by seeking to raze
   the economic foundations of well-organized sectors - sectors that
   represented the mass bases of ascendant political oppositions. This
   finding not only sheds light on political order in Bolivia, but also
   opens up new directions in research on violent confrontation in Latin
   America.},

Abstract = {The essay analyzes the conflict which opened after the French Revolution
   between public opinion and ideology. In this space of reflection the
   second seemed sometimes as the hidden face of the first one. Public
   opinion historically represented the institutionalization of the
   possibility of a disagreement on the legitimacy of the body politic. It
   has thus made possible a speech on the political detached from religion.
   As is clear from the controversy of Napoleon against the ideologues and
   the Marxian critique, ideology does not get to be the science of social
   discourse and its alienation, to become a set of sophistry on social
   conditions. Discussing the arguments of Tocqueville, Bourdieu and Reynie
   about the deficit of reflexivity of public opinion, the author affirms
   its distance from the ideology, because it requires anyway an investment
   for religious believe his propositions.},

Abstract = {The article maps a profound transformation in the nature of the
   state-as-law in Latin America since 1975. In 1975, states had legal
   orders with limited ambition and limited autonomy from the ruler of the
   day. There were vast social, economic and political spaces left open to
   arbitrary decision making. Now these spaces have shrunk, and state order
   had become more formalized. We can now distinguish four models of
   state-as-law, depending on the density and autonomy of the state's legal
   order: the original model (an estado politico) survives in a very few
   states, and three new models have emerged, an estado social de derecho,
   an estado liberal de derecho, and an estado de derecho politizado.},

Abstract = {A conditional survey establishes a preliminary case for believing that
   policy differences are to some extent driven by fundamental beliefs
   about empirical aspects of society and economics. The survey shows
   willingness in about a third of all respondents to shift their expressed
   policy preferences when asked a hypothetical question positing negative
   consequences of their initial preferences. This suggests that
   assumptions about the consequences of public policies may play as
   important a role in policy preferences, or a more important role, than
   do values, personality traits, or motivation. However, roughly a third
   of those with the strongest initial attitudes expressed even stronger
   attitudes-but in the same direction-when confronted with
   counterattitudinal hypotheticals. This may reflect attitude polarization
   of the sort encountered by previous researchers, such as Lord et al.
   (1979) and Taber and Lodge (2006). Or it may indicate a tacit objection
   to the very idea of basing policy preferences on policy consequences.},

Abstract = {Casalini reconstructs Politics out of History by Wendy Brown by taking
   into particular consideration the dialogue between Brown and the works
   of Marx, Nietzsche and Freud. The emphasis placed on the nexus between
   individual and political freedom and on the distinction between
   ``moralism{''} and ``morality{''} leads the way to the exploration of
   the relationship between theory and politics. In the light of the
   contemporary crisis of the American left, the role of the theorist is
   that of introducing elements of discontinuity in the common-sense
   discourse which, on the other hand, tends to be crystallized by
   politics. According to Brown this gap must be taken into consideration
   by Women Studies, since this field of study sometimes risks relying on
   static and institutionalized identities which can be an obstruction to
   its exercise of a ``homeopathic function{''} inside democratic regimes.},

Abstract = {Is it an accident that at certain time periods cut by the history it is
   L.I. Brezhnev and M.S. Gorbachev that became heads of the country? Of
   course, no. The very fact that both personalities significantly impacted
   the life of the state and society shows that they were in demand from
   inside as well as from outside and they were integrated with the nation
   under those conditions. Without knowing, at least at the approximate
   level, what kind of people they were it is impossible to imagine the
   more or less real picture of those times. In the essay by A. Chernyaev
   written on the basis of his personal memories, the author, who worked
   within Brezhnev's group of speechwriters and consultants for more than
   10 years and who, after Gorbachev came to power, became his assistant on
   international affairs, touches upon the whole number of topics that
   allow to better understand these people as individuals and politicians
   and to look into their ``nitty-gritty of politics{''}. In the first part
   of the essay published in this issue the author talks about personal
   qualities of two leaders, discusses their positions regarding national
   issue and problems of ``war and peace{''}, and assesses their foreign
   political activity.},

Abstract = {This article examines the evolving relationship between traditional and
   modern forms of political authority in local government in Timor-Leste.
   The ``clash of paradigms{''} between traditional and liberal democratic
   ideas of legitimacy in Timor-Leste is widely considered to be an
   important issue for the stability of the nation-state as a whole, and
   integral to engaging local communities in nation building, peace
   building, and democratization. Drawing on fieldwork conducted by the
   authors in Baucau, Los Palos, Viqueque, Venilale, and Ainaro in
   2008-2009, we examine the ways elected chefes de suku and chefes de
   aldeia are interacting with traditional authorities at the local
   government level. The findings suggest that the interaction of modern
   and traditional systems has produced several hybrid models of local
   political authority and legitimacy. Specifically, we identify three
   models: two ``co-incumbency{''} models, and an ``authorization{''} model
   emphasizing a separation of powers between traditional and modern
   authorities.},

   Even if Peru did witness some political changes that did leave questions

   fundamentally one of continuity, both in the way in which politics is
   conducted as well as in the factors that affect politics. While this
   report focuses on Peruvian politics during 2011, it reviews some cases
   from 2010 that deserve attention as well. Those aspects that make the
   Peruvian case interesting from a comparative perspective are highlighted

   same-sex couples, the state government of Baden-Wuerttemberg opted for
   an individual approach: Each county decides about the fee level that a
   gay couple has to pay when registering at the district office. As a
   consequence, there is a remarkable variation in the levels of
   registration fees across the individual regional units of the state. In
   this study, we address this variation in registration fees and develop
   an explanatory model that builds on central concepts of public policy
   analysis and political economy. Our analysis reveals that the varying
   levels of registration fees for same-sex unions are determined by the
   regional political culture, economic problem pressure and the partisan
   composition of the regional parliaments. In this sense, an increasing
   representational strength of socially progressive political parties
   entails lower fee levels.},

Title = {How to Attract Voter Attention? The Emergence of the Political Agenda
   and the Issue Management Model},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL MARKETING},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {11},
Number = {4},
Pages = {299-321},
Abstract = {The large theoretical and empirical body of research on different
   rational choice concepts has provided a wide array of material for both
   critics and adherents of this approach. However, the ability rational
   choice theories offer to incorporate assumptions developed in different
   research areas in unitary logical concepts has been seldom highlighted.
   In order to demonstrate this ability, I have developed a model of the
   emergence of the political agenda, called the Issue Management Model,
   which tries to extend the Economic Theory of Democracy to the
   requirements of the modern media democracy and to connect its main
   assumptions with some concepts of shaping the political agenda from
   political psychology and media communication. The article pursues three
   objectives: first, it demonstrates the ability of the rational choice
   theories to link their key assumptions to empirical results of studies
   in different academic disciplines. Second, it discusses the extent to
   which the Economic Theory of Democracy can be aligned with the
   requirements of modern democracy. Last, it attempts to bring together
   several concepts of the emergence of the political agenda. The intention
   of this article is to contribute to a better understanding of the
   formation of political agenda or, strictly speaking, of the construction
   of party strategies aimed at surviving in office.},

Abstract = {This article examines two unexplored questions concerning the impact of
   civic education programs in emerging democracies: (1) whether such
   programs have longer-terms effects and (2) whether civic education can
   be effective under conditions of democratic ``backsliding.{''} We
   investigate these questions in the context of a large-scale civic
   education program in Kenya just before the disputed 2007 election that
   sparked a wave of ethnic clashes and brought the country to the brink of
   civil war. Analysis of a survey of 1,800 ``treatment{''} and 1,800
   ``control{''} individuals shows that the program had significant
   long-term effects on variables related to civic competence and
   engagement, with less consistent effects on democratic values. We also
   find that participants who subsequently were affected by the violence
   were less likely to adopt negative beliefs about Kenya's political
   system, less likely to support the use of ethnic or political violence,
   and more likely to forgive those responsible for the post-election
   violence.},

Title = {AIDS hyper-epidemics and social resilience: theorising the political},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY POLITICS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {18},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {254-268},
Abstract = {AIDS has been the most political pandemic in the world for 30 years, and
   yet political science has viewed it in a mostly descriptive,
   compartmentalised and theoretically neglectful way. There have been many
   theories of AIDS, but very little AIDS theory that is informed by
   politics. This deficit of theory seems to be intellectually
   counter-intuitive, but may be the result of an epistemic community which
   is often erroneously constructed as monolithic; its pursuits are deeply
   informed by funding priorities which favour phenomena with more
   tangible, short-term results; the incremental biomedical `good practice'
   responses in some instances crowd out what is perceived as the luxury of
   deeper, systemic reflection. This article argues that a focus on
   socio-political resilience can be useful to galvanise political
   scientific theorising of AIDS. As a heuristic filter, resilience may be
   useful to advance social science's analytical narrative regarding the
   pandemic beyond the negative, to identify and capitalise on the lessons
   and transformational potential of AIDS and other long-wave shocks.},

Abstract = {The 2011 electoral reform has substantially changed the conditions of
   exercise of the right of suffrage of the Spaniards registered at the
   CERA. It has removed the possibility of the CERA elector to vote in
   local elections and it has deeply reformed the voting procedure, among
   others news, to establish requested vote in all elections. Far from
   facilitating the right of political participation, this reform, as
   demonstrated by the practice, did just the opposite. This article
   analyzes the new voting procedure and contrasts it with objective data
   (participation data, studied requests for votes, votes cast, votes that
   have actually reached the competent electoral boards to be tabulated,
   etc.-in order to isolate those phases of the procedure which should be
   clearly reformed by a new Organic Act and detect those other aspects
   that require a complete legal development. Likewise it has been proposed
   concrete reforms which, in the opinion of the author, affect greater
   efficiency and effectiveness in the exercise of the fundamental right of
   political participation (art. 23 Spanish Constitution) of living abroad
   Spaniards.},

Booktitle = {CONTEMPORARY POLITICS IN AUSTRALIA: THEORIES, PRACTICES AND ISSUES},
Year = {2012},
Pages = {166-176},
Abstract = {An understanding of what happens internally within parties, such as how
   candidates for office are selected and how policy positions are
   determined, is shaped by theories of democracy (Chapter 1), as well as
   understandings of rules and institutions (Chapter 2) and models of
   individual political behaviour (Chapter 3). This chapter links these
   different theoretical positions by arguing that parties are the main and
   crucial link between citizens and government, but that this link is made
   increasingly problematic by the top-down structure of parties. These
   tensions might be understood in terms of broader shifts in the social
   identities of Australians, which produce new demands for representation
   and participation (see Chapters 4 and 5).},

Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},

Volume = {15},

Pages = {109-127},
Abstract = {The twin ideas at the heart of the social contract tradition are that
   persons are naturally free and equal, and that genuine political
   obligations must in some way be based on the consent of those obligated.
   The Lockean tradition has held that consent must be in the form of
   explicit choice; Kantian contractualism has insisted on consent as
   rational endorsement. In this paper I seek to bring the Kantian and
   Lockean contract traditions together. Kantian rational justification and
   actual choice are complementary devices through which our freedom and
   equality can be reconciled with moral and political authority. We should
   not think that there is simply one way by which relations of moral and
   political authority can be reconciled with our status as free and equal.
   I defend three distinct devices through which freedom and authority may
   be reconciled: justification to others, social choice and promise. All
   three are aspects of the `consent tradition' broadly construed.},

   Hypothesis},

Abstract = {When does aid foster development after civil war? A testable model is
   needed to account for the uneven outcomes in postconflict development.
   This article proposes and empirically tests the novel
   nonstrategic-desperation hypothesis, an explanation based on the varied
   incentives that fragile postconflict governments face when confronted
   with donor development goals. Paradoxically, incentives to meet
   development goals only exist when donors have little strategic interest
   in the recipients and when recipients lack income from resource rents
   and are therefore desperate for income. Ten-year data on infant
   mortality changes following civil wars ending 1970-96 and a variety of
   robustness checks support the hypothesis. By focusing on how income
   sources constrain the choices of aid recipients, and how these
   constraints can provide incentives to meet donor development goals, the
   nonstrategic-desperation hypothesis explains how the good use of aid can
   take place following civil war, when institutions are weak.},

Abstract = {What Is a Case the Case Of? Thinking about Borderline Cases Camille
   HAMIDI Though ethnographic methods seem to have gain credit and
   legitimacy these past decades in France, whether or not this method can
   produce theoretical results that are relevant beyond the case studied is
   still quite debated. By retracing the various steps of a fieldwork
   research conducted on voluntary associations of young migrants, this
   article makes two epistemological points. In keeping with Ragin's
   analysis on casing, it demonstrates that producing a theory based on a
   case study is necessarily an iterative process and that one only finds
   out what his case is a case of once the research is over. More
   specifically, it focuses on limit cases, and offers to conceptualize two
   forms of such cases, depending on how they are used to produce theory:
   negative cases are used to test the robustness and the degree of
   expansion of an existing theory; limit cases are used to test an
   existing theory in order to refine it, specify its conditions of
   validity and reconstruct it.},

Abstract = {A federal system consists of dual sets of political institutions that
   complicate institutional arrangements in Australia. So they present
   institutionalists (Chapter 2) with particular challenges and
   opportunities for analysis. They have been criticised for making it
   difficult to determine who is responsible for implementing policy, as
   well as making it harder for voters to punish or reward those in
   government. On the other hand, they can be defended as creating more
   opportunities for representation and including a tier of government that
   is closer to the people. So a consideration of democratic theory
   (Chapter 1) is one prerequisite for reflecting on the desirability and
   defensibility of a federal system. At the same time, the behaviour of
   individuals at each level of government and in intergovernmental
   interactions provides many opportunities for behaviouralist studies
   (Chapter 3).},

Title = {Promoting common prosperity through improving ownership relations in
   China},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL CRITICAL THOUGHT},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {2},
Number = {2},
Pages = {156-170},
Abstract = {The reason why the income gap among the Chinese people is continuously
   increasing is primarily that the proportion of private ownership in
   China's ownership relations is increasing while that of public ownership
   is decreasing. Efforts to find solutions to the problem of a growing
   income gap in the domain of distribution relations have not been
   entirely effective, and have made little practical contribution to
   resolving the problem, while being unsustainable as well. Only the
   improvement of ownership relations can fundamentally reverse the trend
   to an increasing income gap within the Chinese population, and promote
   common prosperity. This paper suggests a scientific approach: in respect
   of the ownership structure, the proportion of public ownership in the
   national economy should be increased, and a pattern established in which
   the public economy holds the dominant position, while the various
   elements of the multi-ownership economy, directed by the state-owned
   economy, coordinate with each other for development. Within the public
   economy, we need to improve the manner in which ownership of the means
   of production by workers is realized, and actively apply the principle
   of distribution according to work in the enterprises. In the private
   economy and foreign-funded enterprises, we should supervise the
   capital-labor relationship, restrict exploitation of workers by capital,
   and in accordance with legislation, protect the economic rights of
   workers.},

Journal = {CIVIL WARS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {2-28},
Abstract = {Classical counterinsurgency theory - written before the 19th century -
   has generally strongly opposed atrocities, as have theoreticians writing
   on how to conduct insurgencies. For a variety of reasons - ranging from
   pragmatic to religious or humanitarian - theoreticians of both groups
   have urged the lenient treatment of civilians associated with the enemy
   camp, although there is a marked pattern of exceptions, for example,
   where heretics or populations of cities refusing to surrender to
   besieging armies are concerned. And yet atrocities - defined here as
   acts of violence against the unarmed (non-combatants, or wounded or
   imprisoned enemy soldiers), or needlessly painful and/or humiliating
   treatment of enemy combatants, beyond any action needed to incapacitate
   or disarm them - occur frequently in small wars. Examples abound where
   these exhortations have been ignored, both by forces engaged in an
   insurgency and by forces trying to put down a rebellion. Why have so
   many atrocities been committed in war if so many arguments have been put
   forward against them? This is the basic puzzle for which the individual
   contributions to this special issue are seeking to find tentative
   answers, drawing on case studies.},

Title = {Uncertainty and the epistemic dimension of democratic deliberation in
   climate change adaptation},
Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {19},
Number = {5, SI},
Pages = {889-911},
Abstract = {Climate change adaptation is inherently local, contextual, and
   political, a problem distinct from the global collective action problem
   that is climate stabilization. Climate change vulnerability is a
   function not only of hydro-meteorological changes, specific geographic
   contexts, ecosystem integrity, and economic poverty, but also of the
   social and political institutions of a given local or regional context.
   The uncertainty, complexity, and inherent politics of climate change
   adaptation in particular places mean that adaptive institutions, if they
   are to be more than just disaster prediction and response mechanisms,
   must be flexible, dynamic and capable themselves of adapting quickly to
   changing environmental, economic, and social conditions. Certain
   approaches to adaptation have moved away from rigid orthodox development
   models. Nonetheless, they are often so general as to be impractical, or
   in effect comprise repackaged concepts and methods borrowed from climate
   change mitigation efforts and international development institutions.
   This study discusses the epistemic dimension of democracy at the level
   of international environmental institutions and at the level of local,
   contextually unique adaptation projects. Development and adaptation
   practices that involve democratic participation do so largely in
   accordance with norms of fairness and justice, which are unquestionably
   important. Attaching democracy exclusively to transcendent norms of
   justice, however, belies concrete possibilities for democratic
   approaches to climate adaptation. These possibilities reside in the
   epistemic dimension of democracy, a pragmatic notion developed. The
   account suggests that an epistemic democratic conceptual framework can
   inform adaptation institutions that are better able to cope with
   complexity and uncertainty, even ultimately directing these lessons
   towards the international sphere's institutional focus on mitigation.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY},

Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Pages = {25-58},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This article explores the relationship between terror, power and the
   rule of law. First, tracing Burke's use of the term terror back to
   ancient Greek usage, I argue that being terrified is incommensurable
   with the experience of acting together with others. In this way, terror
   and power are distinct. However, most acts of terror aim to terrify some
   people while inoculating others from terror. Witnesses to the terror of
   others may feel empowered by the destruction of the power of others.
   Second, the rule of law and terror seem incommensurable because causing
   terror often involves violating the law. However, modern political
   thought is founded on the idea that the law itself ought to be
   terrifying. That the terror of non-state actors appears random and the
   terror of the law has hardly been noticed in recent commentary on
   terrorism indicate that the rule of law produces an interesting audience
   effect. In order to sustain power and legitimacy while practising
   terror, governments use the rule of law to divide audiences up into
   terrified criminals and innocent witnesses. The practice of terror as an
   `open secret' also produces similar audience effects. Finally, despite
   these connections between power, terror and the rule of law, I argue
   that terror is always technically out of power, even when practised by
   states. Terror is the true weapon of the weak because it always admits a
   failure to foster human connections with certain people and groups.
   Nonviolence is a weapon of the weak in the sense that it instantiates
   new, unencumbered power.},

Volume = {14},

Pages = {23-37},
Abstract = {Over 10 years have passed since the current phase of devolution in the
   United Kingdom started and the article investigates its effects on
   Scottish political discourse on national identity focusing on the
   unionist version. Based on an analysis of recent political utterances in
   Scotland, the article argues that the current devolution settlement has
   revived and entrenched unionist nationalism in the Scottish political
   discourse. It also shows that one of the effects of devolution on the
   debate on national identity is a clearer sign of increasing contestation
   of Britishness, and suggests that devolution is a double-edge sword in
   management of multiple national identities.},

Abstract = {To achieve the model proposed for law, there is a need to advocate a
   specific play of democracy and human rights, but what is it? According
   to what has been said, a procedural democracy would be no good to us,
   as, in the constitutional rule of law, the human rights operate a
   primary transformation insofar as they refer to the operation of the
   democratic mechanisms with regard to their scope and limits; this means
   that democracy is not always a possible result in morally acceptable
   conditions, nor is it always an appropriate or desirable result. In
   contrast, what we know as material implies the consideration of a series
   of values as belonging to democracy; these values are, because of their
   link with liberalism, freedom and formal equality and, because of their
   link with ethical socialism, material equality and solidarity.},

Abstract = {When something goes awry in a governmental agency, a frequent claim is
   that appointed political heads are incompetent. If true, what explains
   this in a separation of powers system where the executive nominates and
   the legislature approves? Our analysis provides a rationale and
   conditions for rational incompetence. Specifically, we present a model
   in which a President nominates and the Senate confirms or rejects an
   appointee. Besides choosing a nominee's ideology, the President can
   determine competence, with less competence meaning more policy outcome
   variance. Interestingly, without assuming that political actors are
   inherently risk takers, we identify conditions generating what Goemans
   and Fey (2009) have labeled institutionally-induced risk taking, where
   both the President and the relevant filibuster pivot propose and approve
   an incompetent administrator in equilibrium. Reasons for incompetence go
   beyond pure loyalty or patronage, and our model corresponds to
   contemporary cases of seemingly incompetent administration.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses whether the Chinese state's recent efforts since
   2003 to build a `harmonious society' (HS; hexie shehui) represents an
   ideological shift towards global human development (HD) norms promoted
   by the United Nations. At first glance, the one-party authoritarian
   state of China seems worlds apart from the more inclusive HD approach.
   However, China's increasing emphasis on rebuilding health insurance,
   expanding compulsory education and reducing inter-regional inequalities
   somewhat resembles HD. To clarify these ambiguities, the study analyses
   recent PRC social development reports and scholarly debates to
   understand the HS ideology. The paper concludes with a critical
   assessment of HS discourse and a clarification of six key dimensions on
   which the HS appears to differ from the HD approach to development.},

   Perspective},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL MARKETING},

Volume = {11},

Pages = {29-53},
Abstract = {Political advertising continues to be a foundation of political
   marketing, both in the United States and around the world. The
   perspective presented here provides a look back at what researchers have
   accomplished in political advertising research over the past five
   decades, followed by an assessment of the most important priorities for
   future research. We know most about televised political ads, which focus
   more on issues than personality and usually from a positive perspective,
   but we know much less about other channels, especially new Web-hosted
   media. We can expect the legal and regulatory arena to prompt further
   changes in political advertising. At the same time, differences based on
   gender and race/ethnicity are likely to become more important, and the
   political and cultural context for international political advertising
   will demand more comparative study.},

Abstract = {Steffen Kailitz, Does the Type of Autocracy Make a Difference for
   Economic Growth?, pp. 500-527. There are substantial differences in the
   economic growth of different autocracy types. Personalistist autocracy
   performed worst of all types of autocracy. (Non-communist) party
   autocracies did astonishingly bad in view of the theoretically
   well-founded view that an institutionalisation of autocracies via
   parliaments should affect as such the economic growth positively.
   Between non-communist and communist party autocracies there was a
   considerable gap in economic growth. Military autocracy and communist
   party autocracy performed best among all types of autocracy. No type of
   autocracy clearly outperformed democracy between 1950 and 2000.},

Abstract = {The prescriptive theory of rational choice is accepted for decades as a
   general theory to explain human behavior and was taken from economics in
   response of the lack social sciences had. This paper reviews some
   limitations of rational choice observed in economics. Through cognitive
   psychology describes biases in the cognitions of people when assessing
   data and making a choice, which put into question that human mind is
   programmed to follow the assumptions of rational choice (Kahneman \&
   Tversky, 1979; 1984). In the other hand, raising risks in our
   civilization (monetary, ecological, geopolitical,) and its global
   character define our society, nowadays, as a society of global risk
   (Beck, 2008). The author discusses the limits of our rationality in
   regard of making choices as a growing and current issue to the necessity
   of coping with increasing global risks.},

Abstract = {This article highlights the relationship between the Ecuadorian
   indigenous movement and the progressive government of Rafael Correa and
   his PAlS Movement. The objective is to examine why the indigenous
   movement has decided to oppose the Correa government, despite initial
   common political concerns. To explain this paradox, both the recent
   political history of the indigenous movement as well as the attitudes
   and politics applied by the Correa administration are analyzed. Five
   fields of political discrepancy and differentiation are offered as
   probable explanations for the conflictive relationship between the
   indigenous organizations and the Correa government. These interconnected
   themes that seek to explain the distancing are: an intercultural
   dilemma, opposition to extractivism, different attitudes toward social
   mobilization, agrarian policies and finally, the state policy called
   de-sectorization.},

Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {35},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1182-1202},
Abstract = {Over the last few years, EU institutions have taken on the task of
   promoting an `active European remembrance' of Europe's twentieth century
   totalitarian experiences. At stake in this process is the possibility of
   constructing an EU-wide historical narrative. However, EU-level debates
   on the remembrance of European history are permeated by struggles
   between policy actors who vie for control over the telling of Europe's
   past. Using insights from the agenda-setting and framing literatures,
   the article examines the conditions under which memory narratives are
   able to become prominent or, conversely, lose ground in the EU's overall
   discourse. It concludes that, although the constellation of actors in
   place was a key factor in explaining fluctuations in the EU's
   remembrance discourse, the weight of their arguments also depended on
   how well their discourse resonated with existing memory cultures at the
   domestic and the EU levels.},

Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {49},
Number = {3},
Pages = {533-547},
Abstract = {There is nothing natural about mobility regimes. They are the result of
   complex ensembles of power that involve the control of conducts in the
   form of moral economies. To analize mobility as a political, social,
   cultural and economic phenomenon circumscribed to the promotion and
   protection of forms and styles of life, opens up the possibility to
   investigate, following the work of Foucault, what can be called a
   biopolitics of mobility. Mobility, from this perspective, must be
   approached, not from the abstract, but from concrete practices,
   discourses and technologies through which people, goods, and services
   are put in circulation. Such circulation, together with its allied
   connectivity and complexity, constitute what has been termed the
   quasi-transcendentals for contemporary liberal life. Building on this
   theory, the article offers a reading of maritime mobility from the study
   of insurance discourses and practices. In particular, the role of
   Lloyd's of London is analyzed as constituting moral economies of
   maritime mobility.},

Pages = {81-106},
Abstract = {This article examines the life and political thought of German explorer,
   scientist and revolutionary, Georg Forster (1754-1794), one of the few
   members of the German Enlightenment to unambiguously support the cause
   of the French Revolution. Comparing Forster's republicanism to Immanuel
   Kant's (1724-1804), one finds that the political differences between the
   two authors are based on differing conceptions of the power that reason
   exerts over human will, and of its function in politics. Kant's
   republican and reformist autocracy is opposed to Forster's democratic
   republicanism, and to his unconditional defense of revolution, even in
   the case of a totalitarian revolutionary State.},

Abstract = {The article argues that the emergence of capitalist world system has
   caused collapse of the Christian morality that used to form the basis of
   value reproduction of political society. It is morality of homo
   economicus that has become dominant, but in its pure form it is unable
   to serve as support for the existence of society. The function of
   compensation of moral deficit for capitalism was transferred to the
   Modernity political project based on an unperfected alloy (not to say
   medley) of Christianity and capitalism in the form of liberal consensus
   of modern ideologies and utopias.},

Abstract = {While different versions of democratic theory often deal with political
   institutions like parliaments and elections in broad terms (see Chapter
   1), none can avoid giving at least some attention to such institutions.
   As groups of people begin to make decisions about some aspect of their
   lives, they inevitably will begin to develop more or less formal rules
   about how those decisions are made, how they can be changed, and so on.
   Democratic intentions can be thwarted by these rules and values. The
   institutionalists discussed in this chapter pay systematic attention to
   the ways in which different institutional rules, procedures and cultures
   affect the processes and outcomes of political and policy decisions. As
   with democratic theories, there is a range of institutional approaches
   to politics and policy-making - the `old institutionalism', as well as
   the normative, rational choice, historical, empirical, network,
   sociological, constructivist and feminist variations of `new
   institutionalism'. This chapter assesses the strengths and limitations
   of these various varieties of institutionalism.},

Abstract = {In order to address more comprehensively new situations that infringe
   human rights, the Bill of Emergent Rights was proclaimed, showing that
   the law will never be a static object, and must increasingly cover more
   population sectors; inescapably embrace the contexts that impose the use
   of technologies, exploitation and resource scarcity, as well as the
   instability that generates a context in constant threat of economic and
   environmental debacle, and the emergence of other subjects on the
   international stage that exceed the forecasts of exclusive
   ``Statism{''}.
   This paper aims to contribute to the work of divulging this document and
   to refute the argument according to which the non-compliance of it is
   due to its recent discovery or appealing to the artificial barriers
   erected to leave it pregnable. The paper seeks to show this text as an
   alternative to address rights in a more comprehensive and
   multidimensional way.},

Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {15},
Number = {5},
Pages = {667-685},
Abstract = {A range of developing countries and international advocacy organizations
   have argued that wealthy countries, as a result of their greater
   historical contribution to human-induced climate change, owe a `climate
   debt' to poor countries. Critics of this argument have claimed that it
   is incoherent or morally objectionable. In this essay we clarify the
   concept of climate debt and assess its value for conceptualizing
   responsibilities associated with global climate change and for guiding
   international climate negotiations. We conclude that the idea of a
   climate debt can be coherently formulated, and that while some
   understandings of the idea of climate debt could lead to morally
   objectionable conclusions, other accounts would not. However, we argue
   that climate debt nevertheless provides an unhelpful frame for advancing
   global justice through international climate negotiations - the only
   existing means of resolving political conflict over the collective
   action problems posed by human-induced climate change - due to its
   retrospective and potentially adversarial emphasis, and to problems of
   measurement.},

Abstract = {Three ideas can frame discussions of memory. First, the idea of
   collective memory, which points to the various ways in which events in
   the past are selected, lodged in the present and made available for
   reworking in the future. Collective memory is not unitary, rather it
   presents itself in diverse strands, each the product of a discrete
   social location, family or community or organization or state or
   whatever. Second, the idea of the national past, which points to the
   arena of common political identity and tells a community where it came
   from, who it is and where ideally it might hope to be in the future. It
   is another subtle construct, a contested compromise between the demands
   of the elites and the various recollections of the masses. And the third
   idea, the most fundamental, and now familiar, is that the past is no
   simple record of events, rather it is a social construction, the outturn
   of subtle social processes whereby materials are taken from the flow of
   events and refashioned as statements about history. One strand of work
   is carried in memoirs. Such work offers a quite particular view of the
   past; informal, idiosyncratic and personal; it offers later generations
   a distinctive route into that past, a species of direct access, a prompt
   perhaps for other more systematic work. And at the present time, as the
   circumstances in which Europeans find themselves change (thus, most
   generally, macro-changes in global political economic relations with the
   relative decline of the USA and the concomitant rise of East Asia),
   there are pressures to revisit and re-imagine received understandings,
   and in this task memoirs allow present generations to access the often
   engaging non-official past, providing thereby a useful resource in
   thinking about possible futures.},

Journal = {CANADIAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},

Volume = {6},

Pages = {75-85},
Abstract = {The original hypothesis is that forests will be a policy subsector in
   which the challenges of climate change adaptation lead to broader policy
   mandates but that the declining role of the industry in the Canadian
   economy will cause departmental resources to be stable or decreasing.
   The result will be ineffective policy capacity, leading to adaptation
   policies that are poorly designed, incomplete or missing altogether.
   This paper provides some evidence to support this hypothesis, though the
   situation is complicated by the dominant role played by the provinces in
   both ownership and jurisdiction. While the leading federal department,
   Natural Resources Canada, has shed other mandates to focus on climate
   change, provincial agencies are already caught between the added costs
   of addressing climate change impacts, notably wildfire, and the need to
   plan for and implement long term adaptive policies with stable or
   declining resources. Much will depend on coordination between First
   Nations, the provinces and the federal government in a policy subsector
   with a history of conflict between the different orders of government.},

Abstract = {In the early 1970s, Portugal still held on to the oldest European
   colonial empire, resisting the winds of decolonization in Africa. In
   this period, the Portuguese were fighting counterinsurgency campaigns in
   three of its overseas territories: Angola, since 1961; Guinea, since
   1963; and Mozambique, since 1964. This article focuses on the
   counterinsurgency campaign in Mozambique because it was there, in 1972,
   that the most serious known atrocity took place, at least in terms of
   its international impact, from these unconventional wars. The
   appointment of a new commander-in-chief, Kaulza de Arriaga (1970-73), to
   Mozambique intensified the war. Larger airborne search and destroy
   operations were carried out in an attempt to win the campaign quickly
   and decisively. It was in this context that the killing of civilians
   took place somewhere around the town of Tete in December 1972, which was
   eventually followed by an international outcry in response to its public
   denunciation by Catholic missionaries. The exact location, even the
   existence of Wiriyamu, as well as the extent of the atrocities, remain
   contentious. This article will use multiple sources to clarify as far as
   possible: what happened, why it happened, and its implications for the
   dynamics of counterinsurgency and intra-state wars generically.
   Furthermore, it will address specifically what it meant for the
   Portuguese way in counterinsurgency, until the rapid end of multiple
   campaigns as a result of a military coup in April 1974, in which
   Mozambique and the stain of Wiriyamu loomed large.},

   the 2005 and 2009 German Federal Elections},
Journal = {GERMAN POLITICS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {21},
Number = {3},
Pages = {299-316},
Abstract = {Against the background of a substantial rise of the number of
   late-deciding voters at recent elections the paper simultaneously tests
   four complementary hypotheses on the background of contemporary
   electors' timing of decision making. The traditional floating voter
   hypothesis fares best in this analysis: lacking partisan predispositions
   and a general detachment from politics appear as the main reasons why
   people take longer to make up their minds. Indifference and attitudinal
   ambivalence as well as mixed party-political signals from voters' social
   networks also lead to electors postponing their voting decisions. The
   hypothesis that late deciding is a consequence of increased availability
   and attention to mediated political information is refuted. Several
   long-term trends are discussed as reasons for the increase of late
   deciding.},

Abstract = {The contribution analyzes the cross-border diffusion of the radical
   protest method of open field destruction, i. e., the destruction of
   fields cultivated with Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) coram
   publico. The open field destruction represents the most radical and
   confrontative method in anti-GMO movement's repertoire of action. Open
   field destructions were a key method of the French anti-GMO movement,
   which, in turn, was of crucial importance for the reform of French
   biotechnology policy. It will be analysed, how this method has been
   adopted by anti-GMO activists in Spain and Germany, in order to shed
   light on the limited importance of national boundaries for protest
   movements.},

Title = {Defining `religious' in Indonesia: toward neither an Islamic nor a
   secular state},
Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {16},
Number = {8, SI},
Pages = {1045-1058},
Abstract = {Every state manages religion in one way or another, and religious
   violence often justifies state intervention to control how a religion
   should be presented, preached and, most importantly, limited. This paper
   examines the state management of religion in Indonesia with focus on
   state regulations promulgated during the New Order period. The
   Indonesian state has managed religion by making religious practices less
   focused on spirituality but more a matter of state administration. Four
   regulations in particular exemplify the state's attitude toward
   religion, namely the Presidential Decree in 1965 on the state-recognised
   religions, the Joint Ministerial Decree on Houses of Worship in 1969 and
   2006, the National Marriage Law in 1974 and the Ministerial Decrees on
   mission activities in 1978.In brief, this state management of religion
   has been enabling Indonesia, which has the world's largest Muslim
   population, to be governed as neither an Islamic state like Saudi Arabia
   nor an outright secular state like Turkey among the Muslim countries.},

   Movies are not born free and equal in rights. However, if it were
   necessary to oppose works of reflection to works of entertainment, it
   would be the defeat of a certain conception of cinema, but also of the
   will to be together through fiction.},

Pages = {249-259},
Abstract = {Difficulties associated with delivering public policy have long been a
   focus of investigation for institutionalists (Chapter 2). The extent to
   which promises made during elections campaigns can be delivered by the
   political party or parties that win office is of fundamental concern to
   those interested in the operation of democracy in Australia (Chapter 1).
   The fact that public servants can place their own ideas about how things
   ought to be done ahead of those of their ministers is important for
   behaviouralists (Chapter 3) and, in that it suggests that they are part

   theorists and post-structuralists (Chapter 5) would seek to identify the

Title = {Is Class Appreciation Just a Click Away?: Using Student Response System
   Technology to Enhance Shy Students' Introductory American Government
   Experience},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE EDUCATION},

Volume = {8},

Abstract = {Do individual-level student characteristics affect appreciation for, and
   benefit from, the use of student response system technology? We
   investigate the usefulness of inclass electronic student response
   systems ({''}classroom clickers'') to understand if it benefits some
   college students more than others. Specifically, we investigate whether
   shyer students benefit more from the use of the student response system,
   with the expectation that shyer students will appreciate using the
   system more and consequently make more positive gains in attitudes about
   the class, knowledge of politics, and political engagement. Utilizing
   original survey data collected from Fall 2009 and Fall 2010 introductory
   American Government courses, we find that shyer students show greater
   attitude improvement over the course of the semester, exhibit more
   knowledge about politics and engage in more outside-of-class political
   discussions than less shy students when electronic student response
   systems are utilized, but no such difference emerges when more
   traditional in-class feedback methods are used. Overall, the findings
   presented here suggest that, at least marginally, the use of in-class
   electronic response systems can improve the educational experience of
   students who are typically isolated by traditional classroom teaching
   methods.},

Abstract = {`Indian' postcolonial writings continue to have a significant impact on
   contemporary scholarly approaches to nationalism in the subcontinent,
   and have helped displace the hold of earlier left/liberal approaches to
   nationalism. While the impact of these recent postcolonial trends on
   Indian historiography more broadly has been the subject of considerable
   scholarly discussions and debates, less attention has been devoted to
   their specific impact on scholarly approaches to nationalism. Through a
   close and critical reading of the changing historical approaches to
   `minority' Tamil nationalism in the subcontinent as well as through
   comparison of such postcolonial perspectives with that of `anticolonial'
   national liberation theorists such as Frantz Fanon, this essay seeks to
   offer a historical perspective on the strengths and limitations of the
   currently ascendant `Indian' postcolonial perspectives on nationalism.},

Abstract = {Explanations of the performance of Western European anti-immigrant
   parties feature prominently in the literature on electoral behaviour and
   the mass media have been introduced as an important explanatory variable
   in these analyses. In this article we advance our understanding of the
   relationship between mass media news reporting and anti-immigrant party
   support in three ways. First, we go beyond extant research to consider
   the visibility of anti-immigrant parties and party leaders in the news,
   rather than anti-immigration issues more generally. Second, in addition
   to analysing media effects on a party's popularity we also consider the
   reverse relationship, the effects of a party's popularity on media
   coverage of the party. Finally, we analyse the relationships from a
   cross-party perspective, using timeseries analysis for six parties in
   three countries (Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany) over the past two
   decades. Our results show strongest support for the effects of party and
   particularly leader visibility in the news on anti-immigrant party
   success, rather than the reverse relationship.},

Abstract = {Over the last 25 years, Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) has found
   much attention within social science methodology. It is based on set
   relations and aims at the discovery of sufficient and necessary
   conditions and their INUS and SUIN derivates. As such, it is possible
   with QCA to model causal complexity. This article first presents QCA as
   a technique. It then proposes three aspect of causal complexity which
   can be managed with a QCA design: equifinality, conjunctural causation
   and asymmetry. It moves on to discuss what is new about QCA and defines
   as the most prominent novelty QCA's ability to deal with systematic
   comparison; to overcome the need of dichotomization through the use of
   fuzzy sets; and the configurational view on cases. Finally, a list of
   why QCA can be really called a ``qualitative{''} method (despite its
   formalization) and an outlook on the most important challenges for the
   future are introduced.},

Pages = {172-190},
Abstract = {In this article we argue that the tea party movement is the most
   conspicuous contemporary vehicle for reconciliation between Christian
   and economic conservatives. The analysis draws upon participant
   observation of two recent Christian right events at which the tea party
   was a central preoccupation. Offering evidence of the dynamics of a
   shifting framing process, it is argued that the Christian right elites
   are willing to accommodate strategically the precedence of economic
   issues but only if these are accompanied by a commitment to familiar
   Christian right positions on social issues.},

Abstract = {Scholars have long pointed to James Madison's argument for
   constitutional veneration in Federalist No. 49 to illustrate what they
   see as Madison's fear of democratic politics and frequent constitutional
   reform. This article challenges that consensus, first, by showing that
   Madison said the opposite several years earlier and, second, by
   revisiting the historical and textual context of Federalist No. 49. It
   argues that even as Madison praises veneration he offers serious reasons
   to be wary of it.},

   Prestes, who bravely survived to Vargas's government and the dissolution

   his biography on Luiz Carlos Prestes, the brazilian writer Jorge Amado
   makes use of material extracted from the cronological interval between
   the years of 1935 and 1942: in chapters 4 and 5, we'll find specific
   topics, such as political torture, that deserve a study on their own,
   since these topics may ensure a further understanding on the subject.
   The outrageous actions perpetrated by political police were supposed to
   be abolished in 1945, when his government came to an end. However,
   dictatorship and its nasty effects on the political scenario can be
   traced further.},

Abstract = {This article evaluates our structural model forecasting the ExtremeRight

   2012. We discuss the implications of the stability of the national-level
   specification of the model, as well as the limitations imposed by the
   availability and definition of some of the macro indicators used as
   predictors. Although empirically accurate in 2012, there are a number of
   unknowns in the model's likely fortunes for future elections, in
   particular, whether the `Marine effect' observable in 2012 will
   translate into core party support, and the extent to which a party
   `normalisation' strategy will affect its 2017 performance.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POLITICS CULTURE AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {25},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {157-174},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Despite its specific origin in the seating arrangement of the French
   National Assembly after the revolution of 1789, the right- left divide
   of the ideological spectrum has proved remarkably resilient in anchoring
   public intellectual life for over two centuries. In this article, I
   argue that we are witnessing a 90 rotation of this ideological axis,
   resulting in a new set of poles, each of which combines elements of the
   old right- left divide. The ` precautionary' pole brings together the
   conservationist side of the right and the communitarian side of the
   left, whereas the ` proactionary' pole unites the libertarian side of
   the right and the technocratic side of the left. I prepare the ground
   for discussing these new alternatives with a consideration of the
   political theology of the old right- left divide, which ultimately turns
   on alternative visions of how the past determines the future. This `
   left' basically holds that what is possible significantly exceeds what
   is probable, with liberals adopting an ` antirealist' and socialists a `
   realist' stance towards the prospect of an optimal social order. Both
   the precautionary and proactionary poles of the new ideological spectrum
   are fixated on our attitude towards a future in which the ontological
   constitution of the polity ( i. e. its ` humanity') is among the issue
   under contestation. In this emerging ideological conflict, more of which
   is transpiring in video than in print, the precautionaries are marked as
   more ` risk- averse' and the proactionaries more ` risk- seeking' than
   had been presumed to be the normal attitude in the modern welfare state.},

Abstract = {This article introduces a novel approach for generating agenda-related
   estimates of the policy positions of political parties from party
   manifestos and expert surveys. We show that current party estimates
   provide for little variation across policy areas and over time. In
   response, we propose to relate the issue-specific ideological preference
   profiles of political parties to the legislative context. For the
   dimensional representation of policy positions of political parties our
   procedure weights the issue-specific preference profiles by their
   prominence on the agenda of each policy area. We apply this procedure to
   EU legislation and locate national political parties on a
   national/supranational and left/right dimension, which can be used for
   the analysis of Council decision-making.},

Title = {Correct Voting in Direct Legislation},
Journal = {SWISS POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {18},
Number = {4},
Pages = {399-427},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Correct voting in elections has been extensively analysed in the recent
   past. However, thus far, correct voting in direct legislation has hardly
   been investigated. This is all the more surprising since direct
   legislation is a more demanding form of democracy and, thus, to vote
   one's true preferences in direct legislation represents a greater
   challenge than picking the ``right{''} party or the ``right{''}
   candidate at elections. Moreover, the few researches on the correctness
   of individual referendum votes used a measurement method that we think
   has some methodological shortfalls. Instead, we want to propose another
   better-suited method of measuring correct voting in direct legislation
   settings. This method makes use of voters' stances on the issue at
   stake. Besides, we will scrutinize the share of correct voting as well
   as its determinants on the Swiss popular vote of November 2009, which
   included three rather different propositions. The study shows that a
   majority of Swiss voters are indeed able to vote their true preferences.
   The ability to vote correctly depends primarily on the individual
   voter's project-specific knowledge, but also, under certain
   circumstances, on the use of heuristics.},

Abstract = {This paper compares what the two Cypriot leaders have been trying to
   accomplish through the peace negotiations with what public opinion on
   both sides of the island view as acceptable and tolerable. This analysis
   lays the groundwork in assessing just how far we are from a
   comprehensive solution to the Cyprus conflict. The author first
   evaluates the progress accomplished by the two leaders in the peace
   negotiations since 2008 when the current round of negotiations started.
   Second, he looks at how far they are today in finalizing a comprehensive
   peace plan. Third, he assesses where the public opinion on both sides of
   the UN divide stand vis-a-vis a comprehensive solution to the Cyprus
   problem. Here, the author identifies the main obstacles confronting a
   comprehensive solution to the Cyprus conflict. Finally, based on the
   overall analysis, the author speculates on future scenarios and proposes
   recommendations for the UN to help bring the conflict to a comprehensive
   settlement.},

Year = {2012},

Abstract = {The three-fold justification for collaboration between police and the
   armed forces in the Northern Triangle (El Salvador, Guatemala and
   Honduras) has generally included the persistent violence, the high level
   of insecurity, and the inabilities of police to address these problems.
   This article compares and considers the institutional challenges of
   police-military collaboration for the security sector in each country.
   The analysis focuses first on the legal framework that conditions such a
   collaborative strategy, and second on the materiality of budgets and the
   institutional capacities of personnel. The results of this strategy are
   analyzed based on available data. The argument ends with a reflection on
   existing challenges, demonstrating that inter-institutional
   accommodation has not been fully developed in areas that require greater
   accountability and transparency.},

   Section of the Intellectual Property Commission to be able to order the

   that violate intellectual property rights. In particular, this work
   examines what should constitute a violation of intellectual property
   rights for the purposes of the administrative proceedings for
   interrupting information society services or removing content violating
   these rights. A broad interpretation is proposed that includes both
   direct breaches committed against exclusive rights by information
   society service providers and indirect violations of intellectual

Abstract = {In this article, we identify a distinctive type of party member; namely,
   those who identify themselves as ideologically at odds with their party.
   Using survey evidence from nine parties in Belgium and Canada, we
   measure the prevalence of these `ideological misfits' and explore the
   characteristics that define them. While there appears to be no
   systematic cross-party pattern, it is striking that mass parties of the
   left have disproportionately large numbers of such members. To the
   extent that those parties pride themselves on intra-party democracy,
   this raises questions about their capacity to respond to Downsian drives
   towards the centre and suggests that May's law may be one of left-wing
   disparity.},

Abstract = {Besides systemic changes that lead to the re-prioritization of foreign
   policy objectives, foreign policy change is also a result of domestic
   policy entrepreneurs pursuit of a political return. Their potential to
   orchestrate change depends on the existing entry barriers that emanate
   from the political and institutional features of the domestic
   policy-making process. It is accentuated by system-wide developments and
   security crises that illustrate old policy failure. This article
   discusses the role of policy entrepreneurs in foreign policy change by
   reference to the GreekTurkish rapprochement in the late 1990s that
   resulted in Turkey receiving the status of EU candidate country in 1999.},

Abstract = {We suggest a new approach to narrowing the field in elections, based on
   the `deservingness' of candidates to be contenders in a runoff, or to be
   declared one of several winners. Instead of specifying some minimum
   percentage (e. g., 50) that the leading candidate must surpass to avoid
   a runoff (usually between the top two candidates), we propose that the
   number of contenders depends on the distribution of votes among all
   candidates. Divisor methods of apportionment proposed by Jefferson and
   Webster, among others, provide measures of deservingness, but they can
   prescribe a runoff even when one candidate receives more than 50 percent
   of the vote. We propose a new measure of derservingness, called the
   Next-Two rule, which compares the performance of candidates to the two
   that immediately follow them. It identifies as contenders candidates who
   are bunched together near the top. We apply the Next-Two rule to several
   empirical examples.},

Abstract = {This article aims to organize thinking around human rights-based
   approaches to development (HRBAs) and to review available empirical
   evidence regarding their benefits, risks, and limitations. We propose a
   typology distinguishing four types of rights-based approaches: global
   compliance based on international and regional treaties; human
   rights-based programming on the part of donors and governments; rights
   talk; and legal mobilization. The article briefly reviews the politics
   of the first three modalities before examining legal mobilization for
   social and economic rights in greater detail. Litigation for social and
   economic rights is increasing in frequency and scope in several
   countries, and exhibits appealing attributes such as inclusiveness and
   deliberative quality Still, there are potential problems with this form
   of human rights-based mobilization, including middle class capture, the
   potential counter-majoritarianism of courts, and difficulties in
   compliance. The conclusions to each section lay out the key research
   questions regarding HRBAs. Polity (2012) 44, 485-503.

Volume = {24},

Abstract = {While a number of scholars have focused on the importance of partisan
   agenda control in the US House, few have examined its uneven
   consequences within the majority party. In this paper, we explore
   `counterfactual' utility distributions within the majority party, by
   comparing policy outcomes under a party-less median voter model to
   policy outcomes under party-based positive and negative agenda control
   models. We show that the distribution of policy losses and benefits
   resulting from agenda control are quite similar for both the positive
   and negative varieties. In both cases, moderate majority-party members
   are made worse off by the exercise of partisan agenda control, while
   those to the extreme side of the majority-party median benefit
   disproportionately. We also consider the benefit of agenda control for
   the party as a whole, by looking at the way changes in majority-party
   homogeneity affect the summed utility across members. Interestingly, we
   find that when the distance between the floor and majority-party medians
   decreases, the overall value of positive and negative agenda control
   diminishes. However, we also find support for the `conditional party
   government' notion that, as majority-party members' preferences become
   more similar, they have an increased incentive to grant agenda-setting
   power to their leaders.},

Abstract = {Inter-Korean relations can be thought of as one long bargaining session
   over the terms of reunification, in which the South's strategies depend
   on its perceived bargaining position and on its estimate of the
   stability of the Northern regime. After developing the analytical
   framework drawn from the bargaining logic, we analyze the shift in South
   Korean unification policies from confrontation to peaceful coexistence
   and the emergence of two competing visions for unification-confederation
   and absorption. We identify the logical and practical limitations of
   both confederal and absorptionist strategies and the intrinsic dilemmas
   that South Korea inevitably faces in pursuing political integration with
   the North. We conclude that the current South Korean government's
   unification policy is a move in the direction of an absorptionist
   strategy, reflecting the considerable barriers to reaching a
   confederation agreement with Pyongyang.},

Title = {A Human Rights-Based Approach (HRBA) in Practice: Evaluating NGO
   Development Efforts},

Pages = {523-541},

Abstract = {Human rights-based approaches (HRBAs) promise greater alignment of
   development efforts with universal norms, as well as a focus on the root
   causes of poverty While HRBAs have been widely adopted across the
   development sector, there is little systematic evidence about the actual
   impact of this strategic shift. Evaluating the effectiveness of HRBAs is
   challenging because various non-governmental and other organizations
   have developed very different understandings of how to apply a
   rights-based framework in the development context. This essay takes a
   step toward the rigorous evaluation of HRBAs by offering a comprehensive
   review of rights-based programming implemented by Plan International, a
   child-centered organization. It shows that Plan's adoption of
   HRBA-inspired strategies has transformed its interactions with local
   communities and added an explicit focus on the state as the primary duty
   bearer There is evidence for a systematic increase in individual rights
   awareness, greater ownership exercised by community organizations, and
   the application of evidence-based advocacy aimed at scaling up proven
   program activities. But Plan's peculiar brand of HRBA neglects
   collaboration with domestic social movements and civil society, largely
   avoids a more confrontational approach towards the state, and has yet to
   produce evidence for regular successful rights claims by disadvantaged
   communities against governmental representatives at local, regional, or
   national levels. The study also reveals a limited ability of Plan to
   address disparities and discrimination within local communities, as well
   as a need to define clearly the organization's own accountability and
   duties deriving from its presence in local communities across more than
   fifty developing nations. Polity (2012) 44, 523-541.

Abstract = {Concern about vulnerabilities of IT systems is growing together with
   attention to risks of intrusive cyber-control over personal activities
   and data. This article discusses some new technologies that are being
   integrated into computing devices for realizing so-called Trusted
   Computing and Digital Rights Management systems, which can remotely
   attest their current hardware/software state and can enforce external
   policies to access protected content. These technologies are then
   confronted with distributed Trust Management systems, which realize
   access control for local resources on the basis of delegation of access
   rights according to local trust decisions. Both technologies are
   discussed from various points of view: architecture, vision, ethics,
   politics and law.},

   assumes in his work. Such scrutiny will enable us, next, to shed light
   into Blazquez de Mayoralgo's theory of raison d'etat within the the
   basic frame of catholic theology, its role in the discussion against
   Machiavelism and though in a smaller degree in the historical context of

Abstract = {This article reconstructs and interprets Bakaric's views on the causes
   of reproduction of extensive economic development in Yugoslavia in the
   historical context. Emphasis is put on Bakaric's political-economic
   criticism of the ideology and practice of Yugoslav socialism. His
   research into the causes of the economic structure's lack of balance and
   the consequences thereof starts from the etatist relations of
   production, which were the basic framework and an insurmountable
   obstacle to the possibility of their liberalization. He found the causes
   of imbalance in the bureaucratic relations and in the basic motives of
   the governing stratum to ensure - through incessant new big investments
   mass employment, improvement of the standard of living, additional
   influx to the budget and preservation of the monopoly of party power. A
   long process of gradual, slow and uneven development of self-government
   in an unequally developed multiethnic community did not make it possible
   to break out of the vicious circle. Frequent normative and
   organizational changes concealed constant political debates and
   conflicts regarding budget distribution and fiscal solidarity among the
   republics and regions. Bakaric was critical towards the governing
   stratum, which focused on distribution instead of fulfilling
   prerequisites for far-reaching changes of the economic and social
   system, and this resulted in a general crisis and in the collapse of the
   Yugoslav model of socialism.},

Abstract = {This research examines group consciousness among people of African
   descent in Miami-Dade County, Florida, and its possible impact on their
   political participation. Using an original survey of over one thousand
   respondents, the authors question whether African Americans and black
   ethnics (Africans, Afro-Caribbean Americans, Afro-Cuban Americans, and
   Haitians) possess a shared group consciousness and, if so, why. Second,
   does group consciousness or socioeconomic status most influence the
   political participation of our respondents? The authors find that these
   groups have a common consciousness because of their skin color,
   experiences with discrimination, common interests, similar ideological
   views, and leadership preferences. They also find that while group
   consciousness has more of an impact on African American political
   participation, socioeconomic status more heavily influences black
   ethnics. Last, factors such as age, gender, partisanship, religion, and
   second-generation citizenship also affect African American and/or black
   ethnic political participation.},

Volume = {10},

Abstract = {Research emphasizes the uneven impact of Europeanization. While
   different mechanisms of Europeanization, including minimalist framing
   mechanisms based on identifying best practice and peer review, can place
   adaptational impulses on national governments, an institutionalist
   perspective suggests that such initiatives are typically mediated
   through domestic traditions and that domestic governance arrangements
   can be resilient to change. This article examines such claims
   empirically by drawing on research into central-local mechanisms to
   involve local government in domestic deliberations on new EU
   environmental proposals in three member states. It finds that despite
   impulses arising from European peer review initiatives, national
   governance arrangements remain robust, with actors preferring to rely on
   established domestic routines rather than adopting approaches used
   elsewhere. Comparative European Politics (2012) 10, 399-420.

Title = {The Growth of Third-Party Voting: An Empirical Case Study of Vermont,
   1840-55},
Journal = {STATE POLITICS \& POLICY QUARTERLY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {12},
Number = {3},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This article seeks to uncover reasons behind the relatively high levels
   of third-party voting found at the state level in the early-to
   mid-1800s. I argue that third parties needed to develop localized bases
   of support from which they could expand. By analyzing Liberty Party
   gubernatorial voting in Vermont during the 1840s, the article shows that
   the party developed support in particular towns, maintained this over
   election cycles, and spread the party message to neighboring towns after
   the creation of a formal party organization. I also find that towns with
   strong Liberty Party support in the early 1840s continued to be strong
   supporters of the Free Soil Party in the 1850s. I then present evidence
   that early bases of Liberty Party support tended to vote at much higher
   levels for the Republican Party in 1855, indicating that the geographic
   development of an abolitionist party in the early 1840s helped in the
   establishment of Republican success in Vermont. These findings highlight
   the importance of geographic context in the development of third-party
   voting in the early-to mid-1800s and its connection to the rise of the
   Republican Party.},

Abstract = {This article tests the economic voting hypothesis in Portugal during the
   three most recent first-order elections (2002, 2005, 2009), trying to
   make sense of the multiplicity of choices in the Portuguese party
   system. We observed that positive sociotropic perceptions increase the
   probability to vote for the incumbent, even when we control for
   long-term factors of vote choice; egotropic effects are weaker. Negative
   economic perceptions not only lead to a higher probability to vote for
   the major opposition party, but, in some cases, increase the
   probabilities to vote for small parties or to refrain from voting.
   Sociotropic effects are actually quite constant in this timeframe, but
   their strength to explain the vote is lower than that of ideology and
   (before 2009) religiosity. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   can be challenging. Yet, the diffusion and success of `EU studies' push

   the EU provides ample opportunities of simulating various levels of

Abstract = {Public sector unions push for unmerited wage increases, exacerbating
   inflation and deficits. Despite this conventional wisdom, governments in
   several European countries successfully limited public sector wage
   growth during the 1980s and 1990s. This article argues that the recent
   rise in public sector wage inflation in the eurozone is an unintended
   consequence of the shift towards Economic and Monetary Union. I argue
   that monetary union's predecessors, the European Monetary System and
   Maastricht, imposed an institutional constraint on governments, which
   enhanced their ability to impose moderation: national-level,
   inflation-averse central banks that could punish rent-seeking sectoral
   wage-setters via monetary contraction. Monetary union's alteration of
   this constraint weakened governments' capabilities to deny inflationary
   settlements.},

Abstract = {Urban growth and metropolitanization have characterised the spatial
   development of Spain in the second-half of the twentieth century.
   However, there is as yet no stabilised institutional model of how to
   respond to the governance challenges that Spanish metropolitan areas
   face. The article explores the organisation of metropolitan governance
   in Madrid, Spain's largest metropolitan area. It argues that state
   reforms in the wake of democratisation, EU accession and increasing
   international competition have led to the establishment of the
   Autonomous Community of Madrid as a strong metropolitan government.},

Title = {LABOUR MARKET POLICIES IN DENMARK AND CANADA: COULD FLEXICURITY BE AN

Journal = {SOCIALIST STUDIES},

Abstract = {The labour market in Canada is changing. Over the past decades there has
   been an increase in the number of precarious workers on short-term,
   part-time, contracts; jobs are created and lost, as employers deem
   necessary. As a result of these shifts in the organization of work, many
   workers are now forced to hold multiple jobs in order to make ends meet.
   This move away from long-term employment has created a situation where
   the majority of Canadian workers can no longer expect their employer to
   provide predictable support and security for them. At the same time,
   under the current Employment Insurance (EI) laws, they cannot expect
   support from the federal government either. How can workers gain some
   immediate protection through expanded social welfare programmes? With
   more and more workers, especially women, racialized workers and lower
   income people relegated to precarious employment, we must question
   current social policy. If, as it appears, EI does not work, we must
   strive to implement a viable alternative. Could an alternative system be
   modeled on the flexicurity system now in effect in Denmark? This paper
   draws on Nancy Fraser's criteria for social justice for the globalized
   worker, to assess the ways that flexicurity could improve the security
   of the Canadian worker by offering alternatives to participation in the
   market nexus.},

Abstract = {The left-right political dimension represents a powerful and
   parsimonious way to describe political ideology. The right is usually
   seen as standing for tradition and acceptance of inequality, whereas the
   left advocates progress and economic redistribution. This study reports
   an analysis of the left-right scale in the minds of Icelandic voters,
   using data from the Icelandic National Election Studies from 1987-2009.
   Findings indicate that the vast majority of respondents are willing to
   place themselves on the left-right scale, and that they have become
   increasingly willing to do so since 1987. The average political
   orientation of Icelanders has consistently been just right of centre,
   with a moderate dip in 2009. The possibility of political polarization
   and sorting is considered, and ultimately rejected, based on analyses of
   the distribution of left-right scores for the entire sample and for
   subgroups defined by political party affiliation and demographics.
   Lastly, the contextual nature of the left-right dimension is examined by
   looking at the relationship over time between attitudes towards six
   political issues and left-right self-placement. The overarching picture
   that emerges from this study is that of a stable, well-defined
   left-right political landscape in the minds of Icelandic},

Abstract = {The rise of `spin doctors' and news management is one of the most
   important changes in British party politics. However, this development
   has been under-theorised. This article fills this gap in the literature
   by providing a rational-choice model of news management, in which
   parties supply information on things such as policies and intra-party
   gossip to journalists in return for favourable coverage. Basing itself
   on recent research on the media, the article develops a cost benefit
   model of news-story production in which the constant onset of deadlines
   leaves journalists considerably dependent on official information
   sources, such as spin doctors. Drawing mainly from the experience of New
   Labour in Britain, the article discusses various techniques for
   maximising positive coverage and counteracting negative coverage, and
   shows how they relate to the theoretical framework. It concludes that
   news management is inevitable when parties communicate through news
   media that make their own choices over which stories to run. British

Abstract = {Jews, who had lived in the Carpathian Basin as early as the 10th
   century, promoted Hungarian nation-building in the 19th century. They
   identified with the idea of the Hungarian state and made a decisive
   contribution to Hungary's economic modernisation and cultural renewal.
   But as a result of the crises of modernisation and social upheavals,
   political anti-Semitism emerged around 1870. With the First World War,
   anti-Semitic interpretations of society put down roots. The national
   liberal idea of equal rights and integration eroded. The Peace Treaty of
   Trianon in 1920 and the Holocaust in 1944 are the fateful events of
   20th-century Hungarian history. Both are closely interwoven and led to
   the tragic failure of nation-building and state-building in Hungary.},

Journal = {PERSPECTIVES ON POLITICS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {10},
Number = {3},
Pages = {675-686},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Hurricane Katrina and its effects are often talked about in terms of
   what has been made visible, as if the hurricane swept through and
   stripped away our structural blinders along with the levees, revealing
   social disparities within. Here, we focus instead on whom and what
   Katrina and its aftermath have rendered invisible. We are concerned with
   how the seen and the not seen have influenced the ways the purported
   tabula rasa of New Orleans has been (re)constructed and marked since
   2005. We engage with recent debates in political science about power,
   agency, structure, and culpability, arguing that efforts to prioritize
   the pursuit of culpability over critique in power analyses, such as the
   approach advocated by Steven Lukes, risk perpetuating structural
   violence. We employ the concepts of an ocular ethic and social triage to
   understand why the storm of the century that was supposed to reveal all
   has in the end left much concealed, with shocking levels of human
   devastation unaddressed. Only through careful excavation of the ruins
   can we begin to comprehend the sedimented inequality and layers of
   vulnerability that structure violence.},

Abstract = {This article examines the effect of political knowledge on support for
   the euro and voting on the euro issue in the 2001 and 2005 UK general
   elections. Political knowledge increased support for the euro in 2001
   but had no effect in 2005 and it conditioned the effect of the euro
   issue on vote choice in both elections. The effect of the euro issue on
   voting was stronger among knowledgeable voters, who were more likely to
   vote correctly on the issue by choosing a party closest to their own
   views on the euro. These findings demonstrate heterogeneity in voting on
   the euro issue in these elections and should motivate further inquiry
   into the role that political knowledge plays in conditioning voting
   behavior on European issues.},

Volume = {105},
Pages = {227-276},

Abstract = {This text starts, generally speaking, from a reconstruction of the
   political thought of Carl Schmitt, into three periods of its
   development, about the situation or state of exception. After that, it
   will be parsed the time Schmitt, himself, was under a situation of
   exception, in the post-war period. To do this, initially, will be held a
   short biographical account of the author, to demarcate its theoretical
   development traits in determining its preweimarian period. Then will be
   presented briefly some of theses in his most famous works from 1919 to
   1932, highlighting the characteristics of thought critical to
   liberalism, Schmitt and positivism, his understanding of the situation
   or state of exception, the defense of presidentialism and centralization
   of power. Later, it will be parsed to re-meaning of Schmitt's theory and
   its offshoot in 1933 until 1936 Nazi writings and your compliment to
   fascism. Finally, it will be parsed the period that Schmitt was arrested
   by the Allied Forces, in the immediate post-war period. The
   interrogations that were submitted will be examined briefly, as well as
   his participation in the Nazi government. With this exposure fetching
   will know more the implications of theories of exceptionalism, under the
   cut of one of its leading performers. Carl Schmitt met the exception
   like few others, since, in addition to theoretical, experienced the
   exceptional at the time who was arrested by the Allied Forces in 1945.},

Abstract = {New Labour arguably left Britain more comfortable in its diversity and
   better protected by anti-discrimination law. Equal treatment for gay
   people advanced significantly and the Human Rights Act provides a modern
   Bill of Rights for everyone in the Kingdom. Curiously however, parallel
   laws dishonoured these values in thought, word and deed. Home affairs
   hyperactivity left ours a less friendly country in which to seek asylum,
   dissent or even be young. The Coalition bound itself together with civil
   liberties and quickly reversed some excesses of the previous decade.
   Last year's Arab Spring saw it promote human rights abroad. However the
   Government appears bitterly divided by them at home. Is the debate about
   a more British Bill of Rights, political genius, pragmatic fudge or a
   dangerous swindle capable of depriving us all of vital protection
   against abuse of power?},

   in wide zone of the State, in this work, It treats to relate the
   indicators of these areas to the migratory process in the entity. The
   previous thing will allow to see that the migration associates with the
   slow growth of the multiplier, and consequently, of the difficulty of
   generating new wealth and employments but, also it is with an advance of
   this one same. For it the aim of the present work is to find the
   relation, from the analysis and geographical association between
   regional and state migration's pattern with the economic development,
   for what there measures up the coefficient of specialization and the
   basic multiplier, Of the methodology developed by the Latin American
   Institute of economic planning and Social (ILPES) called TAREA (Regional

   `Donnell with the Sociology classical authors, especially with Max
   Weber. Then focus on the appreciation of the link between state and
   democracy. Finally, advances over the democratization as a potentially
   reversible process. Guillermo O `Donnell was convinced of the need of
   the state for democracy. However, the assessment of the condition did
   not prevent him to recognize potential risks when it holds official
   members that are presented as something that exists outside and above

Abstract = {This article offers organizing principles to an emerging research agenda
   that analyses how parliamentary politics affects voter considerations.
   It uses the process by which votes are turned into policy as a unifying
   framework: every step in the process poses incentives for voters and
   encourages different types of strategic behaviour by voters. The
   standard version of strategic voting commonly found in analyses of voter
   choice is about the step familiar from the Anglo-American model - the
   allocation of seats based on votes - yet insights about voter behaviour
   originated from that model have been inadvertently reified and assumed
   to apply universally. The article identifies a set of empirical
   implications about the likelihood of voters employing policy-oriented
   strategies under different circumstances.},

Abstract = {Two dominant arguments within international political theory, arguments
   from humanity and arguments from justice, can be distinguished along the
   lines of the well-known distinction between omissions and actions,
   respectively. The discussion in this paper shows that people in general
   are psychologically biased towards thinking that omissions producing
   harm are less morally grave than actions producing equivalent harm. It
   also canvasses evidence suggesting that greater moral gravity correlates
   with heightened guilt, and that heightened guilt is more likely to lead
   to action that would alleviate it, i.e. remedial or compensatory action.
   For those reasons, it is suggested that we should expect arguments from
   justice, which track actions, to be a more feasible means to the desired
   outcome of (local commitment to) global justice than arguments from
   humanity, which track omissions.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF E-POLITICS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {3},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {Zimbabwe is the best contemporary example of how politics can affect
   economic development. Equally as significant, and yet under studied, is
   the effect of politics on Information and Communication Technologies for
   development (ICT4D). In this case study of government of Zimbabwe's five
   year battle to prevent Econet Wireless from operating a mobile phone
   network, the authors present the fear for the conviviality of ICTs as a
   reason why dictatorial states often restrict free use of ICTs and haw
   this can inhibit its role in fostering development. Using a combination
   of aspects of Thomas Hobbes' political theory and Sen's capability
   approach the authors show how passions like fear for the power of ICTs
   in private hands and the appetite for proceeds from the telecoms sector
   fuelled a five year legal battle that was eventually won by Econet. A
   framework for assessing the motives behind restrictive political action
   and the concomitant erosion of political freedoms which inhibits free
   ICT use and investment in the sector is also presented.},

Abstract = {Despite a holistic approach that links democracy to human rights,
   integral development, and poverty, the Inter-American Democratic Charter
   (IADC) is silent on the ties between democracy and security. Since the
   creation of the IADC, it has become increasingly evident that democracy
   and security are integrally interconnected in the Americas, but there is
   no mention in the IADC of how security issues might affect democracy and
   vice versa. It also fails to make an argument regarding the linkages
   between improved security and a robust democratic culture and is silent
   on the threats that transnational organized crime and internal criminal
   activity pose to democratic governance. This article analyzes the
   democracy- security nexus in Mexico, Central America, and the countries
   of the Caribbean Community. It reflects on the manner in which
   transnational criminal organizations threaten the political development
   of those states as well as traditional notions of sovereignty. The
   article advances recommendations on how to manage the security threats
   and underscores the need to link democracy and security more
   organically. It also recommends a future resolution project that links
   democracy and security and the IADC and multidimensional security,
   rather than reopening the text of the IADC, to strengthen the
   application of the instrument.},

   undertaken into public opinion on climate change in Britain. This
   research note examines which factors affect citizens' awareness of and
   attitudes towards climate change. It undertakes multivariate analysis of
   nationally representative surveys to examine the social and attitudinal
   correlates of climate change attitudes. Accounting for sociological
   background, both political-ideological attitudes and general
   environmental orientations have strong effects. There is a clear gap in
   attitudes between men and women and strong evidence of differences by
   level of education. Climate change scepticism is associated with factors
   such as being male, less well educated, supporting the Conservatives and
   having right-wing ideological beliefs. The findings should encourage
   future research on the issue of climate change in British politics.

Abstract = {The subject of this article is the state of the discipline of
   International Relations (IR) in Poland. In the communist era, IR was an
   arena of ideological confrontation. The political science approach was
   based on Marxist ideology. The transformation after 1989 can be
   described as a transition from real socialism to common sense realism,
   and hence an approach that is practical, but lacking in more
   far-reaching theoretical reflection. The closure of this gap is
   inevitably a slow process. However, it has been possible to sense some
   creative spirit within the discipline recently, as is attested by the
   publication of a series of major works by Polish and foreign authors,
   initiating a debate on the condition of IR and the establishment of the
   Polish International Studies Association. However, the state of the
   discipline in Poland will require a raising of the level of teaching at
   Polish universities, not least through a fuller account being taken of
   research methodologies and theories.},

Abstract = {This article places developments in French higher education (HE) in the
   broader context of the literature on HE governance and, in particular,
   marketization. In order to trace developments over three time frames
   spanning from the mid-1980s to 2010, the author develops three
   ideal-type models of governance and empirical indicators to reflect the
   balance of power between the state, universities and market forces. This
   framework provides the basis for analyzing the extent to which French
   universities have moved away from the primarily state-centered HE model
   and converged on the market-oriented paradigm of HE governance. The
   article demonstrates how changes in French HE have been driven both by
   domestic reform pressures and policy instruments as well as
   transnational forces of competition and harmonization.},

Abstract = {Worldwide, there is substantial popular support for the ideal of
   democracy but, on the other hand, there is considerable dissatisfaction
   with democracy within democracies. Democracies are inhabited by many
   so-called `dissatisfied democrats': citizens who are strong supporters
   of the democratic ideal, but are unhappy with the way democracy is
   working in their country. It is not clear how to explain this
   phenomenon, but based on a review of the existing literature, two
   different approaches can be distinguished: an optimistic and a
   pessimistic one. Subsequently, this article investigates why some people
   are dissatisfied democrats while others are not in eight African
   democracies - Benin, Botswana, Ghana, Lesotho, Mali, Namibia, Senegal
   and South Africa. The empirical evidence seems to support the complex
   mix of both the optimistic and pessimistic approaches: to be sure,
   dissatisfied democrats are critical citizens compared with dissatisfied
   non-democrats, but they are not more politically active than the rest of
   the population. Future studies need to find out whether dissatisfied
   democrats can be seen either as a democratic danger or as a democratic
   defence, but the first findings in this article suggest that a growing
   group of dissatisfied democrats are a sign of democracy in decline.},

Abstract = {Political parties are often argued to compete for voters by stressing
   issues they feel they own - a strategy known as `selective emphasis'.
   While usually seen as an electorally rewarding strategy, this article
   argues that cultivating `your' themes in the public debate is not
   guaranteed to be electorally beneficial and may even become
   counter-productive. It describes the conditions under which `selective
   emphasis' becomes counter-productive, and applies the argument to recent
   discussions regarding the strategies of mainstream parties confronting
   the extreme right. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Political science has, in the past 40 years, developed into a
   multi-dimensional discipline, training thousands of political scientists
   who have entered a variety of professions. Its development in Iceland
   over 40 years has been remarkable, from its small beginnings in 1970 to
   hosting the largest political science conference in Europe in 2011.
   However, as the ECPR's founders taught us, political science must always
   be aware of new challenges and be prepared to innovate and adapt to new
   realities. The financial crisis that hit Iceland and the world economy
   in 2008 embodies significant challenges to the discipline, but also
   opportunities and notably the opportunity to retrieve the dominance that
   market economics secured in the past over many political economy
   analyses. The specific experience of Iceland, as a small state in the
   north, represents a wake-up call for the discipline, raising key
   questions relating to the contribution political science can make to
   understanding the current transformation and to the capacity of the
   discipline to maintain its relevance.},

Abstract = {This paper argues that the problems emerging in the process of current

   between state forces and social forces in nature. In future, the key for
   achieving the sustainability of Chinese urbanization process is to seek
   for the institutional balance between the state and the society.
   Therefore, it is necessary to include the public interests demands into
   the process of urban development to achieve the benign interaction

Abstract = {The Romanian energy market suffers from structural flaws, which pre-date
   the beginning of liberalization. Although the restructuring process by
   breaking-up vertical monopolies (damaging for competition and for
   competitiveness at the same time) started off relatively early - 1998
   for electricity, 2000 for gas, uncompetitive commercial practices and
   damaging administrative decisions kept persisting. A brief diagnosis of
   how the Romanian electricity market runs shows that structural flaws
   still exist. Over 75\% of wholesale electricity trade takes place
   over-the-counter (outside the specialized trading platform OPCOM), via
   so-called bilateral contracts, be they negotiated or regulated. In and
   by themselves, bilateral contracts are important for ensuring trade
   predictability for large industrial consumers. Although there is a
   specialized market for bilateral contracts inside OPCOM, only 8\% of the
   entire electricity traded inside OPCOM is represented by this market
   segment.},

Abstract = {Some observers of American politics have argued that Republicans have
   redrawn the social class basis of the parties by displacing the
   Democrats as the party of the common person. While others have addressed
   the argument by implication, we address the phenomenon itself. That is,
   we examine whether the populist rhetoric used by conservatives has
   reshaped the American public's perceptions about the social class basis
   of American political parties. To this end, we used NES data and created
   novel survey questions for examining the class-based images of the
   parties. We examine whether the public holds populist images of the
   Republican Party and whether the working class and evangelical
   Christians are especially likely to hold this belief. Contrary to this
   argument, most Americans view the Democrats as the party of the people.
   Furthermore, working class and evangelical Christians are no less likely
   to hold this belief.},

Abstract = {In recent decades, local governments in the United States have
   repeatedly turned to activism to protest higher government policies, or
   to generate policy movement in an expanding array of domestic and
   foreign policy areas. There has been little scholarly effort, however,
   to categorize the behaviors of local activism or to understand why it
   occurs. This conceptual article introduces local activism as a political
   strategy comprised of several progressively aggressive behaviors. A
   typology for these activist behaviors is suggested and the potential
   goals and motivations of local activists explored, along with recent
   changes to the intergovernmental environment that may have provided both
   cause and political incentive for local activism.},

Abstract = {Promissory estoppel is an equitable principle meant to prevent any
   occurrence of inequity or injustice caused by the action of the promisor
   in backing out from his promise, which initially led the promisee to act
   to his detriment. This paper discusses the proposal to statutorily enact
   promissory estoppel into the Malaysian laws, which is based on three
   reasons: (i) to clearly define its parameters for the easier application
   by the courts because now that unconscionability is being the main focus
   in granting promissory estoppel, in lieu of detrimental reliance, the
   thin line surrounding its parameters are becoming more vague; (ii) to
   undo its limited interpretation and application as an equitable doctrine
   that is subject to numerous rules of equity, which may potentially
   arrest the development of equity and compromise the administration of
   justice; and (iii) to avoid the statutory restriction imposed by Section
   3(1) of the Civil Law Act 1956, which necessitates the reception of this
   equitable doctrine to be subject to the exclusionary phrase stated in
   the beginning of Section 3(1) denoting that its application of
   promissory estoppel in Malaysia can only be carried out only when there
   is a lacuna in such area of law.},

Abstract = {This paper aims at explicating the hegemonic pressure from the U.S. side
   and the constant resistance from the Chinese side during the U.S.-China
   IPR disputes in the cyberspace. The theory of hegemony and extended
   literature review reveal that during the U.S.-China IPR disputes in
   cyberspace, the dominant U.S. power has shaped the IPR world order so
   effectively for its own interests that China as a disadvantaged country
   has been included, albeit with reservations, in the broad consent of the
   U.S. hegemonic sphere of influence. This study has also demonstrated
   significant theoretical and practical implications.},

Abstract = {The ambition of the study is to provide a description of the forms and
   functions of clientelism, thus looking at the differences between
   ``rural{''} forms of clientelism that still rely on familiar brokerage,
   and their implications in terms of the power status of local bosses, and
   the ``urban{''} forms of transactional exchanges, that are less
   efficient by comparison, and require more innovative monitoring
   mechanisms. In order to assess the likelihood of structurally embedded
   long-term clientelistic relationships, which take the form of patronage,
   or discretionary use of state resources, the second part of the
   empirical analysis uses such proxies as the levels of corruption or
   political incohesiveness. The present paper serves as a starting point
   for further research on these more pervasive and more contentious
   aspects of clientelism within state structures.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {31},
Number = {2},
Pages = {285-296},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {How and how much are ideological dimensions associated with vote choice
   among different age groups? Distinct socialisation experiences and
   life-cycle effects should lead to age group differences in the use of
   ideological dimensions. We test our hypotheses using a 2009 Austrian
   cross-sectional survey. We find that the extent of the association
   between ideological dimensions and vote choice is significant and
   similar across all age groups. However, the nature of the association
   depends on the type of party considered. Positions on the socio-cultural
   dimension are associated with voting for New Politics parties far more
   than positions on the socio-economic dimension; the latter distinguishes
   well between support for the two Old Politics parties. Overall, age
   group differences are surprisingly small in both the extent and nature
   of the association between ideological views and vote choice: there is
   only isolated evidence that the use of ideological dimensions differs
   across age groups. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Interest group mobilization and lobbying patterns in Britain: A
   newspaper analysis},

Abstract = {How do organized interests mobilize around governmental policy
   initiatives? Do they attempt to counter the lobbying efforts of their
   competitors or opponents, or do they seek out niches with little
   competition from countervailing interests? Are any issue niches utilized
   more or less equally by different kinds of advocates, or are business
   lobbyists more prominent here than other groups? And how are these
   mobilization patterns reflected in the news media? Research into the
   mobilization of organized interests around public policy to date has
   mainly focused on the United States (US). Little is still known
   empirically about the mobilization patterns of organized interests in
   the context of actual policy issues in other countries. This article
   addresses this imbalance by analysing newspaper reports on the reported
   political involvement of organized interests in the context of over 1000
   policy proposals advanced by United Kingdom (UK) governments between
   2001 and 2007. The goal is twofold: first, to describe and evaluate a
   new data set for the analysis of lobbying activities in British
   politics, and second, to confront established claims, mainly developed
   within the US context, about interest group mobilization. On the basis
   of an archival search of seven major UK broadsheets, the project focuses
   on 183 governmental policy proposals for which one or more societal
   actors are mentioned in a newspaper article. The actors are coded
   according to established classification schemes, allowing an exploration
   of their distribution across the policy proposals. The findings show,
   first, that in the overwhelming majority of newspaper reporting on new
   governmental policy plans, there are no reports of related interest
   group activity, suggesting that most policy proposals are not visibly
   contested. Second, the possible biases that may result from journalists
   filtering the appearance of different types of lobbyists seem to be
   limited. Third, in a very small number of cases, two or more groups are
   reported as lobbying around an issue. This confirms earlier findings
   from US research that niche lobbying is the most frequently observed
   mobilization pattern. In these issue niches, lobbyists are more likely
   to be nonbusiness actors than in the context of more visibly contested
   proposals. Thus, contrary to findings from the US context, business
   actors do not appear to dominate niche issues in the UK. In British
   newspapers, it is non- business groups rather than business actors that
   are most likely to make an appearance in the context of issue niches.
   Newspaper reporting on interest group mobilization around UK policy
   issues closely resembles patterns of issue niches found in the US. By
   contrast, the difference in levels of business dominance in issue niches
   between these two political systems points to differences in the policy
   process between the UK and US, as well as to possible selection biases
   of the different sampling strategies.},

Abstract = {In 2005, the European Parliament rejected the directive on the
   patentability of computer-implemented inventions, which had been drafted
   and supported by the European Commission, the Council and well-organised
   industrial interests, with an overwhelming majority. In this unusual
   case, a coalition of opponents of software patents prevailed over a
   strong industry-led coalition. In this article, an explanation is
   developed based on political discourse showing that two stable and
   distinct discourse coalitions can be identified and measured over time.
   The apparently weak coalition of software patent opponents shows typical
   properties of a hegemonic discourse coalition. It presents itself as
   being more coherent, employs a better-integrated set of frames and
   dominates key economic arguments, while the proponents of software
   patents are not as well-organised. This configuration of the discourse
   gave leeway for an alternative course of political action by the
   European Parliament. The notion of discourse coalitions and related
   structural features of the discourse are operationalised by drawing on
   social network analysis. More specifically, discourse network analysis
   is introduced as a new methodology for the study of policy debates. The
   approach is capable of measuring empirical discourses both statically
   and in a longitudinal way, and is compatible with the policy network
   approach.},

Abstract = {Although Gandhi is often taken to be an exemplary moral idealist in
   politics, this article seeks to demonstrate that Gandhian nonviolence is
   premised on a form of political realism, specifically a contextual,
   consequentialist, and moral-psychological analysis of a political world
   understood to be marked by inherent tendencies toward conflict,
   domination, and violence. By treating nonviolence as the essential
   analog and correlative response to a realist theory of politics, one can
   better register the novelty of satyagraha (nonviolent action) as a
   practical orientation in politics as opposed to a moral proposition,
   ethical stance, or standard of judgment. The singularity of satyagraha
   lays in its self-limiting character as a form of political action that
   seeks to constrain the negative consequences of politics while working
   toward progressive social and political reform. Gandhian nonviolence
   thereby points toward a transformational realism that need not begin and
   end in conservatism, moral equivocation, or pure instrumentalism.},

Abstract = {Punitive policy designs diminish felons as citizens. Scholars know much
   about the designs' influence on felons' political and civil rights. They
   know little of how policy influences felons' social rights. Examining
   the discretion of states to retain or reform federal bans on drug felons
   receiving cash and food assistance between 1997 and 2004, we explain the
   choices states make about extending social rights to ``deviants.{''} We
   draw from theories of neoinstitutional organization, group threat, and
   political incorporation. Multivariate analysis suggest that the severity
   of states' penal regimes and the degree to which felons and poor people
   threaten social order have the greatest influence on states' responses
   to the federal sanctions on drug felons. Our study informs
   understandings of why some states take a ``punitive turn{''} while other
   states may counter convention, exercising discretion to reduce rather
   than increase their punitiveness toward felons specifically and
   lawbreaking generally.},

Abstract = {Spectral analysis and ARMA models have been the most common weapons of
   choice for the detection of cycles in political time series.
   Controversies about cycles, however, tend to revolve around an issue
   that both techniques are badly equipped to address: the possibility of
   irregular cycles without fixed periodicity throughout the entire time
   series. This has led to two main consequences. On the one hand,
   proponents of cyclical theories have often dismissed established
   statistical techniques. On the other hand, proponents of established
   techniques have dismissed the possibility of cycles without fixed
   periodicity. Wavelets allow the detection of transient and coexisting
   cycles and structural breaks in periodicity. In this article, we present
   the tools of wavelet analysis and apply them to the study of two
   lingering puzzles in the political science literature: the existence of
   cycles in election returns in the United States and in the severity of
   major power wars.},

Abstract = {Eighty percent of American cities today hold their general elections on
   different days than state and national elections. It is an established
   fact that voter turnout in these off-cycle local elections is far lower
   than turnout in local elections held concurrently with state and
   national elections. In this paper I demonstrate that the timing of city
   elections has been an important determinant of voter turnout since
   before the Civil War By examining three large American cities over the
   course of the nineteenth century, I find that American political parties
   regularly manipulated the timing of city elections to secure an edge
   over their rivals. I show that the decisions to change the election
   dates of these cities were contentious, partisan, and motivated by an
   expectation of subsequent electoral gain. The Progressive municipal
   reformers of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries continued
   in this tradition when they separated city elections from state and
   national elections, and the local election schedule they implemented has
   largely persisted until today.},

Abstract = {In recent times, `just war' discourse has become unfortunately
   associated, in the minds of some, with the idea of the forcible
   promotion or imposition of democracy as a legitimate just cause. It
   would thus be understandable if supporters of just war theory were to
   disavow any particular linkage of its tenets with the democratic ideal.
   However, while certainly not endorsing the stated cause, this article
   contends that the theory in its most plausible and attractive form does
   exhibit certain biases towards the ideal, in both jus ad bellum and jus
   post bellum. If these biases fall short of shackling the theory to
   claims such as `only democracies can fight just wars', they may
   nevertheless place taxing justificatory burdens on a non-democracy's
   claim to have a war-waging right and on non-democratic conceptions of
   the just peace that should ideally follow a just war.},

Abstract = {This article argues that long periods out of office make parties
   impatient and more willing to make concessions over portfolio allocation
   in exchange for participation in a coalition cabinet. Two hypotheses are
   analysed: on the one hand, being in opposition for a long time should
   put parties at a disadvantage when bargaining over office payoffs. On
   the other, this effect should not apply to the formateur party, since
   formation offers are based on the receivers' impatience. The empirical
   results largely support these expectations. Additional evidence of the
   causality of the main effect is obtained through the use of matching
   techniques based on the propensity score.},

Abstract = {In the summer of 2010, 52 Republican members of the US House of
   Representatives joined the newly formed Tea Party Caucus, bringing the
   first institutional voice to the Tea Party movement. To understand both
   the policy orientations of the organized Tea Party (in its caucus
   manifestation) and the institutional strength of the caucus's
   membership, we assess the extent to which caucus members are distinctive
   from their fellow Republicans in the US House of Representatives. Our
   results suggest that membership in the caucus is primarily driven by
   ideology and economics. Specifically, we find that Tea Party Caucus
   members are Republicans who are ideologically oriented toward limited
   government and lower taxes and who hail from particularly prosperous
   congressional districts. We find no evidence that Tea Party Caucus
   members serve safer districts or have greater seniority or institutional
   stature than their Republican colleagues who are not members of the
   caucus. These findings, we believe, speak not only to the nature and
   orientations of the Tea Party Caucus, but to the wider Tea Party
   movement itself.},

Abstract = {The still present belief some 40 years ago that British politics was
   both exceptional and superior has been replaced by more theoretically
   sophisticated analyses based on a wider and more rigorously deployed
   range of research techniques, although historical analysis appropriately
   remains important. The American influence on the study of British
   politics has declined, but the European Union dimension has not been
   fully integrated. The study of interest groups has been in some respects
   a fading paradigm, but important questions related to democratic health
   have still to be addressed. Public administration has been supplanted by
   public policy, but economic policy remains under-studied. A key
   challenge for the future is the study of the management of expectations.

   structurally pivotal bloc during the New Deal and Fair Deal (1933-52)
   due to its size and cohesion and the need for southern votes to
   constitute majority coalitions. Empirically, it asks how southern
   members deployed this capacity and with what consequences. Utilizing a
   multilevel coding of policy substance, it tracks whether southern
   roll-call behavior was consistent with Democratic Party positions and
   traces changes over time with consequences for lawmaking and party
   politics. Analytically, the article moves beyond central current debates
   about parties and preferences that provide no distinctive place for the
   South and advances ``situated partisanship,{''} an approach that
   privileges temporality and policy substance to understand when and with
   regard to which issues political parties are able to organize the
   preferences of their members and control lawmaking.},

Abstract = {In the historical development of the relationship between education and
   society, primary education in France has played a central role. The
   French educational system is one of the most stable public institutions,
   given its constitutional significance and relevance for the embodiment
   of the republican virtues. Its organisational structure has remained
   almost unchanged since the Loi Goblet, enacted on 30 October 1886. The
   principles of universalism, uniformity and equality of opportunity have
   marked over time that policy developments in France aimed at fighting
   inherited disadvantage and lifting children above the poverty line
   through state-based education. The scholarly focus on the institutional
   and administrative dimension of the French system of education has
   helped illuminate some of the difficulties associated with the
   implementation of change, including the disappointing experience with
   the introduction of positive discrimination in the 1980s. However, to
   date, the empirical evidence of the effects of educational reforms that
   were implemented remains unfortunately secondary to the conventional
   wisdom of the `politics of non-reform' and institutional inertia.
   Governmental initiatives have concentrated on tackling educational
   under-achievements in basic literacy and numeracy in primary schools.
   The empirical findings in this article point not only to the general
   deterioration of educational achievements, but also to a persisting gap
   between pupils from different social background. The article will
   document how educational inequalities driven by different social
   economic groups have increased, despite government efforts and new
   policy initiatives in the 1980s and 1990s.},

Abstract = {Does membership in intergovernmental organizations help developing

   that IGO membership can improve the environmental performance of
   developing countries, by linking different issues, promoting the general
   idea of environmental sustainability and providing a channel through
   which these countries receive technologies and resources necessary to
   reduce pollution. This argument has been tested on panel data for 114
   developing countries in 1970-2000. The results confirm that, controlling
   for a country's income and its political system, IGO membership is
   indeed associated with a reduction in both air pollution and greenhouse
   gases. To understand the mechanisms behind this result better, IGO
   membership is disaggregated according to both function and the degree of
   institutionalization of the respective organization.},

Abstract = {After three decades of reform, China's state-owned enterprises have
   become powerful entities economically and politically, while remaining
   relatively inefficient and often monopolistic vis-a-vis the private
   sector. Their expansion in the aftermath of the global financial crisis
   has further squeezed the space of development for non-state sectors. The
   prospect of reform is now coloured with uncertainty as regulatory,
   legislative and political means have failed to rein in the politically
   well-connected large centrally managed SOEs.},

Volume = {65},

Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to explain why voters made the choices that
   they did in Britains Alternative Vote (AV) referendum on 5 May 2011. The
   paper utilises four alternative theoretical models to analyse individual
   voting behaviour. They are described as the costbenefit, cognitive
   engagement, heuristics and mobilisation models. The explanatory power of
   these models is investigated using a large survey data set gathered in
   the AV referendum study conducted in conjunction with the British
   Election Study. Multivariate analyses show that all four models
   contribute to explaining why some people voted in favour of electoral
   reform, with the costbenefit model exhibiting particularly strong
   effects. The conclusion discusses public reactions to the referendum and
   possible implications of the decisive rejection of electoral reform
   after a campaign characterised by disaffection and disengagement.},

Abstract = {how the major newspapers in the country used certain frames to report
   about the two front-running candidates in the second round of the
   presidential elections in Croatia in 2010. The paper first examines if
   there were any differences between Ivo Josipovic and Milan Bandic in
   terms of their visibility in newspaper reports. Secondly, the paper
   investigates if and how newspapers employed valenced frames to report
   about the candidates. Thirdly, the paper speculates how the news framing
   of the candidates may have affected the outcome of the elections.
   The results show that three valenced news frames dominated the news
   coverage about the candidates: success frame (winner - loser),
   suitability frame (suitable - unsuitable) and integrity frame (honest -
   dishonest). Although Milan Bandic was the most visible candidate, the
   press favoured Ivo Josipovic, framing him as suitable for the position,
   honest and decent, and as the likely winner. On the other hand, Milan
   Bandic was framed predominantly as dishonest, unsuitable and the loser.
   The paper finally suggests that the news framing of the candidates may
   have contributed to the victory of Ivo Josipovic.},

Journal = {STATE CRIME},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {1},
Number = {1},
Pages = {109-125},
Month = {SPR},
Abstract = {Using the example of Australia's immigration detention policies, this
   article engages with contemporary debates about public criminology to
   explore how, when researching state crime, criminologists should
   conceptualize victims. It is argued that what is missing from the
   debates about public criminology (and much state crime research) is a
   systematic discussion of victim agency. A number of questions will be
   addressed throughout the discussion: Can victims be the ``object{''} of
   ``neutral{''} research? Should detainees, for example, be seen primarily
   as passive victims of state abuse? What role is played by institutional
   ethics policies, especially those based on medical models? It will be
   argued that state crime research should acknowledge-if not emphasize-the
   potential subjective role played by victims; that there is a complex and
   dynamic inter-relationship between the researcher and the victim that
   confronts traditional perceptions of criminological research; and that
   victim resistance, combined with criminological research, can be crucial
   in designating particular state activities as criminal and constructing
   the social audience that rejects them.},

Abstract = {In the aftermath of the imperial presidency, some historians and
   political scientists developed a revisionist critique of Franklin D.
   Roosevelt's destroyer deal, criticizing his claim and exercise of
   prerogative power to unilaterally exchange destroyers for leasing rights
   to British bases in the Western Hemisphere. They argued that the deal
   was a violation of international law, that it went beyond the
   Constitution, that it violated neutrality laws passed by Congress, that
   it took advantage of the British in a time of maximum peril. The purpose
   of this article is to examine two of these claims-that the president
   went beyond the Constitution and the laws. The destroyer deal was an
   exercise of prerogative power anticipated by the founders of the
   Constitution, and Roosevelt's policy was successful because it
   ``normalized{''} prerogative, basing it on what presidency scholar
   Richard Neustadt referred to as ``power stakes.{''}},

Abstract = {How is the current United States (US) counterterrorism (CT) strategy
   suited to combat the evolving threat posed by the Al Qaeda terrorist
   network? Although in some respects the US CT strategy has delivered the
   intended results of its sponsors, a number of events in the past several
   years demand that the US government reorients particular aspects of its
   approach to transnational terror in order to stay ahead of its adversary
   in the global war on terror (GWOT). Multilateral and multifaceted traits
   of the US CT strategy underscores the need to maintain and develop new
   and effective partnerships with institutions, organizations, and
   overseas states; but until the US government begins to look at the GWOT
   - not in terms of big-war paradigm, but instead as new type of war
   characterized by global insurgency - Al Qaeda and the Global Silafi
   Jihad will continue to punch above the capacity of Western democracies
   to manage their position in the GWOT and stay ahead of the game.},

Abstract = {The notion of civil society associations as schools of democracy has
   resulted in models of political participation that place an emphasis on
   membership in civic associations as a means of developing personal
   skills that are conducive to political participation. These suppositions
   seem well established. It is still contested, however, to what extent
   the particular characteristics of the associations that offer such
   membership have an impact on civic engagement. Expanding recent research
   that mainly builds on group characteristics aggregated from the
   characteristics of the associations members, we apply the Swiss part of
   a unique multi-level data set, the CID-data, which provides information
   about approx. 1000 activists from about 400 associations. This data
   allows us to measure group characteristics, such as the function of an
   association and its connection to the local elite, directly and thus
   provides us with a special opportunity for a multi-level analysis of
   activists nested in organisations.},

Abstract = {In addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, societies worldwide
   have to cope with the potential impacts of climate change. The central
   question of this paper is to what extent our historically grown
   institutions enable actors to cope with the new challenges of climate
   adaptation. We present six qualities of governance institutions that are
   crucial to allow for, and encourage adaptation, and apply them to the
   National Adaptation Strategies of the Netherlands, the United Kingdom,
   Finland and Sweden. We conclude that although the governance
   institutions involved seem to have the basic qualities required, they
   face five institutional weaknesses, causing tensions on the long term:
   (1) lack of openness towards learning and variety; (2) strong one-sided
   reliance on scientific experts; (3) tension between top-down policy
   development and bottom-up implementation; (4) distrust in the
   problem-solving capacity of civil society; and (5) wickedness of
   reserving funding for long-term action.},

Title = {The Electoral Consequences of Skin Color: The ``Hidden{''} Side of Race
   in Politics},
Journal = {POLITICAL BEHAVIOR},

Volume = {34},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Despite the significant role that skin color plays in material
   well-being and social perceptions, scholars know little if anything
   about whether skin color and afrocentric features influence political
   cognition and behavior and specifically, if intraracial variation in
   addition to categorical difference affects the choices of voters. Do
   more phenotypically black minorities suffer an electoral penalty as they
   do in most aspects of life? This study investigates the impact of color
   and phenotypically black facial features on candidate evaluation, using
   a nationally representative survey experiment of over 2000 whites.
   Subjects were randomly assigned to campaign literature of two opposing
   candidates, in which the race, skin color and features, and issue stance
   of candidates was varied. I find that afrocentric phenotype is an
   important, albeit hidden, form of bias in racial attitudes and that the
   importance of race on candidate evaluation depends largely on skin color
   and afrocentric features. However, like other racial cues, color and
   black phenotype don't influence voters' evaluations uniformly but vary
   in magnitude and direction across the gender and partisan makeup of the
   electorate in theoretically explicable ways. Ultimately, I argue,
   scholars of race politics, implicit racial bias, and minority candidates
   are missing an important aspect of racial bias.},

Abstract = {Studies of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)
   countries have generally failed to detect real economic expansions in
   preelection periods, casting doubt on the existence of opportunistic
   political business cycles. We develop a theory that predicts that a
   substantial portion of the economy experiences a real decline in the
   preelection period if the election is associated with sufficient policy
   uncertainty. In particular, policy uncertainty induces private actors to
   postpone investments with high costs of reversal. The resulting
   declines, which are called reverse electoral business cycles, require
   sufficient levels of polarization between major parties and electoral
   competitiveness. To test these predictions, we examine quarterly data on
   private fixed investment in ten OECD countries between 1975 and 2006.
   The results show that reverse electoral business cycles exist and as
   expected, depend on electoral competitiveness and partisan polarization.
   Moreover, simply by removing private fixed investment from gross
   domestic product, we uncover evidence of opportunistic cycles.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ELECTIONS PUBLIC OPINION AND PARTIES},

Volume = {22},
Number = {3},
Pages = {293-313},
Abstract = {This article analyses the decision of Belgian voters to cast a
   preference vote on the occasion of the 2009 regional elections. And what
   appears is that preference votes could be given three meanings. First,
   preference voting appears to be a sophisticated voting behaviour more
   accessible to politically interested and involved voters. Less
   politically active voters more often limit themselves to marking their
   ballot on the top of the list without differentiating their support
   among candidates. Second, preference voting is very much a token of
   voter-candidate proximity. Voters are more likely to support candidates
   when they know one or several specific candidates directly or via the
   media. Finally, preference voting is also very much dependent on the
   structure of institutional incentives. The more influence a preference
   vote has on the process of intra-party seat allocation, the more likely
   voters are to make the effort. All in all, this article shows the
   diversity of motivations behind preference voting, and more importantly
   the different meanings it could take in elections.},

Abstract = {Since 1990, the number of preferential trade agreements has increased
   rapidly. The argument in this article explains this phenomenon, known as
   the new regionalism, as a result of competition for market access;
   exporters facing trade diversion because of their exclusion from a
   preferential trade agreement concluded by foreign countries push their
   governments into signing an agreement with the country in which their
   exports are threatened. The argument is tested in a quantitative
   analysis of the proliferation of preferential trade agreements among 167
   countries between 1990 and 2007. The finding that competition for market
   access is a major driving force of the new regionalism is a contribution
   to the literature on regionalism and to broader debates about global
   economic regulation.},

Abstract = {Though African party systems are said to be ethnic, there is little
   evidence for this claim. The few empirical studies rarely rely on
   individual data and are biased in favour of Anglophone Africa. This
   paper looks at four Francophone countries, drawing on representative
   survey polls. Results reveal that ethnicity matters, but that its impact
   is generally rather weak and differs with regard to party systems and
   individual parties. `Ethnic parties' in the strict sense are virtually
   absent. In particular, the voters' location seems more important than
   ethnic affiliation. Other determinants such as regional ties, elite
   strategies, cross-cutting cleavages, and rational preferences deserve
   more attention in the future study of voting behaviour in Africa.},

Title = {Policy Copying and Public Sector Reform in Northern Ireland},
Journal = {REGIONAL AND FEDERAL STUDIES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {22},
Number = {3},
Pages = {309-321},
Abstract = {Policy copying or transfer has been identified as a significant feature
   of the operation of devolution in Scotland and Wales. Little attention
   has been paid to policy copying in relation to the system of devolution
   in Northern Ireland, particularly since 1999. One of the most important
   areas of change and policy implementation has been public sector reform.
   This paper examines the three main areas of public sector reform: the
   civil service, local government and the large quango/public bodies
   sector. Northern Ireland is compared to England, Scotland and Wales to
   identify examples of policy copying in changes to public sector
   governance. Following this analysis a number of factors which have
   determined the extent of policy copying are discussed. These include; a
   weak policy-making capacity, the dominance of managerialist and
   technocratic approaches, priority for cost-cutting measures and a lack
   of consensus on reform among the political parties along with the
   operation of veto mechanisms. The paper concludes by noting that
   Northern Ireland has not adopted some of the policies and changes
   introduced in Scotland and Wales in relation to the public sector even
   though these may have improved the operation of devolved governance.},

Abstract = {While there is much debate about the merits of dichotomous versus
   continuous measures of democracy, surprisingly little attention is paid
   to the question as to how to go from degree to dichotomy. This study
   identifies no less than 38 different ways in which Freedom House and
   Polity scores have been used to distinguish between democracies and
   non-democracies. The analysis shows that it is difficult to draw the
   line in measures of democracy, even for Freedom House and Polity
   themselves. These problems are illustrated with the help of a recent
   study on democratization in Africa. The conclusion formulates some
   guidelines for good practice and points at the potential of
   disaggregated scores to distinguish between democracy and dictatorship.},

Abstract = {If in the Eighties people spoke about the ``death of the cinema{''}, we
   realize that we attend an in-depth reorganization. On the one hand the
   big Hollywood studios multiply the initiatives ({''}3D{''}, cinema in
   three dimensions) to reconquer the amateurs of big spectacle. In
   addition, television, with certain series, obtains a critical glance on
   society. Lastly, the marketing of small numeric cameras, appears to want
   to put the film turning close to all. However, it is not the tool which
   makes art, but the person which has it in hands.},

Volume = {16},

Pages = {531-544},
Abstract = {In 2004, the first citizenship ceremony was conducted in the London
   Borough of Brent. These compulsory ceremonies for those who have been
   granted British citizenship had been proposed in the government white
   paper and then in the 2002 Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act. They
   were designed to celebrate the moment of achieving citizenships and were
   one response to a perceived `crisis of citizenship' in Britain. This
   study examines the texts of the `local welcome' which is given by a
   local dignitary at every ceremony as a moment of invention of tradition
   and of narrating citizenship and thereby narrating the nation-state. The
   study explores how and what the speeches tell us about understandings of
   citizenship and its relationship to diversity. It explores how history
   is also represented within the speeches. Finally, the study interrogates
   the texts' telling of a multi-cultural story.},

Abstract = {Public agencies have discretion on the time domain, and politicians
   deploy numerous policy instruments to constrain it. Yet little is known
   about how administrative procedures that affect timing also affect the
   quality of agency decisions. We examine whether administrative deadlines
   shape decision timing and the observed quality of decisions. Using a
   unique and rich dataset of FDA drug approvals that allows us to examine
   decision timing and quality, we find that this administrative tool
   induces a piling of decisions before deadlines, and that these
   ``just-before-deadline{''} approvals are linked with higher rates of
   postmarket safety problems (market withdrawals, severe safety warnings,
   safety alerts). Examination of data from FDA advisory committees
   suggests that the deadlines may impede quality by impairing late-stage
   deliberation and agency risk communication. Our results both support and
   challenge reigning theories about administrative procedures, suggesting
   they embody expected control-expertise trade-offs, but may also create
   unanticipated constituency losses.},

Abstract = {In the two decades following World War II, the nation-state was globally
   established as the normal form of the modern state. This normative idea
   was acknowledged in the right of self-determination of nations. The
   enemies of national liberation were colonialism and racism. The
   anticolonial nationalism of Asia and Africa also shared with the Marxism
   of the Third International a distinction betwen the ``bad nationalism''
   of the Western capitalist countries and the ``good nationalism'' of the
   anticolonial movements. It is now being claimed that the world order
   based on equally sovereign nation-states has fundamentally changed. This
   essay examines these arguments. It concludes that there is no ``empire''
   based on deterritorialized authority. On the other hand, the
   normalization of nation-states implies the gradation and ranking of
   nations with some claiming the power to declare others exceptions to the
   rule of sovereign equality. Further, within nation-states, the populist
   politics of ethnic identity can undermine as well as bolster the
   ideology of nationalism. Neither imperialism nor nationalism has come to
   an end.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ELECTIONS PUBLIC OPINION AND PARTIES},
Year = {2012},

Abstract = {This paper assesses the explanatory power of rival models of voting
   behavior in the 2010 elections for the U.S. House of Representatives.
   Multivariate analyses of data gathered in a 2008-10 national panel
   survey indicate that a combination of national-level valence and
   positional issues had strong effects on the choices voters made.
   Campaigning in 2008 during the biggest financial crisis since the Great
   Depression, Barack Obama had boldly reiterated the mantra ``Change You
   Can Believe In{''} to propel his successful race for the presidency.
   There were serious political consequences when the expectations he
   raised went unfulfilled. High unemployment and anaemic growth continued
   to beset the economy in 2010, and the President's landmark health-care
   legislation and policy proposals in areas such as climate change and
   immigration were debated in a context of widespread disappointment with
   his performance. This context enhanced voters' susceptibility to
   Republican claims that the President's policies initiatives were
   ill-advised. The result was a politically toxic mix of valence and
   positional issues which corroded Obama's image and worked strongly
   against Democratic candidates.},

Abstract = {Federal political systems come in a variety of forms. In some, regional
   governments exercise considerable policy-making, taxation and
   administrative power. Other systems have a mixture of local units-some
   having limited policy-making and administrative powers, others having
   fairly extensive policy-making and administrative authority. Still other
   federal states have developed in ways that allow territorial diversity
   within fairly strong structures, principles and floors that are devised
   by the central government to ensure a unity of services across different
   regional governing units. For members of the European Union these levels
   of governance are overlaid by a further level of governance, expressed
   though directives, regulations, and benchmarking exercises developed in
   Brussels. It is this multilayered environment that creates both
   opportunities and issues when it comes to policy learning and policy
   transfer-not least, what is the difference between the two concepts.
   This article will attempt to highlight the problems that emerge as a
   result of this diversity in federal systems, offering possible ways
   forward.},

Journal = {REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ESTUDOS POLITICOS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {104},
Pages = {263-289},
Month = {JAN-JUN},
Abstract = {Despite the contribution consolidated in different periods of the
   nineteenth century, the study of political economy of the tax remained
   for a long time restricted to the classical approach of Say, Smith and
   Ricardo, among others. In fact, classical political economy has examined
   the impact of taxes on production, circulation and distribution of
   wealth but has not considered further transformations of the State and
   its functions after the Industrial Revolution. The split between the
   minimal State and the interventionist State opened a new phase in its
   relations with the market. In the base of new State, the tax was the
   connection needed to interact economic, political and social, thus
   giving a new perspective to the political economy of tax. However, this
   new dimension of tax was not perceived immediately. Gilpin has defined
   the nature of political economy would be facing a general understanding
   of social change, emphasizing the interaction between social, economic
   and political. In turn, Schumpeter noted that the origin and evolution
   of the fiscal State is related to the economy and social change.
   Consequently, if the two concepts are related, it becomes possible to
   justify the basis for a political economy of tax, the main object of
   this work.},

Abstract = {Children in ``Need of Care{''} and ``Dangerous Children{''}: Expertise
   and Racial Differentiation in South Africa, 1937-1976
   Laurent FOURCHARD
   In the second half of the 1930s, South Africa implemented a new
   legislation with the intention of rehabilitating rather than punishing
   children. This article examines the role of a new set of experts in
   shaping this law and the effects of its implementation on the racial and
   social differentiation of children. It interrogates the meaning of
   change of a liberal public action in a context dominated by increasing
   racial discriminations. While the law set the conditions for a more
   systematic intervention of the state into the daily life of poor
   families, successive governments favored an individualization of
   treatment for white children as well as collectivization of sanctions
   for the black majority. This turnaround of public action came to be
   reinforced under the apartheid regime by disciplinary measures and by
   the triumph of a localized version of the Chicago School's notions of
   social disorganization. This change contributed to the widespread use of
   violence among black children in socializing them to the harsh
   environment of prison and children's institutions.},

Abstract = {At the European level, we notice that the young migrant football players
   have often to face practices which are not complying with the European
   legislation in terms of immigration, as long as ethic principles for the
   Council of Europe. In the context of a new connection between the
   European Union and the Council of Europe since the entry into force of
   the Lisbon's Treaty on December 1st 2009, our survey will aim at
   comprehending what is at stake in a new European migration's policy
   toward the young professional sportsmen. An analysis carried out from
   the migration's issue will allow us to understand the main questions of
   these crossroad and trans-national spaces where institutions, social
   groups and agents, among whom strategies and resources result, for the
   main part, from other structured social fields and which are contingent
   on the interests of groups and specific national stories, are in
   confrontation.},

Abstract = {Discipline and cohesiveness of political parties are essential for
   legislatures to engage in policy-making. Parties in Brazil have
   historically been considered ideologically weak and uninvolved in policy
   issues of national importance. Analyses of roll-call votes, however,
   have shown that parties can be disciplined government supporters. This
   paper tests the claim that Brazilian parties have also become
   programmatic actors in their own right. The paper uses statutory
   delegation content to test whether voting discipline translates into
   greater influence on the substance of legislation. The data analysis
   shows that party unity among parties of the government coalition does
   not affect statutory content. Opposition parties, by contrast, are more
   likely to reduce the executive's discretion when they are more unified.
   Overall, the support for the hypothesis of programmatic parties is weak,
   given that executive authorship is the strongest determinant of
   statutory content.},

Abstract = {This chapter takes up one of the fundamental democratic issues raised in
   Chapter 1: who are the people to whom governments ought to be
   responsible? The development of three levels of government in Australia
   and the fragmentation of local government have meant that this question
   has been answered in ways that are often unproductive for good
   metropolitan governance. This issue clearly has a strong institutional
   dimension (Chapter 2), which the chapter explores. The attitudes and
   behaviours of citizens contribute to the problems identified here (see
   Chapter 3), as do deep inequalities revealed in, for example, the
   displacement of Aboriginal people as Australian cities expand (see
   Chapter 4). These problems also might be understood through the
   circulation of discourses around `the bush' and `world cities' (see
   Chapter 5). The `world cities' concept reminds us of the growing
   connections between local and international politics (see Chapter 6).},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF GENOCIDE RESEARCH},

Pages = {187-213},
Abstract = {The 2005-inaugurated new historical museum of Yad Vashem in Jerusalem is
   one of the most significant and influential global Holocaust memorial
   sites of the twenty-first century. At the same time, it is also a very
   local Israeli `lieu de me `moire'. This essay explores the interactions
   between these two levels of representation while suggesting a critical
   analysis of the museum's narrative. I contend that for various cultural
   and political reasons this museum encourages most of all identification
   with the Jewish victims. This morally necessary and very much justified
   empathy is achieved, however, in a way that blocks almost any nuanced
   historical understanding of the event. Thus by melancholic means the
   museum suppresses any `otherness' that would make the story of the Shoah
   more complex, interrupt in the melodramatic processes of identification,
   and destabilize the identity of the Western (individual and collective)
   self.},

Abstract = {Mental health and illness are issues that are increasingly in relevance
   for society and impacting the national economy. This development denotes
   the dire necessity for further research in the field of social
   psychiatry. The present article examines whether the sociology of Pierre
   Bourdieu can provide a theoretical foundation for social psychiatry and
   its multiple research questions. On the one hand, the integration of the
   theoretical aspects of Bourdieu's sociology can improve the relationship
   between sociology and social psychiatry. On the other hand, the
   considerations of Bourdieu can be associated with the findings and
   concepts of ``traditional{''}, medical-biological psychiatry. However,
   Bourdieu's approach does not jeopardize social psychiatry's critical
   potential. It is presumed that the theoretical concepts of ``habitus{''}
   and ``capital{''} in particular are of great significance for future
   research in social psychiatry.},

Abstract = {The study of religion holds great promise for the study of identity,
   institutional origins, the state, and the strategies of institutional
   actors in comparative politics. Doctrinal differences translate into
   distinct patterns of state institutions, economic performance, and
   policy preferences. Religious attachments affect voting and popular
   mobilization. Churches can become powerful institutional players that
   lobby, influence policy, and form effective coalitions with both secular
   and denominational partners. Finally, natural religious monopolies and
   (conversely) resolutely secular countries show how churches have played
   a central role in the struggle of nations and states. The relationship
   is thus mutual: religion influences political attitudes and
   institutions, and politics affects religious practice and political
   activity.},

Title = {Reinventing prevention or exposing the gap? False positives in UK
   terrorism governance and the quest for pre-emption},
Journal = {CRITICAL STUDIES ON TERRORISM},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {69-87},
Abstract = {This article considers the developments within UK counterterrorism
   strategy between the Prevention of Terrorism Acts (PTAs) and the recent
   (2011) reworking of CONTEST. It argues that the performance of
   prevention within British counterterrorism policy has changed to favour
   pre-emptive measures, deployed in accordance with knowledge produced
   about terrorism `risk'. However, this shift has been accompanied by the
   continuation of certain practices of pre-emption. The article integrates
   the studies of `suspect communities' created by counterterrorism
   practices into its discussion of risk, elucidating how the production of
   risky subjectivities has enabled the practice of `preventative' force
   upon both Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA) and contemporary
   terrorist suspects. The article focuses on these articulations of risky
   communities, highlighting how they lead to `false positives' in the
   identification of terrorists and the use of sovereign force (like the
   death of Jean Charles de Menezes or the assassination of PIRA suspects
   in Gibraltar) by painting certain racial characteristics and behaviours
   as imminently dangerous. The article connects the production of suspect
   communities to the presence of pre-emptive logics within
   counterterrorism discourse, logics that have consistently produced a
   `gap' between the terrorist event and its pre-emption, between the
   suspect community and the figure of the terrorist, then. This `gap'
   leads to the use of force upon innocent persons - who are temporarily
   rendered guilty by visualities of `suspectness'. As such, the apparent
   novelty of pre-emptive terrorism governance within British policy
   framing does not reflect a similar discontinuity in the practice of
   counterterrorism then - which has consistently deployed suspect
   communities and produced ` false positives' within a politics of
   pre-emption.},

Volume = {29},
Pages = {327-337},
Abstract = {This paper is a constitutional analysis, but also a political science
   analysis, of reforms on the German Constitution since 1949. This
   analysis concluded that in many cases it has been more constitutional <<
   mutations >> than formal reforms, and that it is difficult to
   distinguish both kind of changes. Due to the number of reforms and its
   effects, it is possible to consider that the German Constitution is a
   flexible constitution: the special majority required is not a real
   obstacle to the parliament decision; and the decision to reform the
   constitution and an ordinary decision are very similar, therefore there
   is a serious rift between constituent process and reform process.},

Journal = {BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES OF TERRORISM AND POLITICAL AGGRESSION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {4},

Abstract = {In social science research on terrorism, there is a continued lack of
   individual-level, data-driven evidence to test hypotheses, build
   reliable case studies, and support the emergence of new theories about
   the psychological process in the development of the terrorist. To help
   redress this deficiency, this article calls for explicit discussion of
   researchers' reluctance either to interview terrorists or share their
   experiences of having done so, as well as greater methodological
   transparency in their efforts. It identifies and explores a series of
   challenges in interviewing participants in political violence and argues
   for greater future engagement from social science researchers, and
   psychologists in particular. If both behavioral and interdisciplinary
   research on terrorism is to achieve its extraordinary potential,
   students and scholars of terrorism must do more than simply `talk' to
   terrorists. They must be open to comparing experiences in an attempt to
   remove the novelty associated with research interviews with terrorists,
   be more explicit about their methods, and thereby explore interviewing
   as a scientifically viable method of collecting data in an area that for
   so long has suffered the failure of not doing so.},

   next generation of informed, engaged citizens for our democracy''
   (American Association of State Colleges and Universities {[}AASCU] 2003,
   1). Many institutions have fulfilled this mandate by becoming
   educational partners with Debate Watch, a program of the Commission on
   Presidential Debates. In this research, we describe a project aimed to
   generate youth voter interest in and knowledge about the 2008 election.
   Recalling the McLuhan (1964) truism ``the medium is the message,'' we
   shift the study from message content to message form when attempting to
   engage students in the political process. In particular, we describe the
   impact of combining discussions about presidential debates with a
   festival format to see what impact the form had in student civic
   engagement. We conclude that a festival format contributes greatly to
   the success of the Debate Watch event.},

Abstract = {Citizens differ in the extent to which they participate politically, and
   the extent citizens participate plays an important role in the
   representation of their needs and preferences. Thus, the identification
   of factors shaping how and how much citizens participate is important.
   It has been established that citizens who are generally informed about
   politics tend to engage more extensively in various modes of democratic
   participation than less informed citizens. However, the effect of
   specific political knowledge on individual's participation behaviour
   still marks a deficit in political research. The present article
   investigates this matter by distinguishing different types of
   participants as well as different dimensions of political knowledge. The
   results suggest that knowledge of political actors is an important
   factor for being a voter while knowledge of the rules of the game is of
   particular importance when it comes to being a more active type of
   participant. These results have important implications for explaining
   differences in political participation and measuring political
   knowledge. Acta Politica (2012) 47, 42-66. doi:10.1057/ap.2011.20;

Abstract = {Transatlantic international relations (IR) theory has more or less
   neglected the international relations of East Asia. This relative
   neglect has come in different forms: excluding East Asian cases from
   analysis, including East Asian cases but miscoding or misunderstanding
   them, or including them but missing the fact that they do not confirm
   the main findings of the study. A review of the East Asia-related
   literature on three important clusters of theorizing-structural theories
   of conflict, institutional design and efficacy, and historical
   memory-suggests that this neglect of the region ( and other regions) may
   come at a cost to transatlantic IR, not only in terms of data problems
   but also in terms of omitted or downplayed explanatory variables and
   theoretical arguments.},

Abstract = {Indigenous movements as well as social movements against megaprojects
   like dams, mining projects and the cultivation of sugar cane and palm
   oil for the production of agro sprit, have been very active in postwar
   Guatemala. During the last ten years, however, a shift from claims for
   identity issues to an increased defense of natural resources can be
   observed. In Guatemala, the intensified struggle for maintaining the
   living environment, which can be monitored in all of Latin America,
   resorts to a posited opposition between indigenous and western
   approaches to life. Indigenous movements, since the end of the civil
   war, best tit the theoretical concept of new social movements, yet the
   concept, coined among others by Alain Touraine, can only be applied in a
   limited way and is only conditionally useful for explaining social
   processes in Guatemala.},

Abstract = {Based on examinations of counter-terrorism discourses in Britain and the
   Netherlands, this article argues that official security narratives tend
   to hinder efforts to counter far-right violence and can provide
   opportunities for far-right groups to advance their own agendas. Western
   European governments narrate issues of multiculturalism and radical
   Islamism in ways that overlap with farright ideology, providing
   opportunities for far-right groups to appropriate official security
   discourse and thereby legitimise themselves to new audiences.},

Abstract = {Terrorism risk assessment and management involves a unique set of
   modeling challenges. A special problem is that the expertise required to
   address those challenges lies divided between two communities: risk
   assessment modelers working in the probabilistic risk assessment
   paradigm, and subject matter experts ({''}SMEs{''}) working in terrorist
   psychology. SMEs don't fully understand what Modelers bring to the
   table, and Modelers don't fully understand what SMEs bring to the table.
   The two cultures sit at different tables, unable to communicate
   effectively, and the nation comes out behind. This article takes the
   form of a dialogue between a Modeler and a SME, describing the different
   perspectives of modelers and SMEs. We discover critical modeling
   shortfalls arising from the differing world views of those two cultures.
   Out of our dialogue, we develop a solution in the form of a new modeling
   paradigm, based on combining the relative strengths of the two
   communities.},

Abstract = {Croatia's accession to NATO, and soon the European Union, presupposes
   that its intelligence system has already been the subject of in-depth
   reforms based on sound democratic and human rights principles and the
   rule of law. Has this, in fact, been the case? This article answers this
   question and in doing so breaks down the intelligence reforms undertaken
   into three distinct phases. It concludes that changes in governance,
   organization, oversight, and accountability, along with pressures to
   join European institutions, have helped Croatia develop an intelligence
   system increasingly respectful of democratic norms, human rights, and
   the rule of law.},

Journal = {NATIONAL IDENTITIES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {39-51},
Abstract = {This article examines the nature of national identity as held by
   political elites within Scotland. Through an examination of interview
   data collected from over 60 members of the elected political elite
   within Scotland, questions such as `what is Scottishness?', `who can be
   Scottish?', and `what boundaries to belonging exist in Scotland?', are
   addressed. It begins by considering mass survey data concerning such
   questions, and then compares the results from elite interviews. The
   article concludes by highlighting the differences that emerge between
   the mass and elite conceptions of Scottishness today.},

Abstract = {This article explores forms of territorial appropriation and spatial
   practices in the archipelago of San Bernardo (Bolivar, Colombia). Our
   aim is to describe and analyze the forms in which the Islet's
   inhabitants -the island where a major part of the population in the
   archipelago lives- appropriate themselves, organize and interact with
   their insular and continental environment by means of contacts with the
   different territories. This set of practices and relations represent
   what we call islander space (espacio isleno).},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL CRITICAL THOUGHT},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {2},
Number = {4},
Pages = {456-471},
Abstract = {This paper borrows from Arendt's analysis in her 1969 essay `On
   violence' to make an intervention in the debates about violence that
   have arisen in relation to new political movements such as Occupy Wall
   Street. While Arendt was writing against a tendency to overestimate the
   political value of violence, this paper argues against a current
   tendency to overvalue non-violence in the same manner. In both cases the
   point turns on Arendt's argument that the true source of political power
   is not to be found in one strategy or another, but rather in collective
   action as such. The ultimate value of Arendt's account of politics as
   collective action is that it shows how freedom can be operative in
   conditions of constraint, which is particularly relevant for
   contemporary movements facing state repression.},

   We argue that the critics are unconvincing about: (a) the institutional

   talk and practices in ordinary life; and (c) the allegation that rights
   talk undermines community, which remains a poorly specified and
   implicitly inegalitarian standard. Our argument is developed on the
   basis of sociolegal theory and empirical study over the last several
   decades.},

Abstract = {In its resolution 1975 (2011), the United Nations security council
   opened the way for the provision of decisive support to the forces close
   to Alassane Ouattara to win the Ivorian power struggle. The deployed
   peacekeepers had a mandate ``to protect civilians under imminent threat
   of physical violence.{''} A second reason frequently given was the
   necessary enforcement of the popular will expressed during the
   presidential elections in 2010. Ever since a low-intensity civil war
   broke out in September 2002, the different military engagements by
   various international players were justified by (1) protection concerns
   and/or (2) the preservation of democratic achievements. In the end, the
   justification of intervention by the ``protection of civilians{''}
   argument received a larger consensus than the democratic norm. This
   article compares changing justifications for intervention with real
   achievements.},

Title = {Indonesia's democratic stagnation: anti-reformist elites and resilient
   civil society},
Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {19},
Number = {2},
Pages = {209-229},
Abstract = {As Egypt and Tunisia begin difficult democratic transitions, comparative
   political scientists have pointed to the world's largest Muslim nation,
   Indonesia, as a role model. Seen as a stand-out exception from the
   global recession of democracy in the pre-2011 period, Indonesia has been
   praised as an example of a stable post-authoritarian polity. But a
   closer look at Indonesia's record in recent years reveals that its
   democratization is stagnating. As this article demonstrates, there have
   been several attempts to roll back reforms introduced in the late 1990s
   and early 2000s. While not all of these attempts have been successful,
   Indonesia's democratic consolidation is now frozen at 2005-2006 levels.
   However, the reason for this democratic stasis, the article argues, is
   not related to Diamond's notion of societal dissatisfaction with bad
   post-authoritarian governance. Opinion polls clearly show continued
   support for democracy despite citizen disgruntlement over the
   effectiveness of governance. Instead, I contend that anti-reformist
   elites are the main forces behind the attempted roll back, with civil
   society emerging as democracy's most important defender. This insight,
   in turn, questions the wisdom of the decision by foreign development
   agencies - in Indonesia, but other countries as well - to reduce their
   support for non-governmental organizations and instead intensify their
   cooperation with government.},

Abstract = {Quality of democracy can be evaluated by observing the performance of
   its different dimensions. In this paper I argue that most important
   dimension such as rule of law, electoral accountability,
   inter-institutional accountability, citizen participation and a
   competitive party system are closely interrelated. The starting point to
   analyze the relation among these concepts and its impact to democratic
   quality is the dimension of accountability in its two versions. The
   empirical analysis developed in eight Eastern European countries shows
   which factors explain the effective implementation of the different
   dimensions. Variation among regime type are due to the higher or lower
   presence of each dimension, with wide possibilities for different
   combinations, and this helps us to identify different types of hybrid
   regimes.},

Abstract = {This article inquires into the ideological vision of Hasan al-Banna
   (1906-1949), one of the most influential figures of Islamist thought. By
   assuming a discourse theory perspective, I argue that al-Banna's
   Islamist discourse was genealogically caught between a traditional
   pan-Islamic vocation and modern ways of articulating political
   discourse, such as nationalism and Arab nationalism. Following the
   traumatic encounter between tradition and modernity that colonialism
   enacted, al-Banna increasingly integrated and valourized modern national
   `signifiers', downplaying early universalistic ethos. This denoted a
   growing reliance on the language of modernity over the language of
   tradition, though such reliance was instrumental to al-Banna's
   anti-imperialist political project, entailing the very preservation of
   tradition as a moderator principle in the appropriation of modernity.},

Abstract = {Iranians have experienced some democratic movements during the last
   fifteen years, but they did not succeed in establishing democracy in the
   country. However, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) has
   increasingly played an undeniable role in different fields of Iran's
   society, particularly after the war with Iraq in the early 1990s.
   Additionally, Iran's political economy, based on oil revenue, helped the
   center of power to support the IRGC and the government. In this article,
   we discuss about the relationship between the government and IRGC, and
   moreover we conclude that this condition plays an obstacle role for
   democracy in Iran.},

Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE PEACE \& SECURITY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {24},
Number = {3},
Pages = {405-424},
Abstract = {This article argues that the increasingly frequent and robust
   implementation of the Responsibility to Protect (RtoP) principle
   reflects not only the operation of the functionally narrow doctrine of
   humanitarian intervention, but also the emergence of a new paradigm of
   global security, namely sovereignty-building. RtoP protects populations
   from mass atrocity crimes, supports and builds responsible sovereigns
   committed to protecting their populations, and restrains `irresponsible'
   sovereigns. These functions of RtoP perfectly capture the
   sovereignty-building paradigm. This article will draw upon the
   philosophical literature on sovereignty, the analysis of the norm
   development of RtoP, and empirical evidence of the UN Security Council's
   deliberations on the situation in Libya in 2011 to argue that the image
   of responsible sovereignty featured in RtoP is composed of three
   aspects: popular, spontaneous and indivisible sovereignty. That image is
   projected on states in the implementation of RtoP, and constitutes the
   teleological objective of the emerging paradigm of sovereignty-building,
   which can be distinguished from the traditional doctrines of
   state-building and humanitarian intervention.},

Abstract = {The reactions of metropolitan political elites to the recent electoral
   successes of Scottish Nationalists have been broadly negative; arguments
   for independence have been characterised in domestic United Kingdom
   terms and thereafter dismissed as voluntaristic, atavistic and
   indulgent. This is an error: the end of the comfortable certainties of
   the cold war has revealed a complex pattern of ever-changing structural
   relationships within which discrete polities must make their way; these
   changes have given us the European Union, an unfolding project, and as
   structural change in Europe runs through Scotland local agents must read
   and react with an eye to the future. Arguments for independence are
   rational; critics may disagree with such proposals, but it would be
   sensible to consider them directly. Those inclined to dismissal may
   neglect good argument today and store up unpleasant surprises for
   themselves tomorrow.},

Title = {Peace-building and democracy promotion in Afghanistan: the Afghanistan
   Peace and Reintegration Programme and reconciliation with the Taliban},
Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {19},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {553-574},
Abstract = {Democracy and peace are commonly promoted as concomitant objectives in
   war-torn societies; however, the underlying assumption of the
   convergence of these two goals often proves problematic in practice,
   leading to conflict and ineffective intervention. This contribution
   focuses on the connections between democracy and peace-building in
   Afghanistan, through the lens of the Afghanistan Peace and Reintegration
   Programme (APRP). It finds that in this case, the two aims have not
   always complemented one another, resulting instead in multiple
   trade-offs and disputes. The article demonstrates how a better
   understanding of the connections between democracy and peace can help
   improve the efficacy and legitimacy of interventions of this type. Some
   elements of the APRP strategy are context-appropriate and do enhance the
   potential for more substantive democracy and peace: for example, the
   National Community Recovery plan, centrepiece of the third stage of the
   process, which aims to enfranchise former insurgents and their
   communities through mechanisms of local government, emphasizing
   consultation and enhancing participation. However, the argument here is
   that the complexity of the insurgency, the lack of coherent
   communication within and between international and local actors, the
   ambiguity surrounding the meaning of democracy, and the failure to
   pursue genuine reconciliation have all served to undermine the dual
   objectives of the APRP initiative.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE EDUCATION},

Volume = {8},

Pages = {69-84},
Abstract = {Institutions of higher learning are increasingly asked to defend
   curricular and pedagogical outcomes. Faculty must demonstrate that
   simulations are productive tools for learning, but a review of the
   literature shows that the evidence of their effectiveness is
   inconclusive, despite their popularity in the classroom. Simulations may
   in fact help students learn, but the pedagogical benefits of simulations
   may be being attributed too generally to the learning environments that
   they supposedly produce, rather than the specific learning modalities
   that occur within them. The article concludes with a recommendation that
   educators choose particular learning techniques first and then build
   simulations around these techniques, rather than the reverse.},

Abstract = {The Twelfth of July is the unofficial `national day' of Northern Irish
   Protestantism, and has often been characterised as highly sectarian and
   divisive. Research on the Twelfth has concentrated on the parades and on
   the Troubles period; assertions about the Twelfth and its rhetoric in
   the post-war, pre-Troubles era have often been based on little more than
   assumption. This article attempts to fill this gap by examining speeches
   made at Twelfth of July gatherings in Northern Ireland from 1954 to
   1962. It will show that the dominant theme of the speeches was the
   threat to Ulster Protestants and their state from the Irish Republic,
   republicans such as the IRA and Sinn Fein, and from the Catholic Church.
   Orange and Unionist leaders used this sense of threat to discourage
   division and dissent within Ulster Protestantism. Although Irish
   nationalism and Catholicism were consistently presented as threatening,
   the amount of blatant sectarianism was much less than might be assumed.
   Northern Catholics were rarely attacked directly, and some Twelfth
   speakers argued specifically for better relations with Catholics.},

Journal = {ASIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {20},
Number = {2},
Pages = {109-128},
Abstract = {This article uses evidence from the Ganges Water Dispute to explore the
   relationship between liberal international relations theory and
   international law. As such, this article addresses one of the primary
   questions in international law: why do states agree to international
   law? The Ganges Water Dispute between Bangladesh and India lasted 40
   years and was concluded with the sudden creation of the Ganges Water
   Treaty in 1996. This article argues that liberal international relations
   theory is of most use in understanding the surprising creation of this
   treaty, as opposed to the more conventional approaches to international
   law such as institutionalism or constructivism, because it takes into
   consideration the role of regime type, domestic politics, and
   transnational interactions. In particular, Bangladesh's transition to a
   liberal state in the early 1990s, elections in both India and
   Bangladesh, and pressure from the pending creation of a UN water treaty
   facilitated the creation of the Ganges Water Treaty. While the
   literature on water conflicts suggests that this treaty should not have
   been created, liberal theory, by focusing on the interactive nature of
   domestic and international politics, points out the reasons for the
   successful creation of the treaty.},

Abstract = {Brazil's redemocratization had a strong impact on the foreign policy of
   the country, bringing closer social policy and the international
   cooperation agenda, especially in issues like food security and public
   health. However, there are resistances in the Ministry of External
   Relations concerning citizen participation in diplomacy and the
   decisions about promotion and defense of democracy have been
   contradictories and unstable. At the same time, the stronger presence of
   Brazilian social movements in transnational networks changed the
   political struggle in themes like the environment and human rights, with
   local groups searching for foreign allies to balance their domestic
   weakness.},

Pages = {187-214},
Abstract = {This paper constructs formal stochastic models of the elections in
   Georgia in 2008 and in Azerbaijan in 2010. The models include various
   kinds of valence, where valence is defined as being associated with the
   non-policy considerations involving the electoral perceptions of party
   leaders. Valences can be (i) exogenous, held by all members of the
   electorate, giving an estimate of the perceived ``quality{''} of the
   political leaders, and empirically estimated by the intercepts in a
   spatial model; (ii) sociodemographic, associated with the various
   propensities of subgroups in the polity to choose one candidate over
   another.
   We consider logit models of electoral choice, involving these valences,
   as well as spatial components derived from policy differences between
   voters' and candidates' positions. We compute the ``equilibrium{''} vote
   maximizing positions of the candidates or parties in the two elections
   and show that these involved divergence from the electoral center.
   We argue that oppositional candidates faced different political
   quandaries in the two countries. In Georgia the opposition candidates
   had low valences and were associated with relatively non-centrist policy
   positions. In Azerbaijan the survey we used indicates that there was a
   degree of political apathy, due to the perception that the election
   would not be democratic. This made it difficult for opposition
   candidates to offer credible political competition to the dominant party
   of the president.},

   culture, religion and nations. Its policy is very important for the EU,
   as well. Especially security and migration issues are important. The
   coordination between the EU and the UMA is important for common future.
   There are some examples of cooperation of the UMA and the other
   international organisation, like the UNESCO. There are some problems,
   especially rate of democracy in Maghreb and the bad cooperation between
   its states. The UMA is a little known organisation but its development
   can influence the European issues. The Spanish presidency of the EU
   wants to improve Euro - Mediterranean development. But the real impact
   we will see in the future.},

Abstract = {Evidence that political attitudes and behavior are in part biologically
   and even genetically instantiated is much discussed in political science
   of late. Yet the classic twin design, a primary source of evidence on
   this matter, has been criticized for being biased toward finding genetic
   influence. In this article, we employ a new data source to test
   empirically the alternative, exclusively environmental, explanations for
   ideological similarities between twins. We find little support for these
   explanations and argue that even if we treat them as wholly correct,

   attention to the biological basis of attitudes and behaviors. Our
   analysis suggests that the mainstream socialization paradigm for

Title = {No Going Back? Australian Multiculturalism as a Path-Dependent Process},
Journal = {AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {47},
Number = {4},
Pages = {547-561},
Abstract = {This article evaluates the Gillard Labor government's efforts to revive
   Australian multiculturalism at a time when other liberal democracies
   have declared it a failure. It argues that despite a controversial
   history, Australian multiculturalism has many of the characteristics of
   institutional path dependency, representing a highly contested set of
   policies, programs and norms that evolved in specific historical
   contexts and developed their own self-reinforcing logic. The Australian
   experience offers salient reminders of the difficulties of overturning
   the social and political consequences of immigration decisions made long
   ago. The general success of multiculturalism as a migrant-integration
   strategy suggests that it may be the best available option for
   liberal-democratic governments to manage the politics of cultural
   diversity in the 21st century. There is a need, however, for governments
   to renew their commitment to migrant rights and equity.},

Abstract = {In 1941, the very concept of a Czechoslovakian state was a parlous one:
   the provisions of the 1938 Munich Agreement, which had dismembered the
   pre-war state, had not yet been annulled. The position of the
   Czechoslovakian goverment-in-exile among the Allies was weak. The exiled
   president, Eduard Benes, therefore proposed a bold plan to assassinate a
   key Nazi leader and challenge a perception of Czech passivity under
   occupation. While the plan did succeed, it came at a terrible human
   cost. But, for Benes, it secured the pre-1938 borders of Czechoslovakia.},

Title = {On the Electoral Relevance of Education Policy in the German Lander},
Journal = {GERMAN POLITICS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {21},
Number = {4},
Pages = {444-463},
Abstract = {Education policy in Germany experienced a boom throughout the 2000s.
   Numerous reforms were implemented, quite far-reaching shifts of party
   programmes occurred, and the scope of institutions with an educational
   mandate widened considerably. At the same time, Landtag elections came
   to be seen as less dominated by federal politics. Yet we still know
   little about education policy's electoral relevance. The present
   article, following a most-likely design, analyses those five Landtag
   elections that were held since the reform of federalism in 2006 for
   which the importance of education policy ought to have been highest. It
   turns out that even though education is one of the very few policies
   which the Lander can decide upon autonomously, and despite the recent
   upsurge of regional factors in determining the outcomes of such
   second-order elections, nearly all Landtag elections are won or lost on
   other battlefields.},

Abstract = {In the academic literature the European Union (EU) is analysed from
   different theoretical perspectives. Taking the perspective of
   international relations, the EU emerges as an international organization
   or a confederation; on the other hand, looking from the perspective of
   comparative politics, the EU presents itself as a more integrated
   entity, a federation, a quasi-state or a state in the making. The recent
   perspective, i.e. the governance school, sees the EU as an original
   structure, a sui generis entity, a new, emerging system of governance
   without government. However, at the present stage of development, the EU
   reveals features that are characteristic for the federal structure, i.e.
   the federal political system characterised by two leading models of dual
   and cooperative federalism, hence the comparative method seems to be the
   most appropriate as a research tool.},

Journal = {POLITICKE VEDY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {15},
Number = {4},
Pages = {83-94},
Abstract = {The information transferred by the media has a great influence on
   people's choices, hierarchy of values, belief on personal success, or
   failure. The media play various roles for the individual sectors of
   life. For the political systems they are in the first place an
   instrument for the fight for the authority; for the economic system they
   are mainly an area of economic activity, whereas the receivers treat
   them as a source of entertainment. Ubiquity, and wide influence on the
   reality which the media have causes that it is important in whose hands
   they are, which values they represent, and in whose interest are they
   doing it. The author critically refers to the contemporary role of
   media. Characterising the literature he refers among others to Noam
   Chomsky, who states that media in the first place manipulate the
   society: private media act in the interest of advertisers and owners;
   state ones strengthen the ruling class. In his article the author
   presents how information and manipulation appear in the media, if we
   follow their objectives in liberal, Marxist, and according to the
   hegemonic theory depictions. To conclude, the author doesn't try to
   measure how much reliable information and how much manipulation there is
   in a particular medium, but points out that following the media of
   authoritarian states one may have an impression that time has stopped,
   whereas ``the information blizzard{''} constitutes inherent feature of
   democratic societies. To make possible the development of those
   societies, the media shouldn't yield to the temptation of manipulation,
   but have to provide the reliable information.},

Abstract = {Carolina Piparo was shot a few minutes after withdrawing cash from a
   bank branch. This case outraged the public opinion because she was eight
   months pregnant at the moment of the assault. She had to undergo a
   caesarean section and her baby only survived one week. Through an
   exploratory and inductive research we will analyze how the Argentine
   news papers presented the case. We aim at elaborating a content analysis
   code book that can be validated in future similar researches on the
   subject. We apply the Framing theory in order to detect the frames used
   in the news coverage and to observe if they are compatible with the idea
   of ``moral panic{''} proposed by Stanley Cohen.},

Abstract = {A liberal paradigm shift from state to private responsibility in old age
   income protection has been a general development across Western Europe.
   The financial crisis sheds new light on the question of the
   public-private divide in pension policy. Applying convention theory, the
   analysis reviews how funded pensions are governed and how states use a
   range of regulation to control their operations as they seek to convert
   market-related practices to social policy purposes. The article argues
   that accruing state regulation consequent on coping with the financial
   crisis and its aftermath has undermined easy distinctions between public
   and private schemes, and is generating increasingly technocratic and
   oligarchic forms of pension governance, to the detriment of democratic
   debate on pensions.},

Abstract = {This article contributes to the body of the developing theoretical
   research in leadership and presidential studies by adding analysis of
   what I have termed `comportmental style' as a factor in leader/follower
   relations. Within institutionalism and the wider structure/agency debate
   in political science, one of the challenges as regards the study of
   leadership is to identify factors that offer scope to or else militate
   against leaders' performance. The comportmental style of Nicolas Sarkozy
   (President of the French Republic 2007-2012), deployed in the context of
   the - changing - institution of the presidency, was a major factor in
   his extreme unpopularity, and contributed to his defeat in 2012. What
   this tells us about the nature of the changing French presidency and the
   role of style will be discussed in the conclusion.},

Abstract = {Chile altered its electoral rules for municipal elections in 2002. The
   new rules separated mayoral and council member elections, and while the
   latter continue to use proportional representation, mayors are now
   chosen based on plurality. These changes serve as a natural test of the
   effects of electoral rules on women's political representation. The
   Chilean case demonstrates (1) that electoral reform is gendered, (2)
   that women's representation is shaped by both formal and informal rules,
   and (3) that electoral rules have different effects on mayoral and
   council member positions, demonstrating that the ``glass ceiling{''} for
   executive positions is harder to crack.},

Abstract = {Most Americans would like to believe that no person is above the law.
   When President Richard M. Nixon claimed such powers, he was driven from
   office. When President George W. Bush authorized the torture of
   prisoners, that abuse was viewed as an aberration. But, as this article
   documents, President Barack Obama is squarely in the Nixon-Bush
   tradition of presidential power. In shielding the torturers from
   prosecution, he has preserved kidnapping and torture as options, while
   asserting unreviewable authority to assassinate foreigners and American
   citizens by remote controlled drones. These developments have
   transformed the American presidency into a modern version of the Stuart
   monarchies, at least where allegations of national security are
   concerned.},

Abstract = {This article contributes to the understanding of the organizational
   structures of peronism, Argentine dominant political force, on the basis
   of a study on partisan appointments. It presents the main findings of a
   research on the scope, the workings, the motivations, and the criteria
   of partisan appointments in the Argentine state, with particular
   attention to Nestor Kirchner administration (2003-2007). The more
   general argument contends that appointments became in this period a
   crucial tool to control the state apparatus while, at the same time,
   they made it possible to renovate Peronist partisan elites under the
   leadership of the president. The data, obtained from a large series of
   expert interviews, make it possible to offer a new theoretical framework
   for the understanding of party-government linkages in contemporary
   Argentine democracy.},

   democracy, guaranteeing the safeguard of citizens individual and social
   rights. Each institution is governed by structures, which have specific
   functions concerning its internal structure, organization and
   administration but also the specific mission which is requested to carry
   out, in accordance with the existing legal framework as provided in the
   Constitution, laws, regulations acts, in the legal opinions issued by
   the Judicial and Prosecutorial Authorities as also in the legal opinions
   issued by the Council of the State.
   In order to be achieved the above there are many institutions which
   performed - carrying out mainly police duties such as Hellenic Police
   (HP), Hellenic Coast Guard (HCG), Municipality Police, etc. These
   institutions and more specifically HP and HCG and in particular, their
   mission, role, act and their internal administration mechanisms, have
   been and are often subjected of social criticism but also sometimes
   subject of social approval.},

Abstract = {In the absence of comprehensive national immigration legislation, the
   debate over immigration has devolved to the states. Scholars have
   studied why states adopt punitive policies toward immigrants and why
   states differ in their treatment of immigrants. However, none has sought
   to analyze the transformation from an integration to a punitive policy
   regime. From 1996 to 2005, Oklahoma pursued an integration police regime
   designed to welcome immigrants and promote their social integration. In
   2007, Oklahoma reversed its stance and has since pursued a punitive
   policy regime designed to make life difficult for unauthorized
   immigrants and to encourage them to leave. We contend that a
   longitudinal analysis of immigrant policy making within a single state
   provides a richer and more dynamic understanding of the interplay of
   state political institutions, societal interests, policy narratives, and
   the national political environment in making policy than analyzing the
   differences between states at a single point in time.},

Abstract = {Using digital text analysis methods, we analyze over 3800 newspaper
   articles covering U.S. Supreme Court judicial appointments between 1981
   and 2009 to measure the level of (in)congruence between the Court's
   agenda and the issues emphasized by the media. We find that newspapers
   highlight ``culture war{''} issues at the expense of other important
   issues addressed much more frequently by the Court. Moreover, abortion
   in particular receives attention in more articles and in much greater
   depth than any other issue. With a few minor deviations, these patterns
   are consistent across nominations. These findings raise normative
   concerns regarding the didactic function of the print media in American
   democracy and shed empirical light on positive theories of media
   behavior.},

Abstract = {Incumbents tend to win with higher margins in less ideologically
   constrained districts. I argue that incumbents are advantaged by this
   electoral landscape in part because they work harder to cultivate a
   personal vote. Utilizing data on earmarks, I find that despite winning
   with a larger margin of victory, these incumbents act much like their
   colleagues who narrowly escaped electoral defeat. By more accurately
   measuring perceptions of electoral vulnerability, we also see stronger
   evidence linking district marginality to distributive politics. Such
   incentives appear to stem not from the risks of position taking, but
   from the weaker party attachments among constituents.},

   Cost of Governing},
Journal = {GOVERNMENT AND OPPOSITION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {47},
Number = {4},
Pages = {574-596},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Radical right parties are becoming increasingly likely candidates to
   participate in government coalitions in Western Europe. Comparative
   research on the electoral performance of these parties in government is
   still scarce. Our overview of the electoral effects of government
   participation of six parties in national governments shows that they do
   not run a higher risk of losing votes after government participation
   than other parties. There is considerable variation, however. Some
   radical right parties experienced great losses, while others won
   additional support. Focusing on the ways in which radical right parties
   conducted themselves in government, we explore why some parties won
   votes and others lost in post-incumbency elections. We compare their
   policy achievements with regard to immigration and integration policies,
   the performance of their ministers, and the party coherence of the six
   parties in office. Our analysis shows that policy records do not fully
   explain the variation in post-incumbency electoral results. Weak
   performance and internal party conflict prevent parties from credibly
   laying claim to the policy achievements of coalition governments and
   demonstrate that some of these parties were not ready for office.},

Journal = {POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {40},
Number = {5},
Pages = {602-628},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {One of the largest contemporary debates in political theory revolves
   around the question of how pluralists can justify their political
   commitments. Isaiah Berlin, one of the first to face this problem, was a
   self-proclaimed liberal, whose political writings have led to
   controversy. In this essay, I take up the issue of how Berlin's use of
   the essay genre contributes to his defense of liberalism given his
   pluralist beliefs. I argue that while his reliance upon the essay
   generates particular interpretive problems, it need not undermine his
   commitment to liberalism. Rather, Berlin's defense of liberalism
   involves a rhetorical attempt to discredit alternatives to liberalism
   while drawing attention to suggestive ties between history, political
   judgment, and liberalism.},

Abstract = {This article studies gubernatorial midterm slumps in U.S. state
   legislative elections. We employ a regression discontinuity design,
   which allows us to rule out the hypothesis that the midterm slump simply
   reflects a type of reversion to the mean generated by simple partisan
   swings or the withdrawal of gubernatorial coattails or anticipatory
   balancing. Our results show that the party of the governor experiences
   an average seat-share loss of about 3.5 percentage points. We also find
   evidence suggesting that a large share of the variation in gubernatorial
   midterm slumps can be accounted for by (1) crude partisan balancing and
   (2) referendums on state economic performance, with approximately equal
   weight given to each.},

Abstract = {The relationship between human being and nature together with the
   Enlightenment has been a rapid process of change. Because of this change
   required by an economic structure based on intensive use of resources,
   the environment is damaged on a large scale. The devastation on nature
   is caused by this economic understanding get harm not only plants and
   animals, but also people. On the negative statements coming out of this,
   the existing production concept was suggested to be questioned and
   replaced. Concept of sustainable development has been prominent in the
   thinking of these considerations. However, sustainable development has
   evolved at a rate of a very limited and expansion of the concept of
   sustainable development has been slow. Although existing in the world
   dominant economic models is sources of environmental problems, there are
   neither proposed fundemantal changes nor implemented any
   recommendations. There is no claim that a significant change in the
   understanding of growth, consumption, cost-benefit, competition by the
   view of sustainable development. This condition is the weakest link of
   the concept of sustainable development. Developed after 1980 with the
   beginning of the process of globalization of the market economy to
   spread throughout the world, suspicions about the applicability of the
   concept of sustainable development has increased.},

Abstract = {The study aims to diagnose the theoretical and intellectual fundamentals
   of the two phenomena of political behavior and organizational conflict
   of the members of the parliament of Jordan (of Notables and Parliament),
   also it aims to reveal the relation among the basic dimensions of
   political behavior and organizational conflict, and its organizational
   and psychological impacts within the causality concept as long as
   related to both political behavior and organizational conflict.
   The study sample consisted of 78 members in the parliament, who have
   been chosen in a random sample and it formed a rate of 30\% of the
   study, the researcher developed a questionnaire as a tool to gather the
   necessary data for the study and led to a number of results:
   1. There is a difference in the patterns of political behavior and
   patterns of organizational conflict among the members of the parliament
   (Notables and representatives).
   2. There is a difference in the political behavior strategies and
   organizational conflict strategies among the members of the parliament.
   3. There is a statistically significant correlation between the
   political behavior dimensions and all of the variables (sex, marital
   status, functional expertise, and presence times to the parliament and
   the party to which it belongs), with a rate of 70\%.
   4. There is a statistically significant correlation between the
   organizational conflict dimensions and all of the variables (marital
   status, and presence times to the parliament), with a rate of 29\%.
   5. The results showed that the political behavior dimensions combined
   (agreement on objectives, agreement on public policies and personal
   agreement) and it has been shown a rate of 52.2\%, 46.3\%, and 48.8\%,
   respectively of the total variation in the organizational conflict
   dimensions.},

   Quran},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS AND LAW},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {5},
Number = {3},
Pages = {81-87},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Sometimes either of the spouses might have abomination or marital
   misconduct towards the other. This deed which leads to problems in
   marital relationships is called nushuz, or lack of submission, and can
   be from either the husband or the wife. Nushuz is the mostly observed
   factor in divorce so its prevention can save the family break-up. The
   purpose of this article is to describe the possible mechanism available
   in this area. The holy Quran also offers some solutions to remove the
   problems of marital misconducts which cause damage to the family
   foundation by making the husband primarily responsible for reforming the
   family prima, and has presented conventional practices. To avoid any
   kind of damage to the family foundation the husband should practice
   admonishment and banishment. However, it should not cause bruises on her
   body or lead to a more strained relationship. Moreover, if the wife is
   nashiza (rebellious), selecting arbiters from among relatives of the
   spouses can solve any problem which had led to nushuz and lack of
   submission. We will discuss the process of reforming the family after an
   instance of nushuz, which is essential in bringing the relationship back
   to normal.},

Abstract = {In this article I compare composite indicators measuring state
   fragility. The main objective is to analyze the reliability and validity
   of these measurement instruments. The analysis reveals that the indices
   are able to measure the same phenomenon quite reliable but they measure
   the concept of fragile states not sufficiently valid. Most of the
   indices do not consider crucial aspect of the concept and their results
   are in favor of democracies. Furthermore, weighting and aggregation of
   the index-elements is done without any theoretical foundation. Moreover,
   the validity of many indicators is questionable since these were
   fabricated within the context of other measurement constructs and have
   no conceptual relation to the phenomenon of state fragility. I argue
   that future attempts to measure state fragility should be more
   parsimonious and only include indicators which are relevant to the
   concept. Then comparative research could use them efficiently.},

Abstract = {Federalist thought has historically been an important source of
   inspiration in European integration. Although the last few decades have
   witnessed a gradual decline of the concept's relevance, the most recent
   developments in the wake of the Eurozone debt crisis have drawn renewed
   attention to shortcomings in the European Union's institutional
   architecture as well as to the feasibility of federal solutions to such
   institutional shortcomings. This article explores the potential of
   federalist thought as a blueprint for institutional reform in the EU.
   Based on a brief introduction to the concept of federalism, the article
   contextualizes federalism in debates on the democratic deficit, the EU's
   sources of legitimacy and the relationship between the union
   institutions and the member states. If shortcomings in institutional
   design are the source of the current (and future) crises, then closer
   attention needs to be paid to the costs and benefits of federal
   reorganization in terms of democracy, legitimacy and sovereignty,
   particularly from the perspective of small states in the EU. Federal
   reorganization would not only improve the democratic character of EU
   decision making, but also strengthen the role of small states in the
   union. However, it also prompts a number of thorny questions, most
   importantly regarding the construction of a European demos and its
   relation ship to deeply engrained ideas about the nation state as a more
   or less natural home of democracy.},

Abstract = {An important step in measuring development are the Worldwide Governance
   Indicators (WGI) of the World Bank, a meta-index for measuring good
   governance. The WGI shall measure the quality of governance of a
   country, in comparison to other countries as well as in comparison over
   time. In the following, the WGI's quality shall be evaluated in respect
   to the conceptualization and aggregation of governance-data. A third
   criteria relates to ethical questions. In sum, the WGI use very
   elaborated aggregation techniques but fail on very fundamental
   conceptual issues as well as on ethical issues.},

Volume = {42},

Abstract = {In this article, we examine the linkage between presidential policy
   proposal messages and legislative success. Employing a data set on
   presidential legislative proposals that covers the years 1949-2010, we
   find that politics matters less than policy. Purely political messages
   that reference the electoral logic of mandates or appeal to a sense of
   bipartisanship appear to have no impact on presidential legislative
   success, nor does policy signaling, though highlighting the role of
   agency-based policy experts in crafting legislation does. From these
   results, we conclude that although the way presidents communicate their
   messages to Congress represents an important component of
   presidential-legislative relations, it is instead the perceived quality
   of the legislation that more strongly shapes congressional support of
   presidential policy efforts.},

Abstract = {This article documents that precolonial state development was an
   impediment to the development of democracy outside Europe, because
   indigenous state institutions constrained the European colonial endeavor
   and limited the diffusion of European institutions and ideas. Some
   countries were strong enough to resist colonization; others had enough
   state infrastructure that the colonizers would rule through existing
   institutions. Neither group therefore experienced institutional
   transplantation or European settlement. Less developed states, in
   contrast, were easier to colonize and were often colonized with
   institutional transplantation and an influx of settlers carrying ideals
   of parliamentarism. Using OLS and IV estimation, I present statistical
   evidence of an autocratic legacy of early statehood and document the
   proposed causal channel for a large sample of non-European countries.
   The conclusion is robust to different samples, different democracy
   indices, an array of exogenous controls, and several alternative
   theories of the causes and correlates of democracy.},

Abstract = {The European Union's cross-border cooperation initiatives are perceived
   as an important tool for harnessing the process of European integration,
   which includes the ideas of fostering economic competitiveness and
   reducing regional discrepancies. The paper aims to analyse the role and
   function of notions of cooperation and cross-border communities used and
   advanced within the EU regional policy and, more specifically, within
   the European Territorial Cooperation objective. We argue that
   cooperation is a specific governmental technology which works through
   the promises of incorporation and inclusion of different stakeholders,
   binding them into more or less durable and institutionalised
   cross-border communities. Through cooperation, members of the community
   can be mobilised in novel programmes which encourage and harness
   political practices of self-responsibility and self-management. As such,
   cooperation is promoted as a necessary feature for building, cultivating
   and fostering cross-border communities in which self-disciplined
   citizens and other stakeholders are governed such that they are deemed
   responsible agents in their own development.},

Abstract = {International norms governing appropriate conduct in cyberspace are
   immature, leaving politicians, diplomats, and military authorities to
   grapple with the challenges of defending against and executing
   hostilities in cyberspace. Cyberspace is unlike the traditional physical
   domains where actions occur at specific geographic places and times.
   Rules governing conduct in the traditional domains emerged over
   centuries and share a common understanding of sovereignty that helps
   establish and justify the use of force. In cyberspace, sovereignty is a
   more abstract notion because the geographic boundaries are often
   difficult to define as data and applications increasingly reside in a
   virtual, global ``cloud.{''} This paper proposes a construct for
   establishing sovereignty in cyberspace by studying similarities between
   space and cyberspace. The characteristics of the space domain challenged
   traditional notions of sovereignty based on geography. As nations
   deployed space-based capabilities, the concept of sovereignty needed to
   mature to deal with the physical realities of space. Sovereignty is
   defined, and general requirements for claiming sovereignty are
   presented. The evolution of sovereignty in space is then discussed,
   followed by a construct for how sovereignty could be defined in
   cyberspace. The paper also reviews U.S. civil policy and military
   doctrine and discusses how these documents offer insights into the U.S.
   approach to asserting its claims within these domains. It concludes by
   examining an emerging trend where nations not only seek to establish
   sovereign claims over the architectural aspects of cyberspace, but also
   the information that flows over it.},

Abstract = {Immigration presents a daunting challenge to successive British
   governments. The public ranks immigration as one of the leading policy
   issues after the economy and employment. There is also greater public
   support for stronger immigration controls than in many other countries.
   In response, government strategy has included the use of a citizenship
   test. While the citizenship test is widely acknowledged as one key part
   of immigration policy, the test has received surprisingly little
   critical analysis. This article is an attempt to bring greater attention
   to serious problems with the current test and to offer three
   recommendations for its revision and reform. First, there is a need to
   revise and update the citizenship test. Secondly, there is a need to
   expand the test to include questions about British history and basic
   law. The third recommendation is more wide-ranging: it is that we
   reconsider what we expect new citizens to know more broadly. The
   citizenship test should not be viewed as a barrier, but as a bridge. The
   focus should centre on what future citizens should be expected to know
   rather than how others might be excluded. The test should ensure that
   future citizens are suitably prepared for citizenship. There is an
   urgent need to improve the test and this should not be an opportunity
   wasted for the benefit of both citizens and future citizens alike.},

Abstract = {This article contributes to the steady flow of critiques of the big
   society idea contained in The Political Quarterly. It focuses chiefly on
   two sets of parallels. The first is between the big society and the
   policies pursued by the Thatcher government which, despite their obvious
   rhetorical differences, contain many striking similarities, including
   their neoliberal origins, application of the crowding out thesis and
   uncritically idealised notions of community. The second is between the
   big society and a policy with the same name pursued doggedly by the
   Chinese Communist Party for nearly 20 years until being abandoned as a
   failure. Lessons for the Prime Minister's flagship policy are drawn from
   the Chinese experience. The article concludes with a welcome for the
   rediscovery of the social by public policy and some suggestions as to
   how a more participative and democratic state could follow from this
   breakthrough.},

Abstract = {The following paper aims to establish a critical approach to the drug
   trafficking phenomenon in the city of Medellin based on aesthetic and
   sociological categories of analysis. The possibility of taking the
   notion of drug tra) cking beyond the boundaries established by academic
   prejudices is proposed. The paper finds a support in the term of Narc
   Deco to raise a possible suspicion against the so-called Culture of Drug
   Trafficking on the basis of a few questions suggested by the meeting
   with this particular perspective. The paper aims to show how the
   interest of drug trafficking towards some specific aesthetic forms is
   not a matter ruled by economic or political principles, but instead,
   this interest turns out to be an effect. Finally, the paper accounts for
   the ethical limits that lead to a kind of resistance of the legitimation
   of some of the aesthetic descriptions created around drug trafficking.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {4},
Number = {2},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Political parties are often faced with seemingly opposing goals when
   trying to secure members' reelection and maintain party unity. On one
   hand, a party needs to fulfill members' diverse electoral needs for
   their reelection, and on the other hand, the party must force members to
   vote in unison according to party lines for collective decisions. How
   does a party influence its members to take unified action while meeting
   their individual electoral needs? Through an analysis of the Japanese
   Diet, this study argues that parties attempt to achieve the reelection
   of their members and maintain party unity by manipulating legislative
   committee assignments and deliberations. In particular, the study
   demonstrates that a party shapes committees in a different way according
   to policy areas over which committees have jurisdiction. A party tends
   to accept its members' requests for affiliation and allow their
   self-management in committees concerned with particularistic benefits so
   that they can deliver specific benefits to each electoral district. In
   addition, a party tends to assign members who have average policy
   positions in the party to committees concerned with general benefits to
   make policies that satisfy many constituencies.},

Abstract = {A recent stream of influential research suggests that the inclusion of
   behavioral genetic models can further inform our understanding of
   political preferences and behaviors. But it has often remained unclear
   what these models mean, or how they might matter for the broader
   discourse in the political science literature. The initial wave of
   behavioral genetic research focused on foundational discovery, and has
   begun to outline the basic properties of genetic influence on political
   traits, while a second wave of research has begun to link genetic
   findings to broader aspects of political behaviors. In the introduction
   to this special issue, we explicate how genes operate, the most common
   forms of behavioral genetic analyses, and their recent applications
   toward political behaviors. In so doing, we discuss what these findings
   mean for political science, and describe how best to interpret them. We
   note potential limitations of behavioral genetic approaches and remain
   cautious against the overextension of such models. The five articles
   that follow strive to move beyond discovery and focus more on the
   integration of behavioral genetic models with mainstream theories of
   political behavior to analyze problems of interest to political
   scientists.},

Abstract = {From a panel painted by Gustav Klimt and the analysis of the Greek
   tragedy Oresteia, this essay reflects on the relationship between hate
   and Law. The text suggests that Law should be thought of as an
   instrument of rationalization of society, but that such rationalization
   remains always incomplete. The essay also suggests that the Law should
   not be conceived as an instrument to deal with the irrational hatred,
   but as a form that promotes the qualitative transformation of violence
   by creating a procedure for creating legal norms.},

Abstract = {One very promising way when it comes to illustrate how cabinets work and
   to classify them is to look at their internal decision-making processes.
   In this paper, I give a new and comprehensive picture of cabinets in
   parliamentary and semi-presidential systems on this basis. In
   particular, in the first part, I review what the literature has proposed
   in this respect. Secondly, after illustrating some shortcomings of the
   works at issue, I present, proceeding from a famous Andeweg's proposal,
   a new typology of cabinets based on two dimensions. For each of the
   eight ideal-types stemming from it, some empirical examples are
   illustrated.},

Abstract = {The study of international migration implies, among other aspects, an
   analysis of the possibilities of constructing a universal citizenship.
   The interrelation between migrations and citizenship in the context of
   the global society urges us to explore the limits and the scope of the
   extension of citizenship to foreign workers in their countries of
   destination, while keeping their links with their countries of origin.
   The existing relationship between nationality and citizenship is then
   explored with the purpose to question the hegemonic perspective and the
   Eurocentric view of citizenship, associated with nationality. Then, the
   paper pleads for a universal citizenship through some pluralistic
   policies on immigrations, which are called ``public policy for
   foreigners{''}. This pluralistic model of citizenship and this policy is
   the one that makes it possible to access the universal citizenship
   rights of the immigrants in their countries of destination without
   losing their relations with their native countries.},

Abstract = {The European Union and Russia describe their relationship as a
   ``strategic partnership{''}. Cooperation and conflict exist alongside
   one another. But especially in the common neighbourhood, a competition
   in integration is underway. Through its Eastern Partnership programme,
   the EU is trying to export values, norms, and practices. Russia, via a
   number of projects, is striving to re-integrate the post-Soviet realm.
   The cases of Belarus and Ukraine show that Moscow is trying to use their
   self-isolation, economic weakness, and dependence on cheap energy
   supplies from Russia, in order to bind these countries more closely to
   Moscow. The integration projects of the EU and Russia are mutually
   exclusive.},

Abstract = {The concepts of democracy and governance have come to occupy a more
   ``prominent position in the discourse of national and international
   development{''}. They have become key notions in which ``citizens can
   have a more active role{''} which should enhance their positive view of
   the ``increase legitimacy of the state{''}. As a matter of fact, both
   concepts are inseparable from the existential characteristics of all
   political animals all over the world. They continue to determine the
   ``democratic political arrangement{''} and, dictate the landscapes and
   operational nerves of all civilized democratic polities in today's
   ICT-driven world particularly in terms of the functional performance of
   the horizontal organs of government which have increasingly gained
   prominence vis-a-vis public policy and responsive service delivery.
   One of the critical components/units of these horizontal organs is the
   Legislature. The Legislature constitutes a cardinal part of the major
   pillars of the governance process in the democratic political systems of
   today's world, Nigeria inclusive. Thus, this paper generally examines
   the challenges and impediments faced in Nigeria by the legislature over
   the years and concludes with the prescriptions for better legislative
   political terrains and the steps to be taken to make the Legislature in
   Nigeria more relevant to the sustenance of the ingredients and values of
   democracy and good governance.},

Abstract = {The substantial literature on mass violence, from ethnic cleansing to
   civil wars, has paid surprisingly little attention to the largest
   instance of mass violence in human history: the Holocaust. When
   political scientists have approached the subject, the trend has been to
   treat the Holocaust as a single case, comparing it-sometimes
   controversially-with other instances of genocide such as Rwanda or
   Cambodia. But historically grounded work on the destruction of European
   Jewry can help illuminate the microfoundations of violent politics,
   unpack the relationship between a ubiquitous violence-inducing ideology
   (antisemitism) and highly variable murder, and recast old questions
   about the origins and evolution of the Holocaust itself. After reviewing
   new trends in history-writing, I highlight opportunities for
   social-scientifically oriented research centered on the interaction of
   state power, local communities, and violent mobilization in five areas:
   military occupation, repertoires of violence, alliance politics,
   genocidal policymaking, and resistance. My conclusion addresses thorny
   issues of comparison, morality, and memory.},

Abstract = {Pensions play a key role for the social situation in Russia. Directly or
   indirectly, half of all households draw pension payments. Moreover,
   pensions were increased significantly in recent years. At the same time,
   the pension system is in a precarious situation. There are major
   shortfalls every year, which must be offset by subsidies from the state
   budget. This makes society dependent on the state and the pension system
   as a whole vulnerable to fluctuations in the budget, which for its part
   depends on the highly volatile oil prices on international commodity
   markets. For Russia, the creation of a self-sustaining system of social
   security is therefore a key modernisation project.},

Abstract = {How to generate legitimate forms of governance beyond the nation state
   is often considered a central question in contemporary world politics (
   ). To proceed in theory-building, scholars need to systematically assign
   the theory-driven assumptions on legitimate forms of governance beyond
   the nation-state with the various, already observable, forms of global
   governance. This article aims to conduct a comparative appraisal of the
   legitimatory quality of different patterns of governance by applying a
   framework of indicators for their assessment. The indicators are
   selected from the scholarly debate within International Relations on the
   legitimacy of global governance arrangements and structured by a
   multi-dimensional concept of legitimacy (input-, throughput- and
   output-dimension). This framework is then applied to international,
   transnational and private forms of global governance in three policy
   fields in order to show how each of them try to produce and maintain
   legitimacy, which strategies they apply and in how they interact with
   their stakeholders.},

Abstract = {The battle for public opinion in the Islamic world is an ongoing
   priority for U. S. diplomacy. The current debate over why many Muslims
   hold anti-American views revolves around whether they dislike
   fundamental aspects of American culture and government, or what
   Americans do in international affairs. We argue, instead, that Muslim
   anti-Americanism is predominantly a domestic, elite-led phenomenon that
   intensifies when there is greater competition between Islamist and
   secular-nationalist political factions within a country. Although more
   observant Muslims tend to be more anti-American, paradoxically the most
   anti-American countries are those in which Muslim populations are less
   religious overall, and thus more divided on the religious-secular issue
   dimension. We provide case study evidence consistent with this
   explanation, as well as a multilevel statistical analysis of public
   opinion data from nearly 13,000 Muslim respondents in 21 countries.},

Abstract = {Greatly increased advertising spending by independent groups represents
   one of the most dramatic recent changes in U.S. elections. This article
   moves forward our theoretical and empirical understanding of how the
   public responds to ads sponsored by candidates as compared to ads
   sponsored by unknown Super PACs and similar independent groups. In the
   theoretical section of the article, we establish why it is necessary to
   measure both backlash and ad persuasiveness to understand overall ad
   effectiveness and then we develop a series of hypotheses about the
   likely influence of ad sponsorship. In the empirical section, we
   undertake the first analysis to date of how the public responds to
   attack television ads sponsored by unknown independent groups. Using a
   large-N, geographically representative sample of U.S. adults, we conduct
   an experiment to assess how sponsorship influences ad effectiveness. We
   find that attack ads sponsored by unknown independent groups are more
   effective, on net, than ads sponsored by candidates.},

Abstract = {Political scientists have long debated how economic globalization
   influences national social policies, but they have so far not explored
   the political demands of political parties implicitly underlying such
   influence. This article explores such demands to see how globalization
   affects partisan-political demands for the welfare state in
   industrialized countries. It argues that political parties link
   globalization to welfare policy, but in ways that differ across parties
   and faces of globalization. First, globalization can be expected to
   spark support for welfare policies as compensation for globalization's
   risks, but given the constituencies and traditions of parties, this
   applies more for left than for right or other parties. Second, this
   dynamic is different for immigration than for trade or investment
   because migration poses fiscal pressures and threats to solidarity that
   can dampen enthusiasm for welfare compensation and spark calls for
   welfare retrenchment. Analysis of party manifestos in 23 Organisation
   for Economic Co-operation and Development countries from 1960 to 2004
   supports this view that some but not all parties embed some but not all
   liberalism.},

Abstract = {In the light of broad trends to hold lobbyists accountable by voluntary
   or mandatory means this practice piece reviews the United Kingdom
   experience of lobbying self-regulation. It suggests that there are key
   problems with the hitherto default self-regulatory model, and that the
   status quo is likely to change. Over the last few years, and spanning
   different political administrations, a steady drip feed of controversy
   and scandal involving lobbying has harmed the reputation of the
   political system, already undermined in other ways. This damaging
   publicity was one of the spurs for the recent inquiry on lobbying at
   Westminster, and this also had an impact on manifesto commitments on
   lobbying in the run up to the 2010 UK general election. Lobbying reform
   featured in the subsequent coalition agreement. Although pressure for
   some form of independent oversight of lobbying has been gaining pace in
   the last few years, and demands for reform have intensified in the wake
   of recent scandals, the precise shape of lobbying regulation at
   Westminster is still unclear. Debate on how to regulate and make
   transparent relations between government, elected representatives,
   officials and outside interests repeatedly throws up a number of issues
   that will need to be addressed in whatever regime is developed. These
   include: agreeing a workable definition of lobbying activity, which
   captures both direct and indirect lobbying; setting thresholds for
   registration; agreeing standards and protocols for reporting lobbying
   activity, including information on the resources devoted to lobbying,
   and where these are targeted. Whatever system is developed will have to
   strike a balance between securing transparency (via reporting,
   disclosure and possibly regulation) and ensuring that barriers to
   participation are not created (especially for resource poor groups and
   ordinary citizens). It is likely that many of those engaged in lobbying
   that does not involve direct advocacy will seek to be excluded from full
   disclosure obligations. How these issues are handled will condition the
   scrutiny and accountability of lobbying in the United Kingdom, and
   ultimately play a key role in determining whether such transparency
   measures can contribute to rebuilding trust and confidence in the

   dimensions of conflict. We evaluate the dimensionality of conflict using
   a new method for estimating state delegation positions and proposals

   suggest that three dimensions are adequate for most analyses and the
   first dimensionproportional representation in the legislaturethe most
   important. Finally, we examine how the agenda unfolds by mapping changes
   to the status quo throughout the convention. We conclude that, despite
   the lack of parties, the nature of the conflict is quite organized with

Abstract = {The author designates the Croatian thinker Juraj Krizanic as a
   philosopher of politics, i.e. a modern political theorist who, on the
   one hand, founds his postulates on traditional theological thought, and,
   on the other, takes into account the postulates of modern political
   theory. As a theologian, Krizanic bases his conception of history and
   theology on the providentialism of St. Aurelius Augustine, and his
   political theory on the acceptance of a part of the thought of his
   contemporary Thomas Hobbes. The theoretical position - political
   theology, positions him precisely between the political-theological
   postulates of Augustine and the political-theoretical hypotheses of
   Hobbes. In agreement with Augustine, Krizanic concludes that the
   political community (state) has its foundation in God and the values
   comprised in him, which is especially manifest in Providence and royal
   worship as basis of the internal structure of the state. But, in
   agreement with Hobbes, Krizanic understands that the mission of the
   state decreed by Providence operates within the earthly state and the
   secular political frameworks, and that, on the other hand, the king
   instituted by the will of God has his foundation also in the political
   body (the people), and this ranks Krizanic among the modern political
   theorists.},

   This study investigates the ambivalence of the relationships between
   Rousseau and the examples, ambivalence which is at the basis of his work
   as a writer and as a philosopher. Even though no positive theory of
   examples is to be found in his writings, we shall demonstrate that there
   are nevertheless many occurrences of a reflexion about the examples in
   the philosophical and literary works of the author, which emphasize the
   problem of the exemplarity of literature, and, more specifically, of
   fiction.},

Abstract = {A perennial topic of discussion among graduate students is the selection
   of a dissertation advisor. How do you pick one? What are the desirable
   attributes in a dissertation advisor? What are the undesirable
   attributes? Graduate students go around and around with criteria.
   Usually the discussion settles on a ``Goldilocks solution{''}: the
   desirable advisor offers neither too little guidance nor too much
   guidance. Everyone wants a worthy dissertation, but no student wants to
   pursue someone else's research agenda or be held up forever by an
   exacting ( or disorganized) advisor.
   Rarely discussed is something seen as decidedly pedestrian: the
   advisor's ability and penchant for offering detailed, written comments
   on drafts that refine the exposition, and, in the process, strengthen
   the student's skills at composition. It was my good fortune, more than
   20 years ago, to have a dissertation advisor who not only offered
   exhaustive comments on my drafts, but who also took the time to teach me
   what I thought I already knew-how to write.
   Looking back at my graduate studies in the department of government at
   Cornell University, I had wonderful teachers, including Richard
   Rosecrance, Peter Katzenstein, and Sidney Tarrow. But my most valuable
   teacher was my advisor, Norman Uphoff. Yes, I learned much about
   comparative politics from him. However, nothing I learned at Cornell has
   proved as valuable-in writing to date six university press books-as what
   Uphoff taught me about composition.
   Over the years, Uphoff's ability to read manuscripts critically and
   helpfully has become something of a legend among Cornell graduate
   students. Uphoff is skillful at organizing cogently ideas, a gift not
   easily codified. Given his pedagogical predilections, Uphoff has written
   a brief but very useful guide for students that addresses the most
   common flaws found in the many papers and theses that he has read over
   40 years of teaching. The guide circulates widely on the Cornell campus,
   sometimes by fellow faculty members, but more often among students. It
   deserves even wider circulation.},

Abstract = {Political campaigns are increasingly making use of new media tools to
   both broadcast messages to and communicate with potential voters. Such
   use of a range of new and traditional media channels synergistically has
   been theorised to offer specific advantages to campaigns, leading some
   media scholars to attach the term ohypermedia' to the practice. Features
   of hypermedia campaigning include flexible organisational structure,
   synergistic feedback of messages across multiple online and offline
   media channels, and the identification and targeting of key groups of
   undecided voters with wedge issues. Recently, the 2010 labour leadership
   contest afforded the opportunity to evaluate the use and effectiveness
   of these strategies in a live campaign. The authors analysed traffic and
   visitor behaviour on the Ed Balls labour leadership campaign website for
   100 days leading up to the election. The hypermedia strategy was deemed
   partially successful: while the candidates website successfully
   attracted a large number of visitors, data suggest that the wedge issue
   strategy, while seen as desirable by the campaign managers, was less
   effective for the Balls campaign team in the context of the labour
   leadership race. The campaigns focus on social media platforms rather
   than search engines meant that the majority of visitors to the campaign
   website were already familiar with, or supportive of Ed Balls political
   platform.},

Abstract = {Brought to fame by a 1994 World Bank report, the idea of pension
   pillarization has become part of the orthodoxy of pension reform. Yet
   scholars have neglected both the national origins and the pre-1994
   diffusion of the `three-pillar doctrine'. This article presents a
   critical history of the transnational diffusion process that led to the
   adoption of this concept at the World Bank. My analysis retrieves the
   Swiss roots of the doctrine during the late 1960s, as well as its
   gradual adoption and mainstreaming during the 1970s and early 1980s by a
   transnational epistemic community of life insurers and pension
   consultants. By 1990, the doctrine was widely used without reference to
   its national origins: a Swiss trademark had become a generic reform idea
   that framed controversies on the future shape of old-age provision.},

Abstract = {Temporary labour migration programs are often proposed as a way to
   provide the benefits of migration in general, while mitigating the
   allegedly problematic effects of permanent migration. Here I propose
   that the arguments deployed in favour of temporary labour migration over
   permanent migration are flawed, normatively, and that empirically
   temporary labour migration programs produce effects in receiving states
   that are even worse than those (allegedly) produced by permanent
   migration. As a result, I shall argue that, for reasons of consistency,
   advocates of restricting permanent migration should support restricting
   temporary labour migration programs as well. I conclude not by arguing
   that temporary labour migration programs should be abandoned, but rather
   that we must focus more seriously on re-constructing temporary labour
   migration programs that do not produce these dilemmas, as well as on
   generating policies that alleviate the challenges they often pose in
   receiving societies.},

Abstract = {With China's increasing investment in Myanmar, a prosperous economic
   corridor is expected to be formed along China-Myanmar oil and gas
   pipelines.
   This economic corridor project is part of Beijing's broader strategy of
   diversifying its sources of imported energy, as well increasing its
   economic integration with Myanmar. Although China has long-term
   strategic energy investment plans in this country, it does not
   necessarily mean that China has free rein over the outcomes.},

Title = {`Presidentialism' in the Ex-Soviet Union},
Journal = {JAPANESE JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-36},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {When the Soviet Union fell in 1990, three of its 15 components, the
   Baltic States, joined the European Union, and a fourth, Moldova, may
   well join in the future. The other 11 quickly became presidential
   republics, following the lead given by Boris Yeltsin, the president of
   the largest among them, Russia. By 1994, all 11 were headed by a
   president elected by universal suffrage. These ex-Soviet countries
   contribute significantly to the number of presidential republics in the
   world. Presidential republics form a clear majority, being predominant
   in Latin America and Africa, alongside the ex-Soviet Union. They are
   rare in Europe, the main cases being France, Romania, and, though
   seemingly temporarily, some Balkan states; in Asia, outside the
   ex-Soviet Union, they are a small minority.
   Like many presidential republics elsewhere, those in the ex-Soviet Union
   are mostly authoritarian, but with variations: this is primarily so in
   Central Asia, as well as in Azerbaijan and Belarus. These presidencies
   have been very stable, with some of their leaders, especially in Central
   Asia, being repeatedly re-elected, often without opposition. There has
   been a regular turnover in Armenia (but less so in Georgia) and in
   Ukraine (but not in Belarus). The Russian case is peculiar, as is well
   known: Putin became prime minister because he could no longer be
   constitutionally re-elected as president, at least without a break. The
   power of these presidents has varied over time: outside Central Asia
   (except Kyrgyzstan) and Azerbaijan, where they have been uniformly
   strong, their strength has declined in Georgia, increased in Russia and
   Belarus, and had ups and downs in Armenia and Ukraine.},

Abstract = {In Illinois and Texas, senate elections return members to serve terms of
   different length. Because term length schedules are randomized, these
   states provide a natural experiment. Cross-sectional comparison of
   chambers requires statistical controls for myriad factors that
   distinguish cases (chambers or periods). These two chambers, by
   contrast, produce direct evidence of term length's impact on electoral
   behavior. We test hypotheses about term length's impact on candidacies,
   campaign expenditures, and voter participation with data from 1968 to
   2010. Surprisingly, there is little evidence of any significant
   differences between contests for two-year and four-year terms.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the main design issues of capital transfers with
   an equalization objective within a system of sub-national finance.
   Although there is a vast literature and ample policy practice with the
   design of recurrent equalization grants, there is a dearth in the fiscal
   federalism literature at both the theoretical design and actual practice
   levels on how to use capital transfers with an interregional
   equalization objective. The main aims of this article are first, at the
   conceptual level, to identify the singular characteristics of capital
   expenditures and capital financing sources that would allow quantifying
   capital expenditure needs and financing capacity across sub-national
   jurisdictions; and second, to use those measures to a capital
   equalization transfer formula applied at the Spanish regional level.},

Abstract = {In 1999, the Canadian province of Ontario joined a number of other
   jurisdictions in requiring its high school students to complete
   volunteer service before graduating. The primary objective of this
   program, and others like it around the world, was to address declining
   civic engagement within society. Using a quasi-experimental design, we
   explore the impact of mandatory volunteering on its stated aims. Our
   findings suggest that volunteering in high school has positive impacts
   on the political dimensions of a student's subsequent civic engagement,
   measured here as political involvement, political activism, political
   interest, and political efficacy. However, those impacts are largely
   conditional on two features of the volunteering experience: sustained
   commitment to one placement and a positive experience as evaluated by
   the student. High school community service seems to be unrelated to
   social dimensions of civic engagement, measured here as involvement in a
   variety of social, cultural, and religious organizations.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on the national and transnational strategies of
   five European Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender civil society
   organizations (CSOs) pressing for equality and non-discrimination. We
   present three modes of interaction between CSOs and their political
   environment. The first mode we label `morality politics'. Arcigay in
   Italy and the Campaign against Homophobia in Poland are seemingly locked
   in this mode because they are confronted with a hostile and organized
   opposition, both in terms of public opinion and elite opinion. A second
   mode of interaction we label an `incremental change' mode and is the
   strategy pursued by Stonewall in the United Kingdom and the Hatter
   Society in Hungary, marked by discreet elite level lobbying. Finally, we
   introduce a third mode of interaction we label `high-profile politics'.
   This mode is marked by highly visible public events, coalition seeking,
   cooperation with government, and transnational activity at the European
   level and abroad. This is a strategy possible by CSOs where there is a
   high degree of public support for equality and minimal partisan or
   religious opposition to the goals of the movement. The Dutch COC has
   been pursuing this `high-profile politics' mode of interaction in their
   political environment over the past few years. Comparative European

Abstract = {The text problematizes Hobbes's relation towards republicanism. This is
   carried out in three stages. The first stage shows the form in which
   republican ideas were present in English political thought in the first
   half of the 17th century. It turns out that, prior to the publication of
   Leviathan in 1651, there was no coherent anti- monarchic republican
   theory in England. Still, English political thought was familiar with
   its individual elements and those elements had a major influence on the
   course of the constitutional crisis and the civil war itself. The second
   stage provides an analysis of Hobbes's criticism of two republican ideas
   which he deems particularly fatal to the survival of the state. The
   first idea is the ideal of mixed government, which Hobbes rejects as
   incompatible with the fundamental condition of state preservation,
   namely indivisible sovereign power. Thereafter, relying on Skinner's
   analysis, the author outlines Hobbes's criticism of the republican
   conception of liberty, which is at the core of the attack on monarchy as
   a form of state incompatible with the liberty of citizens. In contrast
   to such a perception, Hobbes constructs a completely novel definition of
   liberty, which enables him to show that the liberty of citizens is equal
   in democracy, aristocracy and monarchy. Finally, the third stage
   inquires into the implications of Hobbes's criticism of republicanism
   with regard to the conceptual field of his mature theory of the state.
   Emphasis is put on the assertion that this criticism does not also imply
   a rejection of democracy as a form of state. Indeed, the analysis shows
   that, within the framework of Hobbes's theory of the state, criticism of
   republicanism, perceived as vindication of the state, is prerequisite to
   the existence of democracy itself.},

Abstract = {This article reflects on a set of focus group transcripts from a joint
   research project by the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation and the Gauteng
   City-Region Observatory. Casting South Africa as a transitional
   democracy uncovers a number of ambiguities in this context. For
   instance, a selection of South Africans who were respondents in various
   focus groups around the country, cutting across various divides,
   articulated a sense of uncertainty about who needs to bear the
   responsibility for building a cohesive society, and who will bear the
   cost. Various citizens attempt to assert a claim on belonging or
   entitlement in this transitioning society, some vocalising fears that
   their place may be threatened, others vocalising the fact that their
   needs are being overlooked. The article concludes that at this juncture
   in South Africa's democracy, where there is growing individual
   ambiguity/uncertainty, it is critical to bring issues of equality
   centre-stage. The imperative of research on non-racialism is to (re)
   cast economic redress and the economic uplifting of disenfranchised
   South Africans as the new challenge that requires non-racial
   intervention and support.},

Pages = {9-32},
Abstract = {Drawing from the literature and interpreting the evidence, this article
   explores the sources, factors and forces that interact to spark and
   drive conflict in the post-colonial state and its environment. It
   advances that the structure of the post-colonial state and its immediate
   environment is characterised by the juxtaposition of transnational
   groups and proto states interacting with sovereign entities. This
   intermestic (international/domestic) environment engenders a security
   dilemma to which constituent groups and their extraterritorial
   affiliates respond by seeking to appropriate the totality of the space.
   Simultaneously, elite systemic forces engage to impose their strategic
   interests. The state is thus doubly instrumental. Forces from both the
   first and second levels align in collaborative and confrontational
   engagements in pursuit of partisan interests. The objectives of the
   competing loci of power to appropriate the total space or carve out an
   autonomous Lebensraum instigate a zero-sum game. Coercion is the
   principal currency of this engagement. Structural factors, principally
   the incongruous internal construction and the intermestic location of
   the state, account for the proneness of whole sub-regions to implode.
   The evolved behaviour of post-colonial states in the post-Cold War
   period responds to the complex realities of the state and its
   environment.},

Abstract = {Most recent studies about internal power distribution within state-wide
   parties in previous unitary countries, like Spain, show that they have
   changed less than was initially expected. But how national party leaders
   are able to counteract the decentralizing pressures that the first
   studies in this field underlined must still be explained. In this
   article we reformulate a mechanism for national political leaders to
   keep their parliamentary parties under control that Van Biezen has
   suggested for new European democracies. We argue that keeping party and
   public offices apart at the regional level is a vital part of a chain of
   command whereby national party leaders are able to control their party's
   regional governments. Using a quantitative analysis of national and
   regional elites for the first time we show that office overlapping is
   thus substantially less intense at the regional level than at the
   national level in the two main Spanish state-wide parties, and that this
   feature is related to regional politicians' degree of autonomy. Still,
   this `divide et impera' strategy is employed less over time.},

Journal = {QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {7},
Number = {2},
Pages = {135-174},
Abstract = {Private politics social pressure is led by social activists who use
   confrontational and cooperative strategies to induce firms to provide
   social benefits. A confrontational activist demands that a firm change
   its practices and threatens a harmful campaign if it does not change. A
   cooperative activist uses its expertise to identify benefits from a
   change in practices or provides external legitimacy for a firm. The
   greater the threat from a confrontational activist the more aggressively
   the potential targets compete for an engagement with the cooperative
   activist. If firms would reject the demands of the confrontational
   activist, the cooperative activist chooses a socially responsible firm
   over a profit-maximizing firm, and the confrontational activist then
   campaigns against a profit-maximizing firm. If the threat is
   sufficiently strong that the firms would accept the demand of the
   confrontational activist, the cooperative activist is indifferent to
   which firm it chooses. Consequently, when campaigns are observed,
   profit-maximizing firms are matched with confrontational activists, and
   socially responsible firms are matched with cooperative activists. The
   threat of confrontation creates a positive externality for the
   cooperative activist, which has an incentive to contribute to the
   campaign of the confrontational activist.},

Journal = {POLITIKON},

Pages = {29-40},
Abstract = {Using as a starting point the research conducted by the Gauteng
   City-Region Observatory for the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation in 2011 to
   explore the status of non-racialism in South Africa, we conclude that in
   nearly all of the focus groups the participants and moderators find it
   impossible to define the notion of non-racialism-at least, not in a way
   that distinguishes it from non-racism, multiracialism or `good/better
   race relations'. We initiate the discussion of non-racialism by
   highlighting the ubiquity of the term, despite there being only rare
   indications of its actual meaning. One of the obstacles to imagining and
   giving meaning to non-racialism is the binding together of essentialist
   notions of culture and race to form unbridgeable divides between
   constructed groups. The prevalence of multi-racial notions of society,
   resonating closely with ideas of multiculturalism, means the task of
   critically discussing non-racialism still lies ahead, but demands that
   existing practices be critically analysed.},

Title = {Sign of the Outlaw: Liberal Boundaries, Social Banditry, and the
   Political Act},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {34},
Number = {3},
Pages = {271-294},
Abstract = {Theorists should read non-traditional forms of political agency
   alongside the American left's failure to counter liberal hegemony.
   According to Zizek the current ideological deadlock requires
   unconventional approaches to political action. His notion of the Act
   represents one of the most original methods for identifying alternative
   types of political agency. The Act is often violent and not only
   transgresses symbolic norms, but reconfigures our understandings of
   legitimate political behavior. Linking acts of social banditry to his
   theory illustrates how the outlaw represents a sign of political
   resistance. Acts of social criminality, for example, take on political
   significance when undermining the regime's hegemonic narrative. Instead
   of reading acts of banditry as isolated incidents of criminal behavior,
   political movements may interpret the acts as signifying larger
   struggles over public space and resource distribution. Using Billy the
   Kid and Pretty Boy Floyd as case studies, the article examines how
   conditions of uneven economic development produce non-traditional
   political actors. Subsequently, the article provides a framework for
   future research on the political significance of social criminality.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this note is to present a surprising result regarding
   crisis initiation and termination. The decision problem treated here is
   distilled from an extension of the two-sided incomplete information
   version of the traditional deterrence game. We employ a two-stage
   analysis of the decision problem faced by the Challenger that formally
   links the onset of a crisis to the decision over whether to escalate the
   crisis should the Challenger face resistance from the Defender. The
   two-part result is as follows. A crisis is more likely to be initiated
   by a Challenger who will ultimately back down if Defender chooses to
   resist than by a Challenger of the same type who will choose to escalate
   if Defender chooses to resist. Contrariwise, a crisis is less likely to
   be initiated by a Challenger who will ultimately escalate if Defender
   chooses to resist than by a Challenger of the same type who will choose
   to back down if Defender chooses to resist.},

Abstract = {Analyses on the so-called ``Arab Spring{''} mainly focus on its possible
   consequences. But which are its causes? In attempting to provide an
   answer to this question, the author evaluates the multifaceted
   relationship between authorities and citizens - especially the youngest
   ones - underlining the occurrence of specific phenomena (youth bulge,
   high educational levels, widespread ICTs, unemployment, pervasive
   corruption, human rights violations) in the countries involved. The
   conclusion which is reached is that the wave of protests might have been
   generated by the complete detachment existing between citizens and
   institutions, detachment which, paradoxically, might have been created
   and nourished by those in power themselves, through the
   ``modernizing{''} reforms they have imposed in recent years.},

Abstract = {Since the 1990s, Australia has become increasingly concerned about a
   perceived incongruence between its booming economic relationship with
   China and its security alliance with the US. There have been dire
   warnings that the future will be marked by an inevitable increase in
   tensions between China and the US as the former threatens to overtake
   and surpass the latter in aggregate GDP and in military force projection
   capability. This combination of bilateral tensions and concomitant
   pressures from each side for Australias support could force Canberra
   into a difficult choice: renounce its economic relationship with China
   to side with an economically moribund West, or betray old alliance
   commitments in pursuit of a lucrative relationship with a rising but
   ideologically alien new hegemon. What should Australia do? That is not a
   question that can be answered scientifically, but the framework provided
   here can perhaps elucidate the stakes.},

   of African party manifestos have been undertaken to date. This study
   applies the Manifesto Research Group's (MRG/CMP) coding scheme to a
   complete set of manifestos in three countries. The study's main aim is
   to determine whether a research tool that has been seminal in the study
   of Western politics can be used to advance the study of political
   parties in nonindustrialized societies. In a first step, the article
   examines the extent to which African manifestos advance programmatic
   ideas. The results show great differences across parties and time. The
   study subsequently investigates how parties position themselves on a
   right-left spectrum; it further outlines which policy categories African
   parties stress most. Finally, it examines the stance of individual
   parties on specific policy issues. The study argues that the MRG coding
   scheme can contribute to a much more nuanced analysis of African
   parties.},

Abstract = {Debates in democratic theory underestimate the dangers of confusing
   counterterrorism with the defense of democracy. This confusion is traced
   back either to the perception that terrorism constitutes a threat to the
   functioning of a democratic system, the similarity of measures deployed
   to defend democracy and to fight terrorism, or the misuse of the term
   ``democracy.{''} However, terrorism is not a threat to consolidated
   democracies, but rather a threat to security. On the contrary,
   counterterrorism laws can themselves have negative effects on democracy.
   This confusion is hazardous and not merely a conceptual oversight, as it
   could justify unreviewed longer-term counterterrorism measures.},

   required to better understand the underlying connections. They then
   highlight a number of weaknesses in my empirical analysis. First, they
   criticize the operationalization of the isolated-connected distinction I
   borrow from Paxton, and point to the scope of engagement as a way of
   `keeping it simple'. Second, they express disbelief in the apparent
   strength of the correlations at the individual level compared to the
   aggregate level in my analysis, and assert that an `organizational
   society of broad scope' is primary. In this rejoinder, I briefly discuss
   both comments.},

Abstract = {There is an enduring interest in how geographic features influence
   political interactions and outcomes, and many key factors highlighted in
   international relations and cross-national research vary spatially
   within countries. Starting with the pioneering research of Richardson,
   we show how geographic information systems (GIS) technology and the
   increasing availability of spatial data can provide new opportunities to
   answer old and new questions. We focus on key motivations for using
   spatial disaggregated data and show how such data can be used in current
   research, drawing on examples from the study of violent conflict.},

Abstract = {After the introduction of the ``European restriction{''} to public
   deficit, resulting from the Treaty of Maastricht and the Stability and
   Growth Pact, the Autonomous Communities have been subject to formal
   fiscal rules with regard to the deficit and debt, as well as management
   of their budgets. However, this regulation, did not prevent some
   Autonomous Communities failed to comply with the budgetary stability
   objectives, probably because it lacked an effective system of sanctions.
   This paper examines the scope of the constitutional amendment of article
   135, and focuses particularly on the margin of maneuver that the new
   article 135 gives the State to impose regional governments meet the
   deficit and debt limits.},

Abstract = {This article provides a new interpretation of Hannah Arendt's critical
   analysis of the `perplexities of the Rights of Man' by drawing attention
   to its overlooked methodological orientations, especially its `aporetic'
   nature. Arendt's critique is aporetic as it centres on the paradoxes of
   human rights and analyses them by putting into practice a mode of
   inquiry that she associates with Socrates. The article challenges the
   conventional understanding of aporia as a paralysing impasse and
   suggests that aporetic thinking can create possibilities of rethinking
   key concepts especially in times of crises. To make this point, I
   respond to Jacques Rancieres criticism that the paradoxes introduced by
   Arendt paralyse thinking and doom human rights to an inevitable destiny
   of failure. I argue that, precisely because of its aporetic nature,
   Arendt's critique attends to possibilities of rethinking and reinventing
   human rights, as can be seen in her articulation of `a right to have
   rights'.},

Title = {Cooperation for the Enhancement of Environmental Citizenship in the
   Context of Securitization: The Case of an OSCE Project in Serbia},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CIVIL SOCIETY},

Volume = {8},

Abstract = {Environmental citizenship has an important role in rooting environmental
   security at the local level as both the consequences of environmental
   degradation and efforts towards its preservation are directly felt
   there. An increasing level of environmental democracy may also result in
   improvements in equality and access to justice which, in the long run,
   may lead to improving social stability. At the same time, a more
   distinct sense of entitlement to one's environment can inspire deeper
   concern for it. For these reasons, international organizations have
   increasingly started to emphasize questions of environmental citizenship
   in development cooperation. It is thus important to study what are the
   biggest problems in trying to increase participation, and furthermore,
   how international organizations can best work towards these goals in
   their projects. This article focuses on a specific case of such an
   effort, carried out by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
   Europe (OSCE) in Serbia. The aim of the project was to promote the
   implementation of the Aarhus Convention by establishing regional Aarhus
   Centers to reach the local population and address their environmental
   concerns, support local non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and
   facilitate the interaction between the grassroots level and local
   administration. The analysis, which was based on interviews with local
   OSCE and other NGO officials as well as project reports, found that the
   biggest problems lie in the lack of cooperation between different levels
   of administration and their interaction with the civil society. In
   addition, the reinforcement of environmental citizenship requires a
   distinctly cross-sectoral, comprehensive approach. International
   organizations can work as mediators and ease these processes, but at the
   same time they should aim to leave the responsibility for the
   cooperation to the local level.},

Abstract = {Providing policy advice is often the epitome of a public service career,
   the opportunity to have a direct influence on policy. Yet there is a
   wide range of circumstances in which policy advice might be sought,
   requiring different information, timetables and depths of analysis. This
   will necessitate the development of a number of skills and be dependent
   on the political and administrative circumstances. Using the Department
   of the Prime Minister and Cabinet as a case study, we develop a typology
   of policy advice, ranging from intelligence gathering, to reviewing
   options, coordinating policy and sometimes initiating strategy. We
   illustrate the implications of these differing types of work to show how
   public servants must approach policy advising, conscious of and within a
   framework that supports different approaches to policy work according to
   the situation.},

Abstract = {Doing Fieldwork in Political Theory Mathieu HAUCHECORNE This paper aims
   to articulate a properly ethnographic approach for the study of
   political thought. It draws on a fieldwork carried out among the French
   mediators of the US philosopher John Rawls and of US theories of
   distributive justice. The article starts with the presentation of the
   general theoretical framework endorsed in this research, intended as a
   contribution to a historical sociology of political ideas. This approach
   takes place among the recent renewal of intellectual history in France
   and abroad. The article then turns to the reasons which motivated the
   recourse to an ethnographic inquiry, and details how the fieldwork was
   delineated and which sites were selected. The ethnographic dimension of
   the fieldwork relates both to the type of inquiry carried out (based on
   participation and interviews), and the standpoint endorsed,
   characterized by reflexivity, attention to alien categories, and the
   analysis of bodily and material apparatus.},

Abstract = {After the reunification of West and East Germany, West German laws,
   lawyers and judges almost completely replaced the East German legal
   system, giving rise to a unique situation in which old laws governed new
   citizens. Are West German laws and legal institutions incompatible with
   the socialist values of East Germans? Or do East Germans judge legal
   institutions based on their performance? Using three surveys from the
   1990s and 2000s this article shows support for both cultural and
   performance approaches to institutional trust, but suggests that the
   impact of cultural factors may have declined over time. Improved
   economic and political performance in the 2000s, moreover, has led
   levels of trust in the East to reach nearly the same levels as in the
   West. Surprisingly, the results show as well that socialist values in
   West Germany are also a barrier to trust in the courts.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL CRITICAL THOUGHT},
Year = {2012},

Pages = {171-182},
Abstract = {The city of Chongqing epitomizes the multi-layered characteristics of
   the development of Chinese cities, and the process of regional
   development there has seen many conflicts. Consequently, Chongqing's
   experience of reform and development inevitably offers itself as a model
   of how `socialism with Chinese characteristics' operates in practice. In
   recent years, Chongqing has adopted a series of popularly-oriented
   policies aimed at achieving common prosperity. Chongqing is facing up to
   its reality, advocating reforms and vigorously promoting its
   `Five-Chongqing Program' based on the following themes: Livable
   Chongqing, Traffic-Smooth Chongqing, Forested Chongqing, Safe Chongqing,
   and Healthy Chongqing. Also being pursued are special campaigns with
   such titles as `Crime Crackdown', `Singing Red (Revolutionary) Songs,
   Reading Classic Books', and `Three-Into and Three-With'. The goal is to
   make Chongqing more developed, more livable and more beautiful. In its
   practice, the city adheres to the basic principle of socialism with
   Chinese characteristics, and systematically highlights the value of
   socialism. Chongqing also relates closely to its reality, learning
   readily from other successful examples while maintaining its creativity
   and making use of market dialectics. The outstanding element in
   Chongqing's practice is that it combines scientific development with
   harmonious, people-oriented concepts, internalizing them and using them
   in its functioning. Chongqing's creative practice is destined to be an
   advanced example of the development model of socialism with Chinese
   characteristics.},

Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICS RESEARCH},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This article examines citizens who combine liberalism on one of two
   major issue dimensions with conservatism on the other, assessing whether
   they are less politically engaged than ``consistent{''} liberals and
   conservatives and whether this relationship has strengthened over time
   with elite polarization. It also explores the contributions of
   cross-pressures, partisanship, and alienation to contemporary
   ideological differences in political engagement. This article departs
   from most existing research by defining ideology two dimensionally.
   Using the 1984-2008 American National Election Studies, it finds that
   culturally conservative, economically liberal Americans and to a lesser
   extent culturally liberal, economically conservative Americans are less
   engaged in elections than ``consistent{''} liberals and conservatives.
   Different factors explain these differences with liberals and
   conservatives, but cross-pressures do not demobilize either
   ``two-dimensional ideologue.{''} Over time, the increased involvement of
   liberals and conservatives has produced a growing ideological gap in
   political engagement.},

Pages = {657-671},
Abstract = {In this article I enquire into the possibility of citizenship `after
   orientalism' by examining the writing of Chinese academics on internal
   migrants in China. The popular narratives on migrants represent them as
   `peasant workers in need of becoming urban citizens'. These
   representations are based on an understanding of citizenship as
   necessarily urban and modern, which is reminiscent of Weber's theory of
   citizenship, and is based on mechanisms of `internal orientalism'. I
   argue that contrary to the popular understanding of `post-oriental' as
   `resistance to the West', it is the process of the
   boundary-transgression between rural and urban, rather than non-Western
   ideas of citizenship, that opens space for citizenship `after
   orientalism' in China. This process of boundary-transgression can be
   mapped through new practices of naming and narrative-setting in the
   literature on internal migrants, which emphasise subjective character of
   group boundaries and appeal for recognition of rural and migrant
   identities. It is through these instances of boundary-transgression
   between urban and rural that the orientalism embedded within the notion
   of citizenship in China is challenged.},

Abstract = {Since 1991, Western bilateral and multilateral democracy promotion
   assistance, especially for civil society development, has increased
   dramatically. Much of the literature that assesses the impact of this
   assistance has focused on either direct recipients in civil society or
   macro transformations, with minimal systematic analysis of how
   developments in civil society unfold. This article argues that political
   settlements shape the impact of Western civil society building
   initiatives. The inclusivity of political settlements can determine who
   receives funding and who does not and also influences the
   representativeness of political institutions. In contexts with
   noninclusive political settlements, where certain groups are excluded
   from the settlement and the settlement enjoys minimal support, democracy
   promotion efforts are more likely to exacerbate polarization, thereby
   weakening the quality of civil society. Examining the women's sector of
   civil society in the Palestinian territories and El Salvador, this
   article illustrates the primacy of political settlements and the
   limitations of civil society building in contexts where certain actors
   are excluded from the onset.},

   Central aims to recreate the mechanisms on which has been defining the

   which we believe are central to the current cycle of global
   accumulation, these are: oil, coca, agrofuels and geostrategic position.
   We believe that the study of this region gives important work items, not
   only for understanding the valuable role that comes to occupy the
   territory of Colombia under the new phase system, but also for
   understanding the territorial reorganization of the capital is emerging
   as a whole for the Latin American subcontinent.},

Title = {International ideas versus national traditions: Nordic economic and
   public policy as proposed by the OECD},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL POWER},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {5},
Number = {3},
Pages = {455-473},
Abstract = {Through analysis of the Organisation for Economic Co-ordination and
   Development (OECD)'s recommendations to reform Nordic public and
   economic policy, this article seeks to assess the OECD's influence on
   Nordic politics. OECD recommendations are placed at the juncture of
   internationally acknowledged ideas and national traditions - thus being
   potentially useful for national policy-makers trying to deal with this
   tension. During the post-war period the Nordic countries found an
   original combination of international ideas and national traditions,
   involving a combination of economic efficiency and social equality. The
   OECD acknowledges this tradition in various ways but seeks to reform
   Nordic public policy according to a different, and in many ways opposing
   logic. OECD recommendations for Nordic countries typically include lower
   income taxes, lower levels of social security benefits, individual level
   wage setting, more relaxed employment protection legislation, an
   increase of the labour supply and a balanced budget. In spite of
   existing evidence of regime stability, it is not possible to exclude
   OECD influence on Nordic public and economic policy as past reforms
   correspond in many ways to these recommendations. This, in turn, raises
   the question of the democratic legitimacy of the way in which reforms
   are prepared.},

Abstract = {Focusing on electoral rules fundamentally is about understanding the
   institutions in play that structure the electoral behaviour of
   candidates, parties and voters. Thus Chapter 2 on institutionalism helps
   us to understand both why these rules are necessary and why they have
   developed in particular ways. Historical institutionalism and path
   dependency are important here. The sometimes fierce debate over rules
   between different parties in parliament can lead to electoral change
   that either narrows or broadens the opportunities for new electoral
   competitors. Chapter 1 on democratic theories helps us to understand the
   principles behind different electoral arrangements, while Chapter 3
   suggests ways of studying how and why some of these principles are
   translated into different electoral rules at federal, state and local
   levels.},

Pages = {123-139},
Abstract = {Does Latin America's left turn matter in media politics? Has ideology
   any impact on governments' practices and policies regarding media and
   journalistic institutions? This essay focuses on the existence of a
   specific kind of media activism on the part of leftist governments in
   Latin America. It does so by assessing discourses on the media,
   direct-communication practices, and media regulation policies. While
   showing that the current binary distinctions stressing the existence of
   two lefts - ``populist{''} and ``nonpopulist{''} - obscure important
   commonalities and continuities, the author demonstrates that
   institutional and structural constraints account for the differences
   among the various leftist governments in Latin America. In sum, the
   paper challenges the prevailing neglect of ideology as a relevant factor
   in explaining developments in government-media relationships in the
   region.},

Journal = {ASIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {20},
Number = {3},
Pages = {221-243},
Abstract = {This article employs the concept of `regional governance' to analyze
   both the processes and outcomes of the emerging regional institutional
   arrangements in East Asia. It argues that while ASEAN has played a
   significant role in creating and sustaining the `processes' of wider
   East Asian regional governance efforts, the level of achievement in
   translating these processes into tangible `outcomes' remains severely
   constrained by great power rivalry, especially between Japan and China.
   By focusing on the areas of trade and finance, this article argues that
   the varying levels of outcomes between these two issue areas can be
   explained primarily by the degree of convergence between Japanese and
   Chinese interests. In particular, while Japan and China have a shared
   interest in contributing to the promotion of regional financial
   stability, they strongly disagree over the appropriate form and contours
   of a trade governance system.},

Title = {Two decades of Czech foreign policy and hegemony of Internationalism},
Journal = {POLITOLOGICKY CASOPIS-CZECH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2012},
Number = {3},
Pages = {195-217},
Abstract = {The aim of the article is to offer a theoretically grounded explanation
   of the long-term continuity of Czech foreign policy. Czech foreign
   policy displays long-term continuity and consensus at the level of
   policy, but, at the same time, exhibits deep ideological differences
   among political and societal elites at the level of politics. The
   article argues against the mainstream (neo)liberal and (neo) realist
   theories that explain foreign policy outcomes in pure rationalist and
   materialist terms. Instead, the text follows the line of the critical
   constructivist school of International Relations and borrows heavily
   from post-structuralism. Thus, the article takes into account the
   ideational background of Czech foreign policy and argues that these
   deeply seated differences at the level of politics, stemming from
   mutually contradictory normative, philosophical and political beliefs,
   are subsequently neutralized by what is called the ``hegemonic
   internationalist discourse{''}. In this context, the article explores
   the origins, nature and consequences of the power of the hegemonic
   internationalist discourse.},

Journal = {SWS-RUNDSCHAU},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {52},

Abstract = {The contribution presents a new type of the intellectual: the expert
   intellectual. Up until now, experts and intellectuals were considered
   two distinct categories in the social sciences. Recently, however, we
   witness a transformation of the classical concept of the intellectual
   that can be analyzed only by using hybridization methods. Expert
   intellectuals, who typically work for universities or think tanks,
   possess specialized knowledge and envision their social role to be
   charged with political responsibility. They strive to fashion public
   opinion in their statements, which is unusual for pure experts. In order
   to empirically examine whether expert intellectuals fulfill some of the
   classical functions of the intellectual, I conduct a content analysis of
   op-eds written by the most prominent contributors for the world's
   largest newspaper syndicate ({''}Project Syndicate{''}). All the results
   obtained indicate that the new type of intellectual cannot be
   sufficiently captured in the sociological terms suggested by Bourdieu or
   Foucault. Ergo, I conclude with a plea to extend the given
   phenomenologies of the intellectual on the basis of an empirical guided
   investigation into the styles of public interventions},

Abstract = {The public administration through its bodies decides on rights, legal
   conditions and responsibilities of other subjects. This requests, at the
   same time, subsequent control of observance of legal enactments, legal
   norms, performance of the tasks efficiency and purposefulness. Public
   administration as goal-directed activity can include the control as the
   part of its functioning but the public administration itself can be the
   object of control from the side of other subjects. The aim of paper is
   to analyze the mutual relation and foundation of interconnection of
   public administration with the control activity, to analyze the control
   in the field of state administration and territorial self-government
   regarding their own particularities. At the same time, the paper also
   mentions potential insufficiencies of current control system and
   possibilities of their elimination.},

Abstract = {In 2010 and 2011, the Guatemalan democracy experienced processes which
   hampered governance. Both years accounted for the second part of the
   Government headed by the engineer Alvaro Colon The initial expectation
   of alleged Government guidance became its rapid weakening. Social
   programs, the initial strategy of his management, led to a patronage.
   The interest of the presidents Colom ex wife in participating in
   elections in late 2011 and the subsequent ``presidential divorce{''}
   meant a greater degree of wear and loss of credibility of the
   Government. The advancement of the electoral process, the weakness of
   the Supreme Electoral Court (Tribunal Supremo Electoral), the continuity
   of the fragile system, of political parties, excessive and opaque
   private campaign financing linked to organized crime, sparked a
   paradigmatic electoral process. Political Parties choices represented a
   reduced spectrum, conservative and dominated by authoritarian options.
   In a economic level, although the country was not affected by the
   effects of the global economic crisis, the weakening in the management
   of public finances, the increase in the public debt to levels never
   before known and the consequences of the series of natural disasters
   that occurred annually as a result of climate change, generated a
   complex scenario with serious consequences to the following Governments.
   Levels of crime and violence remained high in Guatemala, just below
   Honduras and El Salvador. The presence of organized crime and in
   particular drug trafficking networks was even throughout the country.
   The 2011 were held in a climate of weak electoral institutions, high
   levels of electoral violence and a struggle between cartels for
   territorial control, highlighting the advance of los Zeta organized
   crime group.},

Title = {Descriptive representation and AIDS policy in South Africa},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY POLITICS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {18},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {156-173},
Abstract = {The global AIDS pandemic raises key questions with respect to Pitkin's
   seminal concerns for the descriptive and substantive representation of
   diverse citizen interests. Specifically, are there `group interests' for
   AIDS-related policies, and are they represented by political leaders?
   One might expect all politicians to prioritize a response to the global
   pandemic as a matter of public interest, especially in high prevalence
   countries. Alternatively, because recognizable sub-groups are affected
   differently, theories of representation imply that leader preferences
   should vary along these lines. The author explores the local political
   representation of AIDS-related interests within the context of the high
   prevalence, heterogeneous, and democratic society of South Africa.
   Through analysis of an original survey of the attitudes and preferences
   of local cancillors in Eastern Cape Province, he found that descriptive
   representation is associated with substantive representation:
   politicians express AIDS policy preferences in accordance with race-and
   gender-based interests, albeit in different ways.},

Abstract = {In their book Challenges to Consensual Politics: Democracy, Identity,
   and Populist Protest in the Alpine Region, Daniele Caramani and Yves
   Meny argue that the Alpine region displays a political culture
   characterized, among other things, by marked conservatism, nativism and
   Euroscepticism. Such transnational political culture manifests itself
   throughout the Alpine arch by the presence of successful
   ethno-regionalist, right-wing populist and Eurosceptic parties. In the
   same book, however, Michael Keating proposes a more nuanced thesis.
   While the above-mentioned characteristics are, indeed, predominant in
   the Germanic-speaking area of the Alps (with some spill-over effects in
   the Italian-speaking area), the French-speaking area boasts a more
   progressive political culture. The paper aims to explore this
   alternative thesis by analysing the ideological identities of two
   ethno-regionalist parties operating in the Francophone Alpine area-the
   Union Valdotaine in Italy and the Ligue Savoisienne in France. The
   analysis substantiates Caramani and Meny's thesis, revealing how most
   ideological aspects present in other Alpine areas, such as localism,
   traditionalist conservatism, work ethics and reluctance to share wealth
   with others, are very strong in Savoy and Aosta valley too. However, the
   lack or weakness of crucial populist radical-right ideological elements,
   such as open xenophobia, racism and Euroscepticism, appears to support
   Keating's alternative thesis.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE EDUCATION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {8},
Number = {3},
Pages = {271-287},
Abstract = {For those times when political science is again confronted with
   questions about its usefulness, we suggest that the classroom is a
   central arena for our discipline to reassert its relevance to the
   society in which we live. In particular, given the existence of our open
   and accessible political system, we argue that the introductory course
   taught as a general education requirement by nearly every political
   science department provides unique advantages for political science to
   justify itself as a relevant and necessary endeavor in comparison with
   most other academic disciplines. However, to truly take advantage of the
   unique position of political science we need to reevaluate some of our
   most basic assumptions about the reasons we have for teaching these
   introductory classes. Incorporating the latest research in teaching
   methods and theories of learning, we totally redesigned an introductory
   course from the ground up, basing this course around semester-long group
   projects geared towards enhancing the internal efficacy of our students
   as a means of increasing their comprehension of the material. In this
   article, we discuss the results from our implementation of this course
   design in the fall of 2009, demonstrating the effectiveness of the
   teaching model in both increasing the political efficacy of our students
   while simultaneously improving their knowledge of our political system.
   We conclude with a discussion of just how powerful this method of
   teaching our introductory classes can be as a justification for the
   entire edifice of political science itself.},
