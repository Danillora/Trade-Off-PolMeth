   experience},

Abstract = {Governments when faced with countering terrorism have a number of
   options at their disposal. One such option is the collection of
   intelligence, and human intelligence can provide valuable information on
   terrorist groups and their activities. `Tout', `informer', `informant',
   `source', `agent', `grass', `mole' and `nark' are some of the labels
   used to describe what law enforcement terms a Covert Human Intelligence
   Source. They are in fact individuals who provide information as part of
   a covert or secret arrangement. Informants, for that will be the
   descriptive term used for the purpose of this paper, are an interesting
   phenomenon in themselves, but even more so when considering their use in
   the context of the `Troubles' in Northern Ireland. Informants
   undoubtedly played a role in countering terrorism during the period but
   remain the subject of controversy and fascination. Their presence served
   to provide intelligence, to disrupt activity and cause paranoia within
   terrorist ranks. This paper examines the rationale for their deployment,
   their utilization in Northern Ireland and the recruitment processes
   engaged in by the security forces. There will also be a discussion of
   the ethical and legal dilemmas faced by law enforcement and intelligence
   gathering agencies engaged in their use.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL POWER},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {5},
Number = {2},
Pages = {279-299},
Abstract = {Organization theory, Clegg pointed out, has failed to address the role
   of organizations in some of the crimes of/against humanity, suggesting
   that more attention should be given to the case of total institutions.
   With this paper we respond to Clegg's invitation and study the S-21
   extermination camp, in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. We do so by engaging with
   the work of the Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben, with the aim of
   investigating the organizational patterns that constitute the camp as a
   `State of Exception'. Doing so shows us how organizations can become
   malign forces for evil. We explore the implications of this case for
   more general `Kafkaesque organization', that sometimes reproduce, in
   more benign forms, many of the practices found at S-21.},

Abstract = {Benefiting from the relatively benign environment of the Asia-Pacific of
   the past sixty years, Australia's government has been able to go beyond
   its stated `Defence of Australia' policy to undertake military
   operations outside of its immediate neighbourhood, in support of its
   allies. As austerity begins to bite, however, Australian defence
   planners no longer have the luxury of creating a `balanced force' - and
   this at a strategically critical time in the region, as major powers
   rise and the US calls for greater support from its partners. Andrew
   Davies analyses what the future may hold for Australian defence, with
   key decisions about the submarine programme to provide the first test.},

   in Comparative Perspective},
Journal = {AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {47},
Number = {1},
Pages = {91-113},
Abstract = {This paper explores the impact of political trust and efficacy on
   citizens' opposition to government anti-terrorism police powers in
   Australia and five other nations with different levels of overall trust
   and confidence in government. Survey data are used to examine patterns
   of opposition to unlimited detention, random stop-and-searches, and
   telephone wiretap surveillance. While trust in government represents a
   powerful constraint on citizens' support for extending police powers in
   nations with historically low levels of trust, such as Russia and
   Taiwan, it plays almost no role in high-trust nations such as Australia,
   where citizens seem more concerned about governmental policy performance
   than abuse of authority. Overall, because citizens' trust and confidence
   in government vary nation by nation, the introduction of government
   anti-terror policies is received in distinctly different ways, allowing
   important insights into the nexus between political trust and
   governmental performance and authority.},

Abstract = {Rather than adhering to the cost-benefit calculus often employed in the
   study of turnout, a recent stream in this literature refers to voting as
   habit forming. The empirical findings supporting this developmental
   approach are still scarce, however. Using voting-age discontinuities
   among almost equally aged individuals, this study enables the
   identification of the effect of voting in one election on turnout in
   future elections. Tracing individuals for more than 30 years of their
   lives, the long-term effect of early voting experiences on people's
   turnout profiles is also examined. The findings show early voting
   experiences shape future voting profiles. Moreover, casting a ballot
   does not boost non-electoral participation.},

Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},

Volume = {35},
Number = {4},
Pages = {869-895},
Abstract = {Election manifestos are one of the most prominent sources of data for
   the study of party politics and government. Yet the processes of
   manifesto production, enactment, and public reception are not very well
   understood. This article attempts to narrow this knowledge gap by
   conducting a first investigation into the `life cycle' of election
   manifestos from the drafting stage to their use in the campaign and
   post-election periods. Specifically, it investigates the Austrian case
   between 1945 and 2008 (with special emphasis on the 1990s and 2000s),
   employing a wealth of qualitative and quantitative data. While the
   research is thus mostly exploratory, it develops systematic expectations
   about variation between parties according to their ideology,
   organisation, government status, and characteristics of their
   electorates across the stages of the manifesto life cycle. Of those
   factors, organisational characteristics and status as government or
   opposition parties were found to be relevant.},

Abstract = {It is known that those recently moved are less likely to vote. If the
   decision to vote is a cost-benefit calculation, then those intending to
   move may also be less likely to vote as they will not be affected by the
   local result. This self-interested calculation might be mitigated if
   people vote sociotropically. We show that the effect of intending to
   move is conditional on levels of social capital: those who have invested
   in their community are less affected by their intention to move in their
   decision whether to vote. Using survey data from the UK we show that (a)
   those intending to move are less likely to vote, (b) higher social
   capital increases the likelihood of voting and (c) the negative effect
   of intending to move diminishes when people have more social investments
   in their community.},

Abstract = {Understanding the state in Latin America requires an understanding of
   the challenges and challengers that it is facing. This paper argues that
   the region's three major transitions at the end of the 20th century
   (i.e. democratization, liberalization and decentralization) each posed
   distinct challenges to the state. It then uses the concept of
   infrastructural power to conceptualize the actors who are challenging
   the state, distinguishing between those who threaten either its
   territorial power or its relational power. Turning from challenges and
   challengers to responses, the paper identifies three different types of
   changes (i.e. policy, institutional, and regime) that states have
   adopted to undercut, accommodate, or defeat challengers. Finally, the
   paper underscores the difficulty of measuring state deficits in
   post-decentralization Latin America.},

Abstract = {The eighth annual conference of historical materialism, sponsored by a
   critical Marxist journal of the same name, was held in London from 10 to
   13 November 2011 with the theme of `spaces of capital, moments of
   struggle'. Echoing the on-going international social movements in
   general and the forthcoming general strike in London in particular, the
   conference attracted Marxist and leftist scholars and activists from
   many countries around the world. This paper summarizes some of the
   highlights of this important event, with the hope of informing those who
   were not able to attend but wish to hear what was presented in London.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the way in which the Dutch colonial authorities,
   notably the military, tried to organize their defence forces,
   state-owned and auxiliary, in the teeth of growing Indonesian resistance
   against re-instituted Dutch domination between 1945 and 1950. It will
   focus mainly on the indigenous Plantation Guard, a static defence force
   designed to protect the plantations that were considered vital to a
   successful Dutch return to Indonesia. Attempts to stifle the resistance
   came down heavily on the military side: the authorities, with the help
   of the planters' community in Indonesia, established one security force
   after another, dominated by the military. They ultimately created a
   security matrix they could not control as the parties concerned
   squabbled over who was to `own' the security forces. In the end, the
   resulting disunity benefited the insurgents, leaving those Indonesians
   perceived to be collaborating with the Dutch unprotected and vulnerable.},

Abstract = {Globalization processes have changed the concept of ``territory{''},
   which is less perceived as a physical support and more as a collective
   construction. In this context strategic planning is considered an
   instrument of territorial governance aimed at transforming the
   territories and achieving further development through the mobilization
   of their territorial capital. However, this renewed interest in urban
   strategic planning contrasts with the lack of studies from the
   governance perspective. This article analyses the increasing importance
   of the ``new generation{''} of strategic planning in the current
   European context, especially in the framework of the Cohesion policy,
   and provides an operational definition to assess its impact in terms of
   governance.},

Volume = {8},

Abstract = {The main interest of this paper in exploring the rise of environmental
   nongovernmental organizations (ENGOs) active in Shanghai is to determine
   their efficacy in influencing green politics and whether the outcome of
   the negotiation process (with the state) is successful or not. What is
   meant by efficacy for the purpose of this paper is the ability to
   generate pressure for political response with regards to environmental
   problems. Throughout the article, major case studies in which ENGOs have
   played a critical role in generating political response to environmental
   problems will be presented and studied. Theoretical literature from
   foreign and Chinese sources will be analysed and compared, in order to
   detect whether these case studies represent singular incidents or
   examples of a common phenomenon. Inherent difficulties in researching a
   complex topic like the influence of ENGOs active in Shanghai on green
   politics make some of the arguments in this article plain tentative.
   Further empirical as well as statistical data will be needed to provide
   more detailed conclusions.},

Journal = {CIVIL WARS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {14},
Number = {4},
Pages = {477-498},
Abstract = {Sub-Saharan Africa has shifted from having a low population density and
   no population growth in the 19th century to an extremely high population
   growth today. I argue here that an important cause behind contemporary
   civil conflict has been this rapid demographic shift. Specifically, I
   show that low population densities in Africa historically contributed to
   communal land rights and the creation of large states. In the
   postcolonial era, however, these two variables have combined with high
   population growth rates, low levels of urbanization, and rural-rural
   migration flows to produce large amounts of `sons of the soil' conflict
   over land. Evidence from contemporary civil wars in Sudan and the
   Democratic Republic of Congo supports my theory.},

Volume = {11},

Pages = {75-94},
Abstract = {This article proposes that political marketing and lobbying have much to
   learn from each other. Both are essentially persuasive forms of
   communication; both have some basis in more general marketing theory;
   both involve exchanges, networks, and relationships. However, while much
   lobbying practice is underpinned or informed by (political) marketing
   theories, this connection is only rarely made explicit in the literature
   of either field. Most political marketing writing relates marketing
   solely to the arena of party political electoral competition, ignoring
   how it could be developed further into the area of interest groups
   generally and, more specifically, into an examination of how
   organizations attempt to influence public policy. This paper looks
   briefly at lobbying activities, such as grassroots lobbying and lobbying
   coalitions, and suggests how political marketing can extend its research
   focus to a wider range of lobbying practices. It seeks to identify the
   conceptual basis for the beginnings of a marketing perspective on
   lobbying. Lobbyists can learn from it how to put marketing principles to
   practice, and academics will gain an understanding of how this analysis
   can be applied and further developed.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL CRITICAL THOUGHT},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {2},
Number = {1},
Pages = {42-49},
Abstract = {The paper suggests that ruthless dismantling of social achievements of
   the welfare state brings about exactly the same situation as that
   described by Marx in the mid-nineteenth century: the conditions of the
   communist movement result from the premises now in existence.
   Reservations regarding the term `communism' are more of a political
   nature; the term seems inappropriate only as long as it is associated
   with the Soviet system; this is why the author prefers an
   `anti-capitalist alternative'. The current crisis of capitalism can be
   interpreted in the context of Marx's model as a conflict between
   production forces and relations of production, while new political
   economy will involve new forms of communization. With a certain level of
   education and dissemination of mass information on a global scale, what
   is badly needed is participation in political decision-making in
   response to the crisis, coupled with the conviction that the ruling
   elites have lost their legitimacy. This is a common feature of sudden
   political upheavals in various parts of the world, regardless of the
   difference in conditions.},

Abstract = {This paper takes a constructivist approach to examining one of the new
   norms embodied in the recently revised International Health Regulations
   (IHR). The paper focuses on the provisions that seek to restrain states
   from applying disproportionate international travel and trade
   restrictions in response to a disease outbreak occurring in another
   country. This new norm, which aims to limit unjustified `additional
   health measures', has significant implications for state sovereignty.
   Using the example of the 2009 H1N1 `swine flu' pandemic, the paper
   examines whether state behaviour and the discourse surrounding that
   outbreak supports a constructivist contention that a new norm has been
   created and that most states can be expected to comply with that norm
   most of the time. We conclude by discussing what the discourse over H1N1
   suggests about the extent to which the new norm concerning additional
   health measures has been internalized by states.},

Abstract = {Is Russian literature abroad still adequately represented in
   translation? The Russian media is currently discussing this question. In
   German speaking countries, almost thirty translations of Russian fiction
   were published in 2011, somewhat fewer than in previous years. Notable
   contributions among them, however, include new versions of modern texts
   (Ivan Bunin, Evgenii Zamiatin, Viacheslav Ivanov, Marina Tsvetaeva,
   Daniil Kharms) and first-time translations of major novels and stories
   by artistically ambitious living writers (Mikhail Shishkin, Vladimir
   Makanin, Andrei Gelasimov, Denis Osokin, Dmitry Dergachev).},

   regimes},
Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {16},
Number = {2},
Pages = {153-172},
Abstract = {This article studies the multiple connections between contemporary
   structures of German and Turkish citizenship, and German-Turkish
   migrants' own practices of citizenship transcending national borders.
   Hence, the citizenship structures of the two countries and the ways in
   which they shape and are shaped by the migrants' civic activism shall be
   exposed in a dialogical way. It will be argued that German-Turks
   constitute a transnational space, making it imperative that the existing
   institutions of citizenship in both countries respond to their
   globalized and transnationalized experiences. Addressing the literature
   on transnational space, citizenship studies, diaspora studies and
   cultural studies, and referring to a survey conducted among
   German-Turks, this work will briefly refer to the production of
   transnational space by immigrants of Turkish origin and their
   descendants in Germany and the use they make of the means of
   globalization, which provide them with a set of diversified habitats of
   meaning away from their country of origin. Subsequently, it will claim
   that the traditional framework of national citizenship has been
   superseded as transmigrants have become mobile between their countries
   of origin and of settlement in a way that may require dual citizenship
   as well as dual loyalty, allegiance and orientation.},

Volume = {39},
Number = {2},
Pages = {189-208},
Abstract = {A dramatic outburst of xenophobic violence in May 2008 spotlighted South
   Africa's place among countries of immigration. While a plethora of
   policy studies have examined many micro-level dynamics in these attacks,
   surprisingly little attention has been paid to underlying political
   causes. By applying the comparative `immigration state' literature, I
   offer a counter-intuitive, two-part explanation for the complex and
   often contradictory mix of South African migration policies. First, the
   historical absence of a `rights-markets' coalition allows for the
   persistence of exclusionary and protectionist legislation. Second,
   post-apartheid international commitments to `rights-markets' norms have
   contributed to significant reforms, especially regarding refugees, but
   these pressures have not fully counter-balanced the predominant
   exclusionary and protectionist coalition. Democratization in the absence
   of a liberal `rights-markets' coalition, I conclude, has reinforced
   xenophobia and will continue to produce only incremental policy reforms.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to underline a more broad and complex
   approach towards the regulation of lobbying. Our objective here is to
   provide a systematic enumeration of possible regulatory alternatives.
   This research involves the examination of the most notable and
   significant cases of lobbying regulation in the western world and is
   based largely on the textual analysis of relevant regulatory documents.
   We do not, however, intend to present the detailed mapping of lobbying
   regulation in all possible arenas, or evaluate these means, or even
   recommend particular regulatory options or instruments. We therefore
   suggest an analytical framework highlighting three important points that
   should be clarified in each regulatory system: 1) the actors involved in
   lobbying, 2) the form of regulation, and 3) the regulatory means and
   instruments. The proposed topography of lobbying regulation can serve as
   a general basis for the further analysis of regulatory schemes and their
   comparison, but also as a guide for those considering regulatory
   options.},

Journal = {AFRICAN SECURITY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Pages = {24-43},
Abstract = {This article argues that, instead of criticizing Beijing for security
   free-riding and noncooperation in liberal peace projects in Africa, we
   should engage with Beijing's perspective on African security and its
   rationale for noninterference in Africa's domestic affairs. Beijing
   views the liberal peace project as the neocolonial hegemonic imposition
   of the West and, furthermore, believes it contributes to African
   insecurity. This view comes from China's communication with African
   elites, Beijing's own historical experiences with colonialism, and a mix
   of realist, Marxist, and postcolonial analysis. China's assessment of
   African security is state-centric and elite focused. This study
   discusses how and why Beijing's understanding of and policy for African
   security has evolved and the direction it is likely to take in the
   future.},

Journal = {CONTEMPORARY POLITICS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {18},
Number = {1},
Pages = {71-86},
Abstract = {The research investigates young Pakistanis' self-articulation of their
   relationship with the state and what factors play a role in determining
   their views. The article argues that beyond the issues traditionally
   seen as causing the instability of the Pakistani state (which include
   sectarian and ethnic faultlines as well as the role of the army), there
   is another between ordinary citizens and the state. Although there are
   provincial differences, people at large feel alienated by the state and
   the concept of citizenship has become hazy as it is often mixed up with
   the issue of identity. Given the paucity of rights and responsibilities
   and the lack of political participation, the problems across Pakistani
   society are ever increasing. The research used a mixed methods approach
   and 1300 questionnaires were collected in 27 different education
   institutions across three provinces. On aggregate response the research
   found that there is a high sense of belonging to the nation, yet
   paradoxically also a high sense of alienation with regard to the state.
   Whilst most of those surveyed professed awareness of their rights and
   duties, as well as political awareness, political participation was very
   low. The qualitative section of the questionnaire exemplified the level
   of alienation and anger felt by many across the various institutions and
   provinces.},

Abstract = {This article considers a `new-old' media - that is, a relatively newly
   created medium with deep historical roots - that has gained increasing
   popularity in recent years: a subgenre of the comic book, most often
   referred to as the graphic novel. Presented here as an antidote to
   dominant interpretations of political violence ranging from the state
   terrorism of the Holocaust to the events of 9/11, the article briefly
   traces the history of graphic novels and details their growing
   popularity before describing and analysing representations of terrorism,
   both written and visual, in eight paradigmatic works that purvey
   variously victim, survivor and perpetrator perspectives.},

Pages = {545-560},
Abstract = {What is the political locus of the ``holy trinity{''} of institutional
   attributes: legitimacy, autonomy, and capacity? Is it the state, the
   regime, or the government? This paper proposes a return to the Weberian
   definition of the state and the incorporation of micro-foundations in
   order to re-analyze the meaning of ``state legitimacy{''}, ``state
   capacity{''} and ``state autonomy{''}. An important result of the
   analysis is a novel, albeit classical, definition of ``state policy{''}
   (as opposed to government policy) and of ``state autonomy{''}, in which
   the state can be captured not only by powerful economic groups but also
   by the government itself An illustration of the usefulness of the
   assessment is provided by a brief application of the concepts to the
   analysis of the varieties of the ``Left turn{''} in South America.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the Berlin Land election of September 2011 which
   resulted in a degree of continuity but also some change. It examines the
   campaigns of the main parties, the results - some predictable, others
   less so - and offers possible explanations. It then looks at the process
   of coalition formation which eventually resulted in a red-black
   coalition senate headed by incumbent governing mayor Klaus Wowereit.
   Attention is also paid to the question of whether or not electoral
   convergence has now occurred between the two halves of the capital.},

Title = {Muslims and Politics: Islamic communities as religious interest groups},
Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {49},
Number = {3},
Pages = {591-608},
Abstract = {The growing presence of Muslims in Spain sets new demands and strains
   that examine the ability of Spanish society to accept ``other{''}
   religions and ``other{''} cultural practices. Based on a concept of
   interest groups, we can expect the creation of associations representing
   those interests. This paper analyzes the collective behaviour and
   configuration of interests of Muslims in the city of Granada. We rely on
   two case studies to draw our conclusions: first, the long Muslim claim
   to have an Islamic cemetery and, secondly, the tense negotiations about
   ``el Dia de la Toma{''}. We have used a qualitative methodology based on
   interviews with key players and references to local press, official
   documents and private reports. We provide some conclusions: first, in
   regard to their organization, we must understand the Islamic communities
   - varied, numerous and not always connected-as the most representative
   interlocutors. Second, their influence will be characterized by their
   (to date) outsider position, something that will prevent them from
   developing high-impact, short-time strategies. And third, continuity in
   claims leads them to achieve, in whole or in part, their goals.},

Number = {27},
Pages = {11-42},
Month = {JAN-JUN},
Abstract = {This paper fulfills three purposes related to the municipality: (a) sets
   out the rationale and arguments of the municipality as socio-political
   entity and basic political and administrative division of the Nation,
   which requires a qualitative leap towards modernization, (b) indicates
   specifically that the social body, the territorial body and
   environmental envelope are its dimensions, as seen on a local scale,
   with strategic management in its steering role, (c) establishes a
   realistic vision of the Venezuelan municipality to provide a set of
   guidelines for the construction of its future within a framework of
   human development that is also harmonious and sustainable. The focus was
   to address the requirements of the local society. An emphasis was placed
   on the socio-political aspects without neglecting the
   territory-environmental requirements and at the same time keeping in
   sight the administrative aspects since they are all dimensions and
   functions where the idea of a modern municipality converge. Research was
   conducted in key municipal institutions, a dense literature review was
   undertaken and a dialog was conducted with institutional actors of
   municipal power. This strategy was able to generate the required
   knowledge. To restore lost rights to the municipality is to place it as
   the efficient, transparent, and social relevant institution that is
   necessary to build the future. The opposite is a walk on the path of
   frustration.},

Volume = {14},

Pages = {104-122},
Abstract = {In the 1990s, vivid accounts of atrocities committed by Sierra Leone's
   drug-fuelled child soldiers contributed to the portrayal of so-called
   `resource wars' as some violent descent into a primordial anarchy. The
   academic rebuttal that inevitably followed stressed, by contrast, the
   very ordered nature of civil conflict, placing the rational actor at the
   centre of supposedly `irrational' violence. This article nevertheless
   finds the rational-actor argument inadequate for explaining the most
   seemingly senseless acts of atrocity and calls for greater focus on
   expressive and psychological micro-foundations of violence in the study
   of civil wars.},

Journal = {CIVIL WARS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {14},
Number = {4},
Pages = {521-545},
Abstract = {An important aspect in the resolution of civil conflict pertains to the
   political transition of rebel groups, dissipation of their command
   structures and reintegration of former combatants. In this paper, we
   draw on empirical data collected in select communities of Lanao,
   Cotabato and Maguindanao provinces of Mindanao, Philippines during June
   2010 to explore future trends in civilian support for the main
   separatist rebel outfit in Mindanao - the Moro Islamic Liberation Front
   (MILF). We test variance in the existence of recruitment pools among the
   two main Muslim ethnic groups - the Maranao and the Maguindanao. Our
   findings suggest that recruitment into MILF is not simply about religion
   or ideology, this is a simplification of its underlying support base.
   Several factors such as geographic location, especially proximity to
   Armed Forces of the Philippines camps, and conflict-related impacts of
   displacement, together with disparity in governance delivery levels,
   have resulted in divergence in levels of support for the Bangsamoro
   struggle between the two main ethnic groups. These variables will have
   an impact on the future existence of the MILF as a rebel movement.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the interaction between transportation policy and
   climate change policy in two Canadian provinces, British Columbia and
   Ontario. The concept of policy capacity is used to qualitatively measure
   the effectiveness of instruments in advancing goals in an area where
   established policy paradigms may not be congruent with new initiatives.
   A review of official policy documents and budgetary information on
   policy-related spending, as well as primary interviews with policy
   managers in relevant provincial ministries, reveals that overlapping
   policy goals and instruments may have created a situation of
   institutionalized policy inhibition, in which conflicting layers of
   policy goals and instruments constrain the available policy capacity.},

Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {35},
Number = {4},
Pages = {911-932},
Abstract = {This article investigates the reasons why the EU tried to promote
   environmental norms in the Doha round. It argues that the EU's support
   of a `greener' World Trade Organization stems from tensions between the
   rigidity of the domestic dynamics of positive integration in the EU and
   the increased bindingness of negative integration commitments undertaken
   under the WTO. Consensual decision-making procedures in the EU led
   societal groups to push for stringent food safety and environmental
   regulations in the EU, and made them very resistant to change. These
   dynamics of positive integration, however, produced rules that were
   inconsistent with negative integration commitments undertaken under the
   WTO, at a time when the creation of a quasi-judicial dispute settlement
   mechanism in the trade regime had greatly increased the bindingness of
   WTO rules. As a result of the twofold effect of domestic and
   international institutional constraints, EU decision-makers were subject
   to compelling incentives to try and strengthen legitimate exceptions
   from WTO rules and immunise European regulation against WTO legal
   challenges. Empirical evidence on how the EU shaped its
   trade-and-environment agenda in the run-up to the Doha Round in 2001, as
   well as how it negotiated in the subsequent period, lends support to the
   argument.},

Abstract = {In his analysis of piaculiar rites in The Elementary Forms of Religious
   Life, Durkheim outlines a sociology of evil of general interest. This
   sociology conceives evil as a social fact and explains the rites of
   mourning and atonement, the belief in malignant powers and the ritual
   purge of evil. Durkheim relates evil with the ambiguity of the sacred,
   causing serious tensions in his theoretical system. He also addresses
   the problem of theodicy for which he proposes a lay solution in the form
   of a functional based sociodicy.},

Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},

Volume = {16},
Number = {5-6, SI},
Pages = {605-623},
Abstract = {Guided by the claims of the feminist and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and
   transgender social movements and international human rights agendas,
   governments in late modern democracies have been implementing (or
   pressured to implement) new juridical frames to recognise sexual
   diversity. As a result, in the last two decades, gendered and sexual
   `others' have been `included' in citizenship leading to the formulation
   of what has been called `sexual citizenship', propounding the formation
   of new sexual rights-bearing subjects. However, this seemingly
   respectable and progressive contemporary sexual citizen has become the
   benchmark against which all sexual subjects are measured, and involves a
   particular liberal self that has been constituted against a myriad of
   `others' marked by cultural, religious and racialised differences. How
   has this `sexual citizen' been constituted and how does it operate
   within the political field of struggles over sexual freedom and justice?
   This article explores to what extent the sexual citizen has been
   configured in Euro-American terms within political liberalism, and how
   colonial and orientalist ideas about sexual citizenship and democracy
   follow on from this restricted notion of the subject of rights.},

Abstract = {Health policies developed in Venezuela in recent years reflect the new
   concept of health embodied in the Bolivarian Constitution of Venezuela.
   This article analyzes the guidelines of the National Public Health
   System regarding social participation in health in Venezuela. The
   methodology was based on documentary analysis of the Health Law Project
   and the National Public Health System of 2004, according to Casilla's
   Participatory Action Model (2003). Among the most striking results, it
   was found that the aforementioned law seeks to ensure a better quality
   of life; strengthen the social participation of individuals and
   collectives to defend and protect the right to health; satisfy social
   needs for quality of life and health in a population; formulate, plan
   and regulate policies, plans and actions regarding health, as well as
   manage services, their evaluation and control with the participation of
   society. Conclusions were that social participation is the fundamental
   basis for public policy in Venezuela, which is evident transversally in
   the Health Law Project and the National Public Health System.},

Pages = {109-126},
Abstract = {The 2011 presidential elections in Peru was the third one held in the
   post-Fujimori era. A perusal of the campaign's political dynamics
   reveals pervasive anti-democratic behaviours, attitudes and rhetoric on
   the part of key political actors, showcasing the degree to which Peru
   remains an unconsolidated, precarious democracy. The second round
   presented a moral and political dilemma insofar as two unsavoury
   candidates of highly dubious democratic credentials vied for the
   presidency: Ollanta Humala, a former army lieutenant burdened by
   accusations of human rights violations who, additionally, led or
   supported two military uprisings; and Keiko Fujimori, the daughter of a
   convicted and jailed dictator who unabashedly touted the legacy of her
   father's authoritarian regime and surrounded herself with tainted
   fujimoristas. The paradox of this undesirable electoral outcome, which
   can be read as a popular rebuke of the status quo, is that it took place
   in the Latin American country posting the fastest economic growth over
   the past decade.},

Abstract = {The euro crisis poses a fundamental challenge to the European Union but
   also to the theories of European integration. Whereas
   intergovernmentalism provides the best explanation of the original
   design of Economic and Monetary Union, it is losing explanatory power in
   the crisis. The intergovernmental logic of integration based on
   exogenous preferences and state bargaining power gives way to the
   neofunctionalist logic. Transnational interdependence, autonomous
   supranational organizations, endogenous preferences, path dependency,
   and spillover drive the process and have produced more integration in
   fiscal policy. As expected by postfunctionalism, however, the crisis
   politicizes European integration and increases Euro-skeptic mobilization
   at the same time, thus putting into danger the further integration and
   cohesion of the Eurozone. So far, however, the neofunctionalist logic
   has prevailed.},

Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE PEACE \& SECURITY},

Pages = {71-81},
Abstract = {For more than fifty years, the World Health Organization has helped
   monitor flu viruses and manufacture vaccines through the Global
   Influenza Surveillance Network (GISN). However, GISN became a flashpoint
   for conflict when Indonesia refused to share its samples of avian
   influenza until drugs and other benefits were shared in return. Years of
   controversial negotiations were required to agree on a framework for
   virus and benefit sharing, providing important insights into disease
   surveillance, global norms, and international law. First, this
   controversy suggests that surveillance behaves like a luxury good, which
   complicates the conventional wisdom that it is a global public good.
   Second, even well-established norms were not immune to challenge,
   thereby limiting the significance of `tipping points' and `normative
   cascades'. Finally, legal arguments were common in this controversy but
   equivocal and inconclusive, so international law is unlikely to affect
   important outcomes relating to outbreak response.},

Pages = {593-612},
Abstract = {Which standards should we employ to evaluate the global order? Should
   they be standards of justice or standards of legitimacy? In this
   article, I argue that liberal political theorists need not face this
   dilemma, because liberal justice and legitimacy are not distinct values.
   Rather, they indicate what the same value, i.e. equal respect for
   persons, demands of institutions under different sets of circumstances.
   I suggest that under real-world circumstances - characterized by
   conflicts and disagreements - equal respect demands basic-rights
   protection and democratic participation, which I here call `political
   justice'. I conclude the article by considering three possible
   configurations of the global order - the `democratic world-state',
   `independent democratic states', and `mixed' models - and argue that a
   commitment to political justice speaks in favour of the latter.},

Title = {The next nuclear wave: renaissance or proliferation risk?},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE PEACE \& SECURITY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {24},
Number = {1},
Pages = {127-140},
Abstract = {This article examines the extent of the so-called `civil nuclear
   renaissance' and the danger it poses to the integrity of the
   international non-proliferation regime. It also explores the drivers
   behind the resurgent interest in nuclear energy, as well as the
   arguments against increased reliance on nuclear power. The article
   argues that growing interest in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy -
   even when tempered by strong safety, environmental, economic and
   security concerns - poses a real challenge to global non-proliferation
   objectives, a challenge exacerbated by the contradiction at the heart of
   the non-proliferation treaty architecture. However, the article does not
   accept the view that civil nuclear capability will inexorably lead to
   proliferation. Rather, it finds that motive is as central as capability
   in determining the likelihood of proliferation, and highlights the
   difficulties of safeguarding against future intentions. Following a
   brief discussion of the Southeast Asian and North Asian contexts, the
   paper concludes with a short discussion of how proliferation risks
   stemming from an increase in nuclear energy might be mitigated.},

   out that, in the economic field, the strength of the macroeconomic
   regime and the little leverage in the capitalized financial system
   created a more balanced approach to financial market regulation. In
   foreign policy dimension, such states took advantage of institutional
   windows of opportunity seeking to develop rules, norms and procedures
   that matched their interests to develop and expand their autonomy and
   participation in major international decisions.},

Abstract = {The article examines theoretical aspects of regional dimension in
   international relations and the ways to apply in practice the results of
   world politics' analysis from the viewpoint of regional and
   macro-regional levels. It also considers the key discussion points on
   regions and macro-regions in the world and Russian research literature.
   The author concludes that this is exactly the new IR concepts of
   regional level which should become the prototype of original Russian
   regional and country studies. These studies need to have a higher degree
   of theoretical conceptualization of regional level as their basis. Such
   an approach will enable the researchers to draw deep and unconventional
   conclusions of practical use especially as far as the non-Western parts
   of the world which are traditionally less examined by Western
   researchers, theorists and practitioners are concerned.},

Abstract = {Turkey's activism in former Yugoslavia is a continuation of the
   country's post-Cold War strategy in the broader context of South East
   Europe. It is driven largely by structural shifts related to the spread
   of democracy, Europeanization and globalization, rather than by ideology
   or Ottoman nostalgia. Despite its vanishing appeal, the EU remains
   essential in understanding Turkey's place in regional politics. The
   Union's expansion has deepened interdependence across South East Europe
   and transformed the Turkish approach: from power politics to a
   multidimensional policy reliant on trade, cross-border investment, and
   projection of soft power. Although Ankara is acting in a growingly
   unilateralist manner and could be viewed as a competitor in some Western
   capitals, Turkish policies are benefiting from Brussels and Washington's
   investment in the stabilisation and integration of the Western Balkans.},

Abstract = {This study, based on a statewide survey of local officials in Florida,
   examines the degree to which vertical and horizontal roadblocks to
   interlocal cooperation persist well after the 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina
   mega-disasters. Respondents evaluate the degree to which vertical
   constraints (state and federal mandates) and horizontal constraints
   (political tensions and competition for funding; incompatible
   communication equipment and inconsistent information-sharing; and local
   cost-sharing complexities and training and personnel qualification
   differences) still deter collaboration. Incompatible communication
   equipment is the most cited barrier, followed by the rules and legal
   complexities inherent in state and federal mandates and interlocal
   cost-sharing agreements. Today, local EM officials judge horizontally
   generated deterrents to collaboration to be nearly equal to vertically
   imposed roadblocks. Perceptions differ significantly by jurisdiction,
   population size, MSA location, and position.},

Abstract = {This article constitutes a comparative analysis of nineteenth-century
   ``restoration presidents{''}-presidents from the dominant party who come
   to power immediately following opposition presidents-to determine the
   extent to which they were able to act as free agents or were bound by
   prior commitments. These presidents established the pattern for
   leadership of which George W. Bush is the latest exemplar. Specifically,
   this article focuses attention on the Jacksonian Democrats following the
   Whig presidencies (Polk and Pierce) and the Republicans following
   Cleveland's two administrations (Harrison and McKinley). A recurrent
   pattern in these presidencies is that they and their regime allies see
   their immediate opposition party predecessors as illegitimate threats to
   the dominant party's ascendancy and in response these ``restoration
   presidents{''} tend to overreach, pushing the regime toward its
   disjunction. Exploring the common elements among this group of
   presidents will facilitate a more accurate understanding of similarly
   placed presidents in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.},

Volume = {65},
Number = {4},
Pages = {855-867},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Turnout is a key indicator in European Parliament elections in the
   absence of a direct executive outcome. Forecasting turnout is an
   important exercise in requiring the identification of a parsimonious
   model with good lead time from the array of structural, demographic, and
   attitudinal variables employed in rich explanatory models of turnout,
   and simultaneously minimizing prediction error. Building on a series of
   regression models using aggregate data, this article explores the
   applicability of such an approach to turnout in the EU-27 countries and
   considers the explanatory added value that deriving such a forecast
   model can also provide.},

Abstract = {Lieske has recently developed a new measure of state culture that
   appears to be a much better predictor of state performance than other
   commonly used measures including per capita income, Sharkansky's index
   of Elazar's typology, and Hero's index of racial and ethnic diversity.
   Here, we show why uni- and multi-dimensional reductions of Elazar's and
   Lieske's typologies and other measures do not predict and explain the
   variation in representative indicators of state performance nearly as
   well. To lay the groundwork for a more rigorous understanding of state
   culture, and to integrate it with the work of Hero on diversity and
   Putnam on social capital, we also develop and test an evolutionary
   theory that draws on Marger's theory of ethnic competition and
   Vanhanen's theory of ethnic nepotism.},

   Theoretical Considerations Based on Jurgen Habermas and Lawrence

Journal = {SWISS POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {18},

Abstract = {In this article, it is proposed to differentiate political cultures in
   two dimensions. First, inspired by Habermas' distinction of the contents
   of discourse, a distinction is suggested between moral,
   ethical-political and pragmatic elements of political culture as well as
   of an element of culture of balancing interests. Second, inspired by
   Kohlberg's stage models for the development of the individual moral
   consciousness and for moral culture, a distinction is similarly
   suggested between two pre-conventional, two conventional and two
   post-conventional collective stages of political culture. It can be
   shown that from a normative point of view, only deliberations made in a
   post-conventional political culture can produce reasonable or at least
   fair results. Conceptual considerations indicate processes of direct
   democracy as the method for promoting post-conventional political
   cultures. The more liberty that the citizens have to formulate and
   trigger processes of direct democracy, the more one can expect from them
   to generate post-conventional political cultures.},

Abstract = {Although the merit system in the provision of public employment was
   introduced in Colombia since 1938, has not yielded the expected results.
   The paper seeks to set out the reasons why little has worked the
   administrative careers over the course of the various administrative
   reforms and the State carried out since 1936. It uses a qualitative
   methodology based on the techniques of documentary review and direct
   observation on primary and secondary sources. The study discusses nine
   major reforms of the State and establishing whether there were
   developments in the administrative career, then, provides an analysis of
   attempts to extraordinary entry and judgments of the Constitutional
   Court. The findings point to note the persistence of models paternalism
   and political spoils along the system of access and promotion by merit.},

Abstract = {How do workers in authoritarian states engage in protest, and how do
   they choose from available protest strategies? Through analysis of
   Chinese migrant labor protests from 2007 to 2008, the author examines
   how structural change expanded opportunities for protest and how
   migrants took advantage of those opportunities. Where formal
   organization is prohibited, informal ties facilitate protest by
   providing material support and information. Although traditional kinship
   ties provide material support, urban ties between workers with no
   connections before migrating to the cities provide information. Workers
   with access to urban ties are both more likely to engage in protest and
   more likely to engage in nonviolent protest through informal bargaining
   or the legal system. Little is known about the process of collective
   action among workers in authoritarian states, and understanding how
   Chinese migrant workers engage in labor protests despite prohibitions on
   formal organization sheds light on this phenomenon.},

Abstract = {This article surveys the growing research programme on the duration of
   cabinet ministers. It examines some of the conceptual and methodological
   issues confronting research, including the nature and measurement of
   durability, ministerial terms and techniques. It considers some of the
   theories and hypotheses that have been generated by researchers. Using
   evidence from studies from around the world, it argues that
   institutional factors, including regime type, constitutional and
   parliamentary rules, and party systems, affect ministerial durability.
   Personal ministerial characteristics, such as gender, education and age,
   also affect durability. It examines future avenues of research in this
   field.},

   Coalition Government},
Journal = {PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {65},
Number = {4},
Pages = {778-801},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Forming a coalition involves compromise, so a prime minister heading up
   a coalition government, even one as predominant a party leader as David
   Cameron, should not be as powerful as a prime minister leading a
   single-party government. Cameron has still to work with and through
   ministers from his own party, but has also to work with and through
   Liberal Democrat ministers; not least the Liberal Democrat leader Nick
   Clegg. The relationship between the prime minister and his deputy is
   unchartered territory for recent academic study of the British prime
   minister. This article explores how Cameron and Clegg operate within
   both Whitehall and Westminster: the cabinet arrangements, the prime
   ministers patronage, advisory resources and more informal mechanisms.
   Cameron and Clegg both possess institutional and personal resources, but
   Cameron remains the predominant resource-rich actor, so at this stage in
   the coalition government we can observe that no formal, substantial
   change in the role of prime minister has been enacted. Camerons
   predominance, by leading a coalition, is partially constrained by Clegg,
   but he too constrains Clegg. This prime minister, then, can be
   predominant even when he is constrained in significant ways by the
   imperatives of coalition government. Cameron is presently no more
   constrained than a prime minister who is faced with a pre-eminent
   intra-party rival with a significant power base.},

Abstract = {Considering a series of transformations in the fields of marriage and
   couples counseling, family therapy, and so on in the United States from
   the turn of the century to the present, this article undertakes a
   Foucaultian analysis of the government of intimacy that seeks to broaden
   contemporary understandings of governmentality, biopower, and
   discipline. It traces a series of shifts and transformations in the
   government of intimacy, understood as a dynamic trajectory of sometimes
   dissonant and unstable assemblages centered on the maximization of
   mutuality, trust, and empathy within the bond of intimate life. The
   overall pattern of change is one of an intensification of forms of power
   that increasingly satiates subjectivity and intimacy itself with each
   successive form. Suggestions are offered for scholarship on
   governmentality and other Foucaultian and post-Foucaultian themes.},

Abstract = {How does linguistic recognition in the courtroom affect popular
   confidence in the justice system among minorities? The authors argue (a)
   the recognition of either a minority language and/or a third-party's
   language (lingua franca) during judicial proceedings increases
   confidence levels but (b) the use of a lingua franca is more effective.
   This is because minorities are more likely to favor an arrangement that
   levels the playing field by having everyone speak a lingua franca
   (relative fairness) than one that allows them to use their own language
   in a courtroom that is otherwise dominated by the majority language
   (absolute fairness). Using original data measuring the linguistic
   recognition in the judiciary, the authors find a significant and robust
   relationship between languages of the court and popular confidence in
   the justice system.},

Title = {Is the European Parliament still a policy champion for environmental
   interests?},
Journal = {INTEREST GROUPS \& ADVOCACY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {1},

Abstract = {A wide range of interest groups target the European Parliament (EP) and
   MEPs have a reputation for being particularly open to diffuse interests,
   who, due to their limited resources, use `friendly' MEPs to put pressure
   on the European Commission and the Council. The notion of the EP
   representing diffuse as opposed to concentrated interests, conflicts
   with the broader political science literature on interest groups that
   dwells on business bias. The general expectation in the literature is
   for concentrated groups (such as the automobile industry) to prevail
   over diffuse interests (such as environmental interests). This article
   considers whether this is a case of conventional wisdom confirmed - or a
   sectoral exceptionalism. In fact, there are good reasons to doubt the
   EP's reputation as a policy champion for diffuse interests. Much of our
   current knowledge about the EP's interest group politics stems from a
   time when the EP's legislative powers were more limited. Within a
   relatively short time span the EP has evolved from a token
   `multi-lingual talking shop' to, what some researchers have named, one
   of the most powerful elected legislatures in the world. Arguably, as the
   powers of the EP have increased, so has attention from interest groups.
   Few interest groups now dare leave the parliamentary arena to their
   opponents, and most interest groups adopt a belt-and-braces approach in
   which `the institutional trio' (the European Commission, Council and the
   EP) is lobbied throughout the policy process. The increased powers
   raises the question of whether the EP still privileges diffuse interests
   or simply reinforces the advantages of concentrated interests. This
   question is addressed in this article by examining one recent
   regulation: Regulation 2011/510/EC on the reduction of CO2 emissions
   from light commercial vehicles. Based on process-tracing of EU documents
   and lobbying letters, and interviews with MEPs, EP officials and
   interest groups, this article shows that the EP is no longer an
   environmental champion, but instead appears to be more of an
   environmental pragmatist. Three factors contribute to this change:
   asymmetric lobbying from industry, a change in the EP's negotiating
   strategy and increased cooperation between the EP committees. These
   changes have reduced the privileged position once held by diffuse
   interests, and provided concentrated interests with a more advantageous
   European parliamentary arena in which they can advance their demands.},

Abstract = {In a democracy, people live by the notion of absolute equality before
   the law. In practice, however, there are always many ways where the
   execution of the law often ends up favoring someone, usually the most
   powerful. This is dramatically true in less-developed democracies, where
   the majority of the masses tend to feel displaced by members of the
   elite. This situation can help explain why there are so many skeptics of
   democracy in the developing nations. In Egypt, after the 2011 revolution
   and the 2012 elections, it became evident that the newly born Egyptian
   democracy will have to overcome a hostile environment full of
   skepticism, coupled with huge external challenges, such as keeping
   intact the peace treaty with Israel, the distribution of hydraulic
   resources agreement with the countries of Central Africa, and the
   preservation of equilibrium with their Arab neighbors-many of them
   fearful of democratic progress in the region.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},

Volume = {51},
Number = {6},
Pages = {756-784},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The dominant explanation of public attitudes vis-a-vis economic
   globalisation focuses on re-distributional implications, with an
   emphasis on factor endowments and government-sponsored safety nets (the
   compensation hypothesis). The empirical implication of these theoretical
   arguments is that in advanced economies, on which this article focuses,
   individuals endowed with less human and financial capital will be more
   likely to experience income losses. Hence they will oppose economic
   openness unless they are compensated by the government. It is argued
   here that including social capital in the analysis can fill two gaps in
   explanations relying on factor endowments and the compensation
   hypothesis. First, generalised trust one key aspect of social capital
   constitutes a personal endowment alongside human and financial capital.
   Second, structural social capital another key aspect of social capital
   can be regarded as a nongovernmental social safety net that can
   compensate for endowment-related disadvantages of individuals. Both
   aspects of social capital are expected to contribute, for distinct
   reasons, to more positive views on economic openness. The empirical
   testing relies on survey data for two countries: Switzerland and the
   United States. For both countries, the results indicate that generalised
   trust has a strong, positive effect on public opinion of economic
   globalisation, whereas structural social capital has no effect.},

Volume = {44},
Number = {4},
Pages = {588-608},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Liberalized markets promoted by the Washington Consensus under
   globalization have resulted in a global class structure in which new
   groups have emerged, including a precariat consisting of millions of
   people subject to flexible, insecure labor relations. The precariat is a
   class-in-the-making, in that the global market system wants most workers
   to be flexible and insecure, even if it is not yet a class-for-itself,
   having a clear vision of what type of society it wishes to see emerge.
   It is not an underclass. This article traces the factors explaining its
   growth and considers which demographic groups have the highest
   probability of being in it. The essay then considers two possible
   political scenarios-a politics of inferno, if current negative trends
   are allowed to continue, and a politics of paradise, a set of policies
   that would be essential to arrest those negative trends.},

Abstract = {In 1946, the Polish authorities settled tens of thousands of Jewish
   ``repatriots{''} from the Soviet Union in west Pomeranian Szczecin. For
   most, Szczecin was only a transit station. In contrast to the official
   version of events, these Jews were not returning to their homeland. They
   had originally lived in eastern Poland and had escaped to the Soviet
   Union during the war or had been deported there. Now they were being
   forced to settle in the west. As a result, this government attempt to
   keep Jews in Szczecin failed. Anti-Semitism, Stalinism, and the struggle
   against Jewish autonomy encouraged many Szczecin Jews to emigrate.},

Volume = {45},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Why do party systems in longstanding democracies sometimes experience
   sudden change? Neither sociological nor institutional explanations can
   account for the swift increase in support for regional political parties
   in India in the 1990s. Instead, the shift from single-party majority to
   coalition government explains the rise of regional parties. The advent
   of coalition government increased the incentives associated with joining
   and establishing regional parties, prompting many already popular
   politicians to leave their national parties and take their supporters
   with them as they formed new regional parties in the 1990s. This finding
   reverses the causal arrow that usually links party systems and coalition
   government and illustrates how noninstitutional elements of the
   political context can determine elite incentives and thereby shape party
   systems.},

Abstract = {We make the case for why the racial threat hypothesis should
   characterize the relationship between states' racial composition,
   whites' racial attitudes, and black representation in the United States
   Senate. Consistent with this claim, we find that senators from states
   with larger percentages of African-Americans among the electorate and
   more racially conservative preferences among whites provide worse
   representation of black interests in the Senate than their counterparts.
   We also apply theories of congressional cross-pressures in considering
   how senator partisanship and region moderate the effect of white racial
   attitudes on black representation. Finally, consistent with the racial
   threat hypothesis, we show that the negative effect of white racial
   attitudes on the quality of black representation is stronger when state
   unemployment rates are higher.},

Abstract = {Understanding how the Tea Party has affected congressional elections and
   roll call voting helps us understand not only an important political
   movement, but how movements affect politics more generally. We
   investigate four channels for the movement to influence political
   outcomes: activists, constituent opinion, group endorsement activity and
   elite-level self-identification. We find consistent evidence that
   activists mattered both electorally and for roll call voting on issues
   of importance to the movement. Constituent opinion had virtually no
   impact on either political outcome. Group endorsement activity had
   possible effects on elections, but mostly no effect on congressional
   voting. Self-identification among elites did not enhance-or
   harm-Republican electoral fortunes, but did affect congressional votes
   important to the movement. These divergent results illustrate how
   movement politics can influence outcomes through multiple channels and
   call into question the usefulness of the ``Tea Party'' moniker without
   important qualifiers.},

Abstract = {Despite pervasive downward pressure on government policy from exogenous
   forces, the author argues that partisanship still exerts an effect on
   privatization in Latin America. When a country is indebted to the
   International Monetary Fund (IMF), and a government of the right is in
   power, scholars can expect increased levels of privatization. However,
   when a country is indebted to the IMF and a government of the left is in
   power, electoral incentives will prompt these governments to ignore IMF
   pressure and reduce levels of privatization. The author tests this
   argument on a data set of eighteen Latin American countries, between the
   years 1984 and 1998.},

Abstract = {This article tests the hypothesis that differences in the housing market
   can partially explain why some American counties are strongly Republican
   and others strongly Democratic, and that this phenomenon can be largely
   attributed to the relationship between home values and marriage rates
   within counties. Specifically, I test the hypothesis that, in the 2000
   election, George W. Bush did comparatively better in counties with
   relatively affordable single-family homes, even when controlling for
   other economic, demographic and regional variables. Using county-level
   data, I test this hypothesis using spatial-lag regression models, and
   provide further evidence using individual-level survey data. My results
   indicate a statistically significant relationship between Bush's
   percentage of the vote at the county level and the median value of
   owner-occupied homes, and that at least part of this is explained by the
   relationship between home values and marriage rates among young women.},

Pages = {39-47},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In the investigation of crimes against patrimony, an important role in
   the investigation methodology is played by the hearings. In general, we
   refer to three types of hearings, the hearing at the scene of the crime
   - in order to prepare the search of the crime scene and the subsequent
   investigation of the offence, a hearing as part of the criminal
   investigation and the hearing before the court.
   Throughout this article we will discuss particularly the forensic
   tactics of hearings as part of the criminal investigation, referring to
   the different statuses of the person undergoing the hearing, who may
   belong to different backgrounds/categories of various legal standings,
   namely those of: victim - injured party, witness, accused or defendant.
   In the first part of the article, we will present the provisions
   relevant for crimes against patrimony, contained in the Romanian
   Criminal Code. The Special Part, in the title reserved for the offences
   of this category, the structure of the title, and also short references
   to the legal content of each offence. In the second part of the article,
   we will show the stages in the preparation of a hearing and the actual
   stages of hearings in the case of crimes against patrimony. In this
   sense, we will discuss: the hearing preparation and the conduct of the
   hearing, as well as the preliminary discussion phase, the phase of free
   reports and the phase of addressing questions and receiving answers.},

Abstract = {Violence against women is a worldwide malaise, eating deep into the
   fabric of society. It has become common to see women violated in
   different aspects of life by their male counterparts, be it their
   fathers, brothers, husbands or for that matter total strangers.
   Unfortunately women bear the brunt of a lot of violence in our society
   and silently cover them up so as to avoid stigmatization or protect
   their families. In recent times in Nigeria, there have been several
   cases of violence against women and, most of these cases are kept silent
   despite their pervasiveness. Issues like sexual harassment, trafficking
   in women and girls, sex selection, early marriage, female genital
   mutilation etc are fast becoming epidemics plaguing Nigeria as it is the
   case globally. This situation is unabatting globally and has elicited
   public outcry leading to the intervention of the United Nations General
   Assembly as well as member states coming out with several treaties, laws
   and policies on women in a bid to protecting the woman from the
   dehumanizing violation of human rights. This work among other issues
   examined violence against women and its diverse ramifications and
   exposed the fact that it is a human rights violation that must be
   stopped. It also assessed some of the legal regimes relating to violence
   and found that these regimes have not had their desired impact due to
   various reasons in Nigeria including the fact that the causes of
   violence are embedded in unequal power relations between men and women
   hinged on patriarchal leanings of society and made some recommendations
   geared at combating the challenge of violence against women.},

Title = {FINANCIAL CRISIS, FINANCIAL FIRMS... AND FINANCIAL FEMINISM? THE RISE OF
   `TRANSNATIONAL BUSINESS FEMINISM' AND THE NECESSITY OF MARXIST-FEMINIST
   IPE},
Journal = {SOCIALIST STUDIES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {8},
Number = {2},
Pages = {85-108},
Month = {FAL},
Abstract = {This paper documents the rise of a politico-economic project of what I
   have termed `transnational business feminism', focused on the need to
   promote women's empowerment, particularly in the wake of the most recent
   global financial crisis. Here, liberal feminists have joined with
   states, funding institutions, NGOs and MNCs in constructing women as
   `untapped resources' capable of delivering a high return on (Western)
   investment. This project has also generated new knowledges regarding
   both gender and finance, as the `excesses' that led to the 2008 crisis
   have been linked to an errant masculinity that can be adjusted by
   incorporating women (and feminine values) into the finance realm.
   However, a feminist historical materialist reading of this project
   reveals that gender is used as part of a narrative that seeks to
   naturalize and depoliticize capitalist crises. Gender also becomes the
   basis for the reembedding of capitalist relations that reproduce the
   exploitation of men and women while creating new markets and sources of
   profit for capital. While transnational business feminism is rooted in a
   particular version of Western liberal feminism that seeks empowerment
   via integration into the market economy, this paper argues that the
   contemporary moment offers an opportunity for a renewed emphasis on
   feminist scholarship that is firmly wedded to anti-capitalism, as well
   as a Marxism that takes gender seriously.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes why, how and to what extent Indonesia's once
   staunchly Islamist Prosperous Justice Party (Partai Keadilan
   Sejahtera;PKS) has become more moderate through its participation in
   democratic procedures. It also examines how this moderation process has
   affected the party's electoral performance and the overall quality of
   democracy in Indonesia. It is argued that PKS has indeed become more
   moderate and that this moderation has, after initial electoral success,
   now posed some serious challenges to the party's organizational
   coherence. The article concludes by highlighting that moderation is a
   process that is neither linear nor unreservedly positive for
   democratization.},

Abstract = {Sheldon S. Wolin's theory of fugitive democracy has been both lauded and
   criticized for its radical departure from the mainstays of democratic
   theory: formal institutions, political offices and constitutional
   arrangements of power. For Wolin, democracy is correctly understood as
   an ephemeral event that appears unexpectedly when ordinary citizens,
   united by a shared grievance, collectively interrupt normal political
   proceedings and reject constitutionalism. This article critically
   analyzes Wolin's theory in light of a historical phenomenon in which
   citizens collectively interrupted politics: frontier vigilantism in the
   American West from 1850 to 1900. Critical of Wolin's wholesale rejection
   of constitutionalism, the article reveals the potentially legalistic
   patterns of extra-legal collective action, and it argues for
   de-fetishizing democratic practice that occurs outside of institutional
   channels. Contemporary Political Theory (2012) 11, 264-284.

Abstract = {French republicanism is usually understood as the legacy of the French
   Revolution and the Third Republic, a unique example of colorblind
   assimilation and universal citizenship: the model for understanding
   immigrant integration in contemporary France. This article challenges
   this usual conception of the French model, and highlights the extent to
   which this approach is not successful in conceptualizing the evolution
   and content of how France's politics and policies have defined `French
   republicanism' over the last three decades. To do so, the article
   emphasizes first the problems of conceiving a national model such as
   France's as a dense system of values a philosophy of integration or a
   national idiom of citizenship. Second, through the analysis of public
   discourses and official reports between 1983 and 2012, the article
   identifies strong variations in the French public narratives, revealing
   the existence of no less than four different and contradictory schemas
   throughout the period: nationality-based integration in the 1980s,
   antidiscrimination in the 1990s, laicite in the 2000s and assimilation
   based on cultural order in the 2010s. Comparative European Politics

Abstract = {This article examines the effectiveness of a collaborative group
   learning project for teaching a core competency in comparative politics:
   constitutional structures. We use a quasi-experimental design and
   propensity score matching to assess the value of a constitutional
   writing group project and presentation. The results provide strong
   evidence that these learning tools are highly valuable for teaching
   abstract concepts. Students who participated in the project scored
   significantly higher on a short series of questions in final exams given
   several weeks after the completion of the group project. Somewhat
   paradoxically, the project increased competency but did not affect
   student self-reported interest in the subject matter. The challenges and
   improvements that can be made for the use these types of learning tools
   concludes the article.},

Abstract = {Feminism and rational choice theory have both been hailed as approaches
   with the potential to revolutionize political science. Apart from a few
   exceptions, however, work utilizing these two perspectives rarely
   overlaps. This article reviews their main contributions and explores the
   potential for a combined approach. It argues that a synthesis of
   feminism and rational choice theory would involve attending to questions
   of gender, strategy, institutions, power, and change. The contours and
   benefits of this approach are illustrated with reference to one
   particular area of research: the adoption of electoral gender quotas.
   Despite a current lack of engagement across approaches, this example
   illustrates that the tools of feminist and rational choice analysis may
   be brought together in productive ways to ask and answer theoretically
   and substantively important questions in political science.},

Abstract = {Studies of ballots have traditionally focused on roll-off, candidate
   order, and partisan advantage. This study is among the first to assess
   the impact of ballots on individual-level voter errors. We develop new
   hypotheses by bringing together theoretical insights from usability
   research and political science about the effects of ballots with and
   without a straight-party voting option. By comparing voters' intentions
   to the votes they cast, we are able to create two measures of voter
   errors: votes unintentionally cast for the wrong candidate and
   unintentional undervotes. Voters generally make fewer errors of both
   types when using a standard office-bloc ballot than when using an
   office-bloc ballot with a straight-party option, with the number of
   wrong-candidate errors substantially exceeding the number of
   unintentional undervotes. Voters' background characteristics have a
   significant impact on their ability to vote without error. Our results
   offer a new perspective for evaluating the use of the straight-party
   option.},

Abstract = {In modern governing, a variety of actors in the public domain daily make
   decisions with consequences for the common good, but how these actors
   are held accountable to political representatives is not always clear.
   While representative democracy in most societies still functions as the
   traditional standard, deficits in democratic control are perceived.
   There is an exercise of power-without-corresponding-representation. At
   the same time modern citizens appear hard to engage in politics.
   Representation-without-corresponding-participation also appears. We
   address this dual problem, one of accountability and one of legitimacy,
   in terms of political theory. Various strategies are explored,
   indicating that some of them contribute to bringing democracy up to date
   more than others. In particular, it seems fundamental to rethink
   contemporary democracy by connecting it with the multi-dimensional
   character of governance. Functional participation by modern citizens can
   enhance the legitimacy of the exercise of power by making the latter
   accountable in a multi-local way.},

Abstract = {The following lines were motivated by the will of answering the critic
   note of Christian Delacampagne, included in his chapter about liberty
   and the opponents of democracy - part of La Philosophie Politique
   Aujourd'Hui: Idees, Debats, Enjeux, published in 2000 - which aimed
   Giorgio Agamben's tentative of approaching democracy and
   totalitarianism, especially in Homo Sacer: Il Potere Sovrano e la Nuda
   Vita, published for the first time in 1995. Before coursing the basic
   points of Delacampagne's interpretation and the dialectic confrontation
   with another possible reading of Agamben's texts, we shall retrieve what
   we can understand with the expression Rule of Law, not only to
   contextualize the discussion in the scope of a conceptual revaluation,
   but to listen different points of view and avoid early mistakes. The
   present article intends to contribute to the comprehension of Giorgio
   Agamben's thesis, offering elements to think once more some limits and
   paradoxes of Democratic Rule of Law, gathered under his optics. Also,
   perhaps, to enable the destiny of another eye upon democracy; certainly
   contentious, however infallibly creative.},

Abstract = {This article is based on Raymond Aron's precept that foreign policy is
   the result of the articulation between strategic and diplomatic
   grammars. Our hypothesis is that military and diplomatic corporation
   interests may deviate or oppose the political exercise of the national
   executive power when framing the country's strategic projection
   internationally. It is our belief that this hypothesis can contribute to
   explain the lack of institutional effort to consolidate Brazilian
   presidential initiatives in the field of foreign policy. In order to
   verify this hypothesis, we analyzed the elaboration of the National
   Defense Strategy, that basically obeys the interests of the military
   interests, and the creation of the South American Defense Council, where
   Brazilian participation in the Work Commissions that should be fulfilled
   by representatives from the Ministry of Defense is practically absent.
   The evaluation of these two instances has shown that often the political
   initiative promoted Brazilian executive power is nullified.},

Title = {Do Blacks and Whites See Obama through Race-Tinted Glasses? A Comparison
   of Obama's and Clinton's Approval Ratings},
Journal = {PRESIDENTIAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {42},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {Recent presidential approval trends have led many pollsters to conclude
   that a ``racial gap{''} exists in President Barack Obama's job approval
   ratings. Pollsters have focused disproportionately on the substantial
   gap between Blacks and Whites. Some political commentators and media
   outlets attribute this divergence to the fact that Obama is the first
   ethnic/racial minority to occupy the White House. The existence of a
   White-Black gap, however, could merely reflect the differences in the
   political preferences of White and Black Americans. In this article, we
   assess these two competing arguments by analyzing CNN polling data
   spanning President Obama's inauguration in January 2009 to June 2011.
   For comparative purposes, we examine Time/CNN polling data that begins
   with President Bill Clinton's inauguration in January 1993 to June 1995.
   Our findings suggest that the gap in Black support for President Obama
   is significantly larger than it is for President Clinton, providing
   evidence that racial group pride and solidarity appear to play an
   important role in Blacks' evaluations of Obama},

Title = {Differing mandates and party loyalty in mixed-member systems: Taiwan as
   a baseline case},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {31},
Number = {2},
Pages = {384-392},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {There is widespread consensus on the theoretical foundations of the
   differing mandates hypothesis, that in mixed-member systems district
   legislators are more likely to defect from the party line than list
   legislators. However, the empirical evidence for this hypothesis is
   extremely weak. Is the hypothesis itself fundamentally flawed, or does
   the long list of intervening variables cited in the literature account
   for these weak results? This paper examines the differing mandates
   hypothesis in a case, Taiwan from 1993 to 2007, in which none of the
   proposed intervening variables should alter expectations. If the
   hypothesis is not supported in this baseline case, perhaps it should be
   discarded altogether. In fact, there is strong support for the
   hypothesis, indicating that the hypothesis is not fundamentally flawed,
   though it may be less robust than commonly believed. (C) 2012 Published

Abstract = {How best to govern reproduction is the subject of heated controversies

   variations. Through fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis, the

   France and Switzerland since the 1970s. If little evidence is found for
   any institutional impact on policies regarding abortion and reproductive
   technologies, the analysis confirms the growing influence of the medical
   profession over reproductive issues and shows that the success of the

Abstract = {This paper examines the development of the idea `personalised
   conditionality' in social security policy in Britain through the report,
   Realising Potential, commissioned by the last of the 1997-2010 Labour
   governments and the documents and policies of the coalition government
   formed after the 2010 general election. Using the idea of active
   proletarianisation from Offe (1984), the paper argues that `personalised
   conditionality' is part of a long and ignoble policy tradition that has
   criminalised workless people and held them responsible for their lack of
   work as a means of discouraging worklessness and forms of subsistence
   outside of paid work. The tensions in such a policy are discussed and it
   is concluded that the consequence of `personalised conditionality' may
   be to detach increasing numbers of people from labour markets, rather
   than active proletarianisation.},

Abstract = {Many recent studies of the judiciary and public opinion adopt a model
   that views court decisions as aggravating division within the public.
   The authors question the image of Court as polarizer, arguing that the
   persuading influence of the U.S. Supreme Court is broader than
   contemporary authors acknowledge. Using a potential outcomes framework,
   the authors analyze public attitudes in response to the decision in Roe
   v. Wade, the original test case in Franklin and Kosaki's seminal
   article. The authors' evidence suggests that members of diverse groups
   who were aware of the Roe decision were more supportive of abortion than
   their decision-unaware counterparts.},

Abstract = {Signature pedagogies have been defined as `types of teaching that
   organize the fundamental ways in which future practitioners are educated
   for their profession' (Schulman, 2005: 3). Applying Schulman's
   definition of signature pedagogies to political science, this article
   notes that as an academic discipline it does not seek to train students
   for a specific profession. It also recognises that political science's
   signature pedagogy is similar to those traditionally associated with the
   social sciences and humanities: mass lectures, small tutorials and
   private study. In recent times newer pedagogies such as problem-based
   learning, experiential learning and service learning have been
   introduced in political science programmes to marry theory and practice
   and promote critical thinking and independent learning. This article
   focuses on one such approach, service learning, assessing the
   contribution it can make to teaching in political science with reference
   to an analysis of its effects in a postgraduate module on democratic
   civic education in University College Cork, Ireland.},

Abstract = {Private-sector interest in agricultural land in Russia has increased
   rapidly over the past five years. Investors at home and abroad are
   acquiring land on a grand scale. These purchases bring with them a
   profound reorganisation of local political economies. Despite
   privatisation and reform of local self-government, informal arrangements
   from the Soviet era remain in force to this day. Agricultural
   enterprises have assumed the tasks of municipal services.
   Profit-oriented investors are breaking with this practice. This is
   highly problematic for the residents of the villages and towns. Two case
   studies show different strategies for dealing with investors.},

Abstract = {Tanzania experienced a top down democratic transition. This transition
   path gave the ruling party monopoly to determine the transition pace,
   design the rules of the game, as well as to own and benefit out of it.
   The de-linking of the party from the state of the previous authoritarian
   regime has yet happened thereby creating uneven playfield for opposition
   parties to be effective. This article, based on documents, interviews,
   and newspapers, holds that the landslide victories by the ruling party
   in the past general elections of 1995, 2000, 2005, and 2010 were largely
   attributed to its fusion with the state.},

Journal = {POLITICS \& POLICY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {40},
Number = {3},
Pages = {403-423},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Harry Potter's boggarts arouse our deepest fears and shape-shift
   according to those fears. Consequently, nobody knows what this magical
   monster really looks like-adding to our insecurities. The striking
   parallels with international issues involve fear and (in) security as
   the central forces driving state behavior, and how to confront
   shapeshifting nonstate sources of violence. Yet examining the
   connections between identity and violence in the boggart metaphor
   problematizes several assumptions underpinning constructivism and
   realism. Using Schmitt's ``friend-enemy{''} distinction, I argue that it
   is not a Hobbesian freedom from fear of violent death that motivates the
   search for security, but the fear of not belonging to a clearly defined
   group. For it is not the dread that an international boggart will kill
   us that makes it so paralyzing, but it's the lack of a clear identity
   that renders ``other{''} and ``self{''} indistinguishable. In a world
   where globalization has blurred state-oriented differentiation of
   (national) self and (foreign) other, Schmitt's theory of identity proves
   particularly valuable.},

Abstract = {Under President Dmitry Medvedev, the struggle against Russia's endemic
   corruption finally seemed to be underway. Laws were reformed; state
   agencies were ordered to be more transparent. Non-government
   organisations fighting corruption were heard. But, de facto, nothing has
   changed. Corruption continues, especially in the higher echelons of
   power. Russia refuses to adopt key elements of international
   anti-corruption conventions as national law and thus protects the
   illicit enrichment of its officials. Corrupt practices have hardened:
   entrepreneurs and ordinary citizens regularly fall victim to
   extortionist acquisitions. But opposition is stirring within society.
   Fewer and fewer people are willing to tolerate corruption. Maturity is
   taking the place of fatalism and resignation.},

Abstract = {The ``Turkish model,{''} in the form of a marriage between moderate
   Islam and democracy, the AKP's electoral success and the economic growth
   witnessed in the last decade, has become the ultimate allure to which
   Arab Islamists aspire. This study focuses on the main premises of the
   Islamist PJD (Parti de la Justice et du Developpement) of Morocco in
   order to understand what the ``Turkish model{''} signified for them. By
   not confining the ``Turkish model{''} solely to the AKP policies, but
   stretching it instead to the pre-AKP Islamist parties, the idea is to
   uncover which features of the ``Turkish model{''} are espoused by the
   Moroccan Islamists and which features are not appreciated. After a brief
   introduction regarding the AKP's understanding of secularism and how it
   differs from radical secularism, the emphasis is given to the PJD's
   position on secularism. The following section explores lessons gathered
   by the PJD from Turkish parliamentarian Islamism in regards to
   engagement in political participation in the face of state repression.
   The last section examines the transition of the PJD's discourse from
   being moralistic-based to policy-oriented, in which the Turkish
   experience once again formed a reference point.},

   protests. Using data from a pioneering survey covering all local
   political representatives in Sweden (n = 9,101, response rate 70\%), we
   examine attitudes toward controversial noninstitutionalized forms of
   citizen protests. The results show that representatives to the right
   show considerably lower protest acceptance than those to the left.
   Representatives in office show significantly lower levels of acceptance
   than those of the opposition. Finally, the results show that
   representatives with more protest experience show higher protest
   acceptance.},

Abstract = {The author demonstrates the non-existence of a consistent theory of
   market and of the modern capitalist system. Only a conceptual analysis
   is possible which is more revealing of the methodologies of various
   theoretical trajectories and a comparative analysis of different
   viewpoints and theoretical contradictions in relation to historical
   reality. The fundamental theoretical accomplishment of Strpic's analysis
   is that it offers a fertile core of clarification of market society and
   capitalism. The search for modern political economy opens up three
   aspects of the crisis of capitalism and of its economic theory. The
   political strategy of laissez faire in the beginning of the 20th century
   brought about the Great Depression (1929-1933), and the theoretical and
   political turn to Key-nesianism (1936). In the 1970s the great
   stagflation (1971-1980) cleared the path for the neo-liberal theoretical
   counterrevolution (1972). In the period of the Great Recession
   (2007-2012) the necessity is imposed on us of a new theoretical turn in
   the direction of anti-neo-liberalism. Market economy and its invisible
   hand cannot be simply suppressed into closed out theoretical systems;
   the economists overlooked precisely this simplification and abstraction
   from real relations. Strpic's theoretical project of the Modern Normal
   and matrix-capitalism makes it possible to read in a new way the
   incommensurability of theoretical paradigms, not as a unified theory but
   as a developmental project which is prerequisite for explaining the
   character of the present crisis and the dynamic development of the
   modern transformation of capitalism.},

Abstract = {Research on congressional parties assumes, but has not directly shown,
   that party size affects individual members' calculations. Drawing on a
   key case from the nineteenth-century Housethe secession-driven
   Republican hegemony of 1861this article explores the hypothesis that
   party voting not only declines but also becomes more strongly linked to
   constituency factors as relative party size increases. The analysis
   reveals that the jump in party size coincides with (1) a decrease in
   party voting among individual continuing members, (2) a strengthening
   association between some constituency factors and party voting, and (3)
   patterns of decline in individual party voting that are explained in
   part by constituency measures.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on the discussion of the legal scope of the rights
   to exclude and control provided by intellectual property law and mainly
   contract law to rightholders who make videogames and other entertainment
   products available online. Based on a recent US case, MDY Industries v.
   Blizzard Entertainment, the article analyzes the interrelation between
   the remedies established for breach of contract and actions for
   copyright infringement in cases in which rightholders aim at controlling
   end users' behavior in online platforms; for instance -as in the
   referred decision-control through a prohibition included in a EULA
   forbidding the use of robot programs in interaction with a videogame.
   Based on the discussion of the aforementioned case, the article
   identifies the main problems arising from the interface between
   copyright and contract law, as well as its effects on innovation and
   competition. A correct understanding of this interface demands an
   examination of different factors that are considered in the article: (1)
   the question of whether rightholders may resort to private autonomy and
   freedom of contract, in order to affect the balance of interests
   established in the Copyright Act by way of a EULA, other adhesive terms
   of use, or even a negotiated contract; (2) how consent works in EULA and
   other agreements in the software industry; (3) limits to privity of
   contract principles and the de facto creation of rights in rem; ( 4) the
   differences in the remedies available to rightholders for breaches of
   EULAs established in the Spanish Copyright Act, on the one hand, and in
   the Civil Code, on the other; and (5) the limitations that competition
   law establishes for some contractual behavior.},

Abstract = {This article aims to understand the determinants of party-system
   polarization by moving beyond the (almost exclusive) emphasis placed in
   the literature on the role of the electoral system and the number of
   parties. We propose a larger menu of explanatory variables that includes
   both institutional and voters-related factors. Regarding the
   institutional factors, we highlight the consequences of expectations of
   coalition formations as well as office-related elections (e.g.,
   Presidential ones) on party-system convergence in legislative elections.
   For the voters-related factors, we address the importance of specific
   characteristics of the electorate following insights from the spatial
   theory of voting. To test our hypotheses, we use survey data covering 33
   nations and 67 elections. While hypotheses derived from electoral
   systems and number of parties find little empirical support, the new
   variables that we consider involving institutions and voters matter
   significantly.},

Abstract = {The several models of French presidential election forecasting that have
   been proposed focus virtually exclusively on substantive explanation of
   the vote, embedded within a single-equation macro-model. We offer
   something different - a powerful Proxy Model based on prediction alone.
   However, that model itself forms part of a larger two-equation system,
   which includes both explanation as well as prediction of the
   presidential vote. Our Proxy Model is estimated on the eight popular
   presidential elections of the Fifth Republic, and tested on the upcoming
   2012 contest. The Proxy Model, 6 months in advance of that race,
   forecasts a Left victory and a Sarkozy defeat.},

Abstract = {During the three years of Liberal government in Spain (1820-1823) a
   republican political discourse arose amongst the ranks of the radical
   intellectuals (known as ``exaltados{''} or ``veintenos{''}) inspired in
   the history of republics from Sparta to the United States of America. It
   was characterised by calls to reform citizens' morality based on civic
   virtues, rejection of the historicism prevailing amongst liberals and
   reactionaries alike, idealisation of the Roman republic and fascination
   for the republicanism of the French Girondins and the North Americans.
   This first flirtation with republicanism was elitist, informed by
   Enlightenment values of Reason that never attracted the grass roots of
   the Liberal movement, although it did usher in a republican political
   tradition closely linked to federalism and moralising tenets that would
   continue in subsequent decades.},

Abstract = {In Christopher Marlowe's 1594 play, Doctor Faustus, magic is a metaphor
   for exploitation. My paper argues that Doctor Faustus is based on a
   carefully constructed comparison between the old and ineffective magic
   of the Emperor and the Pope and the new, very effective magic of
   Mephistopheles and Lucifer. The transition from Catholic to Luciferan
   magic represents the dissolution of the old order and money's entrance
   into a capitalist system. I argue that Faustus's ``fall'' to the devil
   enacts the larger process of exploitation and commodity fetishism
   overtaking the play's entire social world, from the Pope and the Emperor
   down to the servant and the Vintner. From this perspective, Doctor
   Faustus is not about a personal or moral failing, but a mapping of, and
   challenge to, the naturalization of capitalist ideology.},

Abstract = {The conventional wisdom is that turnout is higher in competitive
   contests and that electorates are more representative when more people
   vote. But whether more competition produces a more representative
   electorate remains unclear. Using measures of income bias that improve
   measurement equivalence across states, I show that income biases in
   voting participation tend to shrink as the state's party system becomes
   more competitive and as the Democratic Party does more to mobilize
   voters. Close elections, however, do little to explain the income
   composition of the electorate. Rather, competition reflects a political
   struggle that varies in the extent to which it increases turnout among
   less advantaged citizens.},

Abstract = {This article examines how authoritarian parties and legislatures affect
   regime survival. While authoritarian legislatures increase the stability
   of dictators, political parties - even when devised to quell internal
   threats - can destabilize dictators. The main argument is that
   authoritarian parties influence the distribution of power in a
   subsequent new democracy by helping to protect the interests of
   authoritarian elites. These institutions thus increase the likelihood of
   democratization. Using a dataset of authoritarian regimes in 108
   countries from 1946 to 2002 and accounting for simultaneity, the
   analysis models transitions to democracy and to a subsequent
   authoritarian regime. Results indicate that authoritarian legislatures
   are associated with a lower probability of transition to a subsequent
   dictatorship. Authoritarian parties, however, are associated with a
   higher likelihood of democratization.},

Abstract = {This article argues that American federalism led both to a greater
   national role in rail promotion and more centralized railroads in the
   antebellum period. Local competition among states led Congressional
   representatives from state unable to build local railroads to turn to
   federal assistance. Early support for railroads came from
   representatives in the South and frontier, who were primarily drawn into
   rail coalitions because of their own inability to build local rail
   networks. However, over time, competition among states within the
   coalition as well as concerns about federal power led many initial
   members of the coalition to drop out. In their place, states that
   favored a stronger federal state stepped into the coalition and
   subsequently built a more nationally oriented rail system. This analysis
   argues that the shifting of policies from local control to national
   oversight due to local resource shortages is an important aspect of
   American states building.},

Abstract = {The European Union is able to transfer its values and influence good
   governance policies in ACP states, through leverage and transnational
   networks. This paper tries to establish the leverage-transnational
   networks nexus in influencing policy and to account for the variance of
   European Union influence. In a comparative design, it tries to extricate
   these influences empirically by using a multi-variate regression
   analysis for the years 1975-2009, to establish whether European Union
   influences good governance policies in the African Great lakes states of
   Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. Though the analysis controls for other
   influences, still evidence of European Union influence in the three
   countries is significant. It further indicates that the degree of
   influence is predicated on the complementary role of the modes of
   influence, which accounts for the variance.},

Abstract = {The tremendous political changes that have been taking place in the
   Middle East and North Africa have stressed the importance for the
   materialization of the EU-Turkey Strategic dialogue. Turkey needs the EU
   for its economic modernization. On the other hand, Turkey's political
   system seems attractive to many political forces in the Arab Spring
   countries and can be used as inspiration for their democratization
   process. The Strategic Dialogue, however, needs to become separated from
   Turkey's EU accession negotiations. This article puts forward several
   concrete suggestions to increase the cooperation between the two sides.},

Abstract = {Institutional barriers frustrate third-party challenges to major-party
   dominance in American politics. Conventional wisdom claims that the
   ballot access petitioning requirement hurts minor parties. This claim,
   however, conflates two dimensions of third-party success: (a) ability to
   get on the ballot and (b) ability of actual candidates to win votes. The
   requirement is hypothesized to have a negative effect on the first
   dimension but a positive effect on the second. Modeling these two
   dimensions separately gives evidence of cross-cutting effects. The first
   equation is a probit model of entry that shows third-party candidates
   are more likely to enter when the requirement is low. The second
   equation is an OLS regression, which only includes the subsample of
   districts where at least one third-party candidate gained ballot access,
   that shows third-party candidates win more votes in districts with a
   higher requirement.},

Year = {2012},
Volume = {106},

Abstract = {In recent decades, the concept of ``the people{''} has received
   sustained theoretical attention. Unfortunately, political theorists have
   said very little about its explicit or implicit use in thinking about
   the expansion of the American polity along racial lines. The purpose of
   this article in taking up this issue is twofold: first, to provide a
   substantive account of the meaning of ``the people{''}-what I call its
   descriptive and aspirational dimensions-and second, to use that
   description as a framework for understanding the rhetorical character of
   W.E.B. Du Bois's classic work, The Souls of Black Folk, and its
   relationship to what one might call the cognitive-affective dimension of
   judgment. In doing so, I argue that as a work of political theory, Souls
   draws a connection between rhetoric, on the one hand, and emotional
   states such as sympathy and shame, on the other, to enlarge America's
   political and ethical imagination regarding the status of
   African-Americans.},

Abstract = {Spectacular economic growth in China suggests the ruling Chinese
   Communist Party (CCP) has somehow gotten it right. A key hypothesis in
   both economics and political science is that the CCP's cadre evaluation
   system, combined with China's geography-based governing logic, has
   motivated local administrators to compete with one another to generate
   high growth. We raise a number of theoretical and empirical challenges
   to this claim. Using a new biographical database of Central Committee
   members, a previously overlooked feature of CCP reporting, and a novel
   Bayesian method that can estimate individual-level correlates of
   partially observed ranks, we find no evidence that strong growth
   performance was rewarded with higher party ranks at any of the
   postreform party congresses. Instead, factional ties with various top
   leaders, educational qualifications, and provincial revenue collection
   played substantial roles in elite ranking, suggesting that promotion
   systems served the immediate needs of the regime and its leaders, rather
   than encompassing goals such as economic growth.},

Abstract = {This article engages critically with Richard Hyman's work on union
   identity and European integration. It includes a sympathetic review of
   Hyman's contribution to the debate on these topics over the past two
   decades, alongside a critique of Hyman's approach that highlights
   certain weaknesses and contradictions resulting from his uncritical use
   of a range of categories and concepts taken from regulation theory. The
   authors question Hyman's argument that developments in European unionism
   can be conceptualised adequately through an analysis of the development
   and crisis of `political economism': a dominant union identity that
   Hyman aligns with the development and crisis of Fordism. An alternative
   model for understanding the reorientation of European unions is
   presented based on a critical and dialectical conceptualisation of the
   relationship between unions and capitalist development. This is used to
   construct a model of contemporary union reorientation along the
   dimensions of `accommodation' and `opposition' to neoliberalism and to
   `national' and `international' modes of organisation and mobilisation.},

   Leaders},
Journal = {POLITIKON},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {39},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {149-169},
Abstract = {Drawing from in-depth interviews with 26 prominent South Africans, this
   article looks at how leaders in government, political parties, business
   and civil society understand and interpret non-racialism today. It
   interrogates whether non-racialism is an active political and social
   project among leaders in South Africa and whether, and how, they are
   attempting to redefine non-racialism. The article demonstrates that
   non-racialism is a term still ambiguously understood and defined by
   South African leaders. Some respondents consider races to be products of
   social construction and, as such, believe these constructions can be
   transcended. For many, however, the idea of multiracialism prevails over
   that of non-racialism. Although non-racialism remains largely a
   rhetorical ideal among many leaders, respondents did have well-defined
   views of the challenges facing non-racialism, particularly those of
   socio-economic inequality and poor leadership from the African National
   Congress (ANC). Overall, there is a strong sense from many respondents
   that the values of non-racialism are currently under threat. However,
   through using social sectors such as education and the media, as well as
   fostering open debate on non-racialism and facilitating stronger
   leadership from all areas of society, interviewees did see potential for
   building a path toward a non-racial South Africa.},

Abstract = {Competitive elections create a relationship of formal accountability
   between policy makers and citizens. Recent theoretical work suggests
   that there are limits on how well this formal accountability links
   policy decisions to citizen preferences. In particular, incumbents'
   incentives are driven not by the voters' evaluation of the normative
   desirability of outcomes but by the outcome's information about the
   incumbent's type (e.g., competence or ideology). This review surveys
   both this body of theory and the robust empirical literature it has
   spawned. It concludes with a short discussion of ongoing work that
   attempts to integrate this theoretical perspective with a richer view of
   policy-making institutions.},

   relationship between the teachers and their administration as in the
   modifications of the relationship with the families, as well on the
   level of the institution as in the perception of civil society. These
   metamorphoses of the school body are going along with important
   repercussions inside the classes. The school of the grown ups asks
   questions about the school we offer to the children. In the college of
   the years 2000 the user is not any more the pupil.},

Volume = {2},

Pages = {297-313},
Abstract = {With recent structural changes and economic reforms in Cuba, a
   conceptual framework for understanding what socialist development was
   and is today, is in order. This article integrates development analysis
   with interpretation of change while documenting the economic reforms now
   underway in this country. A clear distinction between the concepts of
   patterns of development versus development strategy contributes to
   explaining how the proposed reforms relate to the official state
   discourse of socialism, as well as to the policy options that will shape
   future economic development. Cuban and non-Cuban narratives are taken
   into consideration in order to provide a balanced assessment of the
   process. Important features are the state's shift from producer to
   regulator, the aperture of new market spaces and the redefinition of the
   term social property.},

   Authoritarian Rule in Sub-saharan Africa, pp. 354-383. Despite a decline
   in military interventions in sub-Saharan Africa, there are sufficient
   indications of a connection between the influence of the military and
   the stabilization of autocratic rule. Due to a scholarly neglect of the
   study of authoritarianism in Africa, this connection has not yet been
   analyzed systematically. With the help of several indicators this
   article examines to what extent autocratic rule in Africa constitute
   military rule or/and to what extent autocratic rule is dependent on the
   support of the military. Results indicate that the military is an
   important pillar of autocratic rule in Africa and that African armies
   are essential for the stabilization of military rule.},

Abstract = {This article maps state visits by the presidents of the Czech Republic,
   Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and Austria between 2004 and 2010. It has two
   goals. First, the article describes and compares the structure of the
   five presidents' state visits according to the countries and regions
   visited and according to the type of visit (official, working, or
   multilateral visit). Second, data about the state visits of the heads of
   states are utilized as an indicator of the geopolitical orientation of
   the respective state. All five countries under study show strong
   geopolitical orientation towards Western Europe, especially Germany.
   Nevertheless, our data also show certain differences in geopolitical
   priorities. Poland stands out with its extraordinarily strong
   orientation towards Eastern and Northern Europe (the Baltics). The Czech
   Republic is characterised by a relatively stronger preference for the
   transatlantic relationship. Our data also show that Hungary is to a
   certain degree isolated as it is not a favoured destination for
   presidential visits.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to answer the question of who were the women of the
   Provisional IRA and to assess any demographic patterns of PIRA
   involvement. We use a multimethod approach to describe the many roles
   and functions of female members of the Provisional Irish Republican Army
   from 1970 to 1998. Drawing on a sample of 61 convicted or deceased PIRA
   members, we outline the shifting sociodemographic and operation profile
   of these women and how structural, tactical and strategic needs of PIRA
   accounted for those changes. Women in the Provisional IRA played crucial
   operational roles throughout the period both front-line and behind the
   scenes. From the outset of the conflict, women consistently took part in
   violent operations. We also provide a historical case study of Mairead
   Farrell's PIRA career to provide further illustrations of these themes
   in greater detail.},

Pages = {61-77},
Abstract = {The concepts of patrimonialism and neo-patrimonialism are linked to the
   analysis of certain forms of state construction and governance in
   Africa, Latin America and Asia. To justify the use of the concept of
   patrimonialism, we generally refer to Max Weber, considering, however,
   that this idea should be complemented by that of neopatrimonialism,
   better prepared to explain certain peculiarities of different present
   forms of state. Given this background, the author examines the exact
   meaning of the concept of patrimonialism in the historical and political
   sociology of Weber, and its place and function in the typology of forms
   of domination. Analyzing the Weberian approach, he proposes some
   reflections on the nature of the conceptual work that could be useful in
   the current debate on States called ``patrimonial{''} or
   ``neo-patrimonial{''}.},

Journal = {POLITIQUE EUROPEENNE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {37},
Number = {2},
Pages = {18-43},
Abstract = {The use of memory as a political resource by European institutions is
   not necessarily an example of the creation of a founding myth on the
   model of the nation state. While the search for a ``grand narrative{''}
   is clearly one motivation for the actors, it coexists with strategies
   aiming at other types of legitimation or which pursue short-term
   interests. The increased importance of European memory thus does not
   mean an end to fairy-tale versions of national histories. A European
   memory can propose alternative projects, drawing on the worlds of
   national imaginations in order to step beyond them or rework them. In
   this article, three scenarios observable when European memory is invoked
   are illustrated by a case study. The first scenario is the
   Europeanization : European institutions play a part in developing
   historical sites of national importance into ``European sites of
   memory{''}; the second is the articulation of a specific memory of the
   process of European integration : this takes the form not only of
   support to networks of historians specialising in European integration
   after 1945, but also of promoting a ``grand history{''} of Europe over
   the long period; the third takes the form of an explicit ambition to
   endow the EU with a grand narrative of its origins, one autonomous of
   national histories. The debate on the Christian heritage of Europe begun
   during the constitutional treaty process is a concrete application of
   this.},

   policy in Ghana and Cameroon},
Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {19},
Number = {2},
Pages = {157-183},
Abstract = {Democratic reform processes often go hand in hand with expectations of
   social welfare improvements. While the connection between the emergence
   of democracy and the development of welfare states in the West has been
   the object of several studies, however, there is a scant empirical
   literature on the effects of recent democratization processes on welfare
   policies in developing countries. This is particularly true for Africa.
   In a dramatically poor environment, Africans often anticipated that the
   democratic reforms many sub-Saharan states undertook during the early
   1990s would deliver welfare dividends. This article investigates whether
   and how the advent of democracy affected social policies - focusing, in
   particular, on health policy - by examining one of the continent's most
   successful cases of recent democratization (Ghana) and comparing it with
   developments in a country of enduring authoritarian rule (Cameroon).
   Evidence shows that democracy can indeed be instrumental to the
   expansion and strengthening of social policies. In Ghana, new
   participatory and competitive pressures pushed the government towards
   devising and adopting an ambitious health reform. Despite facade
   elections, no similar pressures could be detected in undemocratic
   Cameroon and health policy remained almost entirely dictated by foreign
   donors.},

Abstract = {Is it an accident that at certain time periods cut by the history it was
   L.I. Brezhnev and M.S. Gorbachev that became heads of the country? Of
   course, no. The very fact that both personalities significantly impacted
   the life of the state and society shows that they were in demand from
   inside as well as from outside and they were integrated with the nation
   under those conditions. Without knowing, at least at the approximate
   level, what kind of people they were it is impossible to imagine the
   more or less real picture of those times. In the essay by A. Chernyaev
   written on the basis of his personal memories, the author, who worked
   within Brezhnev's group of speechwriters and consultants for more than
   10 years and who, after Gorbachev came to power, became his assistant on
   international affairs, touches upon the whole number of topics that
   allow to better understand these people as individuals and politicians
   and to look into their ``nitty-gritty of politics{''}. In the second
   part of the essay published in this issue (for the beginning see
   Politeia, 2012,. 2) the author talks about the approaches of two leaders
   to solving economic problems of our country, analyzes their attitudes in
   the sphere of ideology and provides overall assessment of the results of
   their activity.},

   also outlines other issues discussed during the reform process, like the

Abstract = {In this article, we investigate voter volatility and analyse the causes
   and motives of switching vote intentions. We test two main sets of
   variables linked to volatility in literature; political sophistication
   and political disaffection. Results show that voters with low levels of
   political efficacy tend to switch more often, both within a campaign and
   between elections. In the analysis, we differentiate between campaign
   volatility and inter-election volatility, and by doing so show that the
   dynamics of a campaign have a profound impact on volatility. The
   campaign period is when the lowly sophisticated switch their vote
   intention. Those with higher levels of interest in politics have
   switched their intention before the campaign has started. The data for
   this analysis are from the three wave PartiRep Belgian Election Study

Title = {Why should we care about the definition of power?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL POWER},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Pages = {119-135},
Abstract = {Being pluralist about the concept of power does not mean that all
   definitions are equally valid. Many definitions are non-rival and gain
   their utility from the specific contexts in which they are applied.
   Others are rival and their relative utility derives from how good an
   explanation is provided by the theory of which they are part. Such
   explanation is constrained by the world because good explanation is
   constrained by the expectations it engenders. Some conceptions of power
   and related terms do similar explanatory work but hold different
   normative values. The contestability of `power' derives from the
   normative work it does in different contexts and explanations. By making
   our concepts as non-normative as possible we can ensure that the moral
   or political disagreement is brought more clearly into the open. How we
   define social and political power does matter in some contexts for both
   explanatory and normative reasons.},

Journal = {ASIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-22},
Abstract = {This article aims to refocus the theoretical debate on the rising
   China-India rivalry by using the conceptual framework of `enduring
   international rivalries'. Largely neglected by China - India studies,
   the enduring international rivalries literature is used hereafter to
   re-conceptualize the interactions between the two giants in a
   postcolonial context, and hypothesize the potential evolution of their
   so-called `rivalry'. Rather than being considered as a fait accompli,
   the rivalry will be construed through its intrinsic dynamisms (a series
   of historicized dyadic crises shaped by deeply rooted perceptual gaps
   and mutual psychological distrust since 1947) in order to conceptually
   map out the patterns that make it live, consolidate, and potentially
   terminate. It is argued that the successive peace management processes
   initiated by Chinese and Indian state leaders after each bilateral
   crisis have nevertheless perpetuated the rivalry, without any credible
   conflict resolution initiative been taken over the years. This article
   concludes on the importance to settle the territorial dispute, bridge
   the psychological gaps between the two societies, and increase
   democratization trends in China, if a rivalry termination between the
   two rising powers is to be envisioned.},

Title = {Party Voters Gone Astray: Explaining Independent Candidate Success in
   the 2009 European Elections in Estonia},

Abstract = {While independent candidates rarely perform well in party-centered
   systems, a genuinely independent candidate attracted a quarter of the
   nationwide vote in the 2009 European Parliament elections in Estonia.
   This study uses data from the Estonian case to address the question of
   why voters vote for independents. It develops and tests two
   explanations: the first construes mass vote for an independent candidate
   as a manifestation of anti-party sentiment, while the second argues that
   voting independent constitutes a variation on the familiar theme of
   punishing the incumbents in second-order elections. The results lend
   strong support to the latter explanation, suggesting that voting
   independent constituted a low-cost strategy for punishing the incumbents
   in a context where strong socio-political cleavages inhibited
   vote-switching to the opposition.},

Abstract = {The quantitative terrorism literature has largely overlooked interstate
   relations when evaluating predictors of transnational terrorist attacks,
   opting to focus on state, group, or individual-level factors to explain
   patterns of terrorism using analytical methods that are limited to
   either the origin or target of the attack. In this piece we argue that
   this is both incongruous with the larger conflict literature and
   limiting in terms of theoretical impact. Transnational terrorism in many
   cases is more accurately considered a component of conflicting relations
   between two states generally hostile towards each other, which
   necessitates an examination of both states. We demonstrate, by
   conducting a series of statistical analyses using politically relevant
   directed dyads, that interstate rivalries are reliable positive
   predictors of transnational terrorism. We find that interstate rivalries
   explain a great deal of variation in cross-national patterns of
   terrorism, a result that is robust to different rivalry measures.
   Application to Pakistani-Indian terrorism further illustrates the
   cross-national results.},

Journal = {CIVIL WARS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {49-62},
Abstract = {The French counterinsurgency has a tradition of its own, going back
   particularly to the experience of colonial wars, within which those of
   France in Algeria since 1830 stand out. This article focuses on the
   bequest of the Algerian War of 1954-62, but the strategies applied in it
   can only be understood against the background of earlier French theory
   and practice. It saw what, in the 20th century, would be regarded as
   particularly cruel behaviour on the part of the colonial power's forces,
   given that this was a Western liberal democracy, which in turn needs to
   be explained in terms of previous French experiences since 1940. It
   raised moral problems which are of an enduring nature, and highlighted
   the aberrancy of a concept that had dominated Western thinking since
   Napoleon: the aberrant emphasis on military victory, when the aim of a
   just war should always be a good and lasting peace.},

   Associations Losing their Value?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CIVIL SOCIETY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-15},
Abstract = {Research linking civic engagement to citizens' democratic values,
   generalized trust, cooperative norms, and so on often implicitly assumes
   such connections are stable over time. This article argues that, due to
   changes in the broader institutional environment, the engagement-values
   relation is likely to generally lack temporal stability. We investigate
   this empirically by analysing the engagement-trust relation using World
   Values Survey (WVS) data from the 1990 and 2000 waves. Overall, our
   results show that voluntary association memberships remain positively
   associated with generalized trust in both samples, but evidence that
   memberships in connected associations are better than in isolated ones
   appears, at best, scant in more recent years.},

Abstract = {Most people disapprove of the fact that candidates for the position of
   police and crime commissioner may be sponsored by a political party. A
   YouGov-Cambridge/RUSI poll has found that 61 per cent of participants
   disapproved compared with only 11 per cent who approved. The poll found
   that nearly half of those eligible to vote for a PCC believe the
   commissioners will make no difference in the fight against crime, and 45
   per cent believe some force areas will have worse policing than others
   as a result; just one in ten people disagree. When asked if having local
   PCCs will make the policing of national issues like security and
   terrorism worse, only a quarter disagreed. Margaret Gilmore analyses the
   findings.},

Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {15},
Number = {4},
Pages = {429-448},
Abstract = {Peter Jones has consistently defended the position that liberalism must
   maintain the distinction between the right and the good if it is to be
   qualitatively different from alternative political theories, and thus
   resist the charge that liberals are just like any other political
   theorists in wanting to impose their views on others. In this paper, I
   not only add my voice to the many who have already challenged the
   viability of that distinction, but also additionally argue that it is
   both unnecessary and undesirable to hold that so much of importance
   hangs on whether or not it can be sustained. I suggest that the
   dichotomy between neutralist or impartialist liberalism, on the one
   hand, and what Jones characterizes as the desire `merely to impose a
   favoured form of life upon others', on the other hand, is too sharp, and
   hence at best misleading and at worst mistaken. This is because, or so I
   argue, not all forms of favouring some values or ideals over others can
   plausibly be presented as the imposition of a favoured form of life.
   Rather, we risk trivializing what is objectionable about imposing a
   particular form of life on people against their will if we treat every
   departure from strict liberal neutrality as necessarily instances of
   such an illiberal imposition.},

Abstract = {In 2006, Bangkok's middle-class residents overwhelmingly supported the
   military coup that displaced the elected government of Thaksin
   Shinawatra. Survey research shows that opponents of Thaksin had a
   stronger commitment to liberal democracy and possibly to royalist values
   while rural voters supported Thaksin because he fulfilled their social
   demands. Opposition to Thaksin was not motivated by economic interests,
   but rather, there is some evidence that urban middle-and upper-class
   voters disliked Thaksin because they heard negative reporting about him,
   which were less available in the countryside. These findings are
   compatible with a new theory of democratic consolidation, in which the
   upper classes have the means that would enable and encourage them to pay
   sufficient attention to politics to discover that what they viewed as
   `good government' was violated by the ruling party, which could have led
   to demands for more democracy historically. More recently, however, in
   Thailand and perhaps other instances in Southeast Asia and Latin
   America, those with the money and leisure to follow politics closely
   have heard reports about the `bad government' of populist,
   democratically elected leaders, and thus have turned against them.},

Abstract = {What is political form? What is it as an analytical category and as a
   political thing that it represents? After raising this question and
   realizing that there is no explicit and operational definition of
   political form in the scientific literature, S. Kaspe offers his own
   definition: ``the integrated composition of mutually complementary
   spatial metaphors of authority that under certain conditions of time and
   place for a certain polity (or ensemble of polities) plays the role that
   is simultaneously descriptive, ascriptive and prescriptive, constitutes
   that very form of the polity (or ensemble of polities){''}. Such view
   allows him to make several nontrivial observations regarding the modern
   state of the Western political form and its prospects.},

Abstract = {On the basis of the analysis of the socio-demographic composition of the
   ruling organs of the ``United Russia{''} Yu. Korgunyuk draws the
   conclusion that the structure of these organs mirrors the structure of
   the country's ruling elite: the upper layer is represented by the
   high-level federal and regional bureaucracy, then we see leaders of the
   federal parliament and then-heads of the regional legislatures. The
   representatives of business and intellectuals are also present in this
   elite, not as independent force, but rather as either dissolved within
   members of parliament or as auxiliaries that serve the upper layer of
   the elite as experts and specialists. The research carried out by the
   author indicates that the `` United Russia{''} despite its numerous rows
   is a machine with its main purpose being helping bureaucracy to build
   hierarchic relations with entrepreneurial and intellectual elites rather

Title = {Questioning democracy promotion: Belarus' response to the `colour
   revolutions'},
Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {37-59},
Abstract = {The article focuses on the aftermath of the colour revolutions by
   analysing and questioning the real success, as often depicted by the
   West, of democracy promotion in the East European region. First of all,
   the article challenges the conventional logic of democracy promotion -
   even when backed by moral reasoning and resource availability - as
   sufficient and adequate for instigating democratic change in non-liberal
   regimes. By examining the case of Belarus it further contends that
   authoritarian regimes effectively learn to resist and counteract
   foreign-led democracy promotion, and often do so legitimately, with a
   minimal use of force. The article concludes that in order to exercise
   democracy promotion (if such a thing is possible at all) a far deeper
   understanding of autocratic narratives is needed, associated with a much
   closer look at societal norms and values, as well as an individual
   country's geopolitical resources and strategies.},

Journal = {POLITOLOGICKY CASOPIS-CZECH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2012},
Number = {3},
Pages = {218-233},
Abstract = {The paper analyses the position and role of the mayor in the Slovenian
   system of local self-government. This role has changed significantly
   since the communist times, and even since the mid-1990s, when Slovenia
   re-introduced the system of local self-government. We track these
   changes and analyse them in this paper. Our theoretical anchor is the
   work by Mouritzen and Svara (2002), in which they categorise ideal-type
   models of executive government at the sub-national levels of government
   and the relations inside the executive. Using data gathered in 2011 and
   2012 in a majority of Slovenian municipalities, we analyse the governing
   of the mayor and try to ascertain the extent to which it depends on the
   political parties that constitute municipal councils, on the municipal
   administration, and also on the institutional framework within which
   municipal governments function.},

   latter) for cross-time historical data essential for tracking the

Abstract = {This paper distinguishes between the concepts of justification and
   legitimation with a view to offering a normative standard for global
   justice compatible with cultural pluralism. According to this
   distinction, justification is presented as an idealized, substantive and
   top-down enterprise rooted in the moral and metaphysical substrate of a
   specific culture. On the other hand, legitimation has a procedural and
   factual connotation and derives its strength from the success of some
   culturally independent but historically situated practice (bottom-up
   approach). Building on this distinction, I argue that justification and
   legitimation should be made complementary for the sake of crosscultural
   dialogue.},

   Clause},
Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {35},
Number = {2},
Pages = {362-379},
Abstract = {This article analyses the Belgian gender parity debate of the 1990s. It
   first sketches the history of this debate and how it led to the adoption
   of statutory gender quotas (1994 and 2002) and finally also to the
   insertion of a clause on parity democracy into the Constitution. The
   article then discusses the factors explaining the adoption of these
   measures. After focussing first on the electoral system and citizenship
   model in place, it looks at the attempts of the women's movement,
   political women's groups and a number of femocrats to relate their
   requests to existing models of citizenship and representation, with
   special attention to the windows of opportunity facilitating these
   attempts. The article concludes with a reflection on how the Belgian
   case contributes to a broader understanding of the processes through
   which gender quotas and, more broadly speaking, gender parity get
   initiated and consolidated.},

Abstract = {Only democratic political systems can ensure a reliable and continuous
   inclusion of the interests of citizens and a commitment to addressing
   their needs. This contribution focuses on how citizens can engage in
   developing answers in fighting climate change and adapting to its
   impacts. Employing the function model of civil society developed by
   Merkel and Lauth, it draws on practical experience revealed by concrete
   examples and offers a systematization of the roles and functions that
   civil society can play in combating climate change. Examples of
   successful civic engagement on the community and national levels cover
   different perspectives and entry points, such as human rights,
   environmental and energy issues, and consumer protection. Transitions to
   stable democracy have become the object of significant international
   democracy support, so the account concludes that democracy's
   international supporters must understand the complexity that climate
   change brings to livelihoods at the community level and the potential
   benefits of pursuing greater interaction with civic engagement at the
   local and national levels.},

Abstract = {In this article, we consider how engagement with Muslims by the state
   has been conducted under the UK government's counter-radicalisation
   `Prevent' agenda. New Labour's `hearts and minds' approach to Prevent
   emphasised, and innovated, engagement with Muslim `communities'. This
   approach was widely criticised, however, particularly in the way it
   merged Prevent with `Community Cohesion'. By contrast, the current
   Coalition government's new Prevent strategy operates with a much thinner
   conception of engagement and stipulates that in future, Prevent and
   cohesion work will be kept separate. This new strategy signals less
   community engagement and a hardened line on the types of Muslim groups
   that can be engaged with. However, local actors driven by operational or
   normative concerns are pursuing somewhat different objectives, often
   outside of central funding streams. Such unintentional localism may
   sustain more participatory and inclusive modes of engagement with
   Muslims.},

Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {15},
Number = {5},
Pages = {649-666},
Abstract = {Cosmopolitan justice calls for extensive institutional transformations
   at the international level. But in the absence of a global enforcing
   authority, such transformations are bound to be hampered by a range of
   obstacles, including non- compliance and coordination problems. What
   solutions can a cosmopolitan thinker offer to address these challenges?
   In answering this question, the paper focuses on the role that
   international cooperation between the world's democracies can play in
   promoting cosmopolitan aspirations. It argues that such cooperation has
   a crucial role to play in executing global justice reforms; and
   furthermore, that the world's democracies have a moral duty to lead the
   way in implementing cosmopolitan justice. The paper then suggests that a
   `League of Democracies' - an intergovernmental organization which is
   open exclusively to the world's democracies - could potentially
   facilitate the type of democratic cooperation that is necessary for
   cosmopolitan justice.},

Abstract = {The political life of Nicaragua in 2011 revolved around the November
   elections and, more specifically, around the future of the ``Christian
   and socialist project of social solidarity{''} promoted and defended by
   the FSLN, led by Daniel Ortega. The FSLN won a landslide re-election
   amid accusations of electoral fraud. In fact, the FSLN manipulated the
   law, the institutions of the country and the electoral process to ensure
   its powerful victory. An explanation of the Sandinista victory, however,
   has to take into consideration the opposition parties' inability to
   articulate a discourse and a vision of society congruent with the needs
   and aspirations of the Nicaraguan poor. The FSLN, on the other hand, was
   able to capture the imagination of this sector of Nicaraguan society.},

Abstract = {Gert Picket, The Cultural Anchoring of Autocracy - Survival by
   Ideological Strategies of Legitimation and Economical Legitimacy or
   Political Democratization?, pp. 176-204. For a long time, the
   persistence of autocratic regimes has been explained by their repression
   potential and by the constellations of the actors involved in the
   regime. At the same time, the autocratic regimes were supposed to take
   the path towards democratization on the long run. Actually, only
   democracy comes with an adequate normative legitimacy assigned by the
   citizens. Apparently, even autocracies are able to get political support
   and thus to survive. Mechanisms of legitimation are economic success, a
   high efficacy of the regime, and an ideology that are appreciated by the
   citizens. Ideology doesn't mean only comprehensive political concepts
   (socialism) but also collective beliefs and identities (religion,
   nationalism, equality). In the long run, however, the supremacy of
   democracy in providing for collective welfare and the particularly
   strong legitimacy of the ideological concept of ``freedom{''} represent
   an advantage for democracy vis-a-vis other regime types.},

Abstract = {This article discusses the history of Scottish sovereignty as a
   component of Scottish identity. The argument is that certain aspects of
   Scottish sovereignty were preserved by the union, and that these have
   often remained latent until the devolution settlement. The new political
   landscape in the UK has contributed to a redevelopment of ideas of
   British parliamentary sovereignty, which have served to render these
   elements of preserved Scottish sovereignty active, and this new state of
   affairs is reflected in the findings of the Calman Commission. In this
   context, what is independence?.},

   political analysis and raises problems of qualitative characteristics of

   echoed in debates over the practical and philosophical difficulties
   incorporating animals into contemporary legal regimes. This chapter
   considers insights from Scheingold's two texts arguing that his insights
   into the legal imaginary in the latter text anticipates the critique of
   animal rights while his emphasis on the fictional imaginary in the
   former text can also be found in contemporary texts that suggest animals
   can help us rethink political agency.},

Title = {Magic Mayors: Predicting Electoral Success from Candidates' Physical
   Attractiveness under the Conditions of a Presidential Electoral System},
Journal = {GERMAN POLITICS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {21},
Number = {4},
Pages = {372-391},
Abstract = {A range of empirical studies has shown that candidates' physical
   attractiveness can substantially influence the outcome of political
   elections. This applies to different countries, different electoral
   systems, and different levels of political systems, and equally affects
   simple direct or list candidates and front-runners. However, no previous
   investigation using actual election results has been made into whether
   candidates' attractiveness also has an effect under the conditions of a
   presidential electoral system. Theoretical reasons can be formulated
   that suggest attractiveness is ineffective under these circumstances. In
   order to clarify this point empirically, we analysed the 2009 North
   Rhine-Westphalia mayoral elections. Yet the results of the analyses
   clearly show that candidates' attractiveness has a substantial
   influence. Taking into account earlier findings, the influence of
   physical attractiveness in political elections appears to be resistant,
   to a large degree, to varying constraints.},

Abstract = {One of the most pressing issues facing Arab societies, in view of the
   large-scale political transitions taking place in the Middle East, is
   the status of religion in the state. In this regard, Turkey, a Muslim
   democratic state, is often offered as a model to follow. The current
   piece demonstrates that despite the seeming appeal of the Turkish model,
   it is inadequate for Middle Eastern societies, in which religion plays a
   significant social role and is a core ingredient of individual and
   collective identity. This is because the foundations of the Turkish
   model were artificially imported from the Western experience, and forced
   from above onto the Turkish populace without much-needed contextual
   adjustment. This assertion is true not only for the original
   state-religion model in Turkey, but also for its modified present-day
   version, which bears to a large extent the burdens of the past. The
   article concludes by outlining some points that might serve emergent
   Arab democracies aiming to design a constructive and authentic model of
   religion and the state.},

Abstract = {In May 2011, Britain's Conservative/Liberal Democrat coalition
   government published proposals for reform of the House of Lords. In a
   White Paper and draft bill they set out detailed plans for a largely or
   wholly elected second chamber. These marked the latest stage in a
   long-running debate on Lords reform. The government's proposals aim to
   change the composition of the second chamber, suggesting that there will
   be no change to its powers or the conventions governing relations with
   the House of Commons. But this expectation has been disputed. The House
   of Lords presently does not make full use of its powers, and many
   anticipate that it would if its members became elected. This paper
   reviews the composition of all second chambers internationally, showing
   that wholly directly elected chambers make up the minority, and that
   both mixed chambers and indirect election are common. It then reviews
   the formal powers of all largely and wholly elected chambers. This shows
   that amongst parliamentary systems the formal powers of the House of
   Lords are relatively great. But second chamber powers, as well as their
   composition, vary widely.},

Title = {Europe: A Zone of Translation?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CIVIL SOCIETY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {8},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {251-266},
Abstract = {For one to imagine Europe as a zone of translation is in the first place
   to put oneself as an outsider into a space called Europe, who needs
   his/her ideas, thoughts, and practices to be translated into what is
   regarded as European. But equally importantly, it also requires one to
   think of Europe as a collection of many spaces, of other spaces, where
   the subjects of Europe are thus both insiders and outsiders at the same
   time, and therefore requiring translation to communicate and to be
   communicated and to exist and be cohabitated by others. In such a Europe
   as a social space, the immigrant, who may be a citizen or a non-citizen,
   is the classic outsider caught in a process of self-reflexivity. A
   perpetual dynamic of translation of ideas, practices, and arguments is
   the only way through which the immigrant can access this social space.
   But if that is the case, in other words, if only through translation is
   the social constituted, one can then re-locate the question of the
   figure of the outsider and mark it as instrumental in the constitution
   of the social. The idea of citizenship still animates Europe and the
   debates on European citizenship feature this social space of the
   insiders and outsiders who are in Europe while at the same time being in
   some way out of it. This variegated field of citizenship of a continent
   (as distinct from a state) with different nuances, emphases, histories,
   and structures suggests that the social indicates something beyond
   citizenship. What is this supplement, needed to constitute this social?
   Two factors are suggested here: The phenomenon of immigration and the
   practices of translation. This article is about these two constituents
   of the social space called Europe.},

Abstract = {Harald Schoen, Voting in Elections and in Referenda - Two Sides of the
   Same Coin? An Analysis of the Referendum on No-smoking Policy in
   Bavaria, pp. 514-535.
   This article examines the determinants of voting behavior in elections
   and in referenda in comparative perspective. It analyzes the differences
   between elections and referenda in terms of institutions and political
   communications and infers several hypotheses. Utilizing data from a
   survey conducted during the campaign before the Bavarian referendum on
   non-smoking policy, the analysis demonstrates that the determinants of
   electoral and referendum participation resemble each other quite closely
   in some respects, while they differ considerably in others. The
   determinants of vote choice in the referendum and the election differ
   profoundly. When studying referendum behavior it is thus not warranted
   to indiscriminately draw on findings concerning electoral behavior.},

   State Retrenchment},
Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},

Pages = {1024-1043},
Abstract = {Differences in the intra-party balance of power explain variation in
   social democratic responses to the economic crisis of the late 1970s.
   This article evidences this claim by analysing the case of welfare state
   retrenchment by social democratic parties. Welfare state retrenchment is
   electorally risky for social democrats and often contrary to their
   principles. Therefore cases of welfare state retrenchment by social
   democrats provide an excellent case study of the difficult trade-offs
   parties have to make between office, policy and vote pay-offs. The
   article claims that leadership-dominated parties advance office-seeking
   strategies and are therefore responsive to economic conditions and
   public opinion. Conversely, activist-dominated parties advance
   policy-seeking strategies and therefore support traditional social
   democratic policy platforms or seek more radical solutions. By comparing
   seven social democratic parties (Denmark, France, Germany, the
   Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and the UK) between 1980 and 2005, this
   article explains variation in when social democrats introduced welfare
   state retrenchment.},

Abstract = {This paper is a summation of material drawn from 18 papers written by
   Professor Toshio Kuwako of the Tokyo Institute of Technology. The
   purpose of the paper is to present an overview of Kuwako's approach to
   consensus building and make it available to the English-speaking world.
   The papers written by Professor Kuwako are largely experiential accounts
   with reflection on and analysis of that experience. The organization
   given to the present paper is that of the present writer. Given that
   doubts are sometimes raised about consensus building in regard to
   intractable issues where no agreement seems possible, and that it is
   precisely these kinds of issues that are the focus of Kuwako's work, his
   contribution would seem important.},

Abstract = {Native Americans are unique among domestic actors in that their
   relations with the U.S. government involve treaty making, with almost
   600 such documents signed between the Revolutionary War and the turn of
   the twentieth century. We investigate the effect of constitutional
   changes to the treating process in 1871, by which Congress stripped the
   president of his ability to negotiate directly with tribes. We construct
   a comprehensive new data set by digitizing all of the treaties for
   systematic textual analysis. Employing scaling techniques validated with
   word-use information, we show that a single dimension characterizes the
   treaties as more or less ``harsh{''} in land and resource cession terms.
   We find that specific institutional changes to treaty-making mechanisms
   had little effect on agreement outcomes. Rather, it is the relative
   bargaining power of the United States economically and militarily that
   contributes to worsening terms for Indians over the nineteenth century.},

Journal = {POLITIKON},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {39},
Number = {3},
Pages = {331-351},
Abstract = {The aim of this article is to make critical sense of the pro-autonomy
   argument in discussions on statesocial movement relations in the new
   social movement (NSM) literature. The argument is framed by a dichotomy
   between autonomy and power that portrays the NSMs as anti-state or
   non-statist movements. The generalized assumption implicit in the NSM
   literature is that the new movements operate at a distance from the
   state, as state politics is inherently undemocratic and despotic, and,
   in addition, that their collectivities prefer independent political
   activism to state politics. This article advances two arguments in order
   to offer a more complex picture of the autonomy question than what it is
   made out to be in this generalized assumption. First, the infatuation
   with autonomy in NSM scholarship could unwittingly legitimate the
   depredations of neoliberal capitalism. Second, the relationship between
   state practices and the praxis of the NSMs is dialectical and fluid;
   thus, the struggles of the new movements take place across institutional
   and non-institutional spaces regardless of the political opportunity
   structure in which they operate. Hence, autonomy can only be partially
   achieved, and since the new movements are heterogeneous, the extent to
   which they operate autonomously from the state will differ from movement
   to movement.},

Title = {Europeanisation through Cooperation? EU Democracy Promotion in Morocco
   and Tunisia},
Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {35},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {117-134},
Abstract = {The Arab spring has highlighted once more the European Union's failure
   to bring about democratic change in the Middle East and North Africa
   through its Mediterranean democracy promotion policy. However, Arab
   authoritarian countries engage to different degrees in cooperation on
   democracy promotion, giving the EU more or less influence on domestic
   institutional change related to political participation, respect for
   human rights, and the rule of law. A comparison of domestic change and
   cooperation in Morocco and Tunisia in 2000-2010 shows that the EU has
   been instrumental in supporting and potentially reinforcing domestic
   reform initiatives. Yet the EU cannot trigger domestic institutional
   change in the first place. The degree of political liberalisation
   determines the fit between the domestic political agenda and external
   demands for reforms. It reflects different `survival strategies' between
   political inclusion and exclusion and is therefore a scope condition for
   rather than the result of cooperation and change.},

   available to scholars studying stateness in Central America, as well as
   to researchers engaged on broader comparative research about stateness
   in Latin America. Some preliminary findings are reported and guidelines

Abstract = {Due to insufficient sample sizes in national surveys, strikingly little
   is known about public opinion at the level of Congressional and state
   legislative districts in the United States. As a result, there has been
   virtually no study of whether legislators accurately represent the will
   of their constituents on individual issues. This article solves this
   problem by developing a multilevel regression and poststratification
   (MRP) model that combines survey and census data to estimate public
   opinion at the district level. We show that MRP estimates are excellent
   predictors of public opinion and referenda results for both
   congressional and state senate districts. Moreover, they have less
   error, higher correlations, and lower variance than either disaggregated
   survey estimates or presidential vote shares. The MRP approach provides
   American and Comparative Politics scholars with a valuable new tool to
   measure issue-specific public opinion at low levels of geographic
   aggregation.},

Abstract = {Can conservatives be feminists? This article examines the issue by
   exploring the case of the British Conservative Party, drawing on a new
   survey of party members. Under David Cameron's leadership, reforms have
   been made to the party's parliamentary selection procedures and distinct
   women's policies developed, thus addressing both the descriptive and
   substantive representation of women. We examine party members' attitudes
   towards three types of gender issue: basic orientations towards gender
   roles and relations; specific policy measures relevant to the
   substantive representation of women; and the descriptive representation
   of women. Detailed empirical analysis reveals that there is significant
   support for progressive liberal feminist positions on each of these
   dimensions in the party, and that sex, age and basic ideological
   dispositions drive such attitudes to varying degrees. Even so, support
   for a liberal feminist position on the descriptive representation of
   women that is, the aspect of gender politics where the leadership has
   been most active remains on the whole quite limited.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to contribute to the debate on emergency
   rule, a practice that democratic theory has struggled to conceptualize.
   Accordingly, this article differs from existing approaches, which mainly
   focus on the constitutional design of regimes of exception and tend to
   identify the institution of the Roman dictator as their source. In
   contrast, we offer a comprehensive approach, considering other
   historical sources of emergency rule, going beyond the dichotomy of
   constitutional and de facto emergency, and focusing specifically on the
   types of emergency powers involved: executive, legislative and judicial.
   We propose a different way of conceptualizing emergency rule, following
   a political rather than a constitutional logic, and we illustrate this
   different conceptualization by offering evidence from Bolivia, Chile and
   Guatemala to demonstrate how this comprehensive approach works in
   practice.},

Volume = {31},

Abstract = {The two hallmarks of a critical election and, hence, of a critical
   realignment are the magnitude of the observed change and the durability
   of that change. In addition to offering a new approach to measuring
   durable change in national party dominance, and providing a
   non-parametric criterion to identify unusual changes in seat/vote
   shares, we provide fresh insights via a unifying statistical approach
   that reflects both of these factors simultaneously. Furthermore, we
   assess the robustness of critical election determinations in two ways.
   First, we compare the magnitude of inter-election shifts with both
   average volatility over the entire time period and volatility relative
   to a particular time period. Second, as an alternative to the usual
   perspective, we consider critical elections not as a one-time cataclysm,
   but rather as a pair (or perhaps even triple) of consecutive substantial
   shifts, generated by the same underlying factors. Overall, we
   distinguish six elections that marginally or provisionally meet our
   criteria to be critical elections. But focusing on pairs of elections,
   1858-60 and 1930-32 stand out as critical among all elections since the
   1850s. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {One of the most significant developments in Latin American democracies
   since the beginning of the third wave of democratization is the rise to
   political prominence of outsider candidates in presidential elections. I
   use an original database of political outsiders in Latin America to
   examine the institutional factors that contribute to the emergence of
   political outsiders. Using a fixed effects variance decomposition (FEVD)
   model, I find that, in addition to the favorable conditions already
   identified in the literature-legitimacy crisis of traditional political
   parties and negative socioeconomic conditions-the rise of political
   outsiders is determined by institutional factors, such as nonconcurrent
   elections, compulsory voting rules, and reelection provisions.},

Abstract = {After the great changes that occurred with the fall of the Berlin Wall
   and the disintegration of the USSR, we analyze, from a
   realist-systemic-structural perspective, the components involved in the
   generation of world order, which factors are involved and what are the
   different aspirations for the desirable characteristics that the order
   would have. It takes special account of the increasing heterogeneity of
   the system and how transnational actors operate as engines of future
   world order, dominated by the possibilities of the historically dominant
   actor: the Nation-State. We study the main characteristics and
   functioning of the international system and the significance of the

   countries in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. The crisis
   revealed unresolved problems in the implementation of previous reforms,

   the funding-gap issue, the reforms needed to address legacies of past
   choices as well as the exceptional circumstances of the crisis. The
   interaction of fiscal constraints and political conditions shaped the

Abstract = {One of the major assumptions of John Zaller's RAS model of public
   opinion is that people need explicit cues from partisan elites in order
   to evaluate persuasive messages. This puts the public in the position of
   a passive audience, unable to scrutinize information or make independent
   decisions. However, there is evidence that people can, under some
   circumstances, evaluate and use information independently of elite cues.
   Thus, patterns of public opinion in the months before the Iraq war are
   inconsistent with the predictions of Zaller's model. While the RAS model
   usually accounts for the dynamics of public opinion quite well, the
   situations in which it fails provide us with critical insights into the
   limits of elite influence.},

Abstract = {This article aims to identify the potential of the Open Method of
   Coordination (OMC) to promote the participation of civil society in the
   policy-making process in the fields of employment and education in
   Slovenia. Our analysis reveals that both EU factors as well as national
   factors determine the role of the civil society in the OMC processes. At
   the EU level, neither of the two policy fields requires a (large-scale)
   harmonisation of national legislation with the European framework and
   they both place competence at the national level. Thus, national actors
   play the OMC game only ``as much as it is required{''}. This leads to a
   very weak political will for making (extensive) policy changes at the
   national level. In relation to domestic factors, the existing structure
   or policy style is only marginally relevant to the participation of the
   civil society in the OMC processes. It seems that the (in) capability of
   civil society is closely linked to the extent/limits of their knowledge
   about the OMC's potential and opportunities. In the field of educational
   policy, the participation of civil society is further limited by lack of
   the financial resources.},

Abstract = {In this article, a theoretically informed and historically grounded
   perspective on ideology and ideologues is developed to address a
   paradox: while presidents play a central role in articulating socially
   diffuse ideologies, such as the soft-Statism of the New Deal or the
   anti-Statism championed by today's Republican Party, few administrations
   have been hospitable to ideologues, the True Believers who develop
   ideologies in the first place and are dedicated to their implementation.
   While institutional inducements to the presidential employment of
   ideologues have grown throughout the modern presidential era,
   differential inducements to their influence have been critical in
   explaining when, and how, both ideologues and ideology have intersected
   with the modern presidency. These differential inducements are exogenous
   crises, the regime characteristics of each presidency, and the personal
   traits of presidents. The interplay of these factors is charted from
   Franklin Delano Roosevelt (or FDR) through the Obama administration.},

Volume = {5},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {Although the separation of Church and State was a traumatic event for
   France, this article argues that its legal product-the Law of 1905-was
   and remains respectful of religious freedom. By considering the relevant
   literature and by reviewing the key laws and judicial decisions on the
   matter, this article also suggests that, for France, laicite represented
   `the other Enlightenment', that is to say, a moment when national
   identity was reawakened, if not formed anew. The piece concludes that
   the reason for this lies in the fact that, in 1905, France's Founding
   Fathers had the courage to distance the country's bloody religious past
   from its legal system, thus producing a statute (the Law of Separation)
   and a concept (laicite) that fostered tolerance rather than conflict.},

Abstract = {The vetting of potential federal judges by the Standing Committee on
   Federal Judiciary of the American Bar Association (ABA) is politically
   controversial. Conservatives allege the Standing Committee is biased
   against Republican nominees. The ABA and its defenders argue the ABA
   rates nominees objectively based on their qualifications. The authors
   investigate whether accusations of liberal bias have merit. They analyze
   all individuals nominated to the U.S. Courts of Appeals from 1977 to
   2008. Using genetic matching methods and ordered logit models, the
   authors find evidence of bias against Republican nominees in the ABA's
   ratings. They conclude by discussing the implications of these results.},

Abstract = {By trying to stop and reverse the effects of the economic crisis,
   governments resort to new methods of clarifying and communicating public
   services. eGovernment has the necessary capacity to attain such a
   desideratum. Although it does not represent a cure in itself,
   eGovernment may be successfully implemented using marketing. In this
   respect, this paper aims to ascertain the propensity of the Romanian
   public management system to digitize offered services and the
   contribution that marketing may be able to offer in the implementation
   process. Following a thorough analysis of the interviews conducted with
   public managers, this article shows that the degree of importance given
   to citizen centric principles, by establishing efficient, reachable and
   inexpensive services, is low. The few identified digitized solutions
   have been introduced following political decisions and the
   post-implementation results show a degree of use which is below the
   initial expectations.},

Abstract = {A diverse and growing literature ties legislative professionalization
   and power to career paths. In particular, higher rates of reelection and
   longer legislative careers should produce more professional, competent,
   and high-quality legislatures. Legislators have more incentives to
   strengthen their own institution when they intend to remain there for a
   long career. Using data from the most recent constitutional convention
   in Brazil, we show that legislators with greater prospects for long
   careers were actually less likely to support strengthening the
   legislative branch. We explain this as part of a local equilibrium where
   career legislators short-term need for pork trumped their long-term
   interest in a stronger institution.},

   inside and outside production is lacking. This paper offers one kind of
   response by examining how a notion of properly rights in stability
   changes how we conceive of the economic aspects of democratic rights and
   their rooting in common ownership and control of resources. To
   elaborate, the paper considers implications for the relation between
   egalitarian principles and policies and examines links between
   progressive public finance and the distribution of economic stability in
   more horizontal and hierarchical capitalist states. Polity (2012) 44,

Abstract = {It is widely assumed that citizens are myopic, weighing policies'
   short-term consequences more heavily than long-term outcomes. Yet no
   study of public opinion has directly examined whether or why the timing
   of future policy consequences shapes citizens' policy attitudes. This
   article reports the results of an experiment designed to test for the
   presence and mechanisms of time-discounting in the mass public. The
   analysis yields evidence of significant discounting of delayed policy
   benefits and indicates that citizens' policy bias towards the present
   derives in large part from uncertainty about the long term: uncertainty
   about both long-run processes of policy causation and long-term
   political commitments. There is, in contrast, little evidence that
   positive time-preferences (impatience) or consumption-smoothing are
   significant sources of myopic policy attitudes.},

Abstract = {Foreign direct investment is seen as an important capital source,
   providing development to the host country, also providing new job
   opportunities and technology transfer, and a complementary of domestic
   private investment in terms of host countries. However, some dense
   polluted investments, having cost pressure because of environmental
   standards applied in their own countries, carry their productions to
   countries where pollution supervisions are lower. Thus, developing
   country becomes a pollution haven and environment is damaged
   substantially as a result of these investments. With this study, the
   validity of hypothesis, accepted as ``pollution haven hypothesis{''} in
   literature, is tested in developing countries.},

Abstract = {The article studies comparatively the decision of the autocrats to
   establish or preserve high courts, analysing under which conditions they
   tolerate judicial institutions able to limit and review their power.
   Through the statistical analysis of new data on autocracies between 1972
   and 2002 and case studies, the article analyses how autocrats are more
   prone to allow high courts in context where there is a powerful
   political opposition than in countries where the elite is cohesive. This
   ensures that these courts legitimize those decisions susceptible to
   generate dissent and avoid that the opposition capitalize controversial
   political issues that could threat the regime.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on a set of democratic innovations that were
   introduced in recent years in Latin America that involve the
   participation of civil society as an active agent of accountability
   Participatory innovations are redefining the traditional scenario in
   which the practice of democratic representation takes place, adding
   novel arenas and mechanisms to engage actors that traditionally were not
   actively involved in accountability politics. The proliferation of
   alternative means for holding governments accountable undermines the
   traditional view of democratic representation, which continues to view
   elections as the quintessential mechanism of citizen control. The
   conventional way of thinking about the role of citizens in the practice
   of democratic accountability-which was largely modeled around the act of
   electoral delegation-must be reconceptualized to make room for other
   mechanisms of citizen control beyond the sporadic act of voting.},

Abstract = {In this article, it is argued that horizontal intra-industry trade is
   associated with reduced conflict propensity within dyads. Horizontal
   intra-industry trade is characterized by participation in international
   markets for similar - in many cases, branded - commodities, resulting
   from economies of scale and consumer tastes for variety. Conversely,
   inter-industry trade in accordance with the Ricardian and
   Heckscher-Ohlin models, while providing valuable trade gains, in some
   instances provokes vulnerability to trade partners, such that its
   overall impact on dyadic conflict is ambiguous. Support for this
   expectation is found in empirical tests spanning from 1963 to 2001.
   Additionally, there is evidence that development is insufficient to
   preclude conflict when jointly developed dyads engage in no
   intra-industry trade.},

Abstract = {This essay analyzes the body politics at the center of both business
   services outsourcing labor (also termed affective, immaterial, or
   communicative labor) and the value-adding digital image in contemporary
   Indian media. The author uses a ``media assemblage{''} method in this
   analysis, which brings together a critique of emerging forms of
   communicative labor; digital image technologies, and the changing
   capacities of the body, or affect. This paper is concept, following the
   critical approach methodology, and interprets findings rather than
   predicts them. Numerous feminist investigations analyzing the potentials
   within what has been designated traditionally as women's work, have
   grasped affective labor with terms such as kin work and caring labor.
   Through an analysis of the Hindi-Bollywood film No Smoking (Kashyap,
   2008), and the documentary Office Tigers (Mermin, 2006), the author
   explores the emergence of a digital vision in the South Asian context
   through pervasive processes that are ``informatizing{''} various forms
   of life and work. They correlate the function of this digital vision in
   both business outsourcing and digital media through analyses of two key
   modalities: the evolving functionality of information in computer
   technology; and the modulation of subjectivity in the capacities of
   attention and sensation of value creation.},

Abstract = {The text provides an overview and evaluation of the strategy and tactics
   of Croatian politics in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The analysis
   focuses on the historical Tenth Session of CK SKH (Central Committee of
   the League of Communists of Croatia) held in 1970, which defined
   Croatian politics with regard to economic and social reform, as well as
   to centralist unitarism and Croatian nationalism. The Tenth Session was
   conceived and held on the initiative of Vladimir Bakaric, a great figure
   and a veteran of Croatian politics, who was the uncontested master of
   Croatia from the end of the war to 1969. With the fall of Rankovic
   (1966), the symbol of ``neo-Stalinist centralism, bureaucratism and
   Great-Serbian hegemonism{''}, one of the principal obstacles to
   modernization and democratization of Yugoslav communism was removed. The
   finest advocates of economic and political liberalization of the regime,
   of decentralization and of a stronger position of the republics were
   Bakaric and his disciples, an intelligent and well-educated generation
   of communists (Tripalo, Dabcevic-Kucar, Pirker). They are the ones who
   would eventually become symbols of the struggle against the Party's
   dogmatic conservatism and Stalinist voluntarism. The author puts forward
   a series of elements which make it possible to understand how the
   political career of this generation of dynamic and popular politicians,
   recognized and successful representatives of socialist democracy and
   national equality, came to a tragic end marked by accusations of
   flirting with chauvinism, of using ``neo-Stalinist{''} methods against
   opponents and colleagues, and of attempting to establish a quasi-fascist
   state, in which the dictatorial rule of the clique of (former?)
   communists and nationalists, in alliance with the new middle class of
   managers and ``technocrats{''}, would be masked by socialist rhetoric
   and pseudo-mobilization of the masses deluded by nationalism into
   believing that members of some other nation are to blame for all
   problems.},

Abstract = {How relatively good or bad were the economic performances of our past
   presidents? The answers to this question remain unclear. Most
   evaluations of presidential performance cloud the issue with partisan
   bias and subjective judgments or mix economics together with other
   policy areas. To address these shortcomings, this article uses new data
   from the Measuring Worth Project to calculate the relative economic
   rankings of the United States presidents who served from 1789 until
   2009. It analyzes up to 220 years of data on economic growth,
   unemployment, inflation, government debt, balance of payments, income
   inequality, currency strength, interest rates, and stock market returns
   to estimate an economic grade point average for each president. Then,
   these estimates are used to test for correlations with other variables
   to generate hypotheses regarding the conditions for superior and
   inferior economic performance.},

Abstract = {In challenging Marxist theorists to confront the radical rebirth at the
   core of the fascist revolution, Roger Griffin has carried fascist
   studies to a new and valuable plateau. Likewise, David D. Roberts's
   elaboration of Griffin's model offers a provocative and fruitful avenue
   to rethink fascist political culture. This article seeks to advance the
   dialogue to the next level by considering what an international approach
   can add to these primarily nationalist interpretations of generic
   fascism. Drawing on examples from the history of the United States, I
   argue that fascism is a fundamentally cosmopolitan process and that it
   needs to be placed on a broader continuum with the histories of slavery,
   racism and nationalism.},

Abstract = {While the constitutional studies are continuing in Turkey, the demands
   of ecological constitution come up, which means to represent the
   environment as the subject of the constitution. This study is prepared
   to see whether the Charter of the Environment, adopted in France in
   2005, can be an example for these demands in Turkey. France accepts the
   Charter, which contains environmental rights, duties, precautionary
   principle and predicts the sustainable development as an objective, as a
   part of its constitution. This constitutional text raises the objective
   of protection and preservation of environment to the top of the
   hierarchy of norms. However, the handicaps that the text contains show
   us the sincerity of the political struggles concerning the protection of
   the environment. Against of this insincere attitude, environmentalists
   hope that judges will interpret courageously the Environmental Charter
   and play a decisive role in protection and improvement of the
   environment.},

Abstract = {Alberta remains the only Canadian province to exclude agricultural
   workers from the ambit of its occupational health and safety laws.
   Consequently, farm workers have no right to know about workplace safety
   hazards and no right to refuse unsafe work, thereby increasing their
   risk of a workplace injury. This study uses qualitative content analysis
   to identify three narratives used by government members of the
   legislative assembly between 2000 and 2010 to justify the continued
   exclusion of agricultural workers from basic health and safety rights.
   These narratives are: (1) education is better than regulation, (2) farms
   cannot be regulated, and (3) farmers don't want and can't afford
   regulation. Analysis of these narratives reveals them to be largely
   invalid, raising the question of why government members rely upon these
   narratives. The electoral rewards associated with maintaining this
   exclusion may comprise part of the explanation.},

Abstract = {The rise of China as a regional and global power has been unprecedented
   in world history. It has elevated itself from an utterly impoverished
   agrarian society to one of the most powerful economies, advancing the
   world towards a multipolar system. On one hand, the United States
   continues to see China as an opportunity for economic cooperation to
   resuscitate its hard-hit economy; on the other hand, it pursues an
   ``anti-China Containment{''} policy to counter any efforts on part of
   China to challenge its supremacy in world affairs. Whether China can
   gradually erode the foundations of U.S. influence in Southeast Asia
   without the actual display of force will test the pragmatism of the
   Chinese mind-set. This article aims to analyze the Sino-U.S. rivalry for
   the domination in Southeast Asia and its implications.},

   is addressed through content analysis of public documents and internal

   diverse group of actors create policy stalemates. Others contend instead
   that new ideas are more likely to arise and diffuse from such a diverse
   group. This article is a contribution to this scholarly debate,
   proposing an original contribution on policy agendas. It argues that
   both perspectives are useful to understanding the dynamic of policy
   making within federal systems. Looking at change in policy attention in
   Canadian and British speeches from the throne, the article argues that
   federalism constrains change immediately following a party turnover in
   government. In the following years, however, federal arrangements
   encourage larger changes in policy attention than arrangements where
   power is centralized.},

Abstract = {The passage of electoral gender quotas raises questions about why male
   elites would support policies that seemingly go against their
   self-interests. Recent work on France suggests that quota adoption is
   self-interested because male legislators benefit from alleged voter bias
   against female candidates. This article evaluates this explanation as a
   means for understanding quota adoption globally. It argues that the key
   actors are not legislators but political parties. Developing an
   alternative causal story centered on ``party pragmatism,{''} it finds
   that decisions to introduce quotas are rational and consistent once a
   range of incentives-ideological, electoral, and strategic-are taken into
   account.},

Abstract = {Over the past years, energy security has turned into a major theme of
   the international security debate. As an Alliance that provides
   protection for almost 900 million citizens, NATO has a legitimate role
   to play in energy security. Defining the exact nature of this role
   proved difficult at first, as there were concerns by some Allies about
   unduly ``militarizing{''} an essentially economic issue. But energy
   security is becoming firmly embedded in NATO's agenda. The Alliance's
   new Strategic Concept broke new ground with respect to non-traditional
   security challenges, including energy security. The Lisbon Summit
   Declaration also reinforced the Strategic Concept's message by tasking
   NATO to integrate energy security considerations into NATO's policies.
   Today, the question of ``if{''} has been replaced by the question of
   ``how{''} - energy security is now a permanent fixture of NATO's agenda.},

Abstract = {This review examines four books from the series Constitutional Systems
   of the World: these books set out the experience of the US, Germany,
   Russia and South Africa. As introductions to each of these countries'
   experience with constitutions, each text is perfectly acceptable; the
   problems start when we begin to compare the books to each other. Then
   questions arise about the approaches taken by each individual author,
   and the overall objective behind the series. Henderson, J. (2011) The

Title = {Rule Creation in a Political Hierarchy},
Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {106},
Number = {3},
Pages = {622-643},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Principal-agent relations are replete in politics; politicians are
   agents of electorates, bureaucrats are agents of executives, lower
   courts are agents of upper courts, and much more. Commonly, principals
   are modeled as the rule-making body and agents as the rule-implementing
   body. However, principals often delegate the authority to make the rules
   themselves to their agents. The relationship between the lower federal
   courts and the Supreme Court is one such example; a considerable portion
   of the law (rules) is made in the lower federal courts with the Supreme
   Court serving primarily as the overseer of those lower courts'
   decisions. In this article, we develop and test a principal-agent model
   of law (rule) creation in a judicial hierarchy. The model yields new
   insights about the relationship among various features of the judicial
   hierarchy that run against many existing perceptions. For example, we
   find a non-monotonic relationship between the divergence in upper and
   lower court preferences over rules and the likelihood of review and
   reversal by the Supreme Court. The empirical evidence supports these
   derived relationships. Wider implications for the principal-agent
   literature are also discussed.},

Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This article advances a novel theoretical account of what a ``method{''}
   is and what makes one ``rigorous,{''} and shows how it could advance
   contemporary debates in political theory and empirical methodology.
   Plato's Socrates invented the notion of method, and his characteristic
   practice of immanent refutation through questioning escapes key problems
   in more familiar views. Socratic method is (1) antifoundational, (2)
   non-algorithmic, and (3) indirect and relative to competing hypotheses,
   and it (4) develops its own standards of objectivity from the logic of
   asking questions. The article reconstructs Socrates' method from the
   Platonic texts and shows how it provides reasonable criteria for
   judgment while remaining critical, sensitive to difference, and open to
   innovation. Socratic method avoids a forced choice between universalism
   and particularism in political theory, and it provides a common language
   for evaluating both quantitative and qualitative methods by drawing out
   a critical logic of empirical inquiry shared by both.},

Abstract = {In the absence of congressional action, states have two nonexclusive
   e-commerce sales tax policy options: membership in the Streamlined Sales
   Tax Project or enactment of Amazon tax legislation. Previous research
   has suggested that economic factors are important predictors of adopting
   the former, and legislators frequently assert that lost revenue is a
   motivation for adopting either. There is also some evidence that a
   state's political environment determines policy selection. This article
   tests these claims. Using two unique datasets, one for each policy,
   economic factors and foregone revenue are found to not be statistically
   significant predictors of e-commerce tax policy adoption. Instead, the
   political environment matters. The analysis concludes that governors
   drive state e-commerce sales tax policy, and that the naive perception
   that Republicans are less willing to tax than Democrats is misleading.
   Furthermore, the analysis finds indirect evidence that retail lobby
   influence is an important factor in a state's enactment of Amazon tax
   legislation.},

Abstract = {Why do people vote against their interests? Previous explanations miss
   something fundamental because they do not consider the work of group
   consciousness. Based on participant observation of conversations from
   May 2007 to May 2011 among 37 regularly occurring groups in 27
   communities sampled across Wisconsin, this study shows that in some
   places, people have a class- and place-based identity that is
   intertwined with a perception of deprivation. The rural consciousness
   revealed here shows people attributing rural deprivation to the decision
   making of (urban) political elites, who disregard and disrespect rural
   residents and rural lifestyles. Thus these rural residents favor limited
   government, even though such a stance might seem contradictory to their
   economic self-interests. The results encourage us to consider the role
   of group consciousness-based perspectives rather than pitting interests
   against values as explanations for preferences. Also, the study suggests
   that public opinion research more seriously include listening to the
   public.},

Abstract = {This article provides a social psychological analysis of the neglected
   issue of intergroup compromise. We discuss the factors that promote
   respondents' willingness to compromise with two very different
   outgroups. We present a framework in which altruistic motivations (such
   as empathy) and egoistic motivations (such as trust and symbolic threat)
   act as proximal predictors of compromise, with intergroup contact as a
   distal predictor. We found that respondents who had more positive
   contact with homosexuals perceived them to be less threatening, and felt
   more empathy towards them, and in turn, were more likely to compromise
   with them on group-specific issues (controlling for the general tendency
   to compromise). We also found that respondents who had more negative
   contact with Muslims perceived them to be more threatening, and in turn,
   were less likely to compromise with them. We discuss these results with
   reference to recent developments in intergroup relations and the state
   of public discourse in contemporary Britain, examine their implications
   for intergroup relations in pluralistic contexts, and make suggestions
   for future research on willingness to compromise with outgroups.},

   O'Donnell's works constitutes an important political theory treated, in
   order to generate new comparatives perspectives. In order to these, the
   main contributions on democracy and the state, its historicization, the
   state of law and its implications on citizenry, his ideas on Latin
   America democracy and the discussions around Delegative Democracy, and
   the conclusions on his main concerning and motivation: democratization
   as a construction without boundaries. His legacy endures untouched on
   the social sciences agenda, confirming his unique capacity to articulate
   diverse paradigms and contributions, to propose concepts and theories
   about them.},

Abstract = {In 1997 we first offered American government classes online as well as
   face-to-face classes. We administered pre- and posttests to our students
   to measure their general knowledge of American government, political
   attitudes, demographics, and some behaviors. Following an initial report
   in 2001, we continued to gather data for 10 more years; this current
   study covers nearly 3,200 students during 13 years. We examine the
   sample as a whole and changes in audiences and outcomes, over time, for
   the two teaching formats. Although the kinds of students taking online
   classes have become more similar, a few differences persist. Learning
   outcome differences continue to be insignificant. Neither format has a
   clear advantage in students' changes in attitudes, but the online
   classes increased students' newspaper reading. Class dropout rate and
   faculty workload both favor face-to-face classes, but flexibility in
   scheduling and student demand clearly favor online classes.},

Abstract = {In the United States, considerable evidence documents the power of
   partisanship to shape voter preferences. But does partisanship have
   similar powers beyond American shores? Observational evidence leads some
   in this old debate to answer yes, but others to contend partisanship
   merely restates party vote. Experimentation can clarify what powers, if
   any, partisanship wields over voters in specific countries. If effects
   differ across countries, then scholars can turn their attention to
   explaining why. Survey experiments conducted in three countries where
   multiple parties viably compete for legislative seats-Great Britain,
   Hungary, and Poland-demonstrate that, when cues are available, party
   identifiers often follow their party's lead when expressing policy
   preferences. However, the pattern of results suggests this power may
   strengthen with party system crystallization.},

Abstract = {Jacques Couland, Arab World : democracy is the solution
   In opposition of a prevailing pessimism on the future of the Arab world,
   this paper intends to propose some elements of reflection to accompany a
   current movement. A reminder of the chains which, from the Tunisian and
   Egyptian cases, led to the wide regional expansion of the uprisings,
   leads to inquire the most lasting cases, Yemen and Syria. The place
   taken by Islamic currents is a true challenge. But also the dispersal of
   secular and modernist forces, although gathering efforts are taking
   place.},

Title = {Is There a Necessary Condition for Democracy? The Role of State Capacity

Abstract = {Although postcommunist countries share a common past, the variability of
   outcomes in both democracy and economic reform is very large in the
   region. Only a few countries have become Western-type democracies in
   Central and Eastern Europe and the Baltic. By contrast, the norm is
   clearly not democracy for other Soviet successor states. In this
   article, the author attributes this variation to differences in the
   infrastructural capacity of the state. Using both quantitative and
   qualitative analyses within 26 postcommunist countries, the author
   argues that for democracy to flourish, the state must first possess the
   necessary means to maintain law and order and to protect the rights of
   citizens, in other words, to ensure the maintenance and delivery of
   essential public goods. The results show that the links between a strong
   state that has been able to apply a definitive set of rules and
   democratic institutions are clear.},

   Supreme Court of Justice that regulate, in a transitory way, popular
   lawsuits for unconstitutionality. Based on an examination of
   constitutional norms, jurisprudence and doctrine, interpretations are
   proposed that are consistent with the Venezuelan legal system and the
   broad repertoire of precedents in the matter that can serve as a guide
   for legal operators in the forum. The law gathers Venezuelan legal
   experience in the area, but in matters considered evidence, it includes
   norms that can cause judicial delays by prolonging a phase that legal
   experience demonstrates to be useless.},

Abstract = {For all its rhetorical potency, the policy implications of the squeezed
   middle are yet to be fully explored. This article looks at what the
   phenomenon means for the design and prosecution of progressive economic
   policy. It argues that any progressive government today needs to adopt a
   new first order goal of economic policy: ensuring that the material
   wellbeing of ordinary working people rises when the economy grows, a
   project referred to as building a rising tide economy. This objective
   would sit in addition to the traditional goals of sustained GDP growth,
   high employment, low inflation and poverty reduction. It would have real
   implications across a range of important policy areas.},

Abstract = {The role of compromise in EU politics has been widely recognized by
   scholars and practitioners alike. At the same time, the systematic
   conceptual, analytical and normative study of compromise has remained an
   exception. This is surprising, given that the study of compromise can be
   linked to three broader questions at the heart of integration: (1) How
   does the EU accommodate diversity? (2) What makes supranational rule
   normatively justifiable? (3) Who or what defines the limits of
   cooperation? Against this backdrop, this article sheds light on the
   concept of compromise, on the role of compromise in legitimizing
   supranational governance and on the limits to compromise in the European
   polity. I argue that the EU a divided, multilevel and functionally
   restricted polity is highly dependent on the legitimizing force of
   inclusive compromise, which is characterized by the recognition of
   difference. This is true for horizontal or micro-level relations between
   political actors (where compromise works through concessions as well as
   justification, perspective-taking and empathic concern in a process of
   procedural accommodation), and for vertical or macro-level relations
   between systems of governance (where compromise works through
   constitutional compatibility). Given the legitimizing force of inclusive
   compromise, I subsequently identify the limits to such agreements and,
   thus, to supranational cooperation; I argue that these limits are issue
   specific and depend on where the costs of cooperation are borne. The
   article concludes by outlining routes for follow-up empirical research.},

Abstract = {``Rituals of respect{''} are recurrent, public, and reciprocal political
   practices. In Sufi-majority Senegal, such practices first facilitated
   accommodation among a variety of groups in potential conflict, and later
   facilitated tolerance, then respect, and eventually democracy. The
   social construction of horizontal rituals of respect between religious
   groups, especially Sufis and Catholics, and reciprocal vertical rituals
   of respect between the secular state and virtually all religious groups,
   have created this ``twin tolerations{''}-friendly environment. Is the
   Senegalese pattern generalizable? Three of the major dimensions of this
   pattern-a ``co-celebratory{''} dimension of diverse religions, a
   consensual state-religion ``policy cooperation{''} dimension, and a
   ``principled distance{''} dimension of support for human rights and
   democracy-are also prominent in several countries which have large
   Muslim populations and are widely seen as having been democracies for
   the last ten years, namely, Indonesia, India, and Albania.},

Abstract = {The paper exposes the reasons which made possible the valuation and
   success of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights contained in the
   Resolution 217A III and in the Universal Islamic Declaration of Human
   Rights, along with their legal development. From a historical and
   axiological perspective, life and human dignity are the touchstone for
   every possible consideration or estimation of the Human Rights. A wide
   comprehension which allows harmonizing the different ideological, social
   and religious points of view of the communities of the world is needed.
   Therefore, establishing universal criteria for Human Rights is
   problematic because we cannot define their validity and boundaries of
   application. Bearing this in mind, the aim is finding a convergence
   point that gathers the diverse perspectives around Human Rights and that
   conciliates the fundamental values of society.},

Abstract = {Having been a minister in three different departments for a period of
   over nine years (19992008), during the Blair and, briefly, the Brown
   governments, I thought it might be useful to reflect on what ministers
   actually do, their functions and how they spend their days. In thinking
   about what I did as a minister, I have avoided going back to some of the
   classic constitutional texts on what ministers supposedly do, how they
   are accountable and such like. I am sure there is good literature on
   this from political scientists and constitutionalists, but I have
   avoided influencing my own views and approach by consulting these texts.},

Year = {2012},

Abstract = {In 2001, the House of Commons voted to replace ancient procedures for
   electing its Speaker with a radical new system of election by secret
   ballot. This was a significant parliamentary reform that has received
   little scholarly attention until now. This article reveals how and why
   Speakership elections, in the space of a few parliaments, moved from
   being largely under the control of a narrow Commons elite to
   unpredictable contests with multiple candidates. In doing so, it adds a
   new dimension to two important and widely discussed phenomena: the
   increasing independence shown by backbench MPs since the 1970s, and the
   rise of career MPs at Westminster. These developments, it is argued
   here, laid the groundwork for the reform by contributing to changes in
   the prevailing norms around Speakership selection. In addition, this
   article reinforces existing arguments about the elusive and paradoxical
   nature of parliamentary reform at Westminster by considering the effects
   of Speakership selection reform on parliamentary strengthening. Reform
   can weaken executive control without necessarily strengthening the House
   of Commons, as illustrated by recent Speakership elections run under
   both the old and new systems. British Politics (2012) 7, 135-162.

Abstract = {Previous research has largely concluded that House elections have become
   less competitive in the modern era. Our research examines one area where
   we expect to observe more competition-namely, primary elections. In this
   article, we investigate when and where a state legislator will emerge to
   run in a congressional primary. All else equal, we expect that state
   legislators who can carry a large portion of their old state reelection
   constituency to the ``geographic{''} congressional constituency will be
   more likely to emerge and receive a higher vote share in the election.
   Using geographic information systems (GIS) techniques, we are able to
   derive a measure of constituency congruency by focusing on the degree of
   intersection between state legislative and congressional districts. Our
   results indicate that state legislators are more likely to emerge in a
   primary if constituency congruency is high, especially in open seat
   contests. Congruency does not appear to provide an electoral advantage
   at the polls.},

Abstract = {This paper shows two cases of traditional trade and non monetary
   exchange (The tianguis named Del Santuario, runs two days a week in the
   city of Patzcuaro, and the solidarian market of Los Mojtakuntani or
   Purepecha regional tianguis, on a monthy basis, on recent years) between
   the people from the communities around Lago de Patzcuaro, in Michoacan,
   Mexico. The objective is to look at the coexistence of these
   alternatives indigenous economic practices, as strategies for survival,
   as a local collective action implementation for resistance, built as a
   social memoir, as an utopia, in a context of postmoderns global
   processes.
   The structure of the document is simple. First, establish the basic
   notions for the framework. Second, explain the motivations to create
   this study and the perspectives considerated during the research. Then,
   establish if the phenomenon is isolated or not, and relates it with
   other references, at different levees (national level). To explain the
   scenario, the actors, the roles, and describing the traditional local
   market signs and how the trueque (exchange) operates inside the
   territory of Patzcuaro, on recent decades. This paper concludes with a
   serie of considerations and arise new question to enrich the debate and

Abstract = {The signature developments in intergovernmental relations and federalism
   in 2011-2012 were generally found at the state and local levels.
   Strapped for funds to balance their budgets, states and local
   governments have made significant cutbacks, taken legal risks,
   renegotiated labor union contracts, and rejected federal aid.
   Conversely, subnational governments have created jobs and taken the lead
   in various policy areas. The U.S. Supreme Court showed strong support
   for state sovereignty claims, which could perhaps encourage further the
   bottom-up activism by state and local governments. The president and his
   administration made deft use of executive powers to influence public
   K-12 education reforms and energy and environmental policy, but much of
   the year was spent in budget wrangling over how to reduce the mounting
   federal debt.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The ingredients of wartime morale are the subject of lively debate, with
   casualties, prospect of victory, and elite cues representing the major
   points of view. This research covers the wars in Korea and Vietnam with
   expanded time series of public support and rare surveys that probed
   perceptions of victory during those military interventions. The prospect
   of victory affected wartime morale during both of those conflicts. It
   did so quite uniformly in the American public, cutting across elite cues
   such as partisanship.
   Casualties left only a weak, if any, imprint on popular support for the
   wars in Korea and Vietnam. Wartime morale suffered during those
   interventions not so much because of battlefield casualties or the
   breakdown of elite consensus, but because the prospect of victory
   collapsed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This study targets researching in the Russian-American relations during
   the period (2000-2008) by using the descriptive and statistical
   methodologies, as the study shows the following:
   First: The Russian foreign politics during the reign of president Putin
   witnessed a mass turning especially towards the United States of
   America.
   Second: President Putin suggested some main principles for the Russian
   foreign politic, known as ``Putin's Principles{''} as he tried to mix
   between the Euro-Atlantic and the New Eurasian.
   Third: There are many aspects of conflict between Russia and the United
   States especially in expanding the sovereignty of NATO over the
   countries of Eastern Europe, and USA's try to control South East Asia
   countries annexed to Russian, supporting the colorful revolutions
   especially in Georgia and Ukraine.
   Fourth: Notwithstanding the aspects of conflict between Russia and the
   United States, this didn't prevent the existence of aspects of
   cooperation between both countries, especially in the fields of Economy,
   Energy, and the fight against terrorism.},

Abstract = {To date, no research has attempted to evaluate human rights in the
   Pacific region in comparative perspective. Employing commonly used
   cross-national measures of basic human rights, the author examines how
   well regimes in the region respect political and civil rights as well as
   the right to physical integrity. The results reveal that, as regards
   political and civil rights, the region appears to resemble parts of the
   developing world more than the developed world. In contrast, the region
   performs relatively well with regard to available measures of personal
   integrity rights. Moreover, the results reveal that levels of respect
   for certain key individual human rights in different states across the
   region are far from uniform. The author subsequently poses questions for
   future research based on these findings.},

Abstract = {This article aims to show that the influence of Pascal on Derridean
   Philosophy goes beyond the brief explicit references to this author in
   Force of law, and that they go to a still deeper ground than at first
   glance could be warned. From reading Derrida made of 285 of the Thoughts
   of Pascal, that posed the aporia between the force and the justice - and
   that will allow you to apply the central note of the law is the
   `enforzability' - we think that Derrida and Pascal are philosophers of
   the `Offcentered', that attempts to unmask the reductionism to the
   geometrical Thought. It is the claim of the irreducible of the ``reasons
   of the heart{''}, where we find a new figure of the impossible, and the
   Derridean demand of the irreducible of Justice (scope of the calculation
   and possible) to right. It is at the junction point of this off-centered
   between justice and law, where law finds his principle of ruin,
   contingency, and therefore its finiteness (where the closure would mean
   the aggregation of a finite configuration).},

Abstract = {This article discusses some of the main studies that dealt with dystopia
   in the last few decades. In the 1980s the debate on totalitarianism drew
   the scholars' attention to the dystopian tradition, as it was widely
   considered a precious perspective to approach the totalitarian
   phenomenon from different lines of thought. The visibility gained by
   dystopian literature also called to the forefront the relationship
   between utopia and dystopia, favouring on one side the adoption of
   conventional, shared criteria to tell dystopia from anti-utopia, and, on
   the other side, prompting a discussion on the differences and
   similarities between dystopia and science fiction. Historiography rose
   to the challenge of reconstructing the dystopian tradition, with several
   attempts to investigate the historical and political context that shaped
   it, or, alternatively, the literary models that inspired it.},

   the 19th century and the Eurasians. After the demise of the Soviet
   Union, their ideas combined with other anti-Western currents to form an
   ideological conglomerate that now apparently represents the basis of
   Russia's international cultural policy. It is basically conservative and

Title = {Where is Power in Governance? Why Geography Matters in the Theory of
   Governance},
Journal = {POLITICAL STUDIES REVIEW},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {10},
Number = {2},
Pages = {208-220},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The concept of governance has provided many ways to theorise the
   shifting power relations between the state, interest groups and civil
   society over the last 30 years. Theorisations have culminated in
   `spatial imaginaries' for visualising new governing practices and their
   associated power relations. By paying attention to these imaginaries, it
   is possible to see how each theory of governance brings particular
   spatialities of power to the fore, while necessarily foreclosing others.
   This foreclosure stems from a failure to visualise diverse and multiple
   modes of power in governance models and to take in power as a relative
   and spatially contingent property. This is not only theoretically
   significant, however; it also has important practical consequences for
   how we govern effectively in practice. I argue that rather than starting
   our analyses of governance arrangements with theoretical models which
   appear to predetermine our understanding of the spatial workings of
   power, we should instead remain open and attuned to the complex
   geographies of power that might actually operate in practices of
   governance on the ground. I suggest that by deploying John Allen's
   topological approach to power we can achieve a more relational and
   spatially contingent account of power in practice under the turn to
   governance. This will give us greater insight into actual governance
   arrangements and their limitations, exclusions and unevenness.},

   explores the structural dissimilarity separating what are here defined

Abstract = {This study reassesses the ability of the mass media to influence voter
   opinions directly. Combining data on media content with individuals'
   assessments of British political parties during the 2005 general
   election campaign allows a test of newspapers' persuasive influence in a
   way previously considered a `virtual impossibility'. Utilizing repeated
   measures from the 2005 BES campaign panel, multilevel regression
   analysis reveals significant impact of partisan slant not just on the
   evaluation of the party mentioned but also on evaluations of its
   competitor(s). The strongest evidence of direct media persuasion is
   provided by the finding that variation in slant over the campaign drives
   how undecided voters evaluate the incumbent government party, even when
   controlling for a newspaper's average partisan slant.},

Title = {China's Strategy for Energy Acquisition in the Middle East: Potential
   for Conflict and Cooperation With the United States},
Journal = {ASIAN POLITICS \& POLICY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {4},
Number = {2},
Pages = {176-194},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In this article, the authors examine China's evolving energy strategy in
   the Middle East, particularly in the three countries that have the
   largest energy reserves and form the epicenter of the U.S.-China
   rivalry: Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Iraq. With \$3 trillion in foreign
   currency reserves, Beijing is increasingly using its cash to secure
   future long-term access to energy in the region. Through energy-backed
   loans, as well as upstream and downstream joint ventures, China's policy
   banks and its national oil companies are pumping up the volume of oil
   and gas that will flow from the Middle East to the mainland in the 21st
   century. At the same time, Beijing is embedding itself deeply in the
   economies of these major oil-producing states through expanded bilateral
   trade involving multiple sectors of the Chinese economy. Beijing's
   monetary strength, coupled with its lack of military involvement and
   political baggage in the region, has China poised to benefit from its
   expansive access to the region's energy resources. This article

Abstract = {We report the results of a trust survey and public goods experiment
   conducted with high school students in rural Thailand and Cambodia that
   together help clarify the dynamics at work in sustaining economic
   cooperation within these two third-world communities. We find that
   standard survey measures of trust employed by the World Values Survey,
   which form the basis of most macro-empirical investigations of trust and
   political-economic development, are not useful for predicting
   contributions to a public goods game. Expectations, on the other hand,
   profoundly influence contributions and do so independently of trust
   levels. However, this influence is complex and depends on the
   distribution of player types. We observe a distribution similar to
   previous studies, with the largest group, principled reciprocators,
   updating their behavior quickly based on expectations of
   trustworthiness. Indeed, this study suggests that trustworthiness in
   particular is more important than trust in general and further
   challenges `a-rational' theories of trust.},

   Rousseau as a forerunner of ecology ? Contrary to the thesis of such a
   paternity, contemporary environmentalism little mentions Rousseau.
   Industrial revolution which our author precedes seems to be an absolute
   prerequisite to the ecological problematization of nature. In short, the
   line of inheritance looks broken. However, can we argue that Rousseau
   counts for nothing in the routing history of environmental sensitivity
   towards nature ? To determine this, we must clarify the multiple
   relations to the ``environment{''} Rousseau feels and thinks from
   different points of view : scientific, theological, aesthetic, ethical,
   the latter being perhaps the more decisive.},

Journal = {GLOBAL SOCIAL POLICY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Pages = {45-66},

Abstract = {Based on the Dominican Republic's economic and political institutional
   characteristics, we would expect social spending there to be at least
   average for Latin America. Yet in reality this country ranks at or near
   the bottom of the region in educational, health, pension and overall
   social spending, alongside significantly poorer, slower growing and less
   democratic countries. This article argues that the underdevelopment of
   Dominican social policies reflects the political impact of international
   migration flows, including both Dominican emigration to the United
   States and the immigration into the Dominican Republic from neighboring
   Haiti. These flows have inhibited the development of progressive
   political actors, including the partisan left and organized labor, and
   facilitated the adoption of an economic production model that erects
   additional obstacles to the expansion of the country's social policies.
   Although the Dominican case is rather anomalous within Latin America, it
   holds important implications for countries outside the region.},

Abstract = {The pervasive influence of partisanship on political evaluations is well
   known and understood. Whether citizens rely on their policy attitudes
   has received less attention, especially in the context of how people
   update and revise their evaluations. This paper focuses on presidential
   assessments and uses panel data covering three presidencies to model the
   determinants of opinion change. The results indicate that policy
   preferences (like partisanship) exert a regular and substantial
   influence on how citizens update their presidential evaluations.},

Number = {1},

Abstract = {Independent candidates are legally prohibited in the Tanzanian electoral
   system. Promoting representative democracy; preserving peace, order, and
   security, and the ability of political parties to advance people's
   interests have often been cited as the rationale for such proscription.
   This paper interrogates the validity of these claims. Based on
   documentary analysis and primary data gathered by the author, the paper
   argues that the proscription of independent candidates in Tanzania under
   the guise of people's interests fails the test of validity. Further,
   although independent candidates are prohibited in Tanzania, findings
   suggest that the country's 2010 general election results presented a
   case for their de facto presence. The remarkable discrepancies in
   electoral support between the parliamentary and presidential candidates
   of the same political parties present indicative evidence to that
   effect.},

Abstract = {In past decades, scholars have tended to recommend `optimal' solutions
   for coping with common-pool resources. Examples exist of both successful
   and unsuccessful efforts to establish government property, private
   property, or community property. The absence of any property rights -
   open access - related to valuable resources is associated with overuse.
   The resource institutions that research has documented as working well
   in the field differ substantially in their detailed design but can
   usually be characterised as adaptive, multilevel governance systems
   related to complex, evolving resource systems. We need to overcome the
   tendency to recommend panaceas and encourage, instead, considerable
   experimentation at multiple levels to reduce the threats of massive
   collapses of valuable resources.},

Abstract = {Analysing transatlantic relations from the 1997 Kyoto Protocol (KP) to
   the 2009 Copenhagen accord, the article identifies underlying
   explanations for the divergences between the EU and US during
   international climate negotiations. It traces how a climate divide
   opened between the EU and the US in the early 2000s, involving
   confrontation over the implementation of the KP. However, a phase of
   EU-US rapprochement closed the climate gap in the late 2000s, leading to
   common positions during the 2009 COP-15 negotiations. Yet the Copenhagen
   Accord served to reinforce American influence, while undermining the
   coherence and credibility of the European stance. This led to multiple
   rifts in the post-Copenhagen landscape concerning climate treaty
   architecture, policy implementation and international relationships,
   jeopardising the success of future negotiations.},

Abstract = {Loans from international organizations impose large costs on the
   receiving nation. The decisions to accept such loans and then whether or
   not to implement the prescribed reforms are made with high stakes in
   mind. Domestic leaders are most likely facing punishment for the current
   economic crisis, but what is their incentive to implement the
   arrangements if the costly reforms associated with the loans may reduce
   their ability to satisfy their supporters? To fully understand this
   relationship, I develop a theory that explains leader tenure in the
   post-reform period as a function of the rational decision to accept a
   loan. Leaders who expect to be secure in the adjustment period are more
   willing to accept the conditions that accompany loans rather than
   attempt to withstand the crisis on their own. With the use of a
   selection duration model, I examine the interplay between electoral
   incentives and institutional dynamics to show that leaders governing
   under different institutional arrangements are affected differently for
   involvement in IMF loans. Since leaders choose when to accept IMF loans
   based on their own expectations of post-reform tenure, democratic
   leaders are less likely to participate in loans. Authoritarian leaders,
   on the other hand, are more likely to participate in agreements because
   their hold on power in the post-reform period is stronger.},

Abstract = {Given their political incentives, governments in more autocratic
   polities can strategically channel unearned government and household
   income in the form of foreign aid and remittances to finance patronage,
   which extends their tenure in political office. I substantiate this
   claim with duration models of government turnover for a sample of 97
   countries between 1975 and 2004. Unearned foreign income received in
   more autocratic countries reduces the likelihood of government turnover,
   regime collapse, and outbreaks of major political discontent. To allay
   potential concerns with endogeneity, I harness a natural experiment of
   oil price-driven aid and remittance flows to poor, non-oil producing
   Muslim autocracies. The instrumental variables results confirm the
   baseline finding that authoritarian governments can harness unearned
   foreign income to prolong their rule. Finally, I provide evidence of the
   underlying causal mechanisms that governments in autocracies use aid and
   remittances inflows to reduce their expenditures on welfare goods to
   fund patronage.},

Abstract = {Europe created the model of embedded international courts (ICs) where
   domestic judges work with international judges to interpret and apply
   international legal rules that are also part of national legal orders.
   This model has now diffused around the world. This article documents the
   spread of European style ICs: there are now 11 operational copies of the
   European Court of Justice (ECJ), and a number of ICs that do not copy
   the ECJ but use Europe's embedded approach to international law. After
   documenting the spread of European style ICs, the article then explains
   how two regions chose European style ICs, yet varied from the ECJ model.},

   in Chile about the rights and issues that have enabled social
   empowerment and the factors that impede to strengthen the citizens'

   My interest in this article comes from the concern in the recent decades
   about positioning in the public agenda the active aging as relevant
   issue related to the State-public sphere, all this process in an aged
   demographic context. The elderly people in Chile are an age group with
   low educational capital and high probability of being exposed to social
   risks, such as diseases and poverty, they need specific public policy
   that considers its age condition and also, promotes and strengthen their
   social capital.},

Abstract = {The 2011 election in Rhineland-Palatinate was a political earthquake:
   Following a string of political scandals, the SPD lost almost ten
   percentage points of their support, while the CDU could hardly improve
   on their disastrous 2006 result. The FDP is no longer represented in the
   state parliament. The Greens more than tripled their last result,
   allowing them to enter a coalition with the SPD for the first time.
   Analyses at the municipal level show that the party improved most in
   their urban strongholds while still showing a (relatively) weak
   performance in rural areas. This will make it difficult to sustain the
   momentum of their victory. More-over, the SPD is battered and bruised
   and needs to select a new leader, but veteran minister president Kurt
   Beck shows no inclination to step down. This does not bode well for a
   coalition that needs to organise the state's fiscal consolidation and
   structural transformation.},

Abstract = {This paper considers Lenin's revolutionary theory, starting primarily
   from his book The State and the Revolution, which is characterized by
   the tension between realism and utopia. In this book, the Bolshevik
   leader ascertains the timeliness of the revolution, and the
   ``opportunity{''} afforded by it, despite its inherent uncertainty and
   risks. Stabilized by the party, the insurrection shall steer clear of
   all improvisation and spontaneity. The crucial question, however, lies
   on what to do after victory. Contrary to the tenets of the theory, the
   state has not been extinguished. The process of self-extinction that had
   been foretold turned out to be no different than an ideology, like so
   many others, which feeds on its own continuity.},

   November 2011. The study is divided in three different axes, with the
   aim of providing an overview, as complete as possible, of the process.
   To do this, we first explain the formal procedures for selecting
   candidates, focusing on the institutional level and on the specific
   regulations of each party. Second, we will study the internal situation
   of each party, addressing aspects of informal relations that reflect
   both, conflict and cooperation, within these organizations. Finally, we
   analyze the influence of public opinion and perceptions of voters,
   contextualizing the process of selecting candidates within a crisis

Abstract = {This article analyses the factors that influence some Ghanaians to join
   a political party and become active in the party. It seeks to illuminate
   the multi-dimensionality of the motivational basis of party activism in
   Ghana by exploring the following problematics: Why join the National
   Democratic Congress (NDC)/New Patriotic Party (NPP)? and Why be active
   in the NDC and NPP? Based on interviews, it argues that some Ghanaians
   signed up for the membership of political parties and became party
   activists because of the selective incentives the parties dispense to
   their members. The decision to join a party is thus part of a survival
   strategy and serves practical ends, immediate or remote, social and
   individual.},

   with Russia which are realized and discussed at the moment on the
   post-Soviet territory. After twenty years of postsocialist development
   the potential of the CIS is still unknown, debatable widely advertized
   project of the Eurasian union is represented. The regionalization of the
   post-Soviet territory and local integration Russian projects are
   realities of the present stage of development of the former territory of
   the USSR. Dominating here in the economic and political plan the Russian
   Federation can choose various variants of integration and cooperation,
   including with the states which weren't components of Soviet Union. The
   Russian elite has counted on development of the national interests
   including various integration projects on the post-Soviet territory, and
   uses idea of a reconstruction of the USSR as one of ideologem, for
   attraction on the party of the citizens professing traditional Soviet
   values.},

Title = {Rousseau and the tensions of France's Contrat d'Accueil et
   d'Integration},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Pages = {107-126},
Abstract = {The Contrat d'Accueil et d'Integration is the keystone of France's
   revamped immigration paradigm aimed at integrating immigrants into
   French society and fostering social cohesion through adherence to a
   Rousseauian social contract. Because the use of the social contract as
   an immigration tool taps into an ideal (and thus flawed) philosophical
   tradition, it is important to move beyond the procedural mechanism and
   political implications to probe the deeper philosophical issues raised
   by grafting a Rousseauian social contract onto the immigration realm.
   From a Rousseauian perspective, discerning the nature of French
   republicanism is not a question of which paradigm-the traditional
   republican or the multicultural-has the better understanding of the
   fundamental values of modernity. Rather, what matters is how the French
   public views the scope of these values and whether the laws promulgated
   by the government in power reflect the general will of society as a
   whole. The contribution of this article lies in exposing the questions
   the immigrant contract raises regarding the power of the particular
   and/or general will, the problematic social patterns it engenders
   regarding the factionalization of society, and the tensions and
   trade-offs it creates regarding upholding the assimilationist paradigm,
   sentiments of inequality and fraternity, levels of social strife and
   definitions of national identity.},

Number = {3},
Pages = {273-285},
Abstract = {In Nations and Nationalism Gellner spoke for the capacity of
   institutions to substitute for weakened or withering nations, and it is
   in this sense that the Bauhaus (1919 - 1933), a German institute of
   architectural education, is theorised here as an abbreviated state of
   renewed collaboration. The paper posits the view that the contribution
   of architecture to discussions of nationalism, based on its capacity to
   elucidate latent aspects of the lifeworld, is its account of the spatial
   and material state of the nation. Institutions are viewed as
   middle-ground operations that rehearse the national spirit within an
   abbreviated setting for redemptive praxis.},

   capacity and public goods, the legal-rational state, legitimacy, good
   governance and corruption, income/capita and democracy and human rights.
   In particular, we show the importance of democracy, legitimacy, rule of
   law and secularity. Environmental degradation and debt dependency
   undermine stability. Revenue collection, corruption, rule of law,
   independent judiciary and exports can be important to stability even in
   the face of incomplete democracy and lower GDP per capita. These factors
   are relatively more important in low-income states.},

   TAIWAN TO SEE THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE CROSS-STRAIT-RELATIONS AND

Abstract = {Taiwan media reflects the diversity and chaos of Ideology after the
   political reform from the end of 1980's when the leader of Taiwan Chiang
   Ching-kuo announced the lifting of martial law on July 15, 1987. The
   democracy promoted the exchanging situation between Taiwan and Mainland
   China. The importance of Taiwan's geopolitical position is disappearing
   by time. To integrate into the broadened Asian-Pacific region in the era
   of China's uprising and Taiwan's closed economic cooperation with
   Mainland China under its military threat is a new trend for Taiwan's
   foreign policy. With the returning back of Putin to the presidency of
   Russia and his Asian cooperation strategy, Taiwan could understand the
   role of Russia appropriately to think about how to participate in this
   regional cooperation and consolidate the national security in the
   cross-strait region. The attitude of Russia toward the SCO should be
   paid attention to from the side of Taiwan authority. The author found
   that in the bigger geopolitical pattern in Asian-Pacific region that
   Russia plays more and more stable and positive role in the regional
   security under the competition with USA. The competition between USA and
   Russia is the new world geopolitical pattern for both Taiwan and
   Mainland China. This paper is divided into two parts from the aspect of
   Taiwan political and geopolitical changes to examine the problems of the
   cross-strait relations and Sino-Russian relations under the theme of SCO
   in East Asia. The author assumes that Russia's Asian Strategy will
   strengthen Russia's influence on the cross-strait relations deeply and
   Russia will play the more and more important role in regional security
   and economic cooperation in East Asia.},

Abstract = {C. Wright Mills has been forgotten by sociological theories however
   there is no doubt about how much he contributed to the field of
   Epistemology. He successfully participated in the American Sociology of
   Knowledge and, at the same time, he upheld the tradition of the Conflict
   Theory, including the sociological dimension into one of the most
   questioned political subjects of his period. Undoubtedly, Wright Mills
   was morally committed to the value of reason and freedom. His central
   issue was to analyse the real possibilities for a particular individual
   within a particular social order to become a free man capable of
   reasoning. He wondered how someone could be able to transcend his daily
   nature through reason and experience and to act accordingly to his
   power. The power and political processes were constant in his works,
   since he claimed that any political process was a struggle for power and
   prestige, for authoritative positions, both within each nation and among
   the different states. On the other hand, he observed that the social
   structure in the United States of America was not completely democratic,
   since the course of action depended on the decision of a small group of
   wealthy, powerful individuals. These concentrating spaces of power
   amongst some economic, military and political corporations were
   supported by their underlying ideology, a fact that became clearer when
   referring to international affairs. Nowadays, in a world of structural
   antagonisms, wars and rebellions, the need for looking at the work of
   intellectuals like Mills re-emerges. Mills showed us a way in which a
   complex entity as power can be understood, and, at the same time, the
   need to consider the course of history, its mechanics and process.},

Title = {Income Inequality and Policy Representation in the American States},
Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICS RESEARCH},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {40},
Number = {1},
Pages = {29-59},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Government representation of public opinion is a central component of
   democracy. Previous studies have documented a robust congruence between
   aggregated public opinion and public policies in the American states.
   However, an equally important question for evaluating the quality of
   democracy is ``Who does government respond to when formulating public
   policies?{''} I investigate differential policy representation based on
   citizens' household incomes and find that citizens with low incomes
   receive little substantive political representation (compared with more
   affluent citizens) in the policy decisions made by their state
   governments. This unequal policy representation occurs for both the
   general liberalism of state policies and on specific social issues like
   the death penalty and abortion. These findings suggest that examining
   the variation in political inequality across the 50 states can help
   scholars to better understand and explain ``unequal democracy{''} in the
   United States.},

Abstract = {The invasion of Iraq and the subsequent attempt to engineer a democratic
   state highlights the strengths and limitations of democratization
   studies to explain why, where, and how democracy occurs. This article
   argues that the way power is played out globally and locally determines
   the nature of democratic success or failure. Traditionally,
   democratization studies has focused on internal structures and agents of
   change. However, Iraq indicates that democratization is more complex
   than traditional comparative politics approaches have ascribed it. In
   this article, there are two key propositions. Firstly, global
   power-holders do not hold the exclusive ability to bring about
   democratization, but the drive for democratization is shaped by the
   display of power and disputes over global authority at least as much, if
   not more, than national-level politics. Secondly, the display of power
   internally determines two key dimensions of democratization: state
   capacity and societal security. This article relies on the example of
   Iraq to illustrate the shortcomings of the traditional approach to
   democratization and calls on a reinvigorated interdisciplinary approach
   to why democratization succeeds or fails.},

Abstract = {We are witnessing a process of influence and cross-fertilization in
   human rights between high courts. Several jurisdictions -domestic,
   constitutional, European Court and Court of Justice-cooperate in
   European integration in order to achieve collective enforcement of
   rights and therefore compatible interpretations must be constructed.
   Fundamental rights are an ingredient of a European and democratic public
   order, and the European Convention on Human Rights must work as a
   constitutional instrument of this order. The idea of judicial dialogue
   is such a flexible and ambiguous device that it becomes very useful for
   organizing a network in this scenario of constitutional pluralism.
   Nevertheless it is not at all clear what the expression dialogue
   ``means, however it is probably better not to go very much into detail
   because of the wide number of member States which have to understand it.
   Constitutional Courts should act as partners of the European Court of
   Human Rights and also as mediators, spreading European legal doctrine
   and making it compatible with their own constitutional doctrines by
   means of an interpretation secundum conventionem. It would be convenient
   to reform constitutional parameters in order to harmonize their internal
   standards with the system of the Convention. But we should go further
   and explain in detail the different relationships which are included
   under the word ``dialogue{''}.},

Abstract = {As undergraduate students increasingly rely on the Internet as their
   primary method for gathering sources, they often overlook the rich and
   varied resources available to them in library collections. Furthermore,
   students often lack the sophistication to effectively seek out and use
   information, an ability generally referred to as information literacy.
   Political scientists and librarians at one institution sought to address
   the gap in student information literacy skills by creating and
   implementing a semester-long library lab component integrated into the
   required research methods course within the political science
   department. This article presents the steps taken to implement the lab
   component, including the student learning outcomes we sought to address.
   We also focus on the measures we used to assess the impact of the lab
   component. Students who participated in the lab component demonstrate
   markedly improved information literacy skills compared to those who did
   not.},

Abstract = {This paper challenges the well-established dichotomy to explain
   international power phenomena either as hard power or soft power.
   Reflecting the observation of an increasing decoupling between power
   capacities of the states and their ability to prevail in international
   conflicts, the author assumes the existence of a third power category
   whose origins and models of action are not sufficiently recognized and
   researched. Borrowing the idea of ``structural power{''} from Susan
   Strange, he advocates the hypothesis that it is this third power
   capacity that frequently makes powerful countries powerless and less
   powerful countries more assertive.},

   Anniversaries},
Journal = {POLITIQUE EUROPEENNE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {37},
Number = {2},
Pages = {44-70},
Abstract = {The article aims to generate insights for further work on the legitimacy
   of politics in the European Union. Through an analysis of European
   newspapers, we examine and compare practices of memorializing the dates
   of two key events in the history of the European Union: the declaration
   by Robert Schuman on May 9 1950, and the signing of the Treaties of Rome
   on March 25 1957. The analysis traces the role of symbols and the
   unfolding of a collective memory around these dates over a time-span of
   six decades. The article's preliminary findings show that the Treaties
   are increasingly becoming the focus of a ritual of remembrance that can
   offer an anchor for ``European memory.{''} That is, the Treaties are
   regarded as a focal point of the past that informs the present and
   future of EU integration through the manner in which they play out in
   justifications of the policy-process. By contrast - and surprisingly -
   the Schuman Speech does not seem to be an important retrospective point
   of reference as yet, even though it is part of the official set of
   symbols of the Union. In general, practices of commemoration have become
   more inclusive over time: in addition to political elites they
   increasingly involve citizens as well. It remains to be seen, however,
   whether the events positively resonate with citizens in the long-run.},

Abstract = {During the Indonesian struggle against the Dutch, from 1945-49, the
   Chinese minority, accused of collaborating with Dutch colonialism,
   suffered continual violence, even following the chaotic period of
   1945-46. Incidents occurred in areas the Dutch had recently captured and
   then evacuated or in places where the Indonesian forces were retreating
   from the Dutch attacks, especially during the so-called Police Actions.
   Although the losses did not reach genocidal proportions in terms of
   numbers, the destruction of Chinese property, forced evacuation,
   atrocities and loss of life involved serious incidents, attributable
   especially to irregular forces and to elements of the Indonesian army.},

Journal = {GERMAN POLITICS},

Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Pages = {129-142},
Abstract = {Germany recently experienced another federal reform, shortly after a
   previous modification to the German federal system. Has the second
   federal reform brought substantial change instead of the gradual change
   that literature on joint decision making would lead us to expect? This
   article analyses the reform in three stages: agenda setting,
   negotiation, and ratification; and suggests that at best the new
   restrictions upon public debt brought about by the second federal reform
   can be seen as a substantial change, but only if actors comply with
   them. Furthermore, this note argues that varieties of joint decision
   making can be identified in German constitutional policy, as they can in
   German public policy and EU policies. Patterns of joint decision making
   vary, depending on agenda setting and negotiations, so that the article
   argues for a differentiated view of joint decision making, the joint
   decision trap and exits from the joint decision trap.},

Abstract = {Corruption has been a serious problem in post-Soviet Russia -though
   there was also much more of it in Soviet Russia than is generally
   realised. This article considers the scale of the problem, its causes
   and what both the authorities and civil society are doing about it. It
   argues that President Medvedev has been genuine in wanting to reduce
   corruption, and much more committed to this than either of his
   predecessors were. But corruption is so widespread and pervasive in
   Russia that it will take many years to bring it down to `reasonable'
   levels; Medvedev's political will is a necessary but insufficient
   condition, and he requires greater political capacity and support.
   Moreover, since Putin has been elected to become president again (March
   2012), the anti-corruption momentum built up by Medvedev will dissipate,
   unless Medvedev is made prime minister and given both full support and
   free rein by the president to pursue his anti-corruption drive.},

Abstract = {The years 2005-2010 saw a sudden interest in the phenomenon of
   radicalisation. Terrorism was treated as the end result of a process of
   radicalisation and, as such, a reflection of broad social changes. In
   the discussion surrounding this phenomenon, radicalisation has not
   functioned as a homogenous analytical category. We analyse leading
   academic and administrative texts and identify two fundamentally
   different perspectives. One of these perspectives locates the causes of
   terrorism in alien cultures and identity clashes, while the other
   proceeds from socio-economic conditions and sees the threat as coming
   from increasing levels of social exclusion. The two perspectives are
   incompatible but nonetheless co-exist in practice, making terrorism a
   projection screen for an array of ambitions and fears. The emphasis on
   radicalisation has further become tied to policy preferences which have
   affected the Muslim community in quite different ways.},

Abstract = {What is it for a state, constitution or set of governmental institutions
   to have political legitimacy? This paper raises some doubts about two
   broadly liberal answers to this question, which can be labelled
   `Kantian' and `libertarian'. The argument focuses in particular on the
   relationship between legitimacy and principles of justice and on the
   place of consent. By contrast with these views, I suggest that, without
   endorsing the kind of voluntarist theory, according to which political
   legitimacy is simply created by individual consent, an adequate
   understanding of political legitimacy should take much more account than
   most philosophical theories tend to do of the attitudes and beliefs of
   citizens and the social and political context in which they have
   saliency. This also involves acknowledging the limits of theory in
   determining criteria of political legitimacy.},

Abstract = {The practice of masquerade in Carnival has implications for the way that
   citizenship is articulated, mobilized and made meaningful in Trinidad.
   This is exemplified by artists who make and wear `Indian mas' costumes.
   `Indian mas' refers to a type of costumed performance, ritually played
   out on the two days of the year before Lent, which portrays aspects of
   Native American or American `Indian' dress, beliefs, iconography and
   history. It is a masquerade that underscores mas makers' understandings
   of politics, practices of informal nationalism and approaches to
   citizenship. This mas does not seek to exactly replicate the material
   culture of Native American `Indians'. The working-class, Hindu,
   Indo-Trinidadian makers and players of this mas express a creolized
   re-interpretation. This has significance for their identities within,
   but also beyond, Carnival. The implications can be seen in their
   negotiations with state bureaucracy over forms of governmentality in the
   lead up to Carnival; routes, prizes and judging on Carnival days; and
   expressions of citizenship and politics at other times of the year. An
   ethnographic case study of the Lionel Jagessar and Associates' Mas Camp,
   in the City of San Fernando, Trinidad, highlights how performative
   articulations of fairness, reciprocity and leadership can intersect the
   spectacular with the power of sociality. More importantly, the
   configurations of gender, ethnicity and nationalism described point to
   the messy interlocking of habitus and rupture. This, in turn, suggests a
   way to navigate occidental categories and map unexpected ambiguities in
   claims of political subjectivity.},

Abstract = {Integration policies for migrants in Germany, Austria and other
   comparable European countries are directed to the structural integration
   of migrants and restricted to legal provisions, training and counselling
   services. The history of affirmative action policies for disadvantaged
   social groups as well as the theoretical debates on affirmative action
   reveal that affirmative action policies, as implemented in different
   countries around the world, provide more than basic conditions for the
   structural integration of migrants. Affirmative action policies also
   foster social contacts and inter-group relations between discriminated
   and privileged social groups, and thus further the social integration of
   migrants. For their justification affirmative action policies transgress
   the limits of egalitarian justice and relocate the focus of social
   justice provisions from the equality to the realness of social
   opportunities for migrants.},

Title = {Electoral Systems, Party Mobilisation and Political Engagement},
Journal = {AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {47},
Number = {1},
Pages = {71-89},
Abstract = {Electoral systems are assumed to enhance political efficacy and
   encourage participation through party mobilisation because they create
   incentives for parties (or candidates) to mobilise voters. This paper
   makes use of survey data collected after elections in more than 30
   countries, spanning a variety of party systems in both established and
   new democracies, to examine how party mobilisation varies across context
   and what difference it makes. The results demonstrate that political
   efficacy and behaviour are enhanced when parties mobilise voters. This

Abstract = {Why are some interest groups able to successfully feed their preferences
   into the policy-making process in the European Union whereas others fail
   in their lobbying attempts? This study argues that lobbying success can
   largely be explained by the information that interest groups supply to
   the European Commission, the Council and the European Parliament. What
   is decisive is however not the provision of information by individual
   interest groups, but the information supply by entire lobbying
   coalitions composed of interest groups fighting for the same policy
   objective. Based on a quantitative text analysis of Commission
   consultations, the theoretical expectations are empirically tested based
   on a multilevel analysis of 2696 interest groups and 56 policy
   initiatives.},

Abstract = {This article examines the extent to which service-learning courses
   affect students' attitudes and opinions. Elsewhere, we used a
   pre/postsurvey field experiment to demonstrate that volunteering with a
   homeless person tends to erode the stereotypes held by the domiciled-a
   confirmation of the venerable contact hypothesis. Here we use the same
   research design to assess whether students in service-learning courses
   exhibit a similar type of opinion change after spending a day with a
   homeless person. We find that even with limited contact a significant
   number of service-learning students came away from their time with
   homeless individuals holding fewer stereotypes and with a more nuanced
   perspective on the causes and consequences of homelessness.
   Nevertheless, working with a homeless person did have a negative effect
   on some students and contact generally failed to change students' views
   on public policy.},

   profess allegiance to constructivism often have difficulty to hold to
   the end the notion that reality is a social construction. Therefore, it
   is common to see them yielding to the temptation to secretly
   renaturalize some part of the social world, renaturalization they deem
   necessary to avoid falling into relativism. This strategy, that became
   the standard, is totally regressive regarding the ambitions of
   sociology: it not only leads to serious inconsistencies, which this
   article identifies under the names of ontological gerrymandering,
   derealization, and criticism of artificiality but it severely limits the
   critical potential of constructivist posture by making it a regional
   theory rather than an universal one. A much more consistent approach can
   be found in the Durkheimian thesis on the social origins of categories,
   provided to read it with sufficient care to reassess an aspect which is
   generally neglected: the importance that Durkheim ascribed to the
   control by experience in explaining the transformation process of
   categories.},

Abstract = {The inclusion of the social base in the planning processes for
   development of the Colombian territory, has been marked by a series of
   obstacles that limits the participation of a significant number of
   citizens in the government's administration and making public decisions;
   a situation that is fed by laws that are limited to mechanisms, times
   and scenarios for civic consultation in the formulation of the
   development plans, but doesn't delve deeper into taking the population's
   decisions into account on big problems that affect their quality of life
   and the integral development of the country, a scenario that also occurs
   in the municipality of Medellin, the territorial entity that is the
   subject of this case study. This situation is exacerbated by the
   ignorance of citizens about the possibilities of intervening in
   government's decisions, distrust toward State institutions and
   indifference toward being involved in the public sphere, resulting in an
   environment of political disaffection that affects the stability,
   governance and legitimacy of the democratic regime; this implies
   important challenges for the political leaders in managing this
   disaffection and supporting shared responsibility in government.},

Abstract = {The study and promotion of the emerging human rights has become
   increasingly relevant in recent years, especially after the 2004,
   Barcelona Universal Forum of Cultures. These rights, have turned into an
   essential tool for social legislation for any government. Within this
   category, one can find the right to public space as a fundamental part
   of the right to the city. The absence and disregard for this collective
   right in the legal ordering of Venezuela has favored social exclusion,
   limited participation, the loss of community identity and communication,
   segregation, the lack of monumentality and beauty, privatization,
   fragmentation and insecurity, reduced mobility and accessibility,
   limited spaces for sports and recreation. Without public spaces, there
   is no democracy nor quality of life, no equality nor solidarity. The
   pedagogy of otherness is perverted. Thus, the importance in guaranteeing
   effectively this right. It is necessary for the condition and expression
   of citizenship and therefore, of great relevance for the healthy
   existence of cities presently and in the future. The opposite could mean
   the death of the city.},

Abstract = {Much attention has been directed to the creation of new institutions and
   processes in postconflict Timor-Leste; less emphasis has yet been placed
   on the individuals who operate and navigate this still incomplete
   system. Justice sector institutions function with practical constraints
   of budget and logistics, but are also subject to indirect pressures from
   the political sphere. Legal professionals face an unenviable situation
   in various respects-due to linguistic and, increasingly, regulatory
   hurdles, many are unable to enter courtroom practice. Those who do find
   work in a tribunal setting are often faced with daunting casework
   backlogs and unclear responsibilities, which may produce insular and
   defensive professional cultures. Outside the courts, jurists are
   leveraging influence as political operators, and informally as conduits
   of state-oriented information to their communities. This article,
   comprising research toward the author's doctorate, considers the
   interplay of process and personality in the Timorese justice sector and
   discusses implications for development.},

Abstract = {In recent works Nancy Fraser has developed a model of `metademocracy'
   that promises to reconcile the competing claims of universal justice
   (grounded in human rights) and localized democracy (grounded in popular
   sovereignty). By instituting a global democratic procedure in which all
   enjoy participatory parity, Fraser hopes to ensure that some people are
   not denied standing as `subjects of justice' simply because of their
   territorial location while keeping faith with the democratic commitment
   to autonomy and self-legislation. Despite the compelling nature of this
   model, I argue that Fraser fails to bridge the gulf between justice and
   democracy because her model of metademocracy is built on the `metanorm'
   of `participatory parity'. Drawing on the work of Hannah Arendt, I claim
   that this foundationalist move re-asserts the priority of justice over
   democracy because it takes equality as a moral given rather than the
   ever-precarious achievement of human organization.},

Abstract = {The article critically analyses the late eighteenth century process of
   crisis and transformation of the concept of empire. By considering
   Raynal's Histoire des deux Indes and the Enlightenment's critique of the
   different imperial models, Pandolfi reconstructs the transit from
   classic colonialism - built around the relations between settlers,
   savages and slaves - to another phase characterized by the indirect
   exploitation of the labour force. The text underlines the ambivalence of
   Enlightenment towards the question of the empire by demonstrating how
   Raynal's work reflects the constitutive tension of the second half of
   the 1700s. Therefore, through Diderot's analysis, the author
   demonstrates how the moral advancement of humanity is the product of a
   constant interaction between the colonial rhetoric of commerce and those
   revolutions, which, - in different moments and places - have crossed the
   colonial space.},

Abstract = {Public opinion concerning social welfare is largely driven by
   perceptions of recipient deservingness. Extant research has argued that
   this heuristic is learned from a variety of cultural, institutional, and
   ideological sources. The present article provides evidence supporting a
   different view: that the deservingness heuristic is rooted in
   psychological categories that evolved over the course of human evolution
   to regulate small-scale exchanges of help. To test predictions made on
   the basis of this view, a method designed to measure social
   categorization is embedded in nationally representative surveys
   conducted in different countries. Across the national-and
   individual-level differences that extant research has used to explain
   the heuristic, people categorize welfare recipients on the basis of
   whether they are lazy or unlucky. This mode of categorization
   furthermore induces people to think about large-scale welfare politics
   as its presumed ancestral equivalent: small-scale help giving. The
   general implications for research on heuristics are discussed.},

Abstract = {This paper is about the unsettling prospect of the millennium. In
   post-colonial Africa and in other locales, nationalists sought to
   organize culture as heritage, a set of behaviors and projects inherited,
   in a lineal fashion, from ancient forefathers. By codifying and
   consolidating religion, and by reforming citizens' conduct, nationalists
   created a sovereign culture that could serve as a foundation for an
   independent state. However, there were other, more imminent frames in
   which citizens could act. This paper focuses on the Rwenzururu Kingdom
   in Western Uganda, where in 1970 a prophet named Timosewo Bawalana
   announced that the Christian eschaton had at last arrived. Rwenzururu's
   founders were historians: they recognized the organizing power of linear
   time. With evidence of their distinct language and culture at hand,
   Rwenzururu's architects used the techniques of modern governance census,
   map, bureaucracy to make their independent polity visible, credible, and
   worthy of support. Whereas Rwenzururu separatists organized time as a
   forward march, Timosewo Bawalana was following a difference cadence. By
   breaking with the past, Bawalana interrupted the heritage lessons that
   Rwenzururu's founders conducted, opening up an experimental form of
   community. His radical politics lets us see that the definition of
   citizenship involved an argument over the passage of time.},

Journal = {QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},
Number = {3},
Pages = {285-320},
Abstract = {This article addresses the question of whether incumbents can buy
   political support through targeted public spending. Using a regression
   discontinuity approach which takes advantage of the design of a recent
   Romanian government program that distributed coupons worth 200 Euros to
   poor families towards the purchase of a computer, we find that program
   beneficiaries were significantly more likely to support the parties of
   the incumbent governing coalition. These effects occurred both through
   higher political mobilization and through party-switching. The article
   also analyzes the drivers of such political gains and we find that
   program beneficiaries did not trust either the central government or the
   governing parties any more than the control group. Instead, it appears
   that local governments reaped the benefits of increased trust, and. the
   political support for incumbent parties occurred mostly in towns where
   the local government was controlled by one of the parties of the
   national ruling coalition.},

Title = {Introduction: Gender Parity and Quotas in European Politics},
Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {35},
Number = {2},
Pages = {286-300},
Abstract = {Since the 1995 Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, which
   clearly endorsed measures to ensure the equal participation of women in
   decision-making, many nations across the globe have adopted and
   implemented laws requiring political parties to nominate gender-balanced
   slates of candidates. This symposium brings together new research on the
   fairly recent gender quota and parity reforms in Portugal, France,
   Belgium, Italy, and Spain and the efforts of the European Union to
   promote them. In keeping with the single-case, comparative, and
   international gender quota literature, the articles stress the role of
   domestic and international actors/factors (political parties and elites,
   women's groups active inside and/or outside political parties, and
   international and European organizations) in the adoption of reforms as
   well as the reforms' specific provisions (placement rules and sanctions
   for non-compliance) and how well they fit in with the electoral system
   when assessing their impact. At the same time, the articles also offer
   intriguing insights related to the labelling of reforms as either
   `parity' or `quota' or both in different contexts, the involvement of
   different political parties in their adoption, and, finally, their
   qualitative upshots and, more specifically, their impact on citizens and
   elites' attitudes towards women in politics and measures to enhance it.},

Abstract = {The expectation that participation entails socialization effects on
   political attitudes is not routinely tested in a longitudinal manner. In
   this article, we report on a two-year panel study among 4325 late
   adolescents in Belgium. By means of a cross-lagged structural equation
   model, it was ascertained that the relationship between participation
   and attitudes is reciprocal. The relationship between participation (at
   Time1) and attitudes (at Time2) was significantly stronger than the
   relationship between attitudes (at Time1) and participation (at Time2).
   Therefore, the current study supports the socialization perspective.
   Individual and collective forms of participation have equally strong
   socialization effects.},

Journal = {CRITICAL STUDIES ON TERRORISM},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {5},

Pages = {499-513},
Abstract = {There is a growing body of evidence that terrorists/ terrorist groups
   have increased their use of the Internet to include a move into online
   social network environments in their efforts to radicalise and
   potentially recruit and mobilise new members. Both the US and UK
   governments acknowledge that not enough is known about this phenomenon
   and there is an urgent need for more substantive research in the area of
   terrorists' use of computer-mediated communication. However, research in
   this area carries with it some serious ethical and legal concerns that
   cannot and should not be ignored. UK law makes it difficult for
   terrorism studies researchers and other academics to conduct this online
   research without potentially violating the law. With careful
   consideration of the ethical concerns surrounding the methods of data
   collection, and knowledge of and adherence to Data Protection laws,
   along with notification of proposed research to the proper law
   enforcement office to insure compliance with the UK Terrorism Act, it is
   however possible to move forward with academic integrity and a
   reasonable assurance that one will not be charged and prosecuted for
   violations of the Terrorism Acts.},

Abstract = {Although two-vote mixed legislative systems have proliferated globally,
   the factors contributing to split-ticketing in these cases remains
   poorly understood. Using survey data regarding South Korea's 2008
   National Assembly election, this article addresses two questions: Is
   ticket-splitting in two-vote legislative systems influenced by the
   timing of one's vote decision and are late deciders more or less
   rational in their decision to ticket-split than early deciders?
   Empirical analysis finds that split-ticket voting under various
   specifications is more likely to be carried out by late deciders. Among
   split-ticket voters, however, late deciders are more likely to
   irrationally split their vote.},

   Dalton's hypothesis of cognitive mobilization explains partisan
   dealignment by voters' improved cognitive skills and extended
   information resources. Such an assumption of substitution however is
   contradicted by the fact that even after recent expansions of the media
   system exposure to political information is still positively associated
   with party attachment. There are also theoretical reasons for assuming,
   in accordance with the `classical' involvement hypothesis, that party
   identification motivates and guides voters' political information
   seeking. This is supported and specified by an analysis of survey data
   from the German federal election 2009 showing that strength of partisan
   attachment is a good predictor of voters' information seeking and
   political knowledge.},

Abstract = {The effectiveness of prerecorded phone calls was assessed in the context
   of a Texas Republican primary election that featured a contest for state
   Supreme Court. Automated calls endorsing one of the judicial candidates
   were recorded by the sitting Republican governor and directed at more
   than a quarter million people identified as likely voters and probable
   supporters of the governor. Two experimental designs were used to
   evaluate the calls' effectiveness. The first design randomly assigned
   households to treatment and control conditions in order to gauge the
   calls' effects on individuals' voter turnout, as measured by public
   records. The second design randomly assigned precincts to treatment and
   control conditions in order to assess whether the calls increased the
   precinct-level vote margin of the endorsed candidate. Results suggest
   that the automated calls had weak and statistically insignificant
   effects on turnout and vote margins.},

Abstract = {Despite aptly capturing the EU as a multi-principal model, the
   principal-agent literature has neglected the question of under what
   conditions a particular institution may become a principal. This article
   proposes a research framework that defines a principal not only through
   its involvement in the legal procedure establishing the agent, but also
   through its impact on the day-to-day work and institutional development
   of this agent. Using the case of the European Parliament and agency
   control in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice, it is argued that
   the Parliament has managed partially to compensate in the
   post-delegation phase for constrained ex ante legal involvement. The key
   conditions allowing the Parliament to enter the circle of principals
   have been altered default conditions through the introduction of
   co-decision in Justice and Home Affairs policy, and the strategic
   behaviour of the agent in the principals' competition for leadership and
   control.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the most salient features of the reshaping of the
   state-territory-nation triangle in Serbia over the last 20 years,
   through the lenses of citizenship regime. It looks at the ways in which
   the dominant political narrative in Serbia has imagined political
   community and accordingly managed its members. During the period of
   violent Yugoslav break-up and Milosevic's rule, the Serbian citizenship
   regime was surprisingly `civic', while post-2000 liberalisation has
   introduced ethnic elements which are likely to be further strengthened.
   This apparent contradiction can be explained by the specific goals of
   Serbian political elites to maintain control over population and
   territory in changing political circumstances. I will argue that the
   legacy of different attempts at defining the relation between the
   Serbian state and the Serb people, coupled with the wider context of
   Yugoslav conflicts and post-conflict developments in the region, led to
   an unconsolidated citizenship regime in Serbia with varying and
   contested conceptions about how to achieve congruence of state,
   territory and nation.},

Abstract = {Policy-makers who are confronted with the potential spread of violent
   extremist ideologies among prison inmates are challenged to design
   sustainable prison regimes which are suitable to counter prison
   radicalisation whilst rehabilitating and reintegrating inmates into
   society. This article outlines a theoretical framework that explains how
   uncertainty and pressure in the policy-making context heightens the need
   for structure that induces a shift towards intolerance and stereotypic
   black-and-white thinking, which leads to the introduction of unbalanced,
   one-sided prison regimes. We argue that in the long run, these prison
   regimes are likely to be self-undermining and unsustainable because they
   undermine long-term security objectives and cause undesired side
   effects. These propositions are illustrated by an in-depth case study of
   the Dutch terrorist detention policy.},

Abstract = {The preceding article by Best, Budge and McDonald acknowledges much of
   the substance of the alternative bilateralist interpretation of
   democratic governance I advocated and attempts to re-focus the median
   mandate approach towards a longer-term, and potentially more productive,
   understanding of the opinion-policy relationship. Both are welcome
   developments. Despite taking these steps, however, the authors choose to
   allow the fate of the median mandate thesis to rest ultimately on an
   attempt to re-establish the short-term one-to-one relationship that I
   challenged. In this brief note, I argue that this not only undercuts the
   more positive initiatives noted above, but also is based on a flawed
   understanding of how the short-term relationship should be
   operationalised and tested.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS IN LATIN AMERICA},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {4},
Number = {3},
Pages = {97-121},
Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to explain the contradictions in Michelle
   Bachelet's presidency by focusing on the paradoxical nature of
   presidential power, the limits on the executive in the Chilean
   constitution, and how those limits affected President Bachelet's
   government. At the outset of her presidency, she faced the problem of
   wanting to promote inclusive policies while simultaneously experiencing
   political pressure to maintain elite consensus. Due to institutional and
   political constraints, Bachelet's rhetoric of inclusion could not be
   realized, and she eventually decided to opt for the more traditional
   elite consensus approach. In our view, the emphasis on achieving elite
   consensus produced contradictory results. It sustained Bachelet's
   personal image as a national leader, but limited her ability to get
   effective legislation passed. Indeed, the Concertacion itself was blamed
   for inaction rather than the president as an individual.},

Journal = {CANADIAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {6},
Number = {2-3},
Pages = {267-279},
Abstract = {This article treats Manitoba as a case study in the community-level
   factors influencing the rate of voter turnout. Combining data from
   Elections Manitoba and the Manitoba Bureau of Statistics, it consists of
   an ecological analysis of electoral participation among the province's
   fifty-seven constituencies from 1999 to 2007. The study reveals that,
   while conventional variables like age and affluence play a role, the
   competitiveness of the constituency is by far the most important factor
   in determining a district's rate of voter turnout. This finding required
   analysts to shift their focus to ``competitiveness{''} as the dependent
   variable, which, in turn, revealed that the best predictor of a
   district's competitiveness was how close the race was in the previous
   election. The centrality of competitiveness to voter turnout in Manitoba
   raises important challenges for election officials and reform advocates,
   as it adds a dynamic, contextual variable that is difficult to
   manipulate.},

Abstract = {The article considered the importance of a truly and legally binding
   agreement in mostly commercial transactions in Nigeria that would
   ultimately translate into such that the law would enforce. It sought to
   revisit case laws and statutes on the various commercial transactions in
   Nigeria. In writing the article secondary data drawn from books, case
   laws, statutes, unpublished materials and the internet were relied upon.
   The articles position is that actions do not arise from a base cause. A
   contract tainted with illegality or contrary to public policy cannot be
   enforced by the law courts in Nigeria. The illegality may be borne out
   of sheer ignorance or mere mischief. The law here guides against the
   misuse or misapplication of the formation of the various steps or stages
   obviously involved in the formation of a truly binding contract which
   the law can enforce giving the peculiarity of the Nigerian terrain.},

Abstract = {Gay marriage bans have received widespread support in the past decade in
   states across America. The authors evaluate the extent to which context
   mitigates or exacerbates support for gay rights. Their question is
   grounded in the debate over whether exposure to out-groups creates
   acceptance through contact or whether exposure induces hostility through
   threat. Using data from twelve marriage ban elections, the authors find
   conditional support for the threat hypothesis. While the presence of a
   gay population is unimportant to the majority of the population,
   evangelical Christians who live proximate to larger gay populations are
   more likely to support bans on gay marriage.},

Abstract = {The study of the effects of institutions suffers from a potential
   endogeneity problem. This article proposes a strategy for addressing
   this problem by estimating the motivations for institutional choice
   directly. It identifies the motivations behind the wording of
   postindependence constitutions in Francophone sub-Saharan Africa. The
   author finds that constitutional wording in these countries has been
   motivated by the strength of ties with France. However, contrary to
   standard narratives, domestic political preferences also have been
   influential. By estimating the motivations for institutional choice
   directly, scholars are better placed to draw conclusions about the
   independent effect of institutions in this region.},

Abstract = {John Zaller's finding that members of the public usually follow elites'
   cues may seem normatively disturbing. If true, it might be taken to
   obviate the need for democracy or to show that elites are manipulating
   the public. However, as long as the public sometimes fails to follow
   elites, we can judge cases of public followership according to
   independent criteria, such as whether the public's occasional rebellions
   against elite opinion further liberal-democratic or utilitarian
   purposes. A review of some prominent cases of mass followership of and
   mass divergence from elite opinion suggests that public opinion that is
   independent of elite leadership is neither an unmitigated good nor an
   unmitigated problem for a well-ordered polity.},

Abstract = {In The Wartime President, which the University of Chicago Press will
   publish in 2013, we scrutinize the impacts of war on the president's
   ability to advance a policy agenda at home. Empirically, we provide
   evidence that during major wars of the last century, policy outcomes and
   congressional voting patterns more closely reflect presidential
   preferences over both foreign and domestic issues. Theoretically, we
   identify a particular mechanism through which wars have the potential to
   alter negotiations between Congress and the president-namely, by
   increasing the salience of national considerations, over which
   presidents have clear informational advantages, and diminishing the
   parochial considerations that inform deliberations within Congress. In
   this article, we summarize some of our main empirical findings, offer a
   nontechnical description of our formal theory, and suggest avenues for
   continued research on war and the American presidency.},

Title = {THE PSYCHOLOGICAL VERACITY OF ZALLER'S MODEL},
Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {24},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {545-567},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Zaller's model of public-opinion formation portrays the average citizen
   as an automaton who responds unthinkingly to elite cues. That is, once
   people have received information from political elites, they tend to
   abide by whatever their respective cue-givers dictate, since rejecting
   information is more cognitively costly than simply accepting it.
   Empirical research in psychology on priming supports this view of the
   citizen as a passive receiver of information. For example, people are
   likely to be unconsciously influenced by subtle cues and they tend to
   base their opinions on the accessibility of information in memory.
   However, some citizens, under certain conditions, may be active
   processors of information: actively interpreting it, elaborating on its
   implications, and negotiating its meaning. Whether or not Zaller's model
   is an accurate representation of the process of public-opinion formation
   depends substantially upon the inclusiveness of the researcher's views
   about what constitutes public opinion and how to study its determinants.},

Abstract = {Diamond and Morlino (2005) propose a quality of democracy framework that
   includes eight dimensions, but they restrict use of opinion data to
   measuring only one of these: `responsiveness'. However, we argue that
   citizen experiences and evaluations are essential pieces of data that
   may also enable us to capture valid `insider' measures of procedural and
   substantive dimensions that may be missed by expert judges and
   macro-level indicators. We develop indicators based on public attitude
   data for all eight dimensions of democracy. Substantively, this mass
   perspective on the Quality of Democracy gives us insight into what
   Africans themselves want out of democracy, and how they prioritise its
   various components. As we explore the places where citizen and expert
   evaluations diverge, we conclude that both individual and expert
   assessments of the quality of democracy deserve to be carefully
   interrogated. We cannot conclude that either experts or ordinary
   citizens provide the `true' or `correct' assessment, but rather that
   both perspectives are essential to fully understanding today's
   democratic experience, and the shape of the democratic future, on the
   continent.},

Journal = {PEACE ECONOMICS PEACE SCIENCE AND PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {18},
Number = {3},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Mozambique's post-conflict development has recently focused on the
   promise of biofuels production, and the Government of Mozambique has
   accordingly made hundreds of agricultural concessions to foreign and
   domestic corporations since 2006. In response, local groups have sought
   community land grants to protect livelihoods. We seek to understand
   whether the magnitude and recentness of violent events during
   Mozambique's 16-year civil war determined the success of communities'
   efforts to secure lands. We hypothesize that violence weakens the
   ability of communities to protect their traditional land uses from
   concessions by lobbying for community land grants. This hypothesis -
   dubbed the ``weak institutions hypothesis{''} - is contrasted with the
   idea that violence galvanizes political participation. We test the
   hypothesis using GIS-generated data at the district level on recognized
   community landholdings and civil war events. Controlling for factors
   such as market access, road distance to grain warehouses, and spatial
   auto-correlation, we find that more intense violence is possibly (but
   not significantly) associated with more land grants, and that districts
   experiencing more recent violence are actually more likely to lobby
   successfully for land grants - lending support to the idea that violence
   boosts community use of risk-pooling institutions.},

Abstract = {We analyze individual probabilistic predictions of state outcomes in the
   2008 U.S. presidential election. Employing an original survey of more
   than 19,000 respondents, we find that partisans gave higher
   probabilities to their favored candidates, but this bias was reduced by
   education, numerical sophistication, and the level of Obama support in
   their home states. In aggregate, we show that individual biases balance
   out, and the group's predictions were highly accurate, outperforming
   both Intrade (a prediction market) and fivethirtyeight.com (a poll-based
   forecast). The implication is that electoral forecasters can often do
   better asking individuals who they think will win rather than who they
   want to win.},

Abstract = {Despite the prospects for a new Cold War in Asia between the United
   States and China, the region might continue to witness strong tendencies
   towards multipolarity. India, which in the past marginalized itself from
   the security politics of East Asia, is acquiring a greater salience in
   the region, thanks to accelerated economic growth and expanding military
   capabilities. Delhi is likely to reflect the region's reluctance to be
   strait-jacketed by a bipolar framework between Washington and Beijing.
   India will seek simultaneous improvement in its relations with both
   Washington and Beijing, and might not accept calls for choosing between
   them. India recognizes the limits of security regionalism in Asia and
   could be interested in a sustained triangular dialogue with the United
   States and China in addressing regional and global problems.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to evaluate how infostructure has been reformed
   in the liberalisation process of network industries, which has involved
   third party access to the network through a comparison of the
   electricity, railway, and civil aviation sectors in Switzerland. Our
   theoretical argument posits that infostructure is a missing link in the
   study of the regulation of liberalised network industries. Infostructure
   is defined as the control and command services that are necessary for
   monitoring the access to and optimising the uses of infrastructure. Our
   empirical comparison of the sectors aims at answering the principle
   question: What is the impact of the management of infostructure on the
   liberalisation process and the structure of liberalising markets? This
   study of the liberalisation of network industries in Switzerland
   highlights the potential strategic function of infostructure in the
   context of opening to competition and internationalising markets.
   Infostructure management can impact infrastructure ownership and service
   operation in terms of market structure and constrain access to the
   infrastructure and the market. Infostructure could also weaken the
   capacity to regulate the entire sector from regulatory agencies,
   particularly when self-regulatory arrangements control third party
   access to the network.},

Abstract = {Despite much attention to the problematic consequences of
   authoritarianism, little research focuses on the causes of such
   unquestioning respect for ``proper{''} authority. Elaborating on the
   social learning approach to authoritarianism, this article argues that
   economic inequality within countries shapes individuals' feelings toward
   authority. As differences in condition increase, so does the relative
   power of the wealthy. As a result, regardless of their incomes,
   individuals' experiences are more likely to lead them to view
   hierarchical relations as natural and, in turn, to hold greater respect
   for authority. Multilevel models of authoritarianism in countries around
   the world over three decades support this relative power theory.},

Abstract = {The Democracy Barometer is one of the most recent approaches to
   measuring differences in the quality of democracy in established
   democracies in comparative perspective. Apart from positive aspects such
   as its attentive consideration of de jure and de facto indicators of
   democracy and its thorough documentation of the method and data, our
   critical examination of the approach reveals issues in terms of the
   conceptualization, operationalization and measurement as well as the
   aggregation of the data. First, the theoretically meaningful tension
   between the three basic democratic principles of liberty, equality and
   control fades in the course of the index construction. Second, the
   step-by-step development of the concept tree from its stem towards its
   leaves is not carried out in a consistent manner all the way through,
   leading to mismatches between the concept and its operationalization.
   Third, the applied scale and aggregation rule result in undesirable side
   effects. Finally, on close inspection, the attempts of the Democracy
   Barometer's authors to validate their approach is not entirely
   convincing.},

Abstract = {Can combat experience foster organizational skills that engender
   political collective action? We use the arbitrary assignment of troops
   to combat in World War II to identify the effect of combat experience on
   two channels that change local ethnic composition and future political
   control: ethnic cleansing and co-ethnic immigration. During the
   Partition of South Asia, we find that ethnically mixed districts whose
   veterans were exposed to greater combat exhibited greater co-ethnic
   immigration and minority ethnic cleansing, with minority out-migration
   achieved with lower loss-of-life. Further, where ethnic groups had been
   in complementary economic roles or the minority received greater combat
   experience, there was less ethnic cleansing. We interpret these results
   as reflecting the strategic role of ethnic cleansing and co-ethnic
   immigration by groups seeking political control and the role of combat
   experience in enhancing organizational skills at credibly threatening
   violence and engaging in collective action.},

Abstract = {At the next general election the percentage of women elected to the
   smaller House of Commons risks being lower than in the current
   parliament, where they constitute 22 percent of all MPs. The 200810
   Speaker's Conference identified many of the barriers faced by women and
   other under-represented groups and made a series of recommendations,
   only some of which have been introduced. The Government favours a
   voluntary approach to Recommendation 24, which calls for diversity data
   monitoring, whilst Recommendation 25 which calls for serious
   consideration of legislative quotas in the absence of a significant
   increase in the numbers of women in 2010, appears forgotten. A second
   Speaker's Conference should therefore be established; the issue of
   women's under-representation should be taken up above the party
   levelwith legislative quotas introduced to address the system level
   failure of democratic representation at Westminster.},

   the modernist ideology that society unites the opposed spheres of a

   commonly troped through gender (men compete and women care), generating
   an obvious heteronormativity, but the heteronorm goes deeper, into the
   very ways output and population become intelligible. This has
   implications even for radical social and theoretical interventions that
   conceive ``economy'' as a separate opposed sphere.},

Abstract = {We explicate the precise role that one specific emotion, disgust, plays
   in generating political acrimony. We do this by identifying the link
   between the different dimensions along which moral judgments are made by
   those espousing different political ideologies and the different
   emotions which undergird these evaluations. These assessments reliably
   track along liberal and conservative dimensions and are linked to the
   way values associated with purity and sanctity elicit greater degrees of
   disgust among conservatives. Here, we review a growing literature
   showing how disgust affects the psychology of politics through its
   influence on the cognitive and emotional processes that govern judgments
   of morality, as well as its direct impact on specific policy
   preferences. We then apply these findings to the nature and tenor of
   political discourse and suggest some ways that disgust might affect the
   character and function of democratic debate and tolerance. Finally, we
   discuss what these findings mean for public policy.},

Abstract = {Using 2003 Asian Barometer Survey study data, this paper examines the
   economic voting model in the 2002 presidential election in South Korea.
   The core emphasis of the paper is on an investigation of the relative
   effects of different dimensions/scopes of economic evaluations on voting
   behavior, namely whether one form of assessment (e.g., pocketbook vs.
   sociotropic) can have similar consequences for electoral participation
   as others. The findings indicate that the overall economy is salient for
   Koreans to shape their political choices. In other words, voting
   behavior in Korea depends on how she or he thinks the national economy
   has been for the past five years. Also found is that voters' perceptions
   of their own personal financial situations did not matter much as a
   predictor of voter choice.},

Abstract = {Backed by studies finding only limited propensity for free-riding when
   communities have an interest in self-provision, the last few decades
   have seen a surge of interest in community-based development. A major
   caveat to the ``second wave{''} of collective action studies, however,
   is that collective action often breaks down under hierarchical social
   relationships. This is unfortunate news for developing countries' rural
   societies, which are often entrenched in patron-client networks. Using a
   natural experiment found in the construction of a motorway, the article
   finds that clientelist relationships do not, in and by themselves, block
   peasant collective action. Rather, it is the interaction between
   clientelism and isolation that empowers patrons to block community-based
   projects. Peasants in connected villages face no such constraints, but
   instead rely on their patrons' assistance in collective projects, making
   the hierarchical network an additional resource.},

Abstract = {Post- transitional justice in Latin America started in the Southern Cone
   in the mid- 1990s and gradually spread to a number of countries which
   are seeking to address the human rights violations committed during the
   authoritarian regimes that dominated the continent from 1970s to the
   early 1990s. to distinguish trials at the time of transition from trials
   that take place years into the consolidation phase, this article
   develops a theoretical framework that explains variations in the
   propensity to prosecute the military for gross human rights violations
   (i.e., the number of trials) across time and across countries. the main
   argument presented here is that constitutional reforms have made Latin
   American judges more prone to prosecute the military for past human
   right violations because judges now enjoy more independence from
   powerful Executives and the hierarchy of the judicial system has
   loosened, making lower court judges less dependent on their superiors.
   As a result, judges, especially those sympathetic to a human rights
   agenda, can push prosecutions more forcefully than they could before.},

Abstract = {It is well established that all interactions are symmetric: when the
   effect of X on Y is conditional on the value of Z, the effect of Z must
   be conditional on the value of X. Yet the typical practice when testing
   an interactive theory is to (1) view one variable, Z, as the
   conditioning variable, (2) offer a hypothesis about how the marginal
   effect of the other variable, X, is conditional on the value of Z, and
   (3) construct a marginal effect plot for X to test the theory. We show
   that the failure to make additional predictions about how the effect of
   Z varies with the value of X, and to evaluate them with a second
   marginal effect plot, means that scholars often ignore evidence that can
   be extremely valuable for testing their theory. As a result, they either
   understate or, more worryingly, overstate the support for their
   theories.},
