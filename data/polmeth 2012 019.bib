Abstract = {Research on interest groups indicates that elected representatives
   respond positively to the informational content of a lobby campaign; but
   scholars also acknowledge that this claim is hard to evaluate because of
   the methodological challenges of establishing whether influence occurred
   or not. To test for the impact of informational lobbying, we deploy an
   experimental design, recruiting citizen interest groups in eight local
   authority areas to campaign on a matter of importance to them. These
   groups sent either information-rich or information-poor lobbying letters
   to 248 randomly selected local councillors in their areas, and we
   monitored the responses. Descriptive statistics and regressions with
   clustered standard errors show that the informational content of the
   letter does not make a difference to the response overall. But the
   information-rich treatment affected the quality of the response,
   encouraging councillors to pass on the letter to another expert or
   professional. Our findings indicate that elected representatives in
   English local government use a cue from an informational lobby to defer
   to other professional elites rather than to engage with the lobbyist's
   request. These findings have implications for the study of lobbying
   influence in other jurisdictions.},

Abstract = {Given the reticence of states about cultural rights, this essay explores
   how the independent UN human rights monitoring bodies filled the gap.
   Cultural rights made the human rights system burst at the seams, and
   these bodies picked up the bold demand that culture poses for human
   rights. Through their practice, they crafted an understanding of the
   normative content of cultural rights and thus helped overcome the
   seemingly insurmountable political difficulties of states. Through an
   international law perspective, the essay unravels this practice and
   presents a critical analysis of the new developments in this area.},

Journal = {POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {60},
Number = {3},
Pages = {703-719},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In this article I explore Montesquieu's discussion of republics and the
   constitution of England in order to question the extent to which he
   should be accorded a central place in a tradition of modern
   republicanism. This involves challenging Paul Rahe's recent thesis that
   Montesquieu thought both that monarchy was not at all suited to
   modernity and that England was a republic all along. By stressing the
   importance of honour and ambition I argue that the liberty that
   Montesquieu thought exemplified in the English constitution was, in
   large part, secured by its monarchical principle. Moreover, by eschewing
   the relevance of political virtue for modern commercial societies,
   Montesquieu set his own proposals out in opposition to the prevalent
   French republican discourse of his time; thus it is highly problematic
   to view him as having proposed a republic for the moderns. The article
   also serves to disentangle Montesquieu's understanding of political
   liberty from his analysis of republics in order to refute the idea that
   he provides support for a distinctively republican conception of liberty
   as non-domination. This undermines the republican critique of liberalism
   set forth by Philip Pettit, which is further challenged by considering
   the affinities between Montesquieu's and Constant's conceptions of
   liberty. Many commentators have argued that Montesquieu repudiated
   classical republicanism, yet on the reading advanced in this article it
   is equally problematic to view him as a modern republican.},

Abstract = {FORTIFYING CITIZENSHIP POLICY STRATEGIES FOR CIVIC INTEGRATION IN
   WESTERN EUROPE By SARA WALLACE GOODMAN
   Why have European states introduced mandatory integration requirements
   for citizenship and permanent residence? There are many studies
   comparing integration policy and examining the significance of what has
   been interpreted as a convergent and restrictive ``civic turn,{''} a
   ``retreat from multiculturalism,{''} and an ``inevitable lightening of
   citizenship.{''} None of these studies, however, has puzzled over the
   empirical diversity of integration policy design or presented
   systematic, comparative explanations for policy variation. This article
   is the first to develop an argument for what, in fact, amounts to a
   wealth of variation in civic integration policy (including scope,
   sequencing, and difficulty). Using a historical institutionalist
   approach, the author argues that states use mandatory integration to
   address different membership problems, which are shaped by both existing
   citizenship policy (whether it is inclusive or exclusive) and political
   pressure to change it (in other words, the politics of citizenship). She
   illustrates this argument by focusing on three case studies, applying
   the argument to a case of unchallenged restrictive retrenchment and
   continuity (Denmark), to a case of negotiated and thus moderated
   restriction (Germany), and to a case that recently exhibited both
   liberal continuity (the United Kingdom, 2001-6) and failed attempts at
   new restriction (the United Kingdom, 2006-10). These cases show that
   although states may converge around similar mandatory integration
   instruments, they may apply them for distinctly different reasons. As a
   result, new requirements augment rather than alter the major contours of
   national citizenship policy and the membership association it maintains.},

Abstract = {PARTY SYSTEMS AND GOVERNMENT STABILITY IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE By
   FLORIAN GROTZ and TILL WEBER
   After two decades of parliamentary democracy, the countries of Central
   and Eastern Europe (CEE) have quite different records of government
   stability. At the same time there continues to be turbulent fluctuation
   within the individual countries. To explain this variation, the authors
   draw on characteristics of parties and party systems for 138 governments
   in 12 CEE countries. The analysis is structured by two distinct logics
   that underlie the effect of party-related attributes on government
   survival: the logic of internal friction within the government and the
   logic of external pressure from the opposition. The authors argue that
   in the ``difficult{''} contexts of postcommunist party systems, these
   two logics do not operate independently of each other. Instead, they
   suggest that standard theory needs to be revised to account for the
   interactions of government and opposition characteristics. Their model
   of these interactions not only includes standard numeric and ideological
   variables but also integrates specificities of the postcommunist
   context: the regime divide and the low degree of party-system
   consolidation. Quantitative and qualitative findings demonstrate that
   government stability in CEE is interactively determined by whole
   constellations of party attributes.},

Abstract = {Numerical indices and peer review processes, which are used increasingly
   to assess and rank countries, are relatively novel governance
   instruments. They have serious practical consequences and pose
   conceptual challenges for conventional international relations theories.
   This article draws on concepts from actor-network theory (ANT) to
   analyse the differences between these two mechanisms, their relationship
   to networks, their differing materialities, and how they succeed or
   fail. These concepts include actants, translation, enrolment,
   black-boxing, obligatory passage points, and immutable or mutable
   mobiles, which together provide useful insights into the way in which
   humans and objects work together in transnational networks to produce,
   alter, or resist power. The article argues that ANT can address some
   problems associated with the concept of governmentality, while
   complementing its strengths. Numerical indices and peer review processes
   engage with humans, objects, and networks in different ways and this can
   alter how larger global forces are or are not transmitted, modified, or
   resisted. The article explores the empirical relevance of these concepts
   by examining the World Governance Indicators and the African Peer Review

Abstract = {E-Government is considered a relevant issue on political agendas that
   seek to transform and modernize public administration. This recent
   interest in e-Government has been reflected in the large amount of
   research studies and projects reported in diverse academic disciplines
   and journals, with various methodologies used by researchers.
   However, the vast majority of research has focused on developed
   countries, neglecting the analysis and evaluation of the development of
   e-Government in emerging economies. This article provides a starting
   point that can help public administrators and researchers to evaluate
   this research field, identifying the research topics, research
   methodologies used in the studies published in international journals,
   universities that published major contributions, as well as future
   research opportunities.
   For this purpose, we carried out a bibliometric study that analyzes
   international journals with higher impact (Journal Citation Reports)
   contained in the fields of Information Science and Library Science, and
   Public Administration. This review process included the analysis of the
   articles in 44 journals published between January 2000 and September
   2010. This analysis aims to highlight potential opportunities for
   e-Government research on emerging economies, making a comparison with
   research conducted on developed countries, allowing us to indicate the
   way forward in advancing the implementation of e-Government, as believe
   that a thorough analysis of the past will enable us to prepare for the
   future.
   In this regard, studies on emerging economies emphasize the use of
   research methodologies in very early stage, mainly focused on
   determining the current state of the experiences and initiatives of
   e-Government, awareness of the role of new technologies to encourage
   citizen participation and improving the quality and accessibility of
   public services.
   The research should help public managers and policy makers in the plans
   for implementation of e-Government, making them understand that
   environmental factors influence the innovation of public
   administrations. To this end; policies should be analyzed making
   processes of e-Government in a complex political environment, getting to
   strengthen the connection between e-Government and the traditional
   concerns of public administration.},

Title = {The new politics of Zimbabwe's lowveld: Struggles over land at the
   margins},
Journal = {AFRICAN AFFAIRS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {111},
Number = {445},
Pages = {527-550},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This article explores the contests over land and resources in the
   lowveld of Zimbabwe, focusing on three case studies - Nuanetsi ranch,
   the Save Valley and Chiredzi River conservancies, and Gonarezhou
   National Park. Each case examines who gained and who lost out over time,
   from entrepreneurial investors to well-connected politicians and
   military figures, to white ranchers and large numbers of farmers who
   have occupied land since 2000. We identify a dynamic of elite
   accumulation and control over resources that has been resisted by
   alliances of land invaders, war veterans, and local political and
   traditional leaders. By documenting this struggle over time, the article
   demonstrates that, in these marginal areas outside the formal
   `fast-track' land reform programme, local communities retain the
   capacity to resist state power and imagine alternative social, economic,
   and political trajectories - even if these are opposed by those at the
   centre. While much discussion of recent Zimbabwean politics has
   appropriately highlighted the centralized, sometimes violent, nature of
   state power, this is exerted in different ways in different places. A
   combination of local divisions within political parties, bureaucratic
   discretion within implementing agencies, and local contests over land
   create a very particular, local politics, especially at the geographic
   margins of the nation. As this article shows, this offers opportunities
   for a variety of expressions of local agency and resistance, which
   temper the impositions of centralized state power.},

   suggests that ethnic diversity and income heterogeneity have a negative
   impact on social trust, I argue that cross-national variations in social
   trust are better explained by fairness: fair procedural rules
   (democracy), fair administration of rules (freedom from corruption), and
   fair income distribution (relatively equal but also unskewed). This
   expectation is confirmed by a multilevel analysis of data from the World
   Values Surveys and European Values Study covering 170,000 individuals in
   80 countries.},

Volume = {3},

Abstract = {When surveying policy documents on global health one is often struck by
   a general lack of theorizing about why we have moral duties to promote
   equitable global health initiatives and in regards to what prioritized
   values should represent the satisfaction of these moral duties. Although
   there is general agreement that current inequalities in global health
   provision exist, and agreement that some form of response is necessary,
   there is little consensus about what should be done to rectify this
   situation. The purpose of this article is to explore four normative
   arguments about why we might have global health responsibilities and to
   examine their relationship with distributive principles for the
   alleviation of global health inequalities. Through this examination it
   will be argued that current theorizing about global health rests on
   opposing ontological perspectives about what global health should
   prioritize and that these presuppositions result in distinctively
   antagonistic normative demands about how we should distribute, who gets
   what and why.},

Abstract = {All the authors in this collection of essays on Ukrainian politics
   stress the lack of improvement in the political situation in recent
   years. The authors identify a range of reasons including pre-Soviet
   history, the Soviet legacy, national identity, and political gridlock.
   While the authors disagree slightly on the extent to which change is
   impossible or merely difficulty, none is hopeful. The challenge for
   scholars is to avoid moving from objective analysis to assigning
   political blame. Some authors identify specific political actors on whom
   they fix blame, while others focus on less personal structural factors.
   The relative weight of structure-based and agent-based explanations is
   important in assessing the prospects for change in the future, and the
   possible paths to it. (C) 2012 The Regents of the University of

Title = {Measuring the impacts of truth and reconciliation commissions: Placing
   the global `success' of TRCs in local perspective},
Journal = {COOPERATION AND CONFLICT},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {47},
Number = {3},
Pages = {386-403},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Truth and reconciliation commissions (TRCs) have emerged as an
   international norm and are assumed to be an essential element of
   national reconciliation, democratization, and post-conflict development.
   Despite the increase in the number of TRCs being initiated around the
   globe and the international consensus regarding their positive effects,
   there is little understanding of the long-term effects and consequences
   of TRCs. Specifically, currently there are no established methods or
   mechanisms for measuring the impacts of TRCs; furthermore, the few
   examples of efforts to measure these impacts have serious limitations.
   This article explores both the rise in TRCs as an international norm and
   the contradictions and inadequacies in existing efforts to measure the
   impacts and successes of commissions. Through this examination, we aim
   to demonstrate the need for more critical, interactive, and inclusive
   mechanisms of assessment for understanding the effects of TRCs. The
   objective is neither to promote nor to criticize a specific TRC or TRCs
   in general; however, this article emphasizes the need to think
   rigorously about how we assess the effects of TRCs and offers insights
   into the value of more comprehensive mechanisms for assessing the
   impacts and local perceptions of commissions.},

   democratization?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {49},
Number = {5},
Pages = {671-684},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This article analyzes the relationship between truth and politics by
   asking whether the `publicness' of a truth commission - defined by
   whether it has public hearings, releases a public report, and names
   perpetrators - contributes to democratization. The article reviews
   scholarship relevant to the potential democratizing effects of truth
   commissions and derives mechanisms that help explain this relationship.
   Work from the transitional justice field as well as democratization and
   political transition more generally is considered. Using a
   newly-constructed Truth Commission Publicness Dataset (TCPD), the
   analysis finds that even after statistically controlling for initial
   levels of democracy, democratic trends in the years prior to a
   commission, level of wealth, amnesties and/or trials, the influence of
   the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and different
   cutoff points for measuring democratization across a number of models,
   more publicness predicts higher levels of democracy years after the
   commission has finished its work. The more public a truth commission is,
   the more it will contribute to democratization. The finding that more
   public truth commissions are associated with higher levels of
   democratization indicates particular strategies that policymakers,
   donors, and civil society activists may take to improve prospects for
   democracy in a country planning a truth commission in the wake of
   violence and/or government abuse.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to explain the characteristics and internal mechanisms
   of protest activity and solidarity among Russia's industrial workers
   over the past two decades. Both academic discussions and officials'
   attitudes toward protests prove contradictory. Even in periods of
   increase, labor activism has remained limited. Yet authorities continue
   to show concern about real and potential discontent, while academics
   puzzle over the dominance of quiescence as well as the reasons for
   sporadic activism. The research presented in this article advances our
   understanding of both: the limits of protest, and the causes, forms and
   goals of Russian labor's periodic collective activism. We rely on a
   combination of available statistical and recent survey data to try to
   resolve the paradoxes of labor's quiescence and conflict, as well as
   elites' neglect and concern.
   The research finds changes in patterns of labor activism over the two
   decades. During the 1990s, most strikes were limited, defensive,
   managed, or desperate in character. In Russia's recovered economy, from
   2006 a qualitatively different, ``classical{''} pattern of strikes and
   labor relations emerged. Workers' collective actions mainly affected
   large, profitable industrial and transnational enterprises and took the
   form of ``normalized{''} bargaining and conflict between labor and
   management. With the 2008-09 recession workers returned to the defensive
   strategies of the 1990s, protesting wage cuts and factory closures.
   Survey research from 2010 shows workers to be almost evenly divided
   between groups with positive and negative attitudes toward solidarity
   and bargaining. (C) 2012 The Regents of the University of California.

Abstract = {Recent theory-building on the substantive representation of women (SRW)
   in parliamentary settings contends that in addition to traditional
   concerns about achieving a critical mass of women, scholars need to
   question who the critical actors are. Analysis of a range of
   deliberative functions of the Scottish Parliament supports the critical
   actor thesisyet, while female critical actors have disproportionate
   policy-making influence, the present study adds to contemporary
   understanding by highlighting that it is how critical actors interact
   with critical mass that plays a key role in the SRW. Thus future work
   needs to be cognisant of a range of factors shaping critical
   mass/critical actor interaction, including: institutional mechanisms,
   type of parliamentary proceeding, party allegiance and whether women
   representatives belong to the party forming the executive.},

Title = {Policy formulation, governance shifts and policy influence: location and

Abstract = {Most studies of policy formulation focus on the nature and kind of
   advice provided to decision-makers and think of this as originating from
   a system of interacting elements: a ``policy advisory system{''}. Policy
   influence in such models has historically been viewed as based on
   considerations of the proximate location of policy advisors vis a vis
   the government, linked to related factors such as the extent to which
   governments are able to control sources of advice. While not explicitly
   stated, this approach typically presents the content of policy advice as
   either partisan ``political{''} or administratively ``technical{''} in
   nature. This article assesses the merits of these locational models
   against evidence of shifts in governance arrangements that have blurred
   both the inside vs outside and technical vs political dimensions of
   policy formulation environments. It argues that the growing plurality of
   advisory sources and the polycentrism associated with these governance
   shifts challenge the utility of both the implied content and locational
   dimensions of traditional models of policy advice systems. A revised
   approach is advanced that sees influence more as a product of content
   than location. The article concludes by raising several hypotheses for
   future research linking advisory system behaviour to governance
   arrangements.},

Abstract = {Three studies were conducted to explore the relationship between social
   dominance orientation (SDO) and John Henryism (JH). Each study was
   framed using an intersectionality perspective which predicted that
   specific combinations of social identities would impact endorsement of
   SDO and JH in unique ways. We hypothesized that upper-class non-Whites
   would be higher in SDO and lower in JH than any other class/race
   identity combination. As predicted, a Class x Race interaction emerged
   for both SDO and JH in Study 1 (N = 387), with upper-class non-Whites
   displaying the highest levels of SDO and the lowest levels of JH. Study
   2 (N = 340) replicated these findings and also explored the impact of
   context-level class on SDO and JH. Using a qualitative method, in Study
   3 (N = 23) we found that upper-class non-Whites described their social
   class positions in ways highly consistent with SDO, whereas
   middle/working-class non-Whites described their experiences in ways
   consistent with JH.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes Amnesty International's initial struggle to
   establish an American section. Amid the growing attention to Amnesty
   International in the scholarly literature, limited work exists on its
   national sections, including AIUSA, the American section. Understanding
   transatlantic disagreements about the efficacy of individual letter
   writing, funding, and the selection of prisoners of conscience
   illuminates the transferability of the Amnesty International model to
   the United States, the character of American human rights activism, and
   transatlantic relations among Amnesty's nongovernmental actors.
   Furthermore, the strained relationship between Amnesty International and
   AIUSA reveals different conceptions of nongovernmental activism in the
   1960s.},

Abstract = {This article asks what it means to take celebrity politics seriously. It
   does so from three perspectives. It begins by looking at the case of New
   Labour and the role that celebrity politics played in party political
   communication and in government policy-making. It places both in the
   context of New Labour's cultural policy more broadly. This leads to a
   second perspective, in which the focus is upon how celebrity politics
   might be seen within social and political change more generally. A
   contrast is drawn between the late modernity approach adopted by David
   Marsh and his colleagues, and the media-oriented approach adopted by
   Aeron Davis. Both approaches, it is suggested, invite a turn to
   empirical investigation, and the article's final section reviews
   existing research into celebrity politics, and argues for more emphasis
   on (a) cross-national comparison of forms of celebrity politics, and (b)
   audience perceptions of celebrity politicians, going beyond the current
   focus on large-scale surveys and experimentation.},

Abstract = {Two decades after the transition to a civilian-elected regime, Chilean
   labor remains unable to stem its downward spiral. Declining unionization
   rates, shrinking average size of unions, wage increases below
   productivity gains, increased female labor force participation in
   low-wage and low-status jobs, and a dwindling number of workers
   participating in collective bargaining all attest to the paltry benefits
   obtained so far by workers and trade unionists from Chile's acclaimed
   negotiated transition to democracy. The triumph of the right-wing
   billionaire Sebastian Pinera in the January 2010 presidential elections
   heralds a renewed capitalist offensive against the working class in that
   the government promises to attack weak economic growth rates and
   declining labor productivity with increased labor flexibility, further
   privatization, and the dissemination of a ``culture of
   entrepreneurship{''} among Chile's poor. To overcome its crisis, Chilean
   labor must enact a paradigm shift involving at the very least the
   incorporation of a gendered perspective. This would allow labor leaders
   to recognize that women's paid and unpaid labor has become central to
   the continued expansion of the current regime of capitalist accumulation
   and that this reality must be placed at the core of more effective
   organizing strategies.},

Abstract = {This article asks how ordinary people in Germany perceive and legitimize
   economic disparities in an era of rising income inequality. Based on
   in-depth qualitative interviews with respondents from higher and lower
   social classes, the paper reconstructs the omoral economy' that
   underlies popular views of inequality. While respondents agree with
   abstract inegalitarian principlesi.e. income differentiation based on
   meritthey are concerned with specific instances of inequality,
   especially poverty and wealth. These are criticized because they are
   seen to imply intolerable deviations, both upwards and downwards, from a
   way of living presumed as universal, thereby fostering a segregation of
   life-worlds and social disintegration. Thus, perceptions of injustice do
   not seem to be based on the existence of income inequality as such, but
   rather on the view that economic disparities threaten the social bond.},

Abstract = {This article argues against Anna Stilz's recent attempt to solve the
   problem of citizens' collective responsibility in democratic states. I
   show that her solution could only apply to state actions that are (in
   legal terminology) unjustified but excusable. Stilz's marquee case the
   2003 invasion of Iraq does not, I will argue, fit this bill; nor, in all
   likelihood, does any other case in recorded history. Thus, this article
   concludes, we may allow that Stilz's argument offers a theoretically
   cogent case for citizens' task-responsibility in democratic states
   (given the right conditions); it just so happens that few if any cases
   satisfy these conditions.},

Abstract = {In Scotland, the formation of a minority government in 2007 by the
   Scottish National Party (SNP) provided the potential for profound
   changes in intergovernmental relations. This followed eight years of a
   Scottish Labour-led coalition government characterised by a low-key and
   informal relationship with the UK Labour government. From 1999 to 2007,
   discussions were conducted informally and almost entirely through
   political parties and executives (ministers and civil servants).
   Although formal mechanisms for negotiation and dispute resolution
   existedincluding the courts, concordats and Joint Ministerial
   Committeesthey were used rarely. The Scottish Executive also played a
   minimal role in EU policy-making. Yet, an explosive new era of relations
   between the Scottish and UK governments did not arrive in tandem with
   the new era of party incongruence. The aim of this article is to explore
   these issues by asking two main questions: why were formal mechanisms
   used so rarely from 1999 to 2007, and what factors produced muted rather
   than problematic IGR in the third parliamentary session, between 2007
   and 2011?},

Abstract = {From the beginning of the 1990s up until 2007, leading retailers
   experienced a slowdown of their growth in domestic markets and yet
   generated an opposite upward trend in return on equity (ROE). This
   apparent paradox is examined through an analysis of the 10 main
   retailers accounts. Focusing on the links between financialization and
   globalization processes, this article examines a variety of
   complementary ways of making profits implemented within the industry to
   satisfy impatient shareholders: foreign expansion, financialization of
   assets, deterioration of suppliers and workers positions and the use of
   working capital management to transform market power into financial
   gains.},

Abstract = {This article examines and critiques the engagement of liberal
   international law with liberal internationalism in international
   relations (IR), demonstrating that the results are not to the credit of
   either discipline. In particular, two key assumptions of the legal
   liberal international order are flawed. First, the attempt to establish
   a two-tiered international liberal order based on law and democracy
   results in intervention (both forceful and performative) that
   counterproductively embroils liberal states, generating resentment and
   counter-democratic movements. Second, the assumption that security in a
   globalising world can only be created by the total globalisation of the
   liberal order and the removal of `outlaw' states creates a new version
   of the security dilemma in which the actions taken to secure the liberal
   world order create the very conditions of its insecurity. The article
   concludes with recommendations for a critical post-structuralist
   engagement with a postliberal politics of virtu that paradoxically
   allows for the liberal identity to be better secured in its
   international relations with the other. Journal of International

Abstract = {This article examines the impact of the proliferation of nongovernmental
   organizations (NGOs) on governance in Kenya. Looking specifically at
   service provision, it analyzes how the growth of NGOs has begun to
   change the way decisions are made and policy is formulated. In so doing,
   the article explores shifting NGOgovernment relations over time. The
   governance of service provision has become a complex, intertwined affair
   in which NGOs sit on national policymaking committees, government
   integrates NGO plans and budgets into national policy, and government
   actors learn from and copy NGOs' participatory, accountable approach.
   Through (1) the integration of former NGO leaders in government, (2)
   increasing the variety of voices heard in government decision making,
   (3) lobbying by NGOs, and (4) mimicry of NGOs by government, governance
   of Kenyan service provision has begun to become more democratic. Through
   such changes, developing countries are witnessing a blurring of the line
   between public and private.},

Abstract = {Gender is now recognized as an important dividing line in American
   political life, and scholars have accumulated evidence that national
   security issues are an important reason for gender differences in policy
   preferences. We therefore expect that the dynamics of support for
   defense spending among men and women will differ. In contrast, several
   scholars have shown that population subgroups exhibit a ``parallel{''}
   dynamic in which the evolution of their preferences over time is very
   similar, despite differences in the average level of support.
   Unfortunately, there is little time series evidence on gendered
   reactions to policy, including defense spending, that would allow one to
   arbitrate between these competing perspectives. In this research note,
   we assemble a time series of support for defense spending among men and
   women and model the determinants of that support for the period
   1967-2007. We find that women are on average less supportive of defense
   spending than are men. However, we also find that the over time
   variation of support for defense spending among men and women is very
   similar-each is conditioned principally by the past year's change in
   defense spending and occasionally by war casualties and a trade-off
   between defense and civilian spending.},

Abstract = {This article argues that neo-Gramscian theorizations of ``hegemony{''}
   have failed to illuminate the role of nineteenth-century Britain in the
   rise of a liberal world economy in three respects. First, they have
   provided mutually exclusive accounts of the social forces underpinning
   domestic and international hegemony. Second, they have failed to show
   Britain's agency in the making of a liberal world order. Third, they
   have posited a uniformity of social forces and liberal state forms that
   elides the differences between British and continental societies,
   thereby obscuring the real reasons for the general shift to liberal
   internationalism. We argue that it was the structural differences in the
   economic, social, and political organization of Britain and continental
   Europe that made free trade without a hegemon possible. Neo-Gramscian
   theorists of hegemony-just like their mainstream peers-have unduly
   generalized from the unique structures of American hegemony after 1945.
   Instead of serving as a master concept to organize the history of
   international relations, hegemony itself needs to be historicized: as a
   singular and temporally limited possibility of societal and
   international rule, preceded and succeeded by other forms.},

Abstract = {In the 1990s the Cuban government instituted a ``dual economy,{''}
   creating a dollar economy parallel to the peso economy as part of the
   reform package designed to address economic crisis. Expansion of the
   tourism sector as a dollar industry was central to efforts to raise
   revenue, as Cuba began limited and regulated interaction with the global
   capitalist economy. In an effort to quarantine Cubans from capitalist
   inequities, citizens were prohibited from accessing tourist facilities
   other than as workers. Some have referred to this as ``tourist
   apartheid.{''} This study finds that ``apartheid{''} is not an accurate
   classification of the system in Cuba; rather, the policy is comparable
   to an economic ``firewall{''} designed to allow regulated engagement
   with the international capitalist community, while preventing ingress of
   capitalism domestically. (C) 2012 The Regents of the University of

Title = {``Apolitical{''} Democracy: the Ideals of Citizenship and the
   Contradictions of Public Opinion in the Netherlands},
Journal = {REVISTA DEL CLAD REFORMA Y DEMOCRACIA},
Year = {2012},
Number = {52},
Pages = {105+},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The relationship between citizens and political institutions in
   democratic systems all over the world seems to be experiencing a time of
   uncertainty: falling numbers of voters, an increase in populist
   discourses and parties, rising public protest demanding reforms of
   political systems and the new manifestations of organisations from civil
   society being set up to protect and fight for specific rights.
   Establishing the meaning of citizenship has occupied a great deal of
   space and effort among theorists who have defined the ideal character
   linked to the model of a good citizen, which is useful and valid for
   improving relations between society and the State. However, it is less
   common to find viewpoints approaching the issue of the meaning of
   citizenship by directly asking citizens themselves. This article deals
   with interpretations linked to the notion of citizenship and democracy,
   based on an empirical analysis, with a research developed largely in the
   Netherlands, examining data on Dutch citizens' ideals. The data is
   presented with the aim of seeking uncertainties and evidences that could
   help for understanding what appears to be a greater distancing between
   society and the State.
   With the aim of achieving this objective, this article first presents a
   brief analysis of the ideals associated with the notion of good
   citizenship in the literature. Secondly, it introduces some previous
   cross-national research with closed-ended questions to get grip on the
   meanings of good citizenship of ordinary citizens in different contexts.
   Thirdly, having introduced these two issues, an approach is made to the
   interpretation of the ``good citizen{''} according to open questions to
   Dutch citizens in surveys carried out by the Netherlands Institute for
   Social Research (SCP), where one of the authors of this article carries
   out research work. Later, in a new point, interest is focused on a study
   of the attitudes and expectations of Dutch citizens with regard to
   democratic politics, data also collected via the SCP.
   Analysis of this data will show that, although Dutch citizens show clear
   acceptance of the democratic system as the best political system, they
   do not consider politics as something that is relevant. Moreover, they
   even consider it as rather tiresome and annoying. Citizens adopt a
   negative attitude towards politics and a high level of mistrust towards
   their political representatives. These results lead us to introduce some
   proposals on possible policies in the final part of the paper. These
   suggestions are not intended to be more than brief notes focusing on
   three key aspects: the incorporation of the principle of transparency,
   the introduction of mechanisms for direct participation by citizens and
   the recognition of the potential of civil society. They are proposals
   aimed at reducing the distancing between society and the State, believed
   to be useful for the Netherlands as well as for other possible contexts
   affected by similar symptoms.},

Abstract = {This article explores the question: What was Israel's military strategy
   when it went to war against Hizballah and Lebanon in 2006? It argues
   that Israel's decision to go to war was not based on a thorough in-depth
   analysis of the specific situation at hand, but rather rooted in its
   strategic outlook cultivated in the decades preceding the war. This
   thinking has largely focused on the concept of deterrence, and should
   deterrence fail, to restore deterrence and ensure that the opponent
   would refrain from similar actions in the future. The need to have a
   clear political component which the military effort should support
   appears to have been significantly less in focus. Thus an almost
   predestined recipe of responding militarily `dramatically beyond the
   expectations of the enemy' was put in action from the outset. The
   perception that a more specifically tailored military strategy was not
   needed was a miscalculation.},

Abstract = {Will reforms emerging from the 2008 crisis have a global impact and
   influence developing countries? Evidence suggests that this happened
   before, after meltdowns in the 1970s. This article deconstructs how
   reforms diffused in this period and why countries followed different
   reform timelines. Institutional theory and a descriptive analysis of
   post-1970s experience suggest that countries followed different reform
   paths. Developing countries copied reforms seen as legitimate in various
   OECD countries, supported by entities upon which developing countries
   were dependent. The article argues that developing countries may not
   follow the same path now. Endogenous discussions about reform options
   are more common in developing countries now. More external reform
   alternatives have also emerged from new development partners such as
   China, and it is unclear that countries such as the USA will chart
   postcrisis reform paths developing countries perceive as worthy of
   following.},

Abstract = {Organization theory suggests that structural change has disruptive
   effects on managerial behaviour and organizational outcomes, and that
   these effects are likely to emerge in the period between the
   announcement and the commencement of the new structure. We evaluate the
   validity of this argument by analysing the performance of English county
   councils in the transition period before the voluntary restructuring of
   a sub-set of these organizations. Disruptive effects are tested while
   controlling for a range of other variables, including the relative
   prosperity of the local population and the diversity of their service
   needs. The empirical results indicate that the performance of local
   authorities facing reorganization deteriorated prior to the onset of the
   new structures, and support the view that structural change has
   disruptive effects on organizational outcomes.},

Abstract = {As the Turkish ruling, mild Islamist Justice and Development Party's
   popularity increased and Ankara was tightening its relations with Arab
   neighbours, the West started to speculate about Turkey's changing
   direction from the West to the East. A model story can be observed by
   the escalating tension between Turkey and Israel, for a long time seen
   as close partners. The cooling down of their relations serves as a
   litmus test of Turkey's foreign policy transformation, where Ankara's
   redefinition of strategy and role took place. It portrays the changed
   strategy and discourse of Turkey's foreign policy and tries to make
   connection between the recent developments both in the Middle East
   region and European Union. The work aims to answer these questions: What
   kind of foreign policy transformation can we observe in Turkey? Does
   Turkey pursue any hidden agenda, or is it only following a well-balanced
   approach? Is there any connection between Turkish disappointment with
   European Union membership prospects and turning its attention to its
   Arab neighbours?},

Pages = {663-681},
Abstract = {Global developments such as economic interdependence and the
   proliferation of national and regional competition regimes have created
   a complex international competition policy environment. The European
   Commission's DG Competition has responded to these developments by
   making the international dimension of competition policy a priority
   since the late 1980s. It advocated for the establishment of a binding
   multilateral competition framework at the WTO, pursued bilateral
   cooperation agreements, extraterritorially applied its competition
   rules, and tried to export its competition policy model to its
   neighbors. This paper examines DG Competition's objectives and
   strategies in internationalizing the EU's competition policy, and
   evaluates the success of these strategies in furthering the EU's goals
   in this area. The findings suggest that among all of the strategies it
   has tried, the DG has had most success with exporting the EU's
   competition regime to other countries; however, this strategy may have
   reached its limits, and needs to be supplemented by multilateral
   efforts.},

   Liberal Narratives of Progress},
Journal = {POLITICS RELIGION \& IDEOLOGY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {13},
Number = {3},
Pages = {289-309},
Abstract = {This article concerns secularization theory and the concept of political
   religion, specifically their analytic scope. It begins by noting that
   their recent revival after the Cold War displays a strong fixation on
   totalitarian ideologies: whereas Nazism and Bolshevism have received
   extensive attention, liberalism has been ignored. While this
   secularization-totalitarianism nexus is not without precedent in earlier
   scholarship, the article argues that it is arbitrary; ample space exists
   within secularization theory to accommodate other modern narratives of
   progress and perfection, including liberal ones. The article unlocks and
   recovers this space by revisiting the early stages of secularization
   theory to reveal that many of its initial proponents, such as classical
   realist scholars of international relations, included liberalism on
   their agenda. Concluding passages give some thought to why contemporary
   political religion historiography has not progressed beyond
   totalitarianism and why it should pick up on the broader secularization
   literature introduced here and re-engage with liberalism today.},

Title = {Political situations: knowledge controversies in transnational
   governance},
Journal = {CRITICAL POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {6},
Number = {3},
Pages = {324-336},
Abstract = {This article develops two arguments. The first revolves around the
   importance of studies of knowledge controversies, originally developed
   within the field of science and technology studies (STS), to accounts of
   innovation in transnational governance. Innovation in transnational
   governance, I contend, has catalyzed the emergence of transnational
   knowledge controversies, including controversies about the operation of
   transnational governance mechanisms. An argument turns on the need to
   supplement existing approaches to the study of knowledge controversies
   in STS. To this end I introduce the concept of the political situation.
   This concept highlights the ways in which the significance of a
   controversy needs to be understood in relation to a shifting and
   contested field of others controversies and events that have occurred
   elsewhere and at other times. The concept of the political situation
   also points to the part played by the social sciences themselves in the
   constitution and contestation of the situation within which knowledge
   controversies come to have significance.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {21},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {657-675},
Abstract = {Successive New Zealand governments have failed to adopt effective
   climate change policies. A positive, albeit limited, step was taken with
   the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme in 2008, a scheme founded on a
   framework of comprehensive coverage, applying to all sectors of the
   economy and all Kyoto gases, addressing the challenge of creating an
   emissions trading scheme tailored for a country characterised by large
   forest sinks and substantial agricultural emissions. Amendments in 2009
   created significant changes in the way the scheme operates. These
   included delaying the entry of key sectors, moving to an `intensity'
   based approach, to the free allocation of emissions units and
   implementing a `transition period'. The development of New Zealand's
   climate change policy highlights the difficulties of a unique emissions
   profile and strong political interests, particularly the influence of a
   powerful agriculture sector.},

Abstract = {Purpose - Starting from the premise that human behavior is the result of
   a complex interaction between physiological processes, psychological
   values systems, and socio-institutional contexts, this chapter examines
   how political behavior can be better understood through a multilevel
   approach.
   Design/methodology/approach - Employing social functionalism and
   Jonathan Haidt's Moral Foundations Theory, the conceptual model
   presented is predicated on the premise that human phenotypes are the
   product of evolutionary processes which have resulted in an intensely
   social animal. This chapter examines how physiological processes
   operating at the individual level, as demonstrated by recent
   neuroscience scholarship, are intricately involved in attitude formation
   as well as the presence of and variation in moral values. These
   individual-level traits are both responsible for socio-institutional
   processes as well as shaped by this larger social context.
   Findings - The chapter cites that there are specific neural substrates
   that correlate with moral values responsible for the formation of
   preferences for particular policies.
   Originality/value - In order to better understand political behavior and
   policy formation, it is incumbent upon political scientists to include
   individual-level analyses in theoretical models.},

Abstract = {This article examines the emerging trends in India's role as a provider
   of development assistance to the other developing countries of the
   global South. Though India has diversified the regional focus and has
   multiplied the quantum of development assistance, there remain several
   challenges at various levels. The expectations from the development
   partners have gone up but is India prepared with the institutional
   frameworks that would be required to administer the desired scale of
   response? Is there enough preparedness to undertake impact assessment?
   This article attempts to address some of these issues.},

Abstract = {The article examines China's emergence over the past decade as a net
   donor, and the implications of this status in global development. The
   analysis begins by outlining China's rise as a net donor, drawing
   comparisons in two-way aid flows with the other rising states,
   specifically Brazil, South Africa and India, and then turns to the
   implications of China's rise as an aid sender. The central argument is
   that conceptualizing China's rise as a `net donor' is crucial for
   understanding the hybrid position that China has come to occupy in the
   global aid system, and the consequences of this positioning. Although
   China has achieved remarkable success with its own development, rather
   than join the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's
   Development Assistance Committee (DAC) regime of traditional donors, the
   Chinese Communist Party and government leadership has chosen instead to
   continue to self-identify with the countries of the South, and to
   construct ties of South-South cooperation outside of DAC arrangements.
   The Chinese leadership is trying to stake out an unprecedented position
   in the global aid system, traversing the North-South divide, despite the
   fact that China has already joined the ranks of world economic powers.},

Title = {With a Little Help from Our Feds: Understanding State Immigration
   Enforcement Policy Adoption in American Federalism},
Journal = {POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {40},
Number = {4},
Pages = {674-697},
Abstract = {Since 2001, state governments have adopted 287(g) cooperative
   immigration enforcement agreements with the federal government that
   authorize their law enforcement personnel to assist in detaining
   violators of civil federal immigration law. Employing a theoretical
   framework drawn from theories of policy adoption, intergovernmental
   relations, and immigration research, we test which state-level
   political, sociodemographic, geographic, and economic determinants
   influence states to enter into such a cooperative agreement. In addition
   to finding that the partisanship of a state's governor, a state's effort
   on public welfare, and an increase in a state's percentage of Hispanics
   are related to the adoption of a cooperative immigration enforcement
   policy, we found evidence of steam valve federalism working not at the
   state level as Spiro (1997) first theorized but at the local level. When
   a state's localities adopt immigration enforcement agreements with the
   federal government, the state itself is far less likely to adopt their
   own. Understanding the reasons states would adopt this type of policy
   sheds light on current trends in state immigration policy and their
   effect on future state/federal intergovernmental relations.},

Abstract = {The Middle East is among the least stable and most fragile regions. It
   is not surprising, therefore, that concerns have been raised regarding
   the potential implications of climate change. This article critically
   examines the potential interactions between climate change and conflict
   in the Israeli-Palestinian case. Based on a review of the possible
   effects of climate change, water is identified as the main issue which
   may be affected, and it also has transboundary implications. We
   illustrate the potential implications of reduced freshwater availability
   by assessing the ability to supply normative domestic water needs under
   rapid population growth scenarios, including return of refugees. In
   addition, the ability to supply environmental needs and the needs of
   peripheral farmers under extremely reduced availability scenarios is
   examined. The normative domestic demand in Israel and the West Bank can
   be supplied on the basis of natural resources, though re-allocation of
   water from Israel to the Palestinians is necessary. The Gaza Strip
   cannot supply the normative domestic needs under any scenario and hence
   requires immediate augmentation, regardless of climate change.
   Desalination can supply Gaza's needs and augment water resources in
   Israel and the West Bank, thereby partially decoupling domestic and
   agricultural use from climate. Thus, it is unlikely that climate change
   will directly affect the conflict. However, framing water as a security
   issue, along with the potential for furthering such securitization with
   reference to climate change, may adversely affect the readiness of the
   parties to take adaptive measures and lead them to rigidify their
   negotiating positions. Possible effects of climate change on other
   regional players, particularly Egypt and Jordan, may have indirect
   effects on the Israeli-Palestinian scene. But this hypothesis requires
   further study.},

Abstract = {Immigration policy studies often assume the relevance of path dependency
   or contingency. This study weighs institutional changes, party changes
   and media as factors potentially driving immigration policy shifts after
   11 September 2001. In spite of change with each of these factors,
   immigration policy debate in the USA and Canada presents framing as a
   vehicle for absorbing exogenous shock while maintaining consistency in
   terms of immigration policy orientation. The USA and Canada converge
   after September 11 in filtering immigration through the lens of
   terrorism. However, in the longer run political representatives in
   Canada frame terrorism around human rights issues and thereby return
   immigration to its distinct and familiar policy orientation of openness
   and inclusiveness. Historically, border security, which has been
   narrowly defined in terms of illegal immigration, and the economy
   compete for salience around US immigration policy. After September 11 US
   representatives frame terrorism around security issues that expand much
   further beyond illegal immigration, and strongly reinforce this
   particular security dimension of its immigration policy orientation.},

Booktitle = {ACTIVE CITIZEN PARTICIPATION IN E-GOVERNMENT: A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE},
Year = {2012},
Pages = {44-64},
Abstract = {Today, people regularly debate the meaning of the term transparency
   relative to government. President Obama has made transparency a
   prominent issue in the federal government with his directive to use
   online resources to promote transparency. However, transparency is
   important at all levels of government, particularly transitioning from
   e-government to e-governance. This chapter discusses the definition of
   transparency related to e-governance and the implementation of
   transparency initiatives. The mission is to set the standards for
   government transparency and citizen engagement with an online presence.
   The standards and roadmap for achieving transparency in e-governance
   involve politics, policy, and technology. This chapter outlines the
   necessary political, policy, technology, and transparency issues in
   e-governance. The discussion and recommendations covers issues such as
   political will, insufficient knowledge, and fear. Also, recommendations
   address best practices in policy development and implementation. The
   current applications and data recommendations cover technology
   developments.},

Abstract = {The recent expansion of the Philippine military's tasks into areas not
   related to security and combat has had repercussions on their interface
   with local civilian actors. Through a survey of 93 soldiers from two
   communist front-line units in Western Visayas, the article examines the
   nature of tasks, civilian-military engagements and the soldiers'
   perception of local civilians. The soldiers perform predominantly
   non-combat tasks. They have more engagements with other local security
   forces and elected civilian authorities. These engagements are neither
   robust nor dense, with civilians providing material assistance to
   military-instigated activities. The soldiers have neutral views about
   elected authorities, civil society organizations and government
   agencies, and a moderately negative outlook towards the Commission on
   Human Rights, the media, the police and ex-rebels. The general
   skepticism over local government frameworks and capacity is tempered
   with the practical necessity of working with these local structures.
   There is homogeneity in the perception across functional groupings,
   suggesting close proximity between doctrine and practice.},

Abstract = {Does religion lead to greater destructiveness from suicide terrorism?
   And if so, how does it influence this form of political violence? Recent
   analyses of terrorism point to the significance of religion, but are
   divided as to whether religion itself matters, or certain types of
   religious terrorist groups are actually driving suicide terrorist
   violence. This article draws on social movement theory and recent work
   in the study of suicide terrorism to argue that religion influences the
   severity of suicide terrorist attacks as an ideology groups use to
   justify their struggle and gain public support. This effect occurs
   regardless of a group's goals or organizational nature. The theory is
   tested using a generalized estimating equation to account for multiple
   attacks by several groups. The study finds that the religious ideology
   of a group greatly increases the number of deaths from a suicide attack,
   even if varying group motivations and structural factors are taken into
   account. The article helps to clarify the effect of religion on
   contemporary terrorism, contributing to the study of both terrorism and
   religion and politics.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the views of Georgians, focusing primarily on
   those displaced from Abkhazia, and examines who they blame for the
   Georgia-Abkhazia conflict and what they think about Abkhazians. How
   groups assign blame affects the potential for reconciliation. Very
   different justifications are offered by those affected by conflict.
   These discourses of legitimation help to explain the conflict, and
   provide a narrative for the hostilities/war. For Georgian internally
   displaced persons, the blame for the conflict falls on Russia. For
   Abkhazians, the blame is placed on Georgians. Although both discourses
   are different, they each displace blame from themselves and their own
   agency and actions that played a significant role in the conflict, as
   well as in some of the atrocities that have been documented to have
   taken place on both sides.},

Abstract = {Since South Korea's economic transformation from a labor to a capital
   economy, it has had to grapple with issues like labor shortages and
   demographic changes such as low birth rates and a rapidly aging
   population that threaten long-term growth. In order to sustain its
   development, the country has increasingly turned to foreign labor and
   selective immigration as countermeasures for its economic and
   demographic problems. The state manages the influx of foreigners under a
   framework of ``multiculturalism{''} that professes openness towards
   becoming a ``multicultural society{''} despite resistance rooted in
   ethno-nationalism and a history of homogeneity. Despite criticism on its
   shortcomings and the failure of multiculturalism elsewhere,
   multiculturalism has provided the South Korean state with a convenient
   and flexible, if ambiguous, framework under which a diverse range of
   policies and programs for improving the lives of foreigners and
   immigrants could be adopted while simultaneously dealing with its
   economic and demographic concerns.},

Title = {Islam and Arabic as the Rhetoric of Insurgency: The Case of the Caucasus
   Emirate},
Journal = {STUDIES IN CONFLICT \& TERRORISM},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {35},
Number = {4},
Pages = {315-337},
Abstract = {Interpretations and uses of Islam are legion today. Some call for
   improving or preserving the morals and dignity of a certain local Muslim
   community or of the global Muslim community (umma) in its entirety.
   Others are eager to demonstrate that Islam is fully compatible and, in
   fact, conducive to modernity, democratic governance, and technological
   advancement of humankind. Still others posit Islam as a powerful means
   of liberation from occupation and domination/exploitation of Muslims
   around the world by non-Muslim powers. 1 This article addresses one
   concrete example of how some Muslim insurgents of the Northern Caucasus
   use Islam to unite the diverse and occasionally mutually hostile ethnic
   groups of the area in the face of Russian domination with the goal of
   establishing an independent Islamic state based on the Muslim Divine Law
   (Sharia). After providing a general overview of the history and ideology
   of this Islamic/Islamist movement, the article focuses on the ways in
   which its leadership uses the Internet to disseminate its understanding
   of Islam and to rally young Muslims round the idea of the trans-ethnic
   Sharia state that they promise to institute after defeating and
   expelling ``the Russian occupiers{''} and their local backers. Special
   attention will be given to the role of Islamic concepts and taxonomies
   as well as the Arabic language in framing the political grammar of the
   insurgency movement known as ``The Caucasus Emirate.{''}(2)},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {34},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {133-149},
Abstract = {With the mainstreaming of Euroscepticism within established parties, the
   EU is facing a new challenge: that of soft Eurosceptic governments
   landing in the rotating presidency's seat. Albeit not opposing the EU as
   such, these governments wish to put a brake on developments in further
   integration and challenge the EU informal norms of legitimacy and
   expected behaviour. On the basis of four case studies, this article
   illustrates the ability of the EU to adapt to this new situation -
   especially in the post-Lisbon era, where presidencies' ability to
   influence the EU agenda and direction is increasingly limited. Indeed,
   on the whole, Eurosceptic governments live up to the role of the
   presidency as manager of the EU day-to-day business. However, in this
   context, there is a risk that EU partners might neglect potentially
   authoritarian developments in the country holding the chair, as the
   Hungarian presidency illustrated. Consequently, while the rotating
   presidency becomes less permeable to the turmoil of domestic politics,
   its role as a `magnifying glass' of domestic democratic shortcomings
   becomes less relevant.},

Abstract = {Zimbabwe features highly in western media, in African scholarship and in
   political debates at international fora. However, little attention has
   been paid to Zimbabwean Diaspora politics as an aspect of the ongoing
   transformations and one whose analysis can help understand the
   multifaceted changes and challenges confronting the Zimbabwean
   community. Using a critical moment approach and drawing on key informant
   interviews, cyberspace materials and participant observations, this
   paper examines the nature of Zimbabwean Diaspora politics in Britain and
   how Zimbabweans are negotiating loss, change, identity and belonging in
   a turbulent globalising world.},

   Intergovernmental Gate Opener},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {34},
Number = {7, SI},
Pages = {717-734},
Abstract = {The introduction of `cooperation in the fields of justice and home
   affairs' in the guise of Title VI of the Treaty on European Union can be
   regarded as one of the most momentous innovations of the Treaty of
   Maastricht. In 20 years it has turned from a loosely framed and largely
   intergovernmental cooperation framework into a fundamental treaty
   objective which has generated over 1400 texts adopted by the Council and
   a range of new EU institutional structures such as Europol and Eurojust.
   This article will show that the Treaty of Maastricht - although it did
   not provide for clear objectives, adequate legal instruments and
   effective decision-making procedures in the JHA domain - nevertheless
   marked at decisive breakthrough for this policy-making domain. It did so
   by opening the entire domain for regular institutionalised cooperation
   between the member states, allowing for the development of a common
   perception of the challenges and a gradual agreement on basic objectives
   and principles which a few years later - when the Treaty of Amsterdam
   had removed some of the legal and institutional obstacles left in place
   by the Maastricht Treaty - allowed for an extraordinarily rapid
   development of what is now the Union's `area of freedom, security and
   justice'.},

Title = {Following from the front: theorizing deliberative facilitation},
Journal = {CRITICAL POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {6},
Number = {2},
Pages = {146-162},
Abstract = {Facilitation is indispensable to organized deliberative practices, yet
   largely absent from deliberative theory. This article theorizes the role
   of the deliberative facilitator through the central dilemma of
   `following from the front'. The facilitator necessarily occupies a
   leadership position in the deliberating group, yet must follow the group
   as it unfolds its own discourse on the issue at hand. This article will
   specify this tension in the framing of publics, the handling of
   expertise, the conduct of deliberation, and the crucial phase of
   bringing a deliberation to a conclusion. The various criticisms of
   deliberative practice in these dimensions are treated not as decisive
   objections, but rather as tensions to be negotiated by those who
   organize and conduct deliberative minipublics. This article aims to show
   the value of critical empirical work on deliberative practices as
   describing potential dangers, which can be set against the normative
   ideals and democratic potentials involved in attempts to generate
   deliberation in minipublics.},

Abstract = {In recent years scholarly attention has shifted from the study of
   democratization to the phenomenon of electoral authoritarianism. In
   these regimes, regular elections are held for national legislatures and
   chief executives, yet they fail to live up to democratic standards of
   freedom and fairness. A range of new research has investigated these
   regimes and especially the capacity of elections to either dislodge or
   reinvigorate authoritarian incumbents. This article reviews some of the
   current work on electoral authoritarianism and attempts to find ways to
   achieve synthesis and better theoretical development. It notes the need
   for greater conceptual consensus, attention to context, and better
   evaluation of what electoral competiveness means under authoritarian
   conditions. It argues that the next stage for research should be smaller
   and contextual comparison that can allow for greater attention to
   concepts, while allowing for strong midrange theory.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {19},
Number = {4},
Pages = {549-566},
Abstract = {This article explores the evolution of food safety policy at the level
   of the European Union (EU) from a discourse-analytical perspective.
   First, the article traces the political saliency of food safety since
   the food scares of the late 1990s, such as `mad cow disease', and
   explores the consequent breakdown of the historically sedimented policy
   approach. Specifically, I highlight key moments of institutional
   transformation at the EU level by considering the role of scientific
   expertise and the meaning of national borders in the overall policy
   approach. Subsequently, the paper uses discourse analysis to address the
   mobilization of Europeanization in food safety policy since the 1990s,
   and identifies the `integrative nodal points' that have helped sustain
   this policy discourse: notions of being a member of the food chain, of
   being a stakeholder, and of being a consumer.},

Abstract = {In comparing the amendments to public procurement laws after the ECJ's
   `Ruffert' judgment (European Court of Justice 2008, C-346/06) the paper
   explores the compliance to Europeanization through law in the 16 German
   federal states. Instead of unilinear convergence, three types of
   reactions were identified. First, conservative-liberal governments
   rescinded the respective regulation. Thus, they dismantled their policy.
   Second, conservative governments that were susceptible to the pressures
   from small- and medium-sized business associations absorbed the effects
   of the ECJ ruling by enacting quick and minor amendments. Third, social
   democrat led governments tended to seek out policy alternatives that
   were consistent with European law. These governments engaged in
   EU-induced policy expansion, eventually setting up new procurement laws
   that included a number of social and environmental standards. Therefore,
   the case study at hand confirms studies of Europeanization that
   highlight the re-assertion of party differences which depends on both
   fundamental programmatic differences as well as plurality of European
   law.},

Abstract = {In light of recent interest in theories of green citizenship, citizens'
   reported values in relation to policy for household sustainability are
   examined. Theory is combined with an empirical study of citizen
   attitudes in order to ask how established conceptions of citizenship
   might obstruct or foster opportunities for the practices that greens
   advocate. A prevailing conception of `stakeholder' citizenship is
   outlined, and a critical pragmatic theoretical framework is introduced
   to establish some explanatory propositions. Stakeholder citizenship is
   oriented towards sustainable development, but in problematic ways.
   Stakeholder citizenship promotes individual self-responsibility within a
   growth-oriented economy: it is the form that citizenship takes as the
   state embraces `weak' ecological modernisation. On the other hand,
   self-responsible stakeholder citizens are increasingly aware that
   individual contributions to structural problems are insufficient.
   Further debate is needed in green political theory on the status of
   citizenship as both a political and cultural phenomenon, and in policy
   circles over how best to leverage contemporary forms of citizenship for
   green ends.},

   Interpretation},
Journal = {ETHNOPOLITICS},

Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Pages = {24-42},
Abstract = {The paper attempts to offer an alternative analysis to the predominantly
   positivistrationalist approaches exhibited by most studies of Israel's
   policies towards the Palestinians. Rather than focusing on realist
   estimations of power and the national interest as dictating the foreign
   and defence policies of Israel since its establishment, this paper draws
   attention to the causes of these manifestations. Using a constructivist
   methodology, it examines the way in which historical, cultural and
   religious processes have created a unique Israeli collective identity
   that can be defined by a dual construct of exceptionalism and siege
   mentality. Recognizing the centrality of these constructs in political,
   public and educational discourses is thus imperative not only for a
   better understanding of Israel's approach to security, but also for
   creating conducive steps towards reconciliation between Israel and her
   neighbours.},

Abstract = {This article sets the framework for the subsequent special issue on
   political recruitment and career development of local councillors in a
   comparative perspective. After conceiving recruitment and career
   development as a funnel-like process filtering out the few from the few
   and leading to patterns of interpositional mobility in the political
   realm, the article proceeds by proposing the ideal-types of layman and
   professional to characterize the poles of the continuum upon which
   current trends in recruitment and career may be situated. Overall, these
   trends seem to point at a shifting structure of opportunities with
   predominant professionalization and partial socio-demographic
   democratization. Still, from a comparative perspective the extent to and
   the pace by which these general trends emerge are likely to be
   contingent upon the country, the municipality and the individual
   councillors studied. The comparative dataset on which the issue draws
   offers a unique opportunity to discern empirical patterns in the factors
   discussed above. The article concludes by outlining the issue and
   summarizing its main findings revealing a complex reality in the
   different phases of recruitment and career development of the
   contemporary councillor in Europe.},

Abstract = {Based on an analytic review of recent scholarly advances in genocide
   studies, this article investigates the causes, concept, and logic of
   genocide while suggesting a set of theoretical propositions and avenues
   for future research. Two emerging theoretical streams of literature on
   causes-strategic and ideological-highlight different dimensions of
   genocide and should be thought of as compatible. The study of genocide
   should be embedded in a broader study of political violence; the two
   literatures have been strangely cloistered from each other. To that end,
   genocide should be conceptualized as group-selective, large-scale
   violence whose purpose is group destruction. This stands in contrast to
   violence that is individually selective or indiscriminate; small-scale
   and not sustained across time and space; and whose purpose is
   repression, communication, or some other outcome short of group
   destruction. To develop existing theory and to bring the study of
   genocide closer to the literature on violence, studying variation in
   outcomes is essential; that is, students of genocide should ask why
   genocide and not another outcome occurs, rather than only studying
   common patterns among genocide cases. Similarly, rather than study
   primarily sources of escalation and accelerators of violence, scholars
   should also theorize restraint and decelerators of violence. Further,
   scholars of genocide should focus attention on the interaction between
   national and sub-national actors as well as periods of escalation or
   de-escalation. In these ways and others proposed in the essay, genocide
   studies can build on recent gains and develop a broader and more
   coherent field of theoretical inquiry.},

Title = {Public Political Narratives: Developing a Neglected Source through the
   Exploratory Case of Russia in the Putin-Medvedev Era},
Journal = {POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {60},
Number = {4},
Pages = {768-786},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The place of narrative in political science is an issue that resurfaces
   with regularity, usually focusing on the questions of generalisability,
   evidence and causality which lie at the heart of the discipline. Most
   such debate concerns the use of narrative by political scientists. Far
   less attention has been devoted to the use of narrative by political
   actors, despite its relative ubiquity. Even where such attention has
   been given, it concentrates less on the narrative per se, and more on
   its performance and impact. However, the nature of public political
   narratives means that analysis of them facilitates a holistic
   understanding of their narrators' politics. A public political narrative
   consists of a sequential account given by political actors connecting
   selected, specific developments so as to impose a desired order on them.
   Taking contemporary Russia as an exploratory case, narrative analysis
   draws out the motivations, world view and inconsistencies within the
   Putin-Medvedev regime. Recurring motifs and symbols identify the
   regime's political priorities, explaining policy choices and revealing
   future concerns. Narrative has a predictive aspect, identifying likely
   policy responses to unexpected events. Narratives capture time, and
   shifts in their temporalities indicate changes in self-conceptualisation
   and political priorities. Temporal appropriations include or exclude
   particular agential and causal explanations. The relationship between
   their plots and subplots represents a political signalling process.
   Public political narratives provide temporally and spatially specific
   exceptionalist accounts, but their combinatory quality also facilitates
   comparative analysis. The approach essayed here provides methodological
   generalisability, arguing that the neglect of public political
   narratives merits correcting.},

Title = {Encountering China: Contexts and Methods for Teaching Chinese Politics

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHINESE POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {17},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {361-377},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This article explores the use of student-centered learning activities
   when teaching Chinese politics in American college classrooms and
   discusses the importance of context in those activities. In particular,
   the article explores how classroom context, including student
   identities, and student exposure to diverse, often conflicting
   ``political identities{''} in course material emerge during different
   ``encounters{''}-a Cultural Revolution poster exhibition, a simulation
   about the Three Gorges Dam, a Cultural Revolution role-play, and a
   problem-solving session involving factory workers. The article argues
   that encounters, which encompass in-class activities, such as problem
   solving, simulations, and role-play, enhance student engagement with
   course material, improve student retention of historical and
   contemporary political knowledge, and encourage critical thinking and
   peer collaboration in a student-centered learning environment. The
   article concludes that learner-centered teaching is significant because
   as the world becomes more complex, the knowledge and skills acquired
   through student-centered activities in politics classes are highly
   relevant for the future of self-organization, social interactions, and
   institution building.},

   study took place in and around the town of Eldoret. It encourages
   researchers interested in sport in Africa to develop a political economy

   Association Do fair trade PTAstrade agreements that contain provisions
   for protection of labor rightslead to improvements in labor protection
   in PTA partner states? If so, how do the PTAs bring about such
   improvements? I argue that trade partner states are likely to engage in
   ex ante due diligence and improve the protection of labor rights at home
   before they sign or even enter into negotiations for a PTA. Given that
   large developed economies have increasingly placed value on strong labor
   protection, trade partners of these economies act on the belief that,
   holding other factors constant, having stronger labor protection will
   increase their attractiveness as a potential or a prospective PTA
   partner. I test this argument in the context of the United States and
   its trade partners between 1982 and 2005. The evidence shows that trade
   partner states indeed are much more likely to improve labor protection
   (i) prior to the 2002 Trade Act publicizing the importance of labor
   protection and (ii) prior to signing a PTA with the United States.},

Abstract = {As social property and resources formerly open to common use, such as
   beaches and coastal lakes, have been privately appropriated, an
   environmental discourse has arisen among national and transnational
   elites that justifies this appropriation in terms of conservation and
   even shapes environmental policies for their benefit. One example is the
   creation of natural protected areas in zones of predominantly private
   property, giving them exclusive rights and increasing real estate values
   and investments in tourism. As a result, tourist paradises have sprung
   up in places of high biodiversity, offering exclusivity to their owners
   and clients while violating agrarian rights, creating social conflict,
   and destroying ecosystems.},

Abstract = {The research presented here uses a novel method to show that
   contemporary party systems may originate much further back than is
   usually assumed or might be expectedin reality many centuries. Using
   data on Ireland, a country with a political system that poses
   significant challenges to the universality of many political science
   theories, by identifying the ancestry of current party elites we find
   ethnic bases for the Irish party system arising from population
   movements that took place from the 12th century. Extensive Irish
   genealogical knowledge allows us to use surnames as a proxy for ethnic
   origin. Recent genetic analyses of Irish surnames corroborate Irish
   genealogical information. The results are particularly compelling given
   that Ireland is an extremely homogeneous society and therefore provides
   a tough case for our approach.},

Abstract = {This article argues that an engagement with the political philosophy of
   Leo Strauss is of considerable value in International Relations (IR), in
   relation to the study of both recent US foreign policy and contemporary
   IR theory. The question of Straussian activities within and close to the
   foreign policy-making establishment in the United States during the
   period leading up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq has been the focus of
   significant scholarly and popular attention in recent years. This
   article makes the case that several individuals influenced by Strauss
   exercised considerable influence in the fields of intelligence
   production, the media and think tanks, and traces the ways in which
   elements of Strauss' thought are discernible in their interventions in
   these spheres. It further argues that Strauss' political philosophy is
   of broader significance for IR insofar as it can be read as a
   securitising response to the dangers he associated with the
   foundationlessness of the modern condition. The article demonstrates
   that the politics of this response are of crucial importance for
   contemporary debates between traditional and critical IR theorists.

   Rejoinder to Liam Stanley},

Abstract = {This rejoinder takes issue with two criticisms of my Political Studies
   article on incremental ideational change presented in a recent reply by
   Liam Stanley. It argues that by presenting my critique of historical and
   discursive institutionalism as focused on the lack of realism in their
   standard conceptualisation of ideas, Stanley creates a straw man.
   Instead, my criticism aims at the analytical outcomes of the mainstream
   understanding of ideas as generally coherent and stable, an approach to
   ontological criticism that Stanley explicitly approves of. Second, using
   examples from recent analyses of the financial crisis, I try to show the
   relevance of an ontology conducive to theories that capture and explain
   incremental ideational change. I also defend an eclectic approach to
   theory building that is focused less on policing the boundaries of
   different approaches and more on building consistent theoretical
   approaches from multiple social scientific traditions.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to investigate the determinants of the
   local tax mix in Spain. As the main local own revenues, we analyze the
   five local taxes -with the property tax as the main source- and fees and
   charges. The study relies on a sample of 130 municipalities with more
   than 50,000 inhabitants for the years 2005 and 2009. The results show
   the relevance of scale variables such as the population or total assets,
   but per capita income and grants are not significant. In political
   terms, we observe that ideology is important and fragmentation plays a
   limited role: the property tax share tends to be lower with left-wing
   governments, who favor revenues using the benefit principle.},

Abstract = {There have been many attempts to apply evolutionary models to social
   change. This article takes Darwin's account of artificial - as well as
   natural - selection as its starting point. It thereby brings together
   human intention and learning - the arts of civilisation - and the
   unintended processes of change with which evolutionary models are more
   usually concerned. It argues that policy science should be an
   evolutionary science, studying endogenous processes of technological and
   institutional transformation; but that it must be more than this,
   articulating political goals and policy trade-offs and illuminating the
   arts of civilisation as applied to society as a whole.},

Abstract = {An influential model of deliberative democracy advances a principle of
   reciprocity as a norm of democratic debate on morally controversial
   issues. This norm is at odds with behaviour that has been observed in
   political campaigning and policy making where advocates of competing
   positions talk past one another. Does this inconsistency stem from a
   contrast between the normative and empirical or from not considering
   empirically plausible practices of democratic debate in which
   reciprocity might be respected? One such practice is free votes on
   conscience issues in the UK parliament. This article examines six second
   reading debates in the UK House of Commons on abortion legislation to
   assess whether, in favourable circumstances, political debate is
   consistent with reciprocity. Utilising computer-aided text analysis, via
   the Alceste program, it finds no gross departure from the norm of
   reciprocity, suitably operationalised, but neither does it find complete
   conformity to the norm of reciprocity. Because advocacy is an important
   component of political representation, deliberative norms are qualified
   in practice.},

Abstract = {Optimism and opportunity in Russian-East European relations just a
   couple of years ago, especially with the Obama government's express
   desire to ``press the reset button{''} with Moscow, generated much hope,
   but it seems now that this also camouflaged deep issues of structure and
   process. Beyond historical mistrust and fear, an increasing drift away
   from democracy by Russia, while Eastern Europe, (geographically more
   broadly defined than during the Cold War), largely has sought closer
   political, economic and military integration with their Western
   neighbors, appears to have created two solitudes that may be irrevocably
   moving in different directions.
   Further, Russian ambitions and unrealistic expectations of regaining
   superpower status together with the belief that there may even be a
   shortcut to that restoration by manipulating the Western European
   powers, encouraging divisions within NATO and the European Union and
   isolating Eastern Europe or at least some of the states in the region,
   not only increases regional mistrust but ironically also diverts Russia
   away from the much needed fundamental economic and political changes
   that could transform it into a truly modern and successful state and a
   better neighbor and partner. Add issues such as the deployment of
   anti-ballistic missile defense systems in Eastern Europe over which
   Moscow continues to express vociferous military alarm but which in
   reality disguises Russian hegemonic ambitions or at best political fear,
   as well as Russia's political use of energy and pipelines, and we have a
   combination that makes regional relations increasingly acrid and thus
   does not bode well for the future. (C) 2012 The Regents of the

   Association What counts as evidence that the other side is sincere?
   Within mainstream international relations literature, scholars have
   focused on costly signals. We argue, however, that in the real world
   leaders do not simply look at costly signals, but they rely to an
   important extent on their personal impressions of other leaders, taking
   these as credible indicators of sincerity. Our approach thus builds both
   upon the literature on interstate communication and perceptions and upon
   more recent research in the field of neuroscience regarding affective
   information. To probe the plausibility of our theory, we focus on the
   indicators British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain used to evaluate
   Germany sincerity in the late 1930s and Ronald Reagan employed to make
   sincerity judgments about Soviet intentions in the late 1980s.
   Additionally, we briefly discuss the 1961 Vienna Summit between Kennedy
   and Khrushchev as an illustration of how personal impressions can also
   result in negative assessments of sincerity. Our findings suggest that
   personal impressions are an important, but up until now relatively
   ignored, source of evidence for leaders of their counterparts sincerity
   with significant implications for threat assessments and policy choices.},

Abstract = {The global financial crisis revealed not only the need for greater
   oversight of the private sector, but also the co-dependence of
   governments and those firms. From national economic governance to
   transnational regulations such as the Basel III regulations, the
   continued strong influence of the private sector in negotiating, setting
   standards and implementing them through private bodies such as the US
   Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) remains undeniable. The
   global financial crisis thus illustrates how even amidst valid claims
   that `the state is back', global policy making is increasingly
   multi-stakeholder in character. This article provides a snapshot of the
   increasing extensiveness of multi-stakeholder processes through a
   conceptual overview and an empirical survey, highlighting instances in
   which various actor pillars (governments, intergovernmental
   organisations, civil society organisations, corporations, etc.) have
   begun to expand their membership and participation to include other
   stakeholders. It demonstrates that even as the main actor groups that
   serve as the foundation of global policy processes remain mostly
   unchanged, the extent to which each pursues multi-stakeholder approaches
   has increased.},

Abstract = {A number of distinct subfields within conflict resolution share
   foundational theories and emerge from similar understandings of social
   conflict. One of the most influential of these theories assumes that
   conflict environments give rise to `otherizing' dynamics between
   competing groups. This theory assumes that conflict occurs between and
   further reifies identity groups. It follows from this theory that
   conflict resolution practice, and particularly that within the subfield
   of peacebuilding, must undermine dyadic `in-group/out-group' conflict
   through processes of reconciliation and transitional justice. However,
   the theorized dynamic does not always pertain. In Sierra Leone the truth
   and reconciliation commission was tasked with fostering reconciliation
   between the perpetrators and victims of wartime violence. This article
   describes, however, how former combatants in Sierra Leone are described
   by many as brothers and friends, as opposed to hated members of a
   collective `other'. These findings attest to a distinct lack of
   `otherizing' dynamics and demand a reconsideration of peacebuilding
   practices after what are often considered `new wars' or `postmodern
   conflicts' in sub-Saharan Africa. The article argues that some
   contemporary conflicts might best be considered post-identity because
   they are based less on national, racial, religious, or ethnic identity
   than on circumstance, need, and opportunity. In addition, after
   post-identity conflicts truth commissions may create new competing
   identities, such as those between victims and perpetrators. In such
   cases the applied conflict resolution interventions must emerge from new
   conflict resolution theory which can adequately understand contemporary
   conflict dynamics and begin to develop non-identity focused
   interventions.},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Contemporary empirical evidence shows that trade tariff cuts have a
   negative impact on customs revenue in low-income countries. This article
   documents the historical experience of the US and Canada from 1870 to
   1996, which shows that customs revenue declined in these two countries
   with falling trade tariffs. Such a decline should therefore have been
   anticipated while advocating trade liberalisation in low-income
   countries, and trade reform hyphenated with fiscal reform, so as to
   identify compensating revenue ex ante. A recent cross-country study by
   Baunsgaard and Keen covering the period 1975-2006 fails to find complete
   replacement from other revenue sources in low-income countries even in
   the long run, let alone concurrently. This is an issue affecting
   countries all across the size spectrum, and is of immediate importance
   in the context of the slow progress towards achieving the Millennium
   Development Goals. Another problem, limited to large federal countries
   in the developing world, is that trade taxes are levied exclusively by
   the national government, so that compensating revenue from a source not
   similarly restricted to that level has the potential to destabilise the
   balance of power within the federation.},

   the external world has only a positive impact on its current state of

   several respects openness, in particularly systematic emigrations of
   active people from the country, creates a lot of the problems which,
   however, can be partially solved if society has true democratic
   institutions. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The

Volume = {31},

Abstract = {In many Western countries, alongside NPM-rhetoric, important tasks of
   public service delivery have been devolved to autonomous single purpose
   agencies. This was also the case in Flanders (Belgium). This reform
   rhetoric also has a clear vision on how tasks in the policy cycle are to
   be distributed between actors: policy-making is a political prerogative,
   supported by core governmental departments, whereas executive agencies
   have policy implementation as their main task. This article addresses
   whether this ideal-typical model really exists, drawing on two case
   studies of policy initiatives in Flanders. Our observations confirm a
   policy-operations divide between politics and administration, but it
   needs refinement: ministers and their advisors make the strategic policy
   decisions, in which they are assisted by executive agencies. Ministerial
   departments are hardly involved in the policy-making process. Executive
   agencies are more than policy implementers alone, as they often have a
   large input in the operational stages of policy-making. (C) 2012 Policy

Abstract = {This article addresses Chinas multilateral diplomacy by identifying four
   distinct strategies: watching, engaging, circumventing, and shaping. The
   typology builds on two literatures: power transition theory, and the
   more recent ``assertiveness{''} discourse in the West. Drawing from a
   range of cases in both the economic and security domains, the article
   argues that China's multilateralism is diverse, and that it cannot be
   un-problematically characterized as either status-quo or revisionist in
   nature. However, the general trend appears to be towards engagement, but
   with an assertive tact as China's interests become further entangled in
   the business of international institutions.},

Abstract = {The article provides a broad overview of the fluctuating connections
   between the controversial and ambiguous field of modern geopolitics and
   Russia. Given the pivotal significance of the Russian challenge within
   the early hypotheses of Mahan and Mackinder, the article first explores
   those distinctive geographical and spatial considerations that helped
   shape the development of the Russian Empire. The place of geopolitics in
   the Cold War is then reviewed, including both its policy orientation and
   the exchanges between the proponents of geopolitical realism and liberal
   internationalism. In conclusion, the article examines the post-Cold War
   renaissance of geopolitics, reviewing both theoretical developments and
   policy implications for Russian foreign policy. International Politics

Journal = {SOCIO-ECONOMIC REVIEW},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {10},
Number = {3},
Pages = {447-470},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Based on the Dclaration Annuelle de Donnes Sociales, a very detailed
   French database on wages, we show that wage inequality started to
   increase in France in the mid-1990s. This phenomenon is limited to the
   top end of income distribution and concerns mainly the top 0.1, whose
   share of total salaries increased from 1.2 to 2 between 1996 and 2007.
   This increase in inequality was accompanied by some changes in the
   social composition of this wage elite. These include a decline in CEOs
   and an increase in lower rank management, such as chief officers and
   other administrative managers, as well as a rise in sportspersons. A
   sector approach shows that finance (3 of private sector employees) is
   responsible for half of the rise in inequality at the top end of wage
   distribution. We discuss the role the volume of financial activity plays
   in the tremendous increase of top financial wages.},

Volume = {4},

Pages = {165-197},

Abstract = {This article proposes an anthropological extension of the so-called
   Copenhagen School theory of securitization in International Relations.
   In contrast to existing attempts to show how, suitably elaborated, this
   model can be `applied' to various non-Western contexts, our
   anthropological strategy is to use the contingency of empirical
   materials (namely the Cuban Revolution and the political forms it
   instantiates) as a means for transforming the basic coordinates of the
   model itself. The argument involves two main steps. First we relativize
   the Copenhagen School model, showing the contingency of its premises. In
   its paradigmatic form, we argue, the model is liberal in that its
   abiding concern with states of emergency turns on an ontological
   distinction between political subjects (e. g. people) and political
   structures (e. g. state). By contrast, revolutionary politics in Cuba
   concertedly rescinds just this distinction, to bring about an
   alternative, non-liberal political ontology. We then go on to use the
   Cuban case to construct an alternative model of securitization, which we
   call revolutionary. On this model, the move of securitization pertains,
   not to a passage from ordinary politics into a realm of emergency, but
   to a deliberate ontological fusion of the two, such that rule and
   exception also become coterminous.},

Abstract = {Member states of the GATT/WTO have linked some issue-areas outside trade
   to the institution and did so with varying depths. At the same time they
   have chosen not to link other issue-areas. What accounts for this
   variation? The author argues that states establish a legalized linkage
   between the GATT/WTO and an issue-area outside it when they are
   uncertain about the possibilities of disguised protectionism. Such
   uncertainty exists under two conditions: when diversity in regulations
   in an issue-area across states generates a large adverse impact on trade
   (negative externalities) but that diversity can be justified at the
   international level for (1) having an independent objective apart from
   hampering trade and (2) when there are few alternative policies to
   achieve that objective (legitimacy). States establish a highly legalized
   linkage in these situations to reduce the uncertainty and minimize
   disguised protectionism. By contrast, when regulatory diversity exhibits
   low legitimacy, states establish only a weakly legalized linkage. In the
   absence of meaningful externalities, they do not establish any linkages.
   The author evaluates this argument in two ways. He provides an overview
   of eleven issue-areas about which there have been some debates or
   conflicts about linkages to the GATT/WTO. In addition, he carries out
   in-depth case studies of three issue-areas-labor standards,
   environmental standards, and health safety standards. The findings of
   this article contribute to a better understanding of international
   institutions and cooperation as well as of the evolution of the
   multilateral trade institution.},

Abstract = {From a political and social point of view, the Chilean transition to
   democracy was one of the most conservative in Latin America. The rise of
   Michelle Bachelet, a socialist woman whose father had been executed by
   the Pinochet regime and herself a victim of imprisonment and torture,
   suggested a change. Instead, the legacy of the authoritarian regime, the
   government's technocratic response to it, and the economy's ``mature{''}
   neoliberalism enabled the replacement of the original coalition (the
   Concertacion de Partidos por la Democracia) by a right-wing government

Abstract = {Park, Jong Hee. (2012) What Determines the Specificity of Subsidies?
   International Studies Quarterly, doi: 10.1111/j.1468-2478.2012.00728.x
   ?(c) 2012 International Studies Association As countries increasingly
   protect their domestic industries by government subsidies, specific
   subsidiessubsidies that target specific industries or firmshave received
   increasing international attention due to their negative externality in
   international trade. In this paper, I argue that variations in domestic
   institutional arrangements can explain the cross-national variation in
   subsidy specificity. First, I theorize that the size of specific
   subsidies has an inverted U-shaped relationship with the level of
   centralization of economic interests, while the size of general
   subsidies monotonically increases with the level of centralization of
   economic interests. Then, I expect the supply-side factors such as
   electoral institutions and government partisanship to interact with the
   effects of centralization in determining the amount of specific or
   general subsidies in a country. Using the state aid data set of the
   European Union between 1992 and 2004, I find that the amount of sectoral
   aidstate aid targeted at specific industries or firmsis larger in
   countries where labor and business interests are organized at the
   industry level than in countries with decentralized or highly
   centralized industrial relations. The size of state aid targeting a wide
   range of economic sectors increases as the centralization of labor and
   business interests increases.},

Abstract = {This article addresses the following two questions: First, how does the
   United States (US) manage regional war and peace, especially in the
   Middle East (ME)? It will show that the strategies the US has adopted in
   conflict management in the ME over the last several decades have shown
   considerable variations, both in the goals of its involvement between
   trying to shape the regional balance of power and to reorder the
   domestic regimes in the regional states, and in the means of involvement
   between a unilateral and a multilateral strategy. Second, it seeks to
   explain these variations in the US regional patterns of involvement.

Abstract = {The recent global financial crisis has significantly affected sovereign
   wealth funds' (SWFs') financial performance and their investment
   activities. The crisis shed a new light on SWFs' objectives and
   priorities. SWFs need to review critically their strategic asset
   allocation (SAA) within a sovereign asset and liability management (ALM)
   framework, and their assets should be analyzed over complete economic
   cycles including market turbulences. The crisis raises also the question
   of whether some of the underlying objectives of the Santiago
   Principles-maintaining a stable global financial system and maximizing
   financial returns-are perhaps conflicting. We argue that any conflict
   was from a wrong interpretation of the principles, not from the
   principles themselves. Ultimately, stable financial markets are in each
   SWF's self interest, also from a narrow financial perspective. In this
   respect, financial stability and financial risk/return can be mutually
   reinforcing objectives rather than conflicting.},

Title = {Rethinking China's grand strategy: Beijing's evolving national interests

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICS},

Abstract = {The question of China's grand strategy is of great importance for
   understanding the international impact of China's rise. Both Western and
   Chinese scholars dispute whether China has developed a coherent grand
   strategy in the reform era. The main reason for the controversy seems to
   lie as much in theoretical and methodological assumptions about defining
   and analyzing grand strategy as in empirical validity. This article
   contributes to the debate by adopting a novel theoretical approach to
   analyzing grand strategy by seeing it as the conjunction of national
   interests and strategic ideas. It examines China's evolving national
   interests and strategic ideas in the reform period in order to clarify
   the exploratory, evolutionary and adaptive nature of policy change.
   China cannot be said to have developed a premeditated grand strategy
   during this period. Even though one may still be able to rationalize
   elements of China's foreign policies into a grand strategy, it comes at
   the cost of missing their changing nature. International Politics (2012)

Abstract = {States are free to choose their own means for implementing international
   human rights obligations. Western states usually rely on legal means, in
   particular legally enforceable individual rights. However, law does not
   enjoy a monopoly. The receptor approach assumes that, especially in
   Eastern and Southern states, international human rights obligations can
   be implemented more fully through local social institutions. It
   identifies domestic social institutions capable of meeting human rights
   standards and assumes that, where these social arrangements fall short
   of human rights obligations, they will have to be improved and reformed.
   This should be done as much as possible with the help of home-grown
   remedies to foster the cultural legitimacy of international human rights
   standards.},

Abstract = {The literature offers individually valid yet collectively inconsistent
   hypotheses concerning the nature of public agencies' responsiveness to
   interest groups. This article analyzes the nature of this responsiveness
   by examining the brokerage potential of public agencies among interest
   groups. Such a brokerage potential is hypothesized to follow from
   agencies' preferences for policy goods as well as the tendency of
   interest groups to seek access to public agencies. It combines analyses
   of agencies' demand for policy goods with interest groups preferences
   for seeking access to specific policy venues. The analyses are based on
   survey data of national civil servants and interest groups in the United
   Kingdom and in the Netherlands. The findings suggest that both strategic
   preferences as well as organizational routines positively correlate with
   a brokerage potential while interaction patterns within and with the
   organizational environment of public agencies can constrain their
   brokerage potential in several distinct ways.},

Abstract = {This article examines the demand for criminal accountability for the
   atrocities committed after Kenya's contested December 2007 elections. It
   explains why, despite strong popular desire for accountability through
   prosecutions and the threat of and actual International Criminal Court
   (ICC) involvement, the government has failed to take concrete steps to
   try those believed primarily responsible. The article argues that the
   fundamental reason why the government has not initiated systematic
   prosecutions in regular domestic courts - or created, as promised, a
   hybrid national/international tribunal - is that those in charge of
   establishing these processes are, in many cases, those whom it would
   prosecute or their close allies. A hybrid tribunal now seems unlikely
   and credible national trials are an improbable alternative, though there
   are some reasons to be more optimistic following the new constitution of
   2010. For the time being only international justice, which is beyond the
   government's reach, can achieve a breakthrough in criminal
   accountability, albeit in a very limited way.},

Abstract = {Remarkable progress has been made towards the recognition of sexual
   minority rights in Africa. At the same time, a marked increase in
   attacks, rhetorical abuse, and restrictive legislation against sexual
   minorities or `homosexuality' makes activism for sexual rights a risky
   endeavour in many African countries. Campaigns for sexual rights and
   `coming out' are frequently perceived as a form of Western cultural
   imperialism, leading to an exportation of Western gay identities and
   provoking a patriotic defensiveness. Cultures of quiet acceptance of
   same-sex relationships or secretive bisexuality are meanwhile also
   problematic given the high rate of HIV prevalence on much of the
   continent. This article examines specific initiatives that are using
   subtle, somewhat covert means to negotiate a path between rights
   activism and secretive bisexuality. It argues that strategies primarily
   focused on health concerns that simultaneously yet discreetly promote
   sexual rights are having some success in challenging prevalent
   homophobic or `silencing' cultures and discourses.},

Abstract = {Exogenous shocks may lead to policies that seem extreme and even
   ``irrational{''}. This paper argues that, in the event of a major energy
   shock in the US that persists, such legislation is an inevitable
   response to the demand from constituents that political actors ``do
   something{''}. Since shocks by their nature are unanticipated and are
   often highly technical and complex, boundedly rational legislators
   cannot generally understand all of the ramifications of the shock, much
   less hope to craft well-considered and precise legislation to deal with
   it. But the demand to ``do something{''} means that a range of actions
   is politically necessary. The ``shock{''} policy process is modelled as
   a stepwise legislative decision problem. If the crisis persists,
   legislation that promises a solution is likely to be the result, even if
   this ``solution{''} is infeasible. The model is applied to five US
   energy shocks.},

Abstract = {Changing trends in governance have contributed to the development of
   `capacity-building initiatives' in the third sector to enable them to
   take a greater role in partnership approaches, service delivery and
   social entrepreneurship. However, analysts have argued that such
   initiatives are more likely to serve the interests of professionalised
   welfare groups rather than engage with communities' own skills and
   interests. Drawing on in-depth individual interviews and case studies
   with those engaged in such activities in minority ethnic organisations
   in devolved Scotland, this paper reveals that `capacity' is a socially
   constructed, negotiated process, which benefits some organisations more
   than others. We identify factors which are likely to either facilitate
   or hinder the process. While there is consensus among participants that
   such activities play a useful role in developing organisational
   capacity, we argue that the responsibility for addressing structural
   factors including socio-economic disadvantage and racism remains with
   government.},

   Analysis},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION},

Volume = {66},

Abstract = {We examine whether and under what circumstances World Bank and
   International Monetary Fund (IMF) programs affect the likelihood of
   major government crises. We find that crises are, on average, more
   likely as a consequence of World Bank programs. We also find that
   governments face an increasing risk of entering a crisis when they
   remain under an IMF or World Bank arrangement once the economy's
   performance improves. The international financial institution's (IFI)
   scapegoat function thus seems to lose its value when the need for
   financial support is less urgent. While the probability of a crisis
   increases when a government turns to the IFIs, programs inherited by
   preceding governments do not affect the probability of a crisis. This is
   in line with two interpretations. First, the conclusion of IFI programs
   can signal the government's incompetence, and second, governments that
   inherit programs might be less likely to implement program conditions
   agreed to by their predecessors.},

Abstract = {The Turkish state has been going through a neo-liberal transformation
   resulting from the strategic reorientation of state institutions in ways
   that enhance and facilitate the strategies pursued by market-oriented
   social forces. The reform that granted legal independence to the Turkish
   Central Bank (TCMB) in 2001 was an institutional turning point within
   the state structure in Turkey; this policy shift prohibited TCMB's
   granting of credits to the Treasury and other public institutions.
   Institutionalization of an anti-inflationary approach to macro-economic
   policy altered the power balance not only between different state
   agencies, but also between social groups in favour of financial
   interests that benefited from monetary stabilization. Rooted in a
   neo-Gramscian framework, this article explores the legal independence of
   the TCMB as a function of the market-oriented domestic social forces
   that emerged as a result of the process of neo-liberal globalization
   initiated in the 1980s. The article also emphasizes how the hegemonic
   unification of diverse identities and interests around the strategy of
   achieving price stability was crucial in the autonomy of the TCMB.},

Abstract = {This article looks at the interdependences between the democratisation
   processes in Armenia, Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh and the management
   of the Karabakh conflict, focussing on the EU's democracy promotion
   policies. The article argues that the EU's normative foreign policy in
   the South Caucasus has been limited by the permanence of the protracted
   conflicts, in two interrelated ways. First, by not addressing the
   conflicts the EU focused on long-term goals but failed to provide
   short-term incentives towards peace. Second, by allowing only a limited
   involvement in the protracted conflicts, especially inside Karabakh, the
   EU was perceived as a reluctant partner, undermining its normative
   credentials. (C) 2012 The Regents of the University of California.

Abstract = {The article focuses on the politicization of international authority as
   a thus far little understood development in world politics. We first
   define the concept and show that there is an empirical trend towards
   politicization of international institutions. We then argue that the
   increasing authority of international institutions has led to their
   politicization and we relate this hypothesis to alternative
   explanations. The validity of the authority-politicization nexus is
   illustrated by the rise of international authority in parallel to
   politicization. We go on to distinguish different policy functions such
   as rule definition, monitoring, interpretation, and enforcement in order
   to show that especially those international institutions with a high
   level of authority meet with strong contestation of their competencies.
   We conclude the article by exploring various avenues for future
   politicization research.},

Title = {The EU as an international security actor after Lisbon: Finally a green
   light for a holistic approach?},
Journal = {COOPERATION AND CONFLICT},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {47},
Number = {1},
Pages = {68-87},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This article argues that a holistic approach is important when studying
   the European Union's (EU) role as an international security actor, but
   at the same time it identifies problems in adopting such a comprehensive
   research agenda. The holistic approach entails that the research must
   include `new' security problems, such as climate change, but also
   relevant policies and instruments outside the framework of the Common
   Security and Defence Policy (CSDP). However, owing to conceptual, legal
   and political obstacles, this has been difficult to achieve; as a
   consequence, existing research on the EU as an international security
   actor tends to narrow down the focus to just one framework: the CSDP and
   its operations. This may lead to a distorted image, because the EU's
   role in international security surpasses any single policy framework.
   The contribution of this article is twofold. First, it sets the
   framework for the comprehensive research agenda concerning the EU as an
   international security actor. Second, it identifies key obstacles that
   are making this holistic approach methodologically and conceptually
   difficult. In this context, the Lisbon Treaty, formally abandoning the
   pillar structure of the EU, provides an opportunity to mitigate at least
   some of these roadblocks.},

Abstract = {This article considers the political nature of public space and explores
   its psychological relevance as a natural arena of citizenship. Drawing
   on literature in social psychology, environmental psychology, and
   political geography, the article addresses how common understandings of
   normative behavior in public are often based on particular constructions
   of place and people-space relations. In so doing, it shows how such
   culturally shared locational notions are essentially contested in
   relation to their political significance and ideological orientation
   within a particular public socio-spatial context. It is argued that
   claims for and demands on public space are enshrined in broader
   struggles over the psychological boundaries of belonging, identity, and
   civic entitlements which are central to the contentious issue of
   citizenship. This is illustrated through the analysis of an emblematic
   struggle over a public space located in the Old Town of Barcelona
   between 1999 and 2007, triggered by the social appropriation of an
   undeveloped urban lot. The article pinpoints how considering the
   material dimension of public space may also enrich existing
   psychological approaches to citizenship.},

Abstract = {This article looks at developments in Eastern European civil society (as
   measured by the participation in organisations) and how this has changed
   between 1995 and 2005 using the World Values Survey. There are
   comparisons with Western Europe on the one hand and the United States on
   the other, which show that although civic participation of this kind has
   declined in the United States, it remains stable in Europe, including at
   a low level in Eastern Europe. Surprisingly, there seemed to be little
   differences between countries that had joined the European Union and
   those that had not. The article considers reasons for this continued
   weakness of civil society in Eastern Europe.},

Title = {Does climate change drive land-use conflicts in the Sahel?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {49},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {97-111},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {While climate change scenarios for the Sahel vary and are uncertain, the
   most popularized prediction says there will progressively be drier
   conditions with more erratic rainfall. According to some, an increase in
   violent conflicts over scarce resources should also be expected. This
   article investigates the climate-conflict nexus in detail, focusing on a
   distinct area at the heart of the Sahel, the inland delta of the Niger
   river in the Mopti region of Mali. Two complementary analytical
   approaches are applied. The first consists of collection and analysis of
   court data on land-use conflicts, 1992-2009, from the regional Court of
   Appeal in Mopti. A comparison of the conflict data with statistics on
   contemporaneous climatic conditions gives little substance to claims
   that climate variability is an important driver of these conflicts.
   Second, we carried out a qualitative analysis of one of the many
   land-use conflicts in the region. Again, we find that factors other than
   those directly related to environmental conditions and resource scarcity
   dominate as plausible explanations of the violent conflict. We argue
   that three structural factors are the main drivers behind these
   conflicts: agricultural encroachment that obstructed the mobility of
   herders and livestock, opportunistic behavior of rural actors as a
   consequence of an increasing political vacuum, and corruption and rent
   seeking among government officials.},

Abstract = {Following the Scottish National Party's realisation of a parliamentary
   majority, a referendum on Scottish independence will be held in 2014. As
   an example of ethnopolitical mobilisation, the outcome of this event
   will reasonably impact upon other regional movements in the British
   Isles and beyond. However, any such impact of the referendum will be
   largely a function of the current state of ethnopolitical mobilisation
   in those regions, which varies widely across the cases of Wales,
   Cornwall, Northern Ireland, Isle of Man, Jersey, Guernsey, the Western
   Islands of Scotland, and Orkney and Shetland. The constitutional issues
   raised by a Scottish secession will, along a different vector, stimulate
   discussion and nationalism in both the `Celtic Fringe' and the English
   core of the UK. Meanwhile, the Western Isles, and in particular Orkney
   and Shetland, as constituent parts of Scotland, will be more directly
   influenced by any institutional changes.},

Abstract = {An organization should address ethical issues including privacy before
   deploying biometric systems. Threats to informational privacy rights
   related to potential data misuse, function creep, and the data linkage
   of personal information contained in diverse databases makes possible
   such unintended consequences as surveillance, profiling, and
   discrimination. Unlike passwords, biometric data are unique,
   irrevocable, and variable. Biometric encryption (BE) is highlighted as a
   prominent example of Privacy by Design, where privacy is embedded as a
   core functionality in the biometric system. BE binds a digital key to
   (or extracts the key from) the biometrics. Earlier technical challenges
   to this new technology, as well as recent advances, are presented.
   Lastly, an overview is provided of an application using facial
   recognition (FR) in a watch list scenario, known to be the first and
   largest successful deployment of BE using FR, in a casino context.},

Journal = {SOUTH EUROPEAN SOCIETY AND POLITICS},

Volume = {17},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {155-173},
Abstract = {This article analyses the 2010 regional elections in Italy, in which the
   centre-right, led by Silvio Berlusconi, was successful. This followed on
   from its victory in the 2008 general election and the 2009 European
   elections. The article analyses the extremely conflictual political
   climate in which the elections took place. The analysis of the election
   results concentrates on four points: the large increase in
   abstentionism, the contest in the northern regions between the Lega Nord
   and the Popolo della liberta, the failure of the centre political
   formations to realise their ambitions, and the success of far-left
   `anti-political' groups.},

Journal = {WORLD POLITICS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {64},
Number = {1},
Pages = {116+},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This article examines mass public discourse on religion and pluralism in
   diverse societies. It argues that religion enters the public sphere by
   defining countervailing narratives about sectarianism, which is
   exclusive and divisive, and ecumenicism, which is inclusive and
   unifying. Most empirical studies focus on elites as the producers of
   discourse and ignore the regular people who comprise the ``real{''}
   public. In contrast to prior work, this article systematically examines
   mass public discourse, with Lebanon, a religiously diverse developing
   world society, as its research venue. It uses a novel combination of
   original survey data and publicly displayed religious and political
   iconography to study the exchange of ideas about religion and pluralism
   among the mass public. It shows that sectarian discourse articulates
   ethnocentric and antiplural statements, whereas ecumenicism, by
   contrast, mitigates ethnocentrism and valorizes pluralism.},

   roles in negotiations to end the 2006 Israel-Lebanon War and in the
   brokering of the 2008 Doha Agreement between warring Lebanese factions
   present two instances of `partial' and `direct' contributions to success
   in resolving major extra-systemic and minor internal conflicts. These
   developments are part of a global trend of the regionalization or
   decentralization of security in the post-Cold-War context.},

   Before and After a Natural Intervention},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT AND VIOLENCE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Pages = {142-162},
Abstract = {Data from the Transatlantic Trends: Immigration survey was used to
   investigate whether the debate surrounding Thilo Sarrazin's
   immigration-skeptical Deutschland schafft sich ab (Germany abolishes
   itself) had any impact on migration-related attitudes in Germany. The
   book was published in August 2010 and fieldwork took place during the
   evolving debate, providing a unique opportunity to study the impact of a
   major media event on public attitudes. Descriptive findings on the
   aggregate level show no substantial change in migration-related
   attitudes in the months after publication. More detailed findings reveal
   a significant increase in skepticism only for respondents with low
   levels of education, whose assessment of Muslim migrants' integration
   became more negative during the debate. There are two possible reasons
   for the lack of more substantial attitudinal change. Firstly, the debate
   was highly polarized and lacked the consonant national media coverage
   that is an important precondition for media effects on public opinion.
   Secondly, there were no additional ``external shocks{''} prior to the
   book's release, such as a high levels of immigration, that could have
   made the public more susceptible to criticism of the impact of
   migration.},

Journal = {SOUTH EUROPEAN SOCIETY AND POLITICS},

Pages = {427-447},
Abstract = {One of the most striking facts of recent Spanish political debate has
   been the relatively little partisan and ideological conflict over the
   size of the welfare state. To explain this puzzle, we rely on the idea
   that support for the welfare state and support for redistribution are
   not necessarily the same thing. Our analysis of welfare policy
   preferences in Spain reveals that a significant proportion of Spaniards
   favour welfare state expansion along with non-redistributive programmes,
   and welfare state retrenchment along with pro-poor policies, and that
   partisanship is only barely related to these combinations of
   `non-standard' policy preferences.},

   Divide},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {35},
Number = {4},
Pages = {489-512},
Abstract = {The dominant explanations of Libya's nuclear reversal in 2003 privilege
   either coercion or carrots treating these instruments as alternatives.
   In doing so they ignore that it took a combination of coercion, carrots
   and confidence-building to turn Libya around. This article demonstrates
   this by developing and deploying a theoretical framework that integrates
   these three instruments into a more coherent and convincing explanation
   of the case. It highlights that analysts and policy-makers would do well
   to focus more on how different policy tools can be used in combination
   to achieve desired outcomes than on how individual tools can be employed
   with decisive effects. It also demonstrates that the Libya success will
   be hard to replicate.},

Abstract = {The 2011 Portuguese presidential election resulted in a comfortable
   victory for the incumbent president, Cavaco Silva, an outcome consistent
   with the notion of substantial incumbency advantages. However, as this
   article demonstrates, the Portuguese case is part of a broader pattern,
   with semi-presidentialism in post-war Western Europe generating a
   considerable pro-incumbency bias in presidential elections. Using the
   Portuguese elections as a case study, it is found that this advantage
   derives not only from the direct benefits of holding office, but also
   from an indirect effect of incumbency on the quality of challengers. In
   particular, the average quality of challengers is significantly lower in
   elections with an incumbent than in open-seat contests.},

Abstract = {The article reviews recent advances in the study of violence in civil
   wars. It provides a brief description of the baseline
   ``control-collaboration{''} model, discusses alternatives to it, and
   reviews recent empirical studies that supply additions, corrections,
   extensions, and refinements to the baseline model. It highlights some of
   the assumptions that can be relaxed based on this new research,
   including the following ones: that in civil war context information is
   produced exclusively or even primarily by civilian denunciations at the
   local level; that violence is only used to deter civilian defection;
   that conflict is always locally dyadic; and that rival factions are
   organizationally indistinct from each other and resort to similar
   repertoires of violence. These refinements and extensions have the
   potential to produce a novel set of predictions that can be tested
   against both existing and new data. The essay notes the dynamism of this
   research program and recommends two steps for future research. First, it
   recommends moving to a higher-level, empirical and theoretical
   synthesis, by relying on the growing corpus of empirical studies and
   exploring scope conditions in a much more systematic way than was
   possible previously. Second, it recommends scaling up the findings of
   micro-level, subnational studies to the meso and macro-levels, by
   deriving novel empirical implications and testing them.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT AND VIOLENCE},

Abstract = {Much research into the relationship between democratisation and conflict
   argues that holding elections soon after civil war, when nationalist
   issues still resonate, is likely to see voters elect to fight. This
   paper explores a case where elections had the opposite effect.
   Examination of the relationship between election results and political
   developments, as well as geographical voting patterns, demonstrates that
   elections were the primary mechanism for the deradicalisation of Irish
   politics after the civil war of 1922-23. Elections served as a mechanism
   for arbitration, selection, and coordination between more and less
   radical elites and their bases of support. Once the new state had shown
   its strength it had to accommodate gradual change, while electoral
   losers had to show they could reconcile change with stability. Elections
   helped establish credibility in both respects without altering the
   state-society relationship, suggesting that deradicalisation was
   dependent on state performance, and thus on some shared conception of
   the state. This combination of credibility, electoral legitimacy, and
   state performance, enabled a revolutionary elite, schooled in both
   constitutional and revolutionary politics, to deradicalise Irish
   nationalism after independence.},

Abstract = {Because of consequences of climate change, the Arctic became a
   geostrategic and geopolitical region. Area rich in natural energy
   resources opens with the melting ice a possibility to shorten the sea
   routes. The main international forum for cooperation in the high north
   is the Arctic Council. The relationship of US and Canada seems to be
   quite steady. Even though both countries are struggling to preserve
   national interests in international politics, Arctic seems to be the
   playground where neither of them can actually prevail.},

Title = {THE FUTURE OF TURKEY-EU RELATIONS},
Booktitle = {PANORAMA OF GLOBAL SECURITY ENVIRONMENT - 2012},
Year = {2012},
Pages = {271+},
Abstract = {For over half a century Turkey has been striving to become an EU member.
   Nonetheless, the problem of serious democratic reforms which would bring
   Turkey closer to the Community was first taken up by a moderate Islamic
   Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Democratic reforms in Turkey were
   carried out under the EU pressure, for example private Kurdish courses
   as well as TV and radio programmes were allowed and Turkey has begun
   opening up to its neighbours. The question of the genocide of Armenians
   was becoming the subject of public debate. Yet in recent years, the
   process of the implementation of democratic reforms by Prime Minister
   Erdogan has considerably slowed down. Freedom of speech, Kurdish rights,
   threatening to freeze the relations with the EU if the Republic of
   Cyprus takes over the leadership in the EU Council these are some
   manifestations. Despite the fears over Turkey's giving up its EU
   aspirations, the priority of Prime Minister Erdogan's government should
   be a full EU membership. The evidence for this is not only the
   willingness to solve the Cypriot problem quickly but also the work on
   the new constitution introducing more democratic freedoms in accordance
   with EU criteria. Nevertheless, one should not expect the acceleration
   of the reforms. Having the perspective of a distant EU membership, the
   Prime Minister will carry out the policy of small steps and may even
   sacrifice his good relations with the EU for the sake of internal
   policies. The key role in the process of Turkey's integration with the
   EU will be also played by the European states (mainly France and
   Germany). Without their political will, the chances for Turkey's
   membership are non-existent.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},

Volume = {19},
Number = {6},
Pages = {863-881},
Abstract = {How does the European Union (EU) affect change in neighbouring
   countries? The article explores this question, using Ukraine as a case
   study. So far Ukraine has attracted contradictory assessments of the
   impact of the EU on the country's domestic transformation. To explain
   this puzzle, the process of Ukraine's convergence with EU rules is
   analysed in terms of rule selection, adoption and application. The
   article focuses on the mechanisms which the EU uses to shape domestic
   actors' incentives and capacities for taking on EU rules in each of the
   three dimensions. In the case of technical regulation, EU mechanisms
   affect domestic actors differently in the three dimensions, resulting in
   comprehensive rule selection but only selective rule adoption and
   application. The process of convergence occurs, but in a
   non-synchronized and highly idiosyncratic way, thereby indicating the
   patchy impact of the EU on its neighbours, even in the core economic
   field.},

Abstract = {While the revolutions of the 2011 Arab Spring deposed and replaced
   previously embedded autocratic regimes, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
   remained largely trouble free. This article examines how the ruling Al
   Saud family was able to prevent the violent manifestation of tensions
   within Saudi Arabia. It is argued here that through the process of
   state-formation mechanisms were created to ensure the stability of the
   regime, a framework initially intended to protect the regime from coup
   d'etats. The long-term application of coup-proofing strategies cannot
   successfully respond to the challenges emanating from non-military
   sources. This analysis concludes that the Saudi monarchy has avoided
   short-term instability, but longer-term pressures facing the Al Saud
   family necessitate domestic reform. However, regional dynamics, driven
   by fears of an expansionist, nuclear Iran, a changing regional balance
   of power, and an apparent American exceptionalism for Saudi Arabia, make
   this reform unlikely.},

Abstract = {It has long been assumed that progress toward arms control and
   disarmament is possible only after constituting legal frameworks from
   which such an action could be initiated. Although the legal framework
   regarding a particular weapon might be questioned for its effectiveness,
   the related practices of legalization themselves are rarely
   interrogated. This article problematizes practices of legalization in
   the field of arms control and disarmament. It builds upon innovations by
   critical security studies scholars to scrutinize the ICRC's engagement
   with the problem of conventional weapons, especially landmines. Study of
   practices of legalization demonstrate the embeddedness of legal
   discourses in the regulation and prohibition of weapons. It compels,
   state and non-state actors to represent their interests in legal terms
   and represents their efforts as attempts towards developing existing
   legal frameworks. This article acknowledges the experiences with
   practices of legalization in the preceding half-century of arms control
   and disarmament negotiations. A reflection on these experiences exposes
   the limitations and possibilities of practices of legalization and
   encourages alternative approaches to regulating and prohibiting weapons.},

Abstract = {In this issue of Studies in Conflict \& Terrorism Brym and Araj
   published a critique of the study of would-be suicide bombers that the
   present author carried out with colleagues. Brym and Araj's point of
   departure was their allegation that the article attributed the
   Palestinian suicide attacks mainly to depression and suicidality of the
   suicide bombers. Their critique was aimed at disputing this alleged
   attribution. For this end they criticized various aspects of the
   methodology used in the study and described their own study which, in
   their view, challenges the author's findings. In this response article
   the author shows that Brym and Araj's critique is based on false
   allegations, cannibalized quotes, and distorted interpretation of the
   published descriptions of the study. Their methodological criticism
   alleging biased psychological assessment is invalid because it ignores
   the use of a control group and a ``blind{''} reliability check of the
   diagnoses. Brym and Araj's own study suffers from serious methodological
   problems: venturing a psychological assessment on the basis of a brief
   interview with family members, conducted and analyzed by persons
   unqualified for making clinical psychological diagnoses, without using a
   standard battery of psychological tests. Brym and Araj did not use a
   control group and a ``blind{''} reliability check of their diagnoses.},

Title = {Internal and External Collective Memories of Conflicts: Israel and the
   1948 Palestinian Exodus},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT AND VIOLENCE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Pages = {127-140},
Abstract = {The general category of collective memory of conflicts includes several
   kinds of memories (e. g., official, autobiographical, and historical -
   of scholars) that the literature typically discusses as a unified
   phenomenon. This contribution demonstrates that each of these kinds of
   memory comprises two types of sub-memories: internal (how the holders of
   a sub-memory actually view the history of a conflict) and external (how
   they publicly express their views of that history). Empirically, the
   research is based on an examination of Israeli official,
   autobiographical, and historical memories from 1949 to 2004 concerning
   the causes of the 1948 Palestinian exodus. Methodologically, it uses
   content analysis of documents and interviews with key Israeli figures.
   Theoretically, the article proves the existence of these two
   sub-memories, discusses their different characteristics and
   implications, addresses their reciprocal relations, and explores
   self-censorship and external censorship as the causes for the
   differences between them.},

Abstract = {Over the last few decades, the European Union (EU) played a central role
   in diffusing specific `models' of territorial policy across member
   states.This Europeanisation process did not produce homogeneous results,
   however, since comparable EU-funded territorial policy instruments
   generated dissimilar outcomes in different contexts.This article aims to
   compare the implementation of Territorial Employment Pacts, a Community
   Initiative the main features of which were a territorial-focused
   strategy, local-level involvement and a creative approach to governance,
   in the cases of Portugal and Italy.The objective is to learn more about
   the key factors for institutional change in the Europeanisation of
   territorial policies.},

Title = {European Public E-Procurement: The Italian Experience},
Booktitle = {ACTIVE CITIZEN PARTICIPATION IN E-GOVERNMENT: A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE},
Year = {2012},
Pages = {230-249},
Abstract = {The public procurement of goods and services is a strategic activity for
   governments for at least three reasons: a) it has a relevant economic
   impact (15-20\% of the GDP of European countries); b) it is relevant for
   potential improvements in governments' public services; and c) it
   affects both the competitiveness of nations and the welfare of citizens.
   After a description of the European central procurement models for the
   public sectors, this chapter identifies the specificities of the Italian
   situation, discussing the role of e-procurement platforms across the
   whole system from an organisational and an economic point of view.
   Focusing on the Italian Central Procurement Department, the authors
   conducted a survey on e-transactions over the past four years. The
   results show the kinds of goods and services that are more compliant
   with the use of e-procurement tools, trends in transaction volumes and
   economic amounts and the relevance of different geographical areas and
   different public organisation typologies. A major change in
   e-procurement transactions has occurred because of the compulsoriness
   enforced by legislative framework.},

Volume = {33},

Pages = {79-95},
Abstract = {There is always a need for new measures of public accountability and
   integrity, not so much because current systems are lacking, but because
   new challenges constantly arise. One such challenge is emerging as
   parliamentary systems within Westminster-influenced jurisdictions are
   becoming more accustomed to minority parties and/or independents playing
   a significant role in government. This is particularly potent in the
   current Australian context where a minority parliament has resulted in a
   situation where the changing vote of any parliamentarian could change
   the outcome of legislation. This situation raises new questions and
   presents new opportunities for the development of enhanced measures to
   support ethical action and decision-making for all parliamentarians.
   More specifically, the anticipated creation of an Australian
   Commissioner of Parliamentary Integrity, with a brief to provide advice
   on ethical issues for parliamentarians, provides such an opportunity.
   This article draws on recent literature to put forward an expanded model
   of `parliamentary integrity', as well as acknowledging the need for
   greater practical utility of concepts in this field by exploring a range
   of challenges that face independents and single-member parties. It
   suggests that the new Commissioner's role might be grounded in a notion
   of parliamentary integrity as the service of the public good, rather
   than the simple avoidance of coercion, corruption or crime. In doing so,
   the article identifies not only an opportunity to respond to the current
   political landscape in Australia but also to set a new standard for
   integrity and accountability in Westminster systems.},

Abstract = {We live in an era of pervasive connectivity. At an astonishing pace,
   much of the world's population is joining a common network. The
   proliferation of communications and information technology creates very
   significant changes for statecraft. But we have to keep in mind that the
   Internet is not a magic potion for political and social progress.
   Technology by itself is agnostic. It simply amplifies the existing
   sociologies on the ground, for good or ill. And it is much better at
   organizing protest movements than organizing institutions to support new
   governments in place of those that have been toppled. Diplomacy in the
   twenty-first century must grapple with both the potential and the limits
   of technology in foreign policy, and respond to the disruptions that it
   causes in international relations.},

   Survivors},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS},

Abstract = {This article analyzes how the current framework of retributive justice
   pursued by the UN International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda fails to
   respect the human rights and to enable the well-being of Rwandan
   genocide survivors. Rwandan genocide survivors currently suffer from
   widespread poverty, lack of access to health care and housing,
   inadequate educational opportunity, and food insecurity and
   malnutrition. It calls for the application of restorative justice as an
   extension of the principle of the Responsibility to Protect for genocide
   survivors to be included in the remit of the Tribunal and UN
   humanitarian and development programs in Rwanda. It examines current and
   past restorative justice programs in various countries around the world
   to provide tangible examples of ways in which restorative justice can be
   implemented. It critically questions the moral logic of exclusive
   reliance on retributive justice that ignores the consequences of
   genocide by punishing the guilty without simultaneously assisting the
   victims. Finally, it urges that the Declaration of Basic Principles on
   Remedy and Reparation for Victims of Human Rights Violations and Article
   75 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court be applied to
   the work of the UN International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on the relationship between the threat perception
   analyses of the British Admiralty and the strategic orientation of the
   Royal Navy at the outset of the twentieth century. The current view is
   that this was an era when fear of France and Russia drove British naval
   policy. However, as this article will show, Britain's Naval Intelligence
   Department formed a low opinion of French and Russian naval capabilities
   at this time and this negative evaluation exerted considerable influence
   over decision making. The belief that, owing to multiple qualitative
   deficiencies, these powers could definitely be beaten in battle lessened
   the standing of the Franco-Russian naval challenge and freed the
   Admiralty to consider the danger posed by other possible enemies, most
   notably Germany.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {34},
Number = {6},
Pages = {567-584},
Abstract = {European Union policy on regional aid has always exhibited a concern for
   the possibility of bidding wars for mobile investment, but it is only
   since 1998 that the EU has had comprehensive rules designed to address
   investment incentives. The Multisectoral Framework on Regional Aid for
   Large Investment Projects, now incorporated into the Regional Aid
   Guidelines, provides for reduced aid maxima for projects over sic50
   million. This paper shows that the Multisectoral Framework has largely
   accomplished its goals: aid award levels have fallen significantly since
   the reform of the Framework in 2002, and in comparison with the
   unregulated location tournaments of the US, aid packages are smaller in
   the EU. In fact, in 2010-2011, there were only three aid awards of \$100
   million or more in the EU, versus 21 in the US.},

Abstract = {The end of the Cold War led to the creation of almost two dozen new
   states, resulting from groups that advanced claims based on the
   legitimacy of national self-determination. These claims ranged from
   modestly increased autonomy to secession and independent statehood. As a
   result, and because a number of these claims escalated to violence,
   scholarly research into self-determination and secession has increased
   tremendously over the past two decades, with scholars examining the fate
   of these movements and associated violence and wars, from onset to the
   termination of associated violence and wars. This article assesses the
   state of the academic literature as it relates to the links between
   self-determination, secession, and civil wars. It begins with a
   discussion of what exactly is understood by such key concepts as
   ethnicity, self-determination, secession, and secessionist war. It then
   turns to the conditions and factors that have been identified in the
   literature to explain the emergence of self-determination and secession
   and why violence and war become potential outcomes.
   {[}Supplemental materials are available for this article. Go to the
   publisher's online edition of Terrorism and Political Violence for the
   following free supplemental resource: article appendix of ethic groups
   at political risk, list of territorial secessionist wars, and militant
   secessionist groups active in the last 25 years.]},

Title = {Integrity agencies: the significance of the parliamentary relationship},
Journal = {POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {33},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {65-78},
Abstract = {One of the outcomes of the work of the global NGO Transparency
   International has been the development of the concept of the `national
   integrity system', and within that context there is growing interest in
   a set of public agencies involved in the encouragement, establishment,
   protection and maintenance of such systems. Some of these agencies are
   now quite venerable, but their number has been increasing rapidly. In
   their work, however, they face a serious problem. Governments draw
   attention to them as accountability devices, but is that just
   window-dressing? In the performance of their work they will inevitably
   conflict with or embarrass governments from time to time, so the
   temptation is to starve them of funds or otherwise weaken them so that
   their threat potential is much diminished. It is important, therefore,
   that measures be put in place to protect THEM as they perform their
   duties. This article examines this proposition, explores the role of
   parliament as the obvious (but problematic) protector, and notes
   particularly the development of the notion of `officers of parliament'
   as a special protective device.},

Abstract = {This article is a response to Evron's argument, offering readers another
   perspective to assess China's military modernization and war fighting
   capabilities, using the same framework and methodology. It examines
   three topics: China's national security and military strategy, the PLA's
   procurement decision-making process, and China's military support and
   mobilization system. It concludes that, China's military modernization
   is to fight and win local wars under the conditions of informatization,
   but if required the PLA can reliably supply large numbers of
   sophisticated weapons and spare parts, to wage a complex and prolonged
   conflict.},

Abstract = {Egypt's revolutionary process is facing serious challenges, not least of
   which is the absence of a broadly based movement that can harness the
   energy of the masses. The forces of the counter-revolution are using all
   means to derail the process especially by effecting a schism between
   economic and political demands where the former is portrayed as
   extraneous to the course of the revolution. The article demonstrates how
   this separation in any struggle is falsely conceived and in the case of
   Egypt is being used as a deliberate tactic to protect the interests of
   the capitalist state and its agents.},

   of the world: Toward a third generation ethics?},
Journal = {BUSINESS AND POLITICS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {14},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Codes of ethics contain a set of rules of conduct and corporate
   principles concerning the responsibility of a company to its
   stakeholders and shareholders. These codes help to guide corporate and
   employee behavior, and - constitute - Verifiable elements of social
   responsibility. This study examines the Most Admired Companies of the
   World, ranked by Fortune magazine in 2009 to find out, first, whether
   their codes of ethics exhibit greater emphasis on social responsibility
   and strong implementation processes, and second, whether they could be
   considered codes of the third generation as elaborated by Stohl et al.
   in their article in the Journal of Business Ethics. Our results indicate
   that the codes of ethics of the 2009 Most Admired Companies of the World
   resemble ``codes of conduct{''} rather than strictly codes of ethics or
   ``codes of corporate social responsibility{''}. These codes continue to
   be governed by traditional norms related to immediate economic success,
   normative compliance, internal management and the pressing effects of
   their sector. This study thus provides empirical support for the idea
   that the philosophy of corporate social responsibility (CSR) is scarcely
   present in the codes of the most reputable companies.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {66},
Number = {1},
Pages = {129-151},
Month = {WIN},
Abstract = {Little existing work has systematically examined the factors that help
   terrorist groups survive or contribute to their failure. State support
   for terrorist groups is commonly thought to be a factor that helps
   groups to survive. I demonstrate with newly collected data that state
   sponsorship is not always helpful to terrorist groups. The resources
   provided by sponsors increase a group's ability to maintain itself
   internally. However, when a group has a sponsor that provides it with
   safe haven, the risk of the group being forcefully eliminated by the
   target increases. I argue that sponsors that provide safe haven can have
   incentives to provide information to the target about the groups to
   avoid potential costs from target military operations within their
   territory. The key empirical findings suggest that state sponsorship is
   a less serious problem for target states than many previously thought.},

Abstract = {To date there is no systematic exploration of the concept of political
   feasibility. We believe that feasibility is a central issue for
   political philosophy, conceptually as well as practically, and that it
   has been given background status for far too long. Roughly, a state of
   affairs is feasible if it is one we could actually bring about. But
   there are many questions to ask about the conditions under which we are
   justified in thinking that we could bring about a political state of
   affairs. In this article we bring together several aspects of the
   concept of feasibility defended in the literature thus far, and build
   upon them to give an analysis of the notion of political feasibility. We
   suggest that the notion involves a relation between agents and the
   pursuit of certain actions and outcomes in certain historical contexts,
   and that there are two important roles for feasibility to play in
   political theory, corresponding to two feasibility tests: one
   categorical, the other comparative. We show how the tests operate in the
   assessment of three different levels of a normative political theory:
   core normative principles, their institutional implementation and the
   political reforms leading to them. Focusing on the third level, which
   has received the least attention in the literature, we proceed to
   explain how feasibility considerations interact with desirability and
   epistemic considerations in the articulation of normative political
   judgments.},

   theories have advanced our understanding of International Relations
   (IR). This article contends that the two leading structural realist
   frameworks, however, rely too heavily on an ascribed unit motivation and
   core dynamic that are not derived from structure. This ultimately
   weakens both theories explanatory potential. This article offers a

Abstract = {Previous studies have attested to leaders ``coup-proofing{''} their
   regimes by reducing the ability or disposition of their armies to seek
   their removal. The following article tests the utility of these efforts.
   ``Structural{''} coup-proofing such as counterbalancing is expected to
   reduce the ability to organize a coup plot by creating substantial
   coordination obstacles to soldiers. Coup-proofing by spoiling militaries
   with organizational resources is expected to reduce the willingness to
   intervene. However, increased organizational resources are expected to
   increase the army's capabilities, thereby increasing the likelihood of a
   coup's success. The theory is empirically tested using a selection model
   with a global sample from 1961 to 2000. Findings suggest that both
   coup-proofing strategies are effective deterrents of coup activity and,
   more generally, that characteristics of the military appear to be far
   more important than economic influences on coups.},

Abstract = {In a 2008 International Politics article, David Patrick Houghton
   questions the importance of `The Third Debate' in IR theory between
   `positivism and postmodernism' and the relative worth of contrasting
   epistemological positions. Houghton's main argument is that the
   philosophical underpinnings of IR have not been central to what IR
   scholars actually do; specifically, the epistemological differences
   between positivists and postmodernists have little practical effect upon
   their empirical findings. In short, epistemology does not matter. This
   article analyses Houghton's thesis within the context of a dominant
   discourse in the discipline that derides postpositivism and, by
   corollary, rejects methodological pluralism incorporating both
   positivist and postpositivist approaches, what I refer to as
   `epistemethodological pluralism'. This article questions the main
   assumptions underpinning this discourse by deconstructing the definition
   of `postpositivism' that underpins the `naysayer' arguments deriding or
   dismissing epistemological differences between positivism and
   postpositivism. Using examples of positivist and postpositivist research
   that focus on the foreign policy of the United States, European Union
   integration and Middle East politics, the article demonstrates how
   epistemological issues have a significant impact on empirical research
   in International Relations and illustrates the benefits of integrating
   the different epistemological approaches. International Politics (2012)

Abstract = {The dominant portrayal of the policy process around the Common
   Agricultural Policy (CAP) emphasises a system of intergovernmental
   bargaining, close links between institutions and farming interests, and
   compartmentalised closed policy networks. This article considers how
   inter-institutional relationships might be reshaped by the extension of
   `co-decision' powers to the European Parliament in the Lisbon Treaty.
   This raises the possibility that policy proposals and outcomes may
   increasingly reflect the participation of a broader range of actors and
   interests. Using four scenarios that reflect different institutional
   configurations, a preliminary analysis of the 2011 dairy regime
   proposals (the `Milk Package') is used to draw some conclusions about
   whether the agricultural policy agenda is likely to be broadened through
   de-compartmentalisation, leading to a more fluid policy arena
   characterised by more actors with conflicting values. (C) 2012 Policy

Title = {Mitigating Inequalities of Influence among States in Global Decision
   Making},
Journal = {GLOBAL POLICY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {3},
Number = {4},
Pages = {421-432},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {International institutions should be as equal as they claim to be,
   especially since many of them assert superordinate normative authority
   based on having egalitarian governance structures. However, when
   defining equality with respect to states' real-world influence in
   determining substantive outcomes, it is evident that there is an
   equality-influence gap between the rhetoric of parity among states and
   the reality of international politics. This is problematic because it
   undermines trust in those international institutions that falsely claim
   to embody equality among states when empirically they do not. Focusing
   on the United Nations System, this paper identifies three main causes of
   this disproportional influence among states in global decision making:
   (a) external imbalances in political capital; (b) internal economic
   barriers; and (c) surreptitious influence through non-state actors,
   funding and training. Six pragmatic strategies are proposed for
   mitigating these inequalities: (1) building capacity for leadership in
   global advocacy; (2) supporting global networks owned by developing
   countries; (3) equalizing multi-party partnerships; (4) facilitating
   evidence-informed global decision making; (5) enhancing accountability
   and independent evaluation; and (6) encouraging further discussion on
   institutional reforms. Notwithstanding sovereign equality's deep flaws,
   it is hoped that challenging the egalitarian presumptions of global
   decision making will encourage further debate on this issue among those
   who can act upon it.},

Abstract = {Canadian trade and investment in Latin America in the late nineteenth
   and early twentieth centuries, an element of British world hegemony and
   its particular form of free-trade imperialism, laid the groundwork for
   Canada's first independent foreign policy toward Latin America. The
   Canadian state's articulation of its interest in Latin America in the
   1940s was associated with the end of British hegemony and the rise of
   the United States as the new world hegemon. It is apparent that Canada's
   location as a wealthy though politically less powerful nation within the
   core of the capitalist world system dates to the late nineteenth century
   and that Canadian capitalists played a significant role in this
   articulation.},

Title = {Glocal naming and shaming: Toponymic (inter) national relations on Lagos
   and New York's streets},
Journal = {AFRICAN AFFAIRS},

Abstract = {Streets are sites of hegemony and counter-hegemony, of inclusion and
   exclusion, of incorporation and expulsion, and of cooperation or
   conflict. Thus, in the cultural geography of cities, commemorative
   street names are critical sites of social reproduction. Commemorative
   street naming is both an historical referent as well as a spatial
   designation. Recent literature on toponymy calls attention to such
   practices as important cultural and political arenas for understanding
   socio-political processes, but often focuses on the politics and
   sociality of street naming within local, national politics to the
   exclusion of how local politics intersects with international politics.
   This article examines the politics of spatial inscription and the social
   reproduction of `place' or `space' on a street corner in New York City
   named after Kudirat Abiola, an assassinated woman activist in Nigeria,
   and the retaliatory renaming by the military regime of a Lagos street
   hosting the US Embassy after the African American anti-establishment
   activist Louis Farrakhan. Subsequently, the next democratic government
   of Nigeria renamed the street, this time after the US ambassador, the
   African American Walter Carrington. Toponymy, the article concludes, can
   thus be seen as a form of retortion in international relations.},

Abstract = {The national fiscal responses to the economic crisis of 2008/2009 varied
   considerably. Some countries reacted with a strong demand stimulus,
   others intended to slash public expenditures, while a third group
   pursued mildly expansionary policies. There are strong reasons for
   governments to pursue a mildly expansionary policy. If governments
   depart from this default strategy in favor of a significant
   counter-cyclical policy, they must be able to swiftly make decisions.
   Therefore, effective use of counter-cyclical policy will be unlikely in
   cases where lengthy negotiations or significant compromises between
   governing parties with different views on economic and fiscal policy are
   likely. Therefore, a major determinant of the expansionary strategy is a
   unified government, usually in form of a one-party government. If
   governments opt for pro-cyclical policy in a major economic crisis, they
   do so because they have few other viable options. In this situation they
   tend to shift blame to international organizations.},

Abstract = {Using data from the fourth round of the European Social Survey, we
   investigate the determinants of the individual union membership
   decision, focusing on the role of dispositionalas opposed to
   situationalfactors. We argue that the battery of items in Schwartzs
   (1992) theory of basic personal values is relevant in the context of
   unionism and can be used to test the validity of certain elements of
   existing theories. We further claim that the use of basic values in this
   context is an effective way of operationalizing the role of societal
   interests embedded in the rational choice explanations for union
   membership. The econometric workwhich features a three-way outcome
   variable identifying current, former and never-membersreveals that,
   along with socio-demographic, ideological, firm-level and sectoral
   characteristics, basic values are closely related to union membership
   status. While higher self-transcendence and conservation scores are
   associated with a greater likelihood of being a current member, higher
   openness-to-change and self-enhancement scores have the opposite effect.},

Title = {What Drives Entrepreneurial Orientation in the Public Sector? Evidence
   from Germany's Federal Labor Agency},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION RESEARCH AND THEORY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {22},
Number = {4},
Pages = {761-792},

Abstract = {Along with the introduction of private sector management tools, public
   servants are expected to act more entrepreneurially-as public managers.
   However, research lacks quantitative evidence on what drives
   entrepreneurial orientation (EO) in this context. Our article examines
   the antecedents of department-level EO in public sector organizations.
   By integrating different research streams into one study, we combine
   partly opposing discourses. This deductive study develops and
   empirically tests hypotheses on antecedents identified from private
   sector corporate entrepreneurship literature and from the current debate
   on new public management and public value management. It uses data from
   250 middle managers of Germany's Federal Labor Agency to do so. Contrary
   to expectations, the influence of management support, work discretion,
   and resources is only limited. Furthermore, a focus on key performance
   indicators and goal ambiguity does not seem to impede EO. Instead, a
   multitude of expectations, middle managers' localism, and position
   tenure have the greatest impact on department-level EO. As a result,
   this study provides insights into the strong role of antecedents outside
   of administration. The article concludes with a discussion of
   implications for both theory and practice.},

Abstract = {The main question on which this article focuses is this: What conditions
   determine whether a group carrying out protests in Russia is more likely
   to be successful in attracting support by recruiting people to
   participate in its activities and gaining sympathy from many members of
   the population? There is strong agreement among experts on Russian
   society and politics that protests in defense of abstract, general
   rights do not appeal to most citizens. This article focuses on groups
   using protest tactics that have been more successful in gaining support,
   such as the Defenders of the Khimki Forest. The evidence that is
   presented in this article suggests that Russians are more likely to take
   part in protests by an organized group if it seeks remedies for concrete
   problems that directly affect them and their families. The appeal to
   felt needs that are grounded in everyday experiences also seems to be an
   important factor that helps a group to evoke a favorable response toward
   its actions among broad circles of the general public. For those doing
   scholarly research, to interpret the development of civil society in
   Russia mainly in terms of the struggles of human rights groups and
   political opposition movements would lead the researchers to neglect the
   activities of most social organizations in Russia. (C) 2012 The Regents

Abstract = {The financial market crisis put the spotlight on the performance of two
   main German government bodies in financial market policy, the German
   Ministry of Finance (BMF) and the German Supervisory Authority (BaFin).
   The problem of delegation between the BMF as the principal of the agent
   BaFin is the focus of this article. During the crisis a lack of
   personnel in the BMF and the structural asymmetry between BaFin and the
   ministry caused problems in the formulation of crisis policies and in
   the handling of the subordinate authority. However, the crisis showed
   only the tip of an iceberg, because the BMF suffers from fundamental
   deficits in coping with the daily business of financial market policy
   and the control of an agency which gained more autonomy than politically
   intended. The overarching question is whether the BMF or BaFin controls
   German financial market policy. (C) 2012 Policy and Society Associates

Abstract = {Engaging the recent debate on China's assertive foreign policy, we
   suggest that it is normal for China - a rising power - to change its
   policy to a confident or even assertive direction because of its
   transformed national interests. We argue also that it is better to
   understand future US-China relations as a bargaining process. Whereas
   China negotiates for a new status in the system with redefined
   interests, the United States and other countries need to adjust their
   old political practices. China's `core interest' diplomacy launched in
   2009 is the first step in revealing `private information' for peaceful
   bargaining with the outside world. A status quo foreign policy is not a
   wise choice for the United States because of the changing power and
   interest configurations in the international system. International

Abstract = {This main focus of the article is an analysis of Ukraine two decades
   after it became an independent state through ten factors that have
   remained constant features of Ukrainian life. The first factor is low
   public trust in state institutions and the wide gulf between elites and
   state on the one hand and the public on the other. A second factor is
   the striving by political forces to monopolize political and economic
   power for the sake of power and selfenrichment - not for the conducting
   of reforms. The third factor is threats to democracy under eastern
   Ukrainian Presidents Leonid Kuchma and Viktor Yanukovych. The fourth
   factor is the low quality and ideological amorphousness of political
   parties. The fifth factor is the absence of political will and
   re-occurrence of missed opportunities; a prominent example of which is
   the Viktor Yushchenko presidency. The sixth factor is the domination of
   elite greed and rapaciousness over pursuit of the national interest and
   national security. The most egregious example of this corruption is in
   the energy sector which western Ukrainians have dominated (It's a Gas:
   Funny business in the Turkmen-Ukraine Gas Trade, 2006). A seventh
   constant factor is the prevalence of virtual over actual policies and
   the non-fulfillment of domestic obligations which leads to low public
   trust in state institutions. The eighth factor is an imitation of
   integration into Euro-Atlantic structures because virtual policies lead
   to inconsistent and multi-vector foreign policies. Virtual policies make
   it difficult for European and American governments to engage with the
   Ukrainian authorities because they rarely fulfill their obligations. The
   ninth factor is eastern Ukrainian naivety about Russia, regardless of
   whether it is democratic or authoritarian, that pursues hard-nosed
   geopolitical goals, a naivety that applies to Kuchma in 1994 as much as
   to Yanukovych in 2010. The tenth factor, the Russia factor, is Russia's
   inability to accept Ukraine's sovereignty or territorial integrity. Both
   eastern and western Ukrainian have been unable to fashion responsive
   policies to deal with Russia's un-acceptance of Ukraine and its
   hard-nosed geopolitical goals. (C) 2012 The Regents of the University of

Number = {3},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This article seeks to unpack the implications of technocracy for
   contemporary peace-building. It aims to illustrate how the bureaucratic
   imperative explains much about the ascendancy of certain actors to
   positions of prominence on the peace-building landscape, and the types
   of activities that these actors engage in. In line with world polity
   theory, it is interested in the construction and institutionalization of
   discourses, understandings, expectations and practices of
   peace-building. It argues that there has been a `technocratic turn' in
   relation to peace-building, whereby there has been a gradual but
   persistent trend towards the application of technocracy in the framing
   of conflict and approaches to it. Two key claims advanced on behalf of
   technocracy - neutrality and efficiency - are discussed. The article
   then argues that a complex mix of structural and proximate factors have
   reinforced the technocratic turn in peace-building. It concludes by
   considering the extent to which the discursive framing of conflict by
   key actors predetermines their conflict response. The article is
   primarily an exercise in conceptual scoping, though it can also be read
   as a contribution to the critique of the liberal peace and
   considerations of resistance and agency in peace-building contexts.},

Journal = {POLICY AND SOCIETY},

Abstract = {A survey of agency chief executives in Hong Kong found that they
   perceive themselves to have high levels of policy autonomy. This could
   be interpreted in two ways: either that agency chiefs perceive they can
   exert power over their `principals' through taking advantage of
   information asymmetries and by adopting other stratagems to evade
   supervision; or that they feel they possess influence through mutually
   supportive participation in policy-making with their supervising bureau
   officials and principal officials (or `ministers'). The institutional
   context of Hong Kong's administrative state, in particular the
   integrated and inclusive nature of the civil service career system; the
   absence of an elected political leadership; and the key representational
   roles played by various boards and panels associated with agencies,
   makes the second interpretation more plausible. In support of this
   argument, evidence is drawn from interviews with senior officials in
   seven Hong Kong agencies, supported by case study material. We find
   evidence of a number of aspects of the policy roles of agencies which
   are mutually agreed, rational adaptations to this institutional context,
   such as partitioning the policy field (when the political executive and
   the supervising policy bureau formally or informally vacate part of the
   policy field and delegate it to the agency); filling a policy vacuum
   (when the political executive voluntarily vacates the field altogether);
   and acting in a segmented policy process (when agencies are allowed to
   take the lead in agenda-setting and/or exercise high levels of
   flexibility and adaptability in the implementation process). These
   features of relations between agencies, policy bureaus and the political
   executive are not the product of principal agent conflict but of mutual
   cooperation and adaptation. (C) 2012 Policy and Society Associates

Year = {2012},
Volume = {43},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {And what if the opinion of the richest were always the best one ? The
   breaking down of Fort-Lamy Consensus makes true such a paraphrase of the
   French writer La Fontaine. This article analyses the CEMAC sub-region as
   a sphere of power relations determined by the wealth of the hegemon. The
   recent enrichment of one of the CEMAC member states has implied a change
   of the whole sub-region. This tendency of relating power position to the
   wealth can give way to hegemonic war, since the tentative efforts to
   modify the aspect of the power sharing by the rising hegemon oppose the
   latter to the outgoing hegemon. As far as CEMAC case is concerned, the
   war hasn't occurred like Gilpin put it in his theory of hegemonic
   change. Yet, one can consider that there is a strong link between the
   regional integration process conducive to peace, and the struggle for
   power authorized by the change of wealth from one state to another.
   Therefore, these two aspects are at the core of entities like regional
   and sub-regional organizations.},

Abstract = {In the last years, and due to the continuous decentralization programs
   to regions and provinces that have undermined the transformation over
   the national States, in Argentina in particular, and in Latin America in
   general, the governance approaches have converged with those on regional
   development to redefine in a more democratic, more efficient and
   horizontal way, the regional dynamics of economic and productive actors
   and of regional productive systems. In this context, the aim of this
   paper is to critically revise the regional governance approach in the
   light of the following research questions: to what extend can regional
   governance institutions be seen as central elements for regional
   development process? What ``scales{''} are necessary to be articulated
   in a regional development process? Is still there a role for the
   national State in the coordination of regional economic actors?
   This work proposes to focus on two key weaknesses of this regional
   governance approach: first, the lack of attention paid to scales
   articulation in regional development strategies (local, regional,
   national and international); and second, the limited and fuzzy attention
   paid to asymmetries among firms and institutions in regional production
   systems and their consequences for regional development. This debate
   takes shape also by describing the weaknesses mentioned on regional
   governance approaches in a case study in Argentina related to
   agriculture machinery production, which has been awarded by financial
   support based on the idea of regional governance dynamics. As a result
   of the analysis, a series of suggestions and propositions emerges for
   policy makers related to regional development.},

Abstract = {Territorial self-determination and global distributive justice seem to
   be at loggerheads. Cosmopolitans hold that institutions such as states
   can be justified only derivatively on global justice. But
   self-determinists insist that territorial self-determination is
   independently significant. The current article hypothesizes that the
   core disagreement is not over the justification of global resource
   egalitarianism, but rather over the conception of resources per se. The
   article presents three conceptions of resources the familiar natural
   resources conception, Tim Hayward's physical conception and Ronald
   Dworkin's constructivist conception and argues that, particularly when
   appended to egalitarian global distribution principles, each is
   importantly flawed. The article then presents and defends an intentional
   conception of resources as fungible means. This account treats resources
   as intentional kinds rather than natural kinds. As such, they can be
   identified only after discerning whose intentional states are decisive
   in a given case. Discerning that is the role of a theory of territorial
   rights. A resource is such when the morally legitimate territorial
   right-holder treats it as a fungible means. The theory of territorial
   rights is universal, and the resource distribution principle is morally
   cosmopolitan; but the determination of what counts as a resource is
   claimant-relative, respecting self-determination. The article then works
   out implications for global justice, with special attention to the
   global environment and through comparisons with Hayward's eco-space
   egalitarianism. The result is a sketch of a unified theory of global
   resource justice, giving due weight to both cosmopolitan egalitarianism
   and to territorial self-determination.},

Abstract = {There are good security and political economy reasons for furthering
   integration towards a world political community (WPC), possibly assuming
   the form of a world state. However, would these reasons provide a
   legitimate and sustainable basis for the WPC? It is argued in this
   article that, while the standard security-military and functionalist
   political economy arguments for world unification may work to a certain
   point, they are insufficient and may become counterproductive.
   Especially if perceived in terms of rationally calculative orientation
   of action, they are not enough and may even work against the WPC. There
   must also be a belief in normative legitimacy, which may be anchored in
   universal principles such as popular democracy and human rights. In this
   light, theories of civilizing process and stages of ethico-political
   learning are explored. Collective human learning not only explains the
   quest for democratization but also points towards cosmopolitan
   ethico-political sentiments. However, there is an internal relationship
   between democracy and identity, and identities tend to be particular.
   The case is made, first, for thinking that the otherness of one's
   narrated `self' can be located either in the past or, alternatively, in
   our contemporary being, when seen from a point of view of a possible
   future position in world history. Second, within a higher level
   identity-in-difference, a co-constitutive and mutually transformative
   relation between self and others can involve letting many differences
   just be.},

Abstract = {Evidence suggests that our foraging ancestors engaged in the small-scale
   equivalent of social insurance as an essential tool of survival and
   evolved a sophisticated psychology of social exchange (involving the
   social emotions of compassion and anger) to regulate mutual assistance.
   Here, we hypothesize that political support for modern welfare policies
   are shaped by these evolved mental programs. In particular, the
   compassionate motivation to share with needy nonfamily could not have
   evolved without defenses against opportunists inclined to take without
   contributing. Cognitively, such parasitic strategies can be identified
   by the intentional avoidance of productive effort. When detected, this
   pattern should trigger anger and down-regulate support for assistance.
   We tested predictions derived from these hypotheses in four studies in
   two cultures, showing that subjects' perceptions of recipients' effort
   to find work drive welfare opinions; that such perceptions (and not
   related perceptions) regulate compassion and anger (and not related
   emotions); that the effects of perceptions of recipients' effort on
   opinions about welfare are mediated by anger and compassion,
   independently of political ideology; and that these emotions not only
   influence the content of welfare opinions but also how easily they are
   formed.},

Abstract = {The success of practitioner involvement in a policy consultation process
   is usually taken to be evident in the extent to which the resulting
   policy document is shaped by their views. Taking as its case study a
   public consultation for a new Scottish mental health policy, and drawing
   on theories of knowledge, this paper finds that for practitioner
   involvement in this consultation it is not possible to measure impact in
   this way. This is because the experiential and verbal knowledge of
   practitioners is not easily transferable through the different stages of
   the consultation process and into the final policy document. Instead,
   another significant effect resulting from practitioner involvement in
   the consultation is identified. Practitioner participation in the
   consultation is found to be a productive process of learning or
   education which produces a policy community more aware of its role in
   relation to the new policy. (C) 2012 Policy and Society Associates

Abstract = {The authors consider a two-period game of conflict between two factions,
   which have a desire for revenge. It is shown that, in contrast to
   conventional wisdom, the desire for revenge need not lead to escalation
   of the conflict. The subgame-perfect equilibrium is characterized by two
   effects: a value of revenge effect (i.e., the benefit of exacting
   revenge) and a self-deterrence effect (i.e., the fear of an opponent's
   desire to exact revenge). The authors construct examples where the
   equilibrium is such that the self-deterrence effect paradoxically
   outweighs the value effect and thereby decreases the factions' aggregate
   effort below the level exerted in the no-revenge case. This paradox of
   revenge is more likely, the more elastically the benefit of revenge
   reacts to the destruction suffered in the past and the more asymmetric
   is the conflict. The authors discuss the implications of
   revenge-dependent preferences for welfare economics, evolutionary
   stability, and their strategic value as commitment devices.},

Abstract = {For the past three centuries, Great Britain and the United States have
   stood in succession at the apex of the international hierarchy of power.
   They have been on the winning side of every systemic conflict in this
   period, from the War of the Spanish Succession to the Cold War. As a
   result, they have been able to influence the political and economic
   development of states around the world. In many of their colonies,
   conquests, and clients, they have propagated ideals and institutions
   conducive to democratization. At the same time, they have defeated
   numerous rivals whose success would have had ruinous consequences for
   democracy. The global spread of democracy, therefore, has been
   endogenous to the game of great power politics.},

Abstract = {This article explores institutional change and the role of ideas in
   Finnish public sector reform from the late 1970s to 2007. The main
   purpose of the study is to explore the ideas advanced in favour of
   legislative reforms - what have been the objectives behind them and to
   what extent have the objectives and arguments changed. The analysis
   illustrates that there have been ideational changes behind the public
   sector reforms and that they have served as policy blueprints,
   ideological weapons and cognitive locks. The article shows that ideas
   are an important locus of policy development and a source of
   institutional change.},

Abstract = {Hooghe and Marks recently introduced a new research agenda for the study
   of European integration focusing on politicisation, that is, the
   inclusion of mass public attitudes in the politics of European
   integration. The overall aim of this article is to respond to this new
   research agenda. Unlike the existing literature, which focuses on
   Euro-sceptical extreme left or right-wing parties, the article argues
   that the explanation for politicisation or the lack of it should be
   found in the incentives the issue offers for mainstream political
   parties. Denmark serves as a crucial case study to show the limitations
   of the existing literature and the need to focus on the incentives of
   mainstream political parties. Empirically, the article argues that
   expectations about the impending politicisation of European integration
   are misplaced. The giant is fast asleep because those who could wake it
   up generally have no incentive to do so and those who have an incentive
   cannot.},

Title = {Improvement of the Quality of Public Policies to Restore the Trust in
   Government},
Journal = {REVISTA DEL CLAD REFORMA Y DEMOCRACIA},
Year = {2012},

Abstract = {Different studies show that the trust in public institutions in Latin
   America is, on average, the lowest in the world. More effective public
   policies are needed to restore it, allowing for the delivery of better
   results to the citizenship.
   This study defines public policies as courses of action to reach
   objectives of public interest that are implemented, evaluated and
   improved, if needed. These courses of action are not entirely rational
   processes. As a matter of fact, they are highly dependent on strong
   political influences that need to find equilibrium with the technical
   knowledge needed for their formulation and implementation.
   The goal of this article is to contribute to the debate on the
   improvement of policy-making and implementation of public policies'
   processes in Latin America. Its content is structured into: i) analysis
   of the main challenges that the governments of the region face in the
   policy cycle; and the presentation of ideas to improve the policy cycle
   based on the experience of six OECD countries (United Kingdom, Canada,
   Spain, United States, France and New Zealand).
   As many other regions in the world, Latin America is facing the
   challenge of transforming public policies' goals and objectives in
   programs designed and implemented with sufficient technical thoroughness
   to achieve these goals. The relationship between the three main actors
   of this process (citizens, public administration and political
   authorities) is conducted in a context that reflects a disconnect
   between political proposals and programs' results, low levels of trust
   in public institutions as well as radical and sudden changes in the
   direction of the policies formulated and implemented.
   The countries of the region face, at least, five key challenges: i) lack
   of technical capacity in the center of government for policy-making and
   policy evaluation; insufficient coordination between sectorial policies,
   which leads to inconsistencies and incoherencies; iii) low levels of
   contestability during the formulation of policies in the system (within
   the executive branch, from the legislative power and also from spheres
   outside the public sector); iv) a disconnect between policy-making and
   policy implementation; and v) even if politics has a strong influence on
   policy-making in all countries of the world, there is a considerable
   distance among different political parties' proposals in Latin America
   in comparison with the traditional countries of the OECD (Mexico and
   Chile, members of OECD, are considered only as Latin American countries
   for the purposes of this study).
   As alternatives to face these problems from an institutional point of
   view, this study presents six ideas identified by the common experience
   of the OECD countries analyzed.},

Abstract = {The contemporary American counterinsurgency discourse has emphasised a
   particular historical narrative of Vietnam to justify large-scale
   military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Absent from this narrative
   is any reference to the broader Cold War context in which Vietnam
   existed alongside numerous other small-scale counterinsurgencies and was
   therefore the exception, not the rule. This article seeks to redress
   this shortcoming by examining the way counterinsurgency was conceived
   and managed at the level of `grand strategy.' Specifically, it focuses
   on the Special Group (Counterinsurgency) to demonstrate that senior
   policymakers under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson understood
   `counterinsurgency' as involving `indirect' assistance to foreign
   governments, rather than taking `direct' military action with American
   ground forces.},

Abstract = {The emergence of participatory institutions in Latin America is today an
   established phenomenon and has generated a vast corpus of literature.
   Among all the participatory mechanisms that have recently been
   incorporated, participatory budgeting appears to be the one that has
   received the greatest attention. Since its introduction in Porto Alegre,
   participatory budgeting has become world famous and has been exported to
   other parts of Brazil, Latin America and Europe. Participatory
   budgeting, however, is not the only available form of institutionalized
   participation in Latin America. Policy councils in the areas of health
   and social assistance have thrived in Brazil and today involve tens of
   thousands of participants. Participatory planning in cities was greatly
   enhanced after the creation of the Ministry of Cities and today takes
   place in more than a 1000 cities in Brazil. This article analyzes
   participation in Brazil in the light of its different designs. Our aim
   is to de-center the debate on participation from participatory budgeting
   and argue for the relevance of context in decision-making and
   participation.},

Abstract = {Ten years after 9/11, and after the death of Osama bin Laden, this
   article re-examines the early history of Al Qaeda-from its founding in
   August 1988 up until bin Laden's declaration of war against the United
   States in Afghanistan in 1996-by examining the group's aims, operations,
   alliances, finances, and administration during five distinct phases of
   the evolution of bin Laden's worldview. The authors argue that in
   assessing the formative years of bin Laden's organization, it is equally
   wrong to minimize the ambitions and organization of the early Al Qaeda
   as it is to telescope back from the Al Qaeda of the 9/11 attacks to
   argue that the group was organizing itself to wage a global Jihad from
   its inception. The authors outline how it was only a half decade
   later-after the group had decamped to Sudan, and after the U. S. had
   deployed troops in Saudi Arabia and Somalia-that al Qaeda shifted to
   conceiving its central mission as attacking American targets.},

Journal = {SOUTH EUROPEAN SOCIETY AND POLITICS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {17},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {295-307},
Abstract = {The chief characteristic of this election was the significant rise in
   abstention, suggesting citizens' disengagement. The loss of influence of
   political parties is related to a long-term cumulative effect of
   disappointment arising from missed opportunities, including Cyprus's
   entry into the EuropeanUnion and domestic shifts in power. Political
   leaders failed to secure expected benefits and offer new prospects that
   could mobilise and sustain participation. The article examines the
   background, the campaign and the results of the 2011 parliamentary
   election and refers to the potential impact on resolution of the Cyprus
   question.},

   ASSESSMENT},
Journal = {PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {90},
Number = {1},
Pages = {19-36},
Abstract = {This article examines the institutional, political and regulatory
   dimensions of environmental assessment (EA) processes. While EA is most
   often conceptualized as a regulatory instrument, this article contends
   that viewing EA in this narrow fashion obscures the broader implications
   and significance of EA as a distinct form of governance. When conceived
   as a mode of governance, EA varies considerably in terms of the key
   governance characteristics emphasized in this symposium. The empirical
   evidence rests upon three cases studies looking at very different
   multi-level governance contexts: the Tamar Valley Pulp Mill in
   Australia, the Whites Point Quarry in Canada, and the Bystroe Canal
   Project in the Ukraine. The case study analysis identifies large
   variations in the institutional, political and regulatory form that EAs
   take, indicating that approaches identifying EA as a form of New
   Governance are overly simplistic. The analysis also points to the
   multi-directional influence of different governance dimensions. The
   insights derived from the use of the three dimensional framework
   validate its value as an analytical tool.},

   from veto to proposition},
Journal = {REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE POLITICA INTERNACIONAL},

Volume = {55},

Pages = {144-169},
Abstract = {This article describes the Brazilian position on forests and climate
   change from 1997 to 2012. It argues that it has evolved from a veto,
   which excluded from the climate change regime emissions from the
   conversion of native forests, to a proposition, as Brazil offered its
   approach to the international community. It explains the change with
   domestic developments: governance over deforestation, the emergence of
   new and relevant actors, and presidential diplomacy.},

Title = {Micro-Level Interpretation of Exponential Random Graph Models with
   Application to Estuary Networks},
Journal = {POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {40},
Number = {3},
Pages = {402-434},
Abstract = {The exponential random graph model (ERGM) is an increasingly popular
   method for the statistical analysis of networks that can be used to
   flexibly analyze the processes by which policy actors organize into a
   network. Often times, interpretation of ERGM results is conducted at the
   network level, such that effects are related to overall frequencies of
   network structures (e.g., the number of closed triangles in a network).
   This limits the utility of the ERGM because there is often interest,
   particularly in political and policy sciences, in network dynamics at
   the actor or relationship levels. Micro-level interpretation of the ERGM
   has been employed in varied applications in sociology and statistics. We
   present a comprehensive framework for interpretation of the ERGM at all
   levels of analysis, which casts network formation as block-wise updating
   of a network. These blocks can represent, for example, each potential
   link, each dyad, the out- or in-going ties of each actor, or the entire
   network. We contrast this interpretive framework with the stochastic
   actor-based model (SABM) of network dynamics. We present the theoretical
   differences between the ERGM and the SABM and introduce an approach to
   comparing the models when theory is not sufficiently strong to make the
   selection a priori. The alternative models we discuss and the
   interpretation methods we propose are illustrated on previously
   published data on estuary policy and governance networks.},

Abstract = {While there is considerable amount of literature examining how and why
   American federal and state governments look for information and ideas,
   there is considerably less knowledge of how these processes operate at
   the local level. This is particularly true in the case of how ideas
   related to sustainable water management policies are found and used by
   local governments. This article attempts to open this area by examining
   where, how and to what purpose local agents engage in the transfer of
   low-impact development policies and techniques. This article is
   organised around four questions: (1) Is there a basic agreement about
   the pioneers in stormwater management; (2) Where did agents gather
   information; (3) Did this involve complex understanding; and (4) What
   emerged as key obstacles to the transfer and learning processes amongst
   the local authorities involved in this study?},

Volume = {10},
Pages = {97-117},
Abstract = {Purpose - Conflict models in international relations, particularly
   foreign policy decision-making models, have relied extensively upon the
   logic and explanatory power of rational choice theories. These models
   suggest that actors select a strategy, or foreign policy, that will
   maximize expected utility given the information available at the time
   and the beliefs about the state of the international system. However,
   prospect theory has shown us that context during conflict matters and
   evolutionary theory, supported by biopolitical science, has revealed how
   individual characteristics, and human nature in general, influence the
   decision-making process. Through these approaches, we can begin to
   understand that a comprehensive model of foreign policy analysis (FPA)
   requires an examination of how human behavioral traits are affected by
   different conflict scenarios, such as a context of ambiguity and risk as
   opposed to one of certainty.
   Approach - Drawing from recent neuroscience findings and taking a life
   sciences approach, this chapter seeks to challenge the rational choice
   theories of FPA by constructing a model of international conflict
   inclusive of a neural theory of decision-making.
   Findings - With a model founded on an evolutionary analysis and a neural
   theory of decision-making, we can begin to better understand not only
   the causes of war and deterrence failures, but also the frequency and
   intensity of genocide and ethnic conflict in the international system.
   Originality/value - Recent advances and technological breakthroughs in
   the fields of behavioral genetics and social neuroscience have revealed
   a plethora of new information valuable to the study of international
   conflict that shed light on brain-behavior processes within different
   decision-making contexts.},

Abstract = {Governance scholars have demonstrated that the agendas, discourses, and
   actions of global civil society groups are affected by powerful states.
   In neoliberal globalisation, powerful states push for market-based
   schemes to resolve global environmental problems, and civil society
   groups often contribute to that agenda. Through the lens of
   governmentality, scholars have shown how civil society acts in ways that
   relegitimise and sustain state power/influence at the global scale. This
   study illustrates how international environmental non-governmental
   organisations operating in the Montreal Protocol contribute to the
   neoliberalisation of ozone governance, in some cases changing tactics to
   fit the neoliberal discourse of the treaty. Consequently, some
   international environmental non-governmental organisations have recently
   abandoned discourses of global environmental health, global security,
   and general welfare to address neoliberal concerns of individualism,
   competition, and transparency in ozone politics.},

Title = {The Geography and Political Context of Human Rights Education: Israel as
   a Case Study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Pages = {384-404},
Abstract = {Studies have shown that human rights education (HRE) can help promote
   democracy and social progress by empowering individuals and groups and
   pushing governments to fulfill their obligations towards residents.
   Assuming that such assessments are accurate, I argue that the successful
   application of human rights education requires much more than what is
   generally discussed in the scholarly literature: adjustments to
   curriculum, additional resources, and adequate teacher training
   programs. Using Israel as a case study, I show that despite government
   investment in human rights education, the majority of Jewish youth still
   do not believe that Palestinian citizens of Israel should enjoy equal
   rights. This, I maintain, is because other forces, both structural and
   subjective, always hinder the individual and institutional
   internalization of HRE's basic precepts. Next, I describe the almost
   complete segregation among Jews and Palestinians in the educational
   system as well as the centrality of a hyper-ethno-nationalist ideology,
   and argue that the specific spatial and political context within which
   the educational process takes place helps determine to what extent human
   rights education is successful in promoting the values and practices
   associated with tolerance, respect, and protection of rights. I conclude
   by offering an example of an alternative desegregated pedagogical model
   that tries to provide meaningful human rights education.},

Abstract = {In January 2009 the Consultative Group on the Past released its report
   of recommendations for Northern Ireland to address its legacy of
   conflict. The two main recommendations were the Legacy Commission,
   designed to investigate and uncover information on some of the most
   high-profile incidents of the Troubles, and the recommendation that
   families of those who lost their lives to sectarian violence be awarded
   a recognition payment of 12,000 pound. The proposals, especially the
   payment, created a firestorm of controversy and much acrimony. This
   paper examines whether the role of procedural justice can help to
   determine why the efforts of the Consultative Group have generated such
   controversy and whether this latest attempt to address transitional
   justice in Northern Ireland has any chance of success.},

Journal = {STUDIES IN CONFLICT \& TERRORISM},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {35},

Abstract = {This article evaluates U.S. perception of and response to Al Qaeda in
   the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) operating in Yemen. It evaluates the
   empirical evidence on which the present understanding of the group is
   based, the implications of the sociopolitical context in which it
   operates, and the uneasy position of the Yemeni government in the War
   against Terror as it has been affected by U.S. policy from the early
   1990s to the present. In the contested Yemeni state, AQAP is competing
   for political legitimacy and is increasingly dependent on public
   support. The U.S. kill-or-capture response, the ``on-off{''} nature of
   its support that has made Yemen vulnerable to the influence of Al Qaeda
   in the past, and the actions of the Yemeni government itself, which
   depends on the continued existence of the threat to secure financial
   support vital for political survival, means that none of the measures
   being taken has the potential to defeat AQAP.},

Abstract = {Assessing the changing role of the emerging powers in global climate
   change negotiations, with special attention to Brazil, we ask why they
   have agreed to voluntary reductions at home without formalising those
   commitments in ways that might persuade other large emitters to make
   similar binding commitments. We argue that for very large emitters, the
   climate issue does not evince the `global commons' logic often
   attributed to it. Instead, since their actions can directly affect
   climate outcomes alone or in small groupings, large emitters are more
   responsive to domestic cost-benefit calculations, making international
   commitments based on shifting interest group pressures at home. In
   Brazil, a coalition of `Baptists and bootleggers' found principled and
   interest-driven reasons to support new climate commitments after 2007.},

Journal = {STUDIES IN CONFLICT \& TERRORISM},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {35},
Number = {11},
Pages = {810-830},
Abstract = {Terrorist groups strive to balance efficiency with their need for
   security. This article examines the factors that affect a group's choice
   of organizational structure. I classify 254 groups from the Global
   Terrorism Database into one of four basic structures: market,
   all-channel, hub-spoke, or bureaucracy. The results of a multinomial
   logistic regression reveal that as secret organizations, terrorist
   groups are not just driven by achieving efficiencies in their
   organization but rather by protecting against infiltration and threats.
   Internal factors such as target selection, operational pace, ideology,
   and stated goals shape a group's structure. External environmental
   factors such as political rights, civil liberties, polity durability,
   and state wealth also help shape a group's structure.},

Abstract = {In the current times of economic turmoil, many sectors are thought to be
   in need of structural reform or system overhauls, which call for
   political leadership, decisiveness and vision. These kinds of challenges
   present governments with a dilemma. On the one hand, there is a call for
   radical change while, on the other hand, the options available for such
   radical change are limited by the many interdependencies of a network
   society. In this article, we analyse three fundamental and structural
   reforms in Dutch housing. These reforms were all implemented in a world
   of interdependencies. The strategies applied appear to be a mixture of
   unilateral, hierarchical strategies and multilateral, network
   strategies. These hybrid strategies come in three forms: (1) a
   combination of hierarchical and network strategies; (2)
   variations/alternations over time between network strategies and
   hierarchical strategies; and (3) the use of one strategy in the
   frontstage while the other strategy is being used backstage. Greater
   understanding of these types of hybrids can help governments in dealing
   with the tension between interdependencies and the need for change.},

Abstract = {This article reviews the development of European Union (EU) Studies from
   a comparative perspective to explain why and how scholarship on the EU
   has changed over time. In particular, this work strives to explain the
   shift away from a US-centered field of research focused on a few core
   theoretical concepts to an academic field toward an increasing level of
   scholarship by European academics on across an extremely broad variety
   of topics. The core explanation is that as the EU has evolved toward an
   increasingly `state like' entity scholarship focused on the EU has
   evolved as well. The evolution has led the field of EU studies to
   resemble much more closely other state focused fields such as American
   or French politics, suggesting a normalization of the EU and EU studies.},

Journal = {POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {33},
Number = {3},
Pages = {249-262},
Abstract = {The `Big Society' is a key policy driver for the new UK Government. It
   is an agenda which purports to re-establish the relationship between the
   state and civil society, raising important questions for social policy.
   Driving this agenda is a focus on a reduced role for government, based
   on the notion that local communities and organisations are best placed
   to identify and respond to local needs. The voluntary and community
   sector (VCS) is posited as having a key role to play in this and the
   article looks at the particular case of faith-based organisations
   (FBOs), drawing on empirical work in Oxfordshire. Reflecting research
   findings, the article identifies opportunities for FBOs framed in the
   overarching promise of the Big Society to harness and support the
   potential of local responses to community needs. At the same time, key
   challenges are identified in relation to how the policy agenda will be
   implemented in reality. Specifically, policy makers face a dilemma in
   relation to, on the one hand maintaining standards of delivery and
   promoting social justice, and on the other protecting the
   characteristics which enable VCS organisations generally, and FBOs in
   particular, to meet the needs of their local community effectively in
   ways they feel are appropriate.},

Journal = {LATIN AMERICAN PERSPECTIVES},

Volume = {39},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Is the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia-Ejercito del
   Pueblo {[}Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia-People's Army]) merely
   a terrorist organization involved in narcotrafficking and the predatory
   tactics of survival, or does it represent a legitimate political
   movement or alternative? Should the Colombian left sever any ties to the
   FARC, or should it attempt to integrate it into the political process?
   These questions are particularly salient now because the political left
   in Colombia is arguably emergent, whereas the FARC's military strength
   has been eroded by the vigorous military and political attacks of the
   Uribe administration and its tactics have made it an unattractive
   political option.},

Title = {Towards an English narrative of democracy?},
Journal = {POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {33},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {173-191},
Abstract = {This article explores the opportunity for, and some of the political,
   ideological and institutional impediments to, the articulation of an
   English narrative of democracy. Such a narrative would locate an
   understanding of recent developments in the politics, governance and
   political economy of England within the much broader and challenging
   framework of the political history of England, and in particular the
   English tradition of radical thinking and political movements. On the
   one hand, this article identifies potential for the development of an
   English narrative in the recent scholarship of historians, and the
   growing evidence of popular support for a political and institutional
   expression of English identity. On the other hand, this article
   identifies the two greatest obstacles to the development of an English
   narrative as the tradition of British modernisation, which has been the
   dominant political narrative during the twentieth-century British
   politics, and the absence of political imagination about democracy,
   citizenship and England among the British political elite. The
   conclusion drawn is that an English narrative of democracy could help
   provide a fair and just settlement for England, but major ideological
   and institutional impediments remain to its development.},

Journal = {CRITICAL POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {6},
Number = {2},
Pages = {182-200},
Abstract = {In this article we re-examine the epistemological basis for claims to
   `best evidence' and `best practice' in policy studies by tracing these
   to a Popperian model of theory development and testing. This model
   outlines how only scientific explanations that survive repeated testing
   count as good theory. Yet repeated testing (replication) is scarce
   across the social sciences - this is the `replication problem'. More
   specifically, the lack of replications in policy studies undermines the
   epistemological basis for policy transfer based on `best practice' and
   `best evidence'. To resolve this, we offer an innovative explanation of
   the replication problem drawing on Foucault's concept of Episteme. In
   doing so, we outline two respectively different accounts of replication:
   `scientific project,' and `aesthetic object.' The latter offers
   alternative bases from which to pursue `best practice' and `best
   evidence'.},

Booktitle = {PANORAMA OF GLOBAL SECURITY ENVIRONMENT - 2012},

Abstract = {Over the past years, defence spending by some NATO's member nations has
   shrunk. While the world is changing, NATO's essential mission will
   remain the same: to ensure that the Alliance remains an unparalleled
   community of freedom, peace, security and shared values. How to survive
   austerity, minimise impact of cuts and ensure effectiveness of the
   Alliance? By Smart Defence. Crisis makes cooperation between nations no
   longer a choice, it is a necessity. It is also a way how NATO can help
   nations to build greater security with their resources but with more
   coordination and coherence, so that together they can avoid the
   financial crisis from becoming a security crisis. Because security is
   also about military capabilities that allows governments to defend their
   populations against new threats and possibly to engage in crisis
   management. NATO's role is to set the strategic direction, to identify
   possible areas of cooperation. There are three ways this can be
   achieved: to pool and share capabilities, to set the right priorities,
   and to better coordinate efforts. Smart Defence, one of the main topics
   at NATO's Chicago summit in in May, 2012 represents a new culture of
   cooperation. It is the chance how to invest enough and together under
   NATO projects (Connected Forces Initiative, NATO Forces 2020), to better
   prepare for the future.},

Pages = {412-431},
Abstract = {Exponential increases in material and energy use globally threaten Earth
   System stability inmany ways including through climate change. Yet
   societies remain committed to economic growth, reflected in the way
   publicly traded corporations are legally obliged to maximise
   shareholders' profits. In contrast, businesses governed cooperatively by
   members, i.e. democratically and transparently, may be better suited to
   operating in an ecologically sustainable way, enacting their members'
   ethical commitments. Combining a complex adaptive systems approach with
   community economies theory, we argue that cooperatives offer a
   significant transformative opportunity to resocialise and repoliticise
   economies away from the growth imperative. Cooperative governance is
   consistent enough with currently dominant neoliberal governance (itself
   closely aligned with economic growth) to gain initial policy traction.
   Ultimately, we seek an overall shift to a stable-state economy - a
   global economy whose operation sustains rather than threatens the
   familiar (to humans and our civilisations) stable state of the Earth
   System.},

Abstract = {Almost a decade after its creation, and despite its unequivocal status
   as a force in Russian party politics, United Russia has received
   relatively little direct research. For a number of reasons, a
   comparative approach seems a logical next step, with what may be termed
   a `dominant-party framework' as an obvious choice to guide further
   research. While recent literature has focused on United Russia's
   development in the regions, providing valuable clues as to how dominant
   parties are formed, this article assesses the ability of the
   dominant-party framework to elaborate the kind of functions the party
   perfonns. This article argues that any exploration of party dominance in
   Russia that focuses solely on the party system as the unit of analysis
   misses important differences that exist between dominant parties and
   risks conflating party system dominance with political system dominance.
   By engaging with the party as the unit of analysis, in particular party
   origins, we gain a fuller appreciation of United Russia's brand of
   `weak' dominance, as well as some of the challenges for comparative
   research in the future.},

Abstract = {There is considerable cross-national variation in the patterns of
   adoption and implementation of policies designed to mitigate climate
   change. The sources of this variation are considered. International
   relations, economic structures, national cultures and domestic political
   competition are factors, often in interaction one with another. In
   situations of multilevel governance, sub-national actors may be
   significant. Grassroots activism from without the formal political
   process has sometimes been critical in sharpening the focus of formal
   political actors, and increasing their willingness to act. Climate
   change is a global issue, but the political action necessary to address
   it is inevitably local and national as well as international.},

Abstract = {The French-speaking minority within the Italian part of the Alpine
   region has been politically mobilized since the beginning of the
   twentieth century. The party politics of the Aosta Valley region have
   been traditionally shaped on the ethno-linguistic, rural-urban and
   centreperiphery cleavages. The main minority nationalist party claiming
   to represent the Frenchspeaking community of the region is the Union
   Valdotaine (UV). This paper aims to explore the role of the main
   political actor of this Alpine region, the UV. The UV's ideological
   positions will be analysed, and also its responses to the external
   pressures that the party is currently facing: gaining political
   representation, immigration, and the processes of European integration
   and of regionalization of the Italian state. On the basis of an analysis
   of party manifestos, this paper will argue that the UV has strategically
   employed identity issues to secure its political survival.},

Abstract = {The surge in mass casualty terror attacks during the first decade of the
   21st century presented a special challenge for health organizations.
   Unique types of injury resulting from these Mass Casualty Events called
   for special capabilities to restore the balance between immediate
   demands and scarce resources. Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), to
   both victims and healthcare providers and first responders required
   extra knowledge and early intervention. All these and the concerns of
   the possibilities of non-conventional weapons terror attacks, led to the
   defining of ``Terror Medicine{''}, a new medical field. This field
   evolves the medical macro management of terror attacks, the focused
   clinical management of the specific injuries and coping with the
   aftermath consequences. The scope of Terror Medicine is: Prevention,
   Preparedness, Response and Recovery. The evolution and trends of Terror
   Medicine is discussed in this article.},

Abstract = {Support of the United Nations (UN) has constituted a constant of
   Norwegian foreign policy since the Second World War. Traditionally,
   Norwegian politicians have used one short standard sentence to sum up
   their UN policy: ``The United Nations is a cornerstone of Norwegian
   foreign policy.{''} This article examines the role and function of this
   alleged cornerstone in the period 1970 to 2005, arguing that the ``UN
   cornerstone{''} played the combined role of foundation and ornament in
   Norwegian foreign policy. The article is in three parts: first, a
   presentation of the main principles in the Norwegian government's view
   of the UN's role in international politics. Second, a discussion of some
   fundamental tensions of Norwegian UN policy within three policy fields:
   security policy, economic policy and social and humanitarian policy.
   Finally, three main trends of Norwegian UN policy between 1970 and 2005
   are identified: a more selective use of the UN; downscaled ambitions for
   the UN; and a ``softer{''} Norwegian profile in the world organization,
   more focused on social and humanitarian matters.},

   China},
Journal = {INTERNASJONAL POLITIKK},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {70},

Abstract = {In the academic literature on diplomacy, where the field has been
   demarcated by a central distinction drawn between suzerain and
   parity-based state relations, Imperial China has squarely been
   designated to the former category, and thereby as inherently alien to
   the diplomatic tradition. However, this image of a monolithic
   2000-year-long rigid, hierarchical system betrays too shallow an
   assessment of Chinese history, and fails to acknowledge a noteworthy
   strain of parity-based relations running through Imperial Chinese
   foreign policy. This strain was at its most pronounced during the four
   centuries of the Song Dynasty, when China's relations with a set of
   important neighbouring states were handled on egalitarian terms far more
   reminiscent of a full-fledged diplomatic multi-state system than is
   popularly acknowledged. Based on a case study of the diplomatic
   relations of the Song Dynasty, this article argues that Imperial Chinese
   foreign policy on a set of occasions showed itself to adhere to
   principles immanent to classical diplomacy, and that these eras should
   thus naturally, and beneficially, belong to the historical canon of
   diplomacy.},

Abstract = {We present a new dataset on decision-making in the European Union
   (DEUII) that revises and expands a previous dataset. Researchers are
   using this new dataset to address a range of research questions
   regarding the inputs, processes and outputs of the EU's legislative
   system. The dataset contains information on 331 controversial issues
   raised by 125 legislative proposals that were introduced between 1996
   and 2008. For each of these controversial issues, the dataset identifies
   the policy alternative favoured most by each of the main political
   actors: the European Commission; the European Parliament; and each of
   the member states' representatives in the Council of Ministers. This
   information was assembled during 349 semi-structured interviews with key
   informants. This article describes the dataset and identifies its
   relevance to several research agendas in EU studies.},

Title = {Judicialization of Politics in Europe: Keeping Pace with Strasbourg},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {66-84},
Abstract = {In Europe's multilayered constitutional arrangements, the work of
   national courts is increasingly influenced by directives and regulations
   of the European Council and Commission and decisions of the Court of
   Justice of the European Union and the European Court of Human Rights or
   Strasbourg Court as it is generally identified. Examined in this article
   are the recent efforts by courts in Germany, France, Italy, and the
   United Kingdom to keep pace with developments in European human rights
   law, especially the decisions of the Strasbourg Court, dealing with
   asylum and immigration. By focusing on recent decisions dealing with
   asylum and immigration issues, this article reveals the variety of
   approaches taken by courts in Europe to harmonize national law with
   international human rights law and concludes that the decisions that
   contributed most to the expansion of judicial power in this domestic
   policy area were those invoking principles of European human rights law
   to bolster the protection of rights that were already part of the
   national constitutional tradition.},

Title = {FRAMING AND COUNTER-FRAMING NEW PUBLIC MANAGEMENT: THE CASE OF GERMANY},
Journal = {PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {90},
Number = {2},
Pages = {370-392},
Abstract = {In this paper I explore the conflict between managerial and bureaucratic
   models of public sector management from the discursive perspective in
   institutional theory. Taking the under-researched case of Germany, I
   conduct a textual analysis of seminal publications in the discourse on
   public sector reform and reveal the subversive framing conflict which
   accompanies the proliferation of private managerial models in the public
   sector. As the most general result, a frame which advocates the transfer
   of business-like managerial practices clashes with a counter-frame which
   opposes this managerialization. I elucidate how these competing frames
   are composed, which of their components are core and which are
   peripheral, how the frames relate to each other, and which broader
   discourses they exploit for legitimization purposes. The results imply
   that the often assumed superiority of managerial over bureaucratic
   control is constructed through discourse rather than being a law-like
   regularity.},

Abstract = {Given frequent leadership turnover and leaders' need to appeal to
   voters, democracies should face difficulties in maintaining their
   alliance commitments. Yet the empirical evidence predominantly shows
   that they do make reliable allies. Democratic governments can increase
   reliability by binding future administrations through the choice of
   alliance commitment. While defense pacts precommit future leaders to
   close military cooperation with an ally, consultation pacts leave more
   room for discretion. This research note examines when precommitment
   through a defense pact is likely to occur. A government should be more
   likely to conclude a defense pact if potential successors have different
   preferences regarding the alliance, if the government believes that it
   will lose power soon, and if the costs of precommitment are not too
   high. I test the theoretical expectations using the Alliance Treaty
   Obligations and Provisions (ATOP) data between 1945 and 2003. The
   findings support the argument and suggest an answer to the puzzle of why
   states sometimes conclude whole-hearted commitments and other times
   seemingly half-hearted ones.},

   ?(c) 2012 International Studies Association Political life in modern
   Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan is commonly characterized by a strong
   central government, influential economic elites, and a relatively
   homogeneous society. In such settings, we would not expect to find much
   impact by foreigners and small NGO actors on policy changes, but the
   cases in these countries challenge this assessment. Relatively unskilled
   foreign workers in present-day Northeast Asia face a range of hardships,
   and existing government programs have provided little support until
   recently. Media portrayals of foreign workersas in several other
   industrialized democraciesreinforce popular suspicions and fear of these
   foreigners. Yet, citizens of host countries themselves have formed
   numerous voluntary associations aimed at assisting foreign workers. I
   call the activities of these groups associative activism. My account of
   associative activism makes explicit the process through which some
   activists, who initially work in concert chiefly to solve specific
   problems, eventually form broader political ambitions as they exert
   pressure on dominant features of the public sphere, especially processes
   of governance, political representation, and opinion formation. I
   identify three domains of associative activism through which political
   influence is exerted by immigrant rights groups: legislative, juridical,
   and municipal. These efforts illustrate how civil society groups can
   play an increasing role in protecting foreigners rights and advancing
   democratization in Northeast Asia.},

   Association Audience costs are a central feature of many prominent
   theories of international conflict. We advance the understanding of
   audience costs by specifying the domestic institutions necessary to
   generate them. In our conceptualization, audience cost capacity (ACC) is
   a function of the availability of alternative rulers and the cost of
   mobilizing against the incumbent. This conceptualization leads to the
   first measure of ACC that has variation between more and less democratic
   political systems and variation within autocracies. We subject our
   measure to a rigorous set of tests that includes addressing selection
   effects and temporal treatment effects, neither of which have been fully
   examined in this research area. The empirical analysis offers strong
   support for the validity of our measure.},

   the background of a possible decline of the geopolitical importance of
   the USA and despite internal European problems in the wake of the
   current financial crisis, an important change in Chinese foreign policy
   is needed. With the development towards a multipolar world becoming more
   and more visible, the Sino-European relationship will gain significance.
   The future role of China and Europe alike will depend on the shape of
   their relations. The author analyzes Sino-European relations with regard
   to economic exchange, security issues, the question of human rights and

Abstract = {Since 1978, with the disappearance of the historical caudillos (Joaquin
   Balaguer, Juan Bosch, and Jose Francisco Pena Gomez), institutional
   fragility and electoral power have been the keys to the survival of the
   political party system in the Dominican Republic. The current parties
   are more stable but not more institutionalized. The authoritarianism
   that characterized the Dominican political system from the 1960s until
   the end of the twentieth century relied for its stability not just on
   power and repression but on political control through clientelism and
   prebendalism. These mechanisms served not only as an instrument of
   social control but also as a strong basis for legitimacy.},

Abstract = {The Maastricht Principles on Extraterritorial Obligations of States in
   the area of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights were adopted on 28
   September 2011 by leading experts in international law and human rights.
   The Maastricht Principles enunciate the parameters within which
   extraterritorial obligations must be discharged. Economic globalization
   fosters an accountability gap and has made evident an imbalance between
   the scope of influence of states and the way in which their legal
   responsibility is defined. Still, the extraterritorial dimensions of
   economic and social rights have been approached by courts and human
   rights expert bodies in a largely ad hoc fashion. By authoritatively
   bringing together the requirements of international human rights law in
   this fast-evolving area, the Principles should contribute to reconciling
   the human rights duties of states with globalization.},

Abstract = {After the 2010 general election the ConservativeLiberal Democrat
   coalition embarked on a radical new policy for funding higher education
   in England which involves transferring all the costs of tuition to
   students, with the exception of the STEM subjects. This article
   evaluates the implications of this policy for Britain's economic
   prosperity in the future by modelling the relationship between higher
   education enrolments and economic growth in the advanced industrial
   countries. It evaluates the potential costs of the coalition
   government's radical funding experiment, if it has the effect of
   deterring large numbers of young people from enrolling in higher
   education. The results show that higher education is an important driver
   of economic growth in advanced industrial countries like Britain,
   although there is no evidence to support the idea that special treatment
   for the STEM subjects stimulates growth. If the policy does deter
   students from enrolling in the future the long-term costs are likely to
   be significantly greater than any short-term gains to the Exchequer.},

   Deciders},
Journal = {POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY},

Volume = {33},

Abstract = {Candidate personality traits have long been recognized as influential in
   the determination of voting choice. However, little is understood of how
   the perception of candidates' traits influences different categories of
   voters. Based on a large-scale electoral-panel survey (ITANES, ITAlian
   National Election Studies), the present study investigated whether the
   voting choice of early and late deciders differentially relied on
   candidate traits. Results showed that after considering the influence of
   ideology and economy assessment, candidate traits still influenced the
   voting choice of early deciders and, even more, of late deciders.
   However, while early deciders took into account both incumbent and
   challenger traits, late deciders mainly relied on incumbent traits.
   Political sophistication moderated this effect, with high-sophisticated
   early deciders relying even more on the challenger, and
   low-sophisticated late deciders relying even more on the incumbent. The
   distinction between incumbent and challenger is discussed as a key
   variable in explaining the role of candidate traits in the choice of
   voters differing as to voting decision time and political
   sophistication.},

Abstract = {It is a widely shared belief that genocide the crime of crimes is more
   morally significant than mere large-scale mass murder. Various attempts
   have been made to capture that separate evil of genocide: some have
   attempted to locate it in damage done to individuals, while others have
   focused upon the harm done to collectives. In this article, I offer a
   third, neglected, option. Genocide damages humankind: it is here that
   the difference is to be found. I show that this understanding has a
   venerable legal history, and argue that it has the significant benefits
   of legitimising intervention and justifying universal jurisdiction.},

   identity influences research in sensitive contexts in ways that are
   often hard to anticipate, that more inclusive approaches to
   dissemination can help counter issues related to research relationships,
   and that responses to work in controversial contexts highlight
   ambiguities within the academy regarding the nature and function of
   social science research, presenting particular challenges for
   early-career researchers.},

Abstract = {The primary research question animating this article revolves around
   understanding how multinational mining corporations (MMCs) are
   responding to the twin pressures of globalization and localization to
   develop Corporate Responsibility (CR) approaches that apply at a global
   level and to their subsidiaries in various different jurisdictions, with
   particular attention being paid to the role of home, host and
   international factors in shaping the CR approaches of MMCs. The focus of
   attention is on the experience of Canadian MMCs in Latin America, using
   as an illustration the particular CR response of one Canadian MMC at its
   subsidiary Guatemalan mining operation. Research suggests that home
   country factors play an important role in shaping corporate CR
   approaches in a manner which take into account the circumstances extant
   at subsidiary operations in developing countries, as do transnational
   advocacy networks and global normative instruments.},

Journal = {COOPERATION AND CONFLICT},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {47},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This article illustrates how organizational learning can explain the
   shift in United Nations' peacekeeping exit strategies from the
   election-based approach of the 1990s to peacebuilding. Conceptualizing
   learning as an ideal-type, three-step process, of knowledge acquisition,
   interpretation and institutionalization, the analysis reveals the impact
   of new knowledge on institutional change. It demonstrates how knowledge
   acquisition became systematized within the United Nations' Secretariat
   especially after 2000, with the active promotion of boundary-spanning
   activities. The analysis then shows how a shared understanding of the
   role of peacebuilding for exit strategies was developed by the
   organization's bureaucracy and intergovernmental bodies in the
   interpretation step. Finally, it highlights how the establishment of the
   Peacebuilding Commission institutionalized the transition to
   peacebuilding as the new exit strategy and how new learning capacities
   were created. By conceiving the interaction between international
   organizations and their external environment as a dynamic relationship,
   the analysis confirms the potential of organizational learning theories
   for explaining institutional change in international relations.},

Abstract = {As a theoretician, Aron was, like Clausewitz, keen to understand the
   nature of war. He was also an attentive witness to the ways in which war
   changed. While his thought is not as systematic as the Prussian
   thinker's, it nevertheless sheds light on the contemporary strategic
   context in three ways. First, his approach to international relations
   leads to the defi nition of the current system as multipolar and
   heterogeneous. Second, his typology of war reveals that interstate war
   has, since 1945, all but been replaced by nuclear deterrence and
   guerilla warfare. Finally, his analysis of the relationship between
   democracy and war brings to light a tension between the principles of
   liberty that defi ne western democracy domestically and the hegemonic
   character of their military interventions on the international scene.},

Title = {An Assessment of the Impact that Participation in Local Climate Networks
   Has on Cities' Implementation of Climate, Energy, and Transportation
   Policies},
Journal = {REVIEW OF POLICY RESEARCH},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {29},
Number = {5},
Pages = {585-604},

Abstract = {Much of the attention surrounding local climate protection in the United
   States is associated with two networks: ICLEI Local Governments for
   Sustainability's Cities for Climate Protection and the U.S. Conference
   of Mayors Climate Protection Agreement (MCPA). However, the impact of
   these networks on member-city actions has not been clearly established.
   This paper examines whether, and to what extent, participation in
   climate networks leads to the implementation of greenhouse gas
   (GHG)-reducing policies, above and beyond what would have been done in
   their absence. To account for the possibility that cities which join
   climate networks are systematically different from those that do not and
   control for self-selection induced bias, three statistical
   techniquespropensity score matching, Heckman full information maximum
   likelihood, and instrumental variablesare employed to estimate the
   treatment effect of participation. Results suggest that impact is
   network specific: ICLEI membership causes small to moderate increases in
   cities GHG-relevant activity, whereas the MCPA has no such effect. The
   characteristics of each network are evaluated in light of these
   findings.},

   international relations for Russian foreign policy. The focus is on
   Russian foreign policy analysis and not the international relations

   second half discusses how recent developments in international security

   Association Globalization has unsettled conventional, nationally based
   political belief systems, opening the door to emerging new global
   political ideologies. While much analytic focus has been on ideational
   transformations related to market globalism (neoliberalism), little
   attention has been given to its growing number of ideological
   challengers. Drawing on data collected from 45 organizations connected
   to the World Social Forum, this article examines the political ideas of
   the global justice movement, the key antagonist to market globalism from
   the political Left. Employing morphological discourse analysis and
   quantitative content analysis, the article assesses the ideological
   coherence of justice globalism against Michael Freedens (1996) three
   criteria of distinctiveness, context-bound responsiveness, and effective
   decontestation. We find that justice globalism displays ideological
   coherence and should be considered a maturing political alter-ideology
   of global significance. The evidence presented in this article suggests
   the ongoing globalization of the twenty-first-century ideological
   landscape.},

Abstract = {The article is a reaction to the intention of the Ministry of Finance of
   the Czech Republic to propose a draft amendment to the Real Estate Tax
   Act, which could cause a revolution in the assessment of tax base. After
   outlining the different models for tax base and tax rate assessment of
   land tax and characterizing the currently valid legal regulation, the
   article analyses critically the intended draft amendment to the Real
   Estate Tax Act, which aims to introduce the ad valorem system of land
   taxation. It is expected that the most effective method will be used in
   the future, i.e. tax base maps compiled by municipalities as the
   beneficiaries of real estate tax. The article describes the
   disadvantages of the ad valorem system of land taxation and highlights
   the advantages of the intended changes.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION RESEARCH AND THEORY},

Volume = {22},
Number = {3},
Pages = {445-471},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This study brings together two perspectives on managers' reported levels
   of red tape. The work motivation perspective explains how managers'
   characteristics, such as work engagement (alienation) or commitment,
   affect their reported levels of red tape. The external control
   perspective explains how managers' feedback relations with external
   actors and organizations reduce miscommunications and conflicts between
   multiple sources of rules, regulations, and procedures. Hypotheses are
   derived about the effects of managers' levels of work engagement,
   commitment to the organization, and networking activity with external
   actors and organizations on their levels of reported red tape. The
   hypotheses are simultaneously tested on a cross-sectional data set of
   Dutch primary school principals with information about their reported
   levels of externally generated general red tape (n = 792) and personnel
   red tape (n = 787). The results of the analyses suggest that work
   engagement reduces and commitment increases reported levels of red tape.
   Networking activity with national government is associated with high
   levels of reported general red tape and personnel red tape. Networking
   activity with local government and interest organizations in the labor
   relations domain are associated with low levels of reported personnel
   red tape. Finally, commitment moderates the effect of networking with
   national government on general red tape and the effect of networking
   with interest organizations on personnel red tape. These results are
   discussed with reference to the two perspectives on red tape.},

Abstract = {Much scholarship in the political economy literature has investigated
   the influence of the democratic advantage on sovereign bond ratings by
   credit rating agencies (CRAs). Missing from earlier work, however, is
   inquiry into the effects on bond ratings of factors that lower political
   risk, such as adherence to the rule of law, the presence of a strong and
   independent judicial system, and protection of property rights. Using
   panel data for up to thirty-six developing countries from 1996 to 2006,
   we find that rule of law, strong and independent courts, and protection
   of property rights have significant positive effects on bond ratings.
   Policymakers wanting to obtain higher bond ratings and increased revenue
   from bond sales would do well to heed the message contained in these
   findings.},

Abstract = {This article critically explores the idea that resolving ethnic
   conflicts requires some form of truth recovery mechanism to ensure
   accountability for past actions. While the truth recovery model suggests
   the need for a pluralistic, inclusive approach to peace building, I
   argue that its intersection with party and identity politics means that
   it has the potential to destabilise settlement processes. Using the
   Northern Ireland case as an example, I describe how the truth recovery
   model can trigger a contest over the past in which ethnicised
   understandings of the past and the present come to the fore. An
   essentially disruptive element in peace building, truth recovery
   conjures into existence alternative historical narratives,
   counterfactual historical scenarios and, in an ethnically divided
   society, may actually narrow the space for debating peace and thereby
   reproduce entrenched and polarised identities.},

   Association Cross-national empirical studies have found that foreign
   investment has beneficial effects on human rights. We argue that these
   studies poorly operationalize foreign investment to test theoretical
   predictions and suffer from sampling bias. We demonstrate that
   investment stock, rather than inflow, is the superior operationalization
   of structural dependence theory. We construct regression models of
   government repression of physical integrity rights, include much more
   data than previous studies, and use a new multiple imputation algorithm
   for time-series cross-section data to resolve sampling bias. We find no
   evidence that foreign investment affects repression, contradicting
   conventional wisdom and suggesting that the political gains from
   repression frequently dwarf any economic costs for governments.},

Abstract = {Why do insurgencies erupt in some places and not in others? This article
   exploits an original violent event database of 274,428
   municipality-month observations in Colombia to determine the conditions
   favoring organized violence at the subnational level. The data cast
   doubt on the conventional correlates of war: poverty, rough terrain,
   lootable natural resources, and large, sparsely distributed populations.
   The evidence suggests that rebellions begin not in localities that
   afford sanctuaries, impoverished recruits, and abundant finances, but
   instead in regions providing receptacles of collective action: the
   organizational legacies of war. Specifically, the data indicate that
   regions affected by past mobilization are six times more likely to
   experience rebellion than those without a tradition of armed organized
   action. The significant correlation between prior and future
   mobilization is robust across different measurements of the concepts,
   levels of aggregations of the data, units of analysis, and
   specifications of the model. These include rare events and spatial lag
   analyses. These results highlight the need for micro conflict data,
   theory disentangling the causes of war onset from those of war
   recurrence, and a reorientation away from physical geography and back to
   the human and social geography that determines if rebellion is
   organizationally feasible. The findings suggest new avenues of research
   on the post-war trajectories of armed organizations, the causes of
   repeated war, and the micro-foundations of rebellion.},

Abstract = {This article explores relationships between procedural justice (PJ) in
   the negotiation process, distributive justice (DJ) in the terms of
   negotiated agreements, and their durability in cases of civil war.
   Adherence to PJ principles was found to correlate strongly with
   agreements based specifically on the DJ principle of equality.
   Agreements were also found to be more durable when based on equality,
   but not when based on other DJ principles. The equality principle
   accounted for the relationship between PJ and durability irrespective of
   differences between the parties in power. Further examination suggested
   that two types of equality in particular-equal treatment and equal
   shares-were associated with forward-looking agreements and high
   durability. The findings suggest that durability is served by including
   equality in the terms of agreements, and that PJ helps (but does not
   guarantee) achieving such agreements.},

Abstract = {The contemporary policy environment makes persistent demands on agency
   officials to use the best information available when making decisions
   about policies, programs, and practices. State and federal legislation
   calls on agencies to incorporate evidence-based practices (EBP) in their
   programs. Using data from a 2008 survey of state agency directors, we
   examine the extent to which state government agencies draw upon various
   sources of information to guide their decisions about programmatic
   operations. Our findings reveal the extent to which agencies rely on, or
   weight, sources of scientific studies and formal evaluations compared to
   other sources. Factor analysis identifies patterns of agency information
   use, providing a basis for further exploring agency differences in
   information consultation that underlie development of new policies and
   programs in the vein of EBP.},

Abstract = {How do property rights become secure? How does rule of law take hold in
   an economy? The author uses an original survey of 516 firms in Russia
   and Ukraine, as well as interview-based case studies, to reexamine these
   fundamental issues of political economy. Most states in the developing
   world lack the requisite time horizons and institutional capacity to
   make the credible commitments emphasized in the literature. In this
   context, the author argues that firms can enforce their property rights
   without resort to mafias by forming alliances with stakeholders such as
   foreign actors, community residents, and labor. These stakeholders can
   impose costs on the potential aggressors through diverse political
   strategies, allowing firms to defend their property rights not only from
   private predators but also from the state. The article evaluates this
   ``bottom-up{''} theory of secure property rights against existing
   state-based theorizing.},

Abstract = {The rituals of the Virgen del Rosario fiesta in Iruya, Argentina, a
   privileged event for studying the relationship between musical activity
   and the construction of identities, include elements related to local
   and broader communities of identification. Its musical spectrum runs
   from Catholic religious songs and the music of the cachis adoration to
   cumbia, Argentine patriotic anthems, and local, Andean, and national
   folkloric music. The fiesta displays processes of communalization-the
   interplay of homogenizing and particularizing projects of state
   formation with local notions of traditions-and contributes to creating a
   collective identity. This identity construction takes place through an
   unequal and dynamic negotiation of meanings in which cultural
   inscription is articulated with the performances of social actors.},

Abstract = {The European Union (EU) and the antebellum US represent attempts to
   overcome anarchy without substituting hierarchy. Understood as `states
   unions', these two systems are shown here to share foundational
   indeterminacy over sovereignty and the constitution of the people (i.e.
   the boundaries of the political community). Existing scholarship
   appreciates the EU's resulting democratic deficit but fails to
   problematize how dual ambiguity is sustained. The contrast between both
   states unions is used to probe this mutually constitutive relationship
   between sovereignty and democracy in an anti-hierarchical order.
   Defining the boundaries of the people by invoking popular sovereignty
   led in the antebellum, the paper argues, to a bifurcated debate over
   where the hierarchy of democratic legitimacy resided, destroying
   ambiguity. The contrast further shows that the EU has avoided the
   development of such rival, mutually exclusive constitutional visions
   that seek to make the people and sovereignty congruent at either the
   unit or union level. Instead, the EU has sustained dual constitutional
   ambiguity by allowing for multiple accountability claims reliant on
   overlapping notions of the people. Democratizing international
   cooperation thus should focus on the form democratic accountability can
   take rather than seeking to use popular sovereignty to establish some
   decision-making level where sovereignty and the people are congruent.},

Abstract = {This article explores why governments commit to human rights enforcement
   by joining the International Criminal Court (ICC). Compared with other
   international institutions, the ICC has substantial authority and
   autonomy. Since governments traditionally guard their sovereignty
   carefully, it is puzzling that the ICC was not only established, but
   established so rapidly. Looking beyond traditional explanations for
   joining international institutions, this study identifies a new causal
   factor: a country's dependence network, which consists of the set of
   other states that control resources the country values. This study
   captures different dimensions of what states value through trade
   relations, security alliances, and shared memberships in international
   organizations. Using event history analysis on monthly data from 1998 to
   2004, we find that dependence networks strongly affect whether and when
   a state signs and ratifies the ICC. Some types of ratification costs
   also influence state commitment, but many conventional explanations of
   state commitment receive little empirical support.},

Abstract = {How does the American public assess risk when it comes to national
   security issues? This paper addresses this question by analyzing
   variation in citizen probability assessments of the terrorism risk of
   nuclear power plants. Drawing on the literature on how motivated
   reasoning, selective information processing, and domain-specific
   knowledge influence public opinion, we argue that heterogeneous issue
   preferences and knowledge of nuclear energy and homeland security have
   important explanatory power. Using original data from a unique 2009
   national survey in the United States, we show that Americans are divided
   in their probability assessments of the terrorism risk of nuclear power
   plants. Consistent with our theoretical expectations, individuals who
   support using nuclear power to meet rising energy demands, who are
   generally less concerned with terrorism, or who are more knowledgeable
   about terrorism and nuclear security tend to provide lower assessments
   of the likelihood that nuclear power plants increase terrorist attacks,
   and vice versa. The findings have implications for the literature on
   public opinion, risk assessment, energy policy and planning, and
   homeland security.},

Abstract = {The possession of nuclear weapons confers many benefits on a state. The
   path to proliferation, however, is often violent. When a state initiates
   a nuclear weapons program, it signals its intent to fundamentally alter
   its bargaining environment. States that once had an advantage will now
   be disadvantaged. This change in the environment is not instantaneous,
   but evolves slowly over time. This gives states both opportunities and
   incentives to resolve underlying grievances, by force if necessary,
   before a nuclear weapons program is completed. Our cross-national
   analyses of nuclear weapons program and the onset of militarized
   conflict confirm this expectation. In particular, the closer a state
   gets to acquiring nuclear weapons, the greater the risk it will be
   attacked (especially over territorial issues). Once nuclear weapons are
   acquired, however, the risk of being attacked dramatically drops, though
   not below the risk of attack for non-proliferators.},

Abstract = {We contribute to extant policy theory by focusing on interrelationships
   between existing policies and innovation. In particular, we call
   attention to the link between supply-side incentives and demand-side
   innovation, which has not been systematically investigated. Our research
   expectation is that supply-side policies generally will complement
   demand-side policy, leading to a positive impact on the adoption of
   demand-side innovations. We test this idea by examining adoptions of
   renewable portfolio standards (RPS), a demand-pull approach targeted to
   renewable energy generation by utilities, in the American states from
   1991 to 2008. Event history models show that an index of supply-side
   financial incentives has a strong positive influence on RPS adoption. We
   do not find support for the hypothesis that this effect is contingent on
   in-state carbon-based energy generation. In conclusion, we argue that
   the study of policy adoption needs to give greater consideration to the
   interrelationships among policy instruments.},

Abstract = {Set-piece consultations, through which government invites groups and
   individuals to comment on proposed legislation, codes of practice,
   guidance or some other measures, are a common feature of British
   policy-making, yet we know remarkably little about them. Above all, we
   do not know why anyone should respond to them when the chances of
   changing policy appear remote. This research note reports a survey of
   over 300 individuals in organisations that responded to government
   consultation requests and explores a range of hypotheses seeking to
   explain participation in set-piece consultations, including those
   relating to the role of membership, the outsider status of the
   organisation and the role of the set-piece consultation in wider
   lobbying campaigns. The evidence suggests that set-piece consultations
   are more fruitfully viewed as distinctive forms of consultation in which
   respondents believe they have a chance of shaping some kinds of issues
   but not the policy itself.},

Abstract = {However obsolete it may appear in the environment of the post-1989 Czech
   Republic, dissident activity has left its imprint on Czech society and
   politics. In Czech foreign policy, there is something like a dissident
   tradition, which dissidents themselves seem to uphold. In the Czech
   foreign policy process, there exists an explicit mechanism that has
   incorporated the dissident tradition, which, in quite a few cases, has
   affected policy outcomes. The introduction of the dissident tradition
   into Czech foreign policy was facilitated by the dissidents' great
   concern for foreign policy and for human rights issues, and, in
   particular, for human rights issues outside the Czech Republic. We
   present evidence that dissidents have been concerned with foreign policy
   and with human rights issues by analyzing the membership of
   parliamentary committees of both chambers of the Parliament as well as
   the dissidents' activities in the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies.
   Significantly, when activities tied to the dissident tradition emerge in
   the Parliament, the initiators of such activities are always (although
   not exclusively) dissidents; the opponents, always nondissidents.},

Abstract = {This article employs original data to assess the development of EU
   studies as practiced by political scientists in the United States.
   Several challenges to the conventional wisdom result. EU studies has not
   been a boom field in the United States: it is in decline both with
   respect to developments in Europe and in absolute terms. Fewer US
   scholars self-identify as EU experts now than a decade ago, and leading
   US journals of international relations devoted less space to integration
   topics in the first decade of the 21st century than they did during the
   1970s. It is true that EU studies has become more professionalized over
   the past 30 years, developing its own journals and conferences - as is
   also true of most other academic subfields. But whether counting
   scholars or scholarship, the revival of EU studies that took place
   during the 1990s and early 2000s was not nearly as significant as
   usually depicted. In addition, that revival is now well past its peak.},

Abstract = {Political organizations claim they are serving the interests of their
   constituents-but being involved in the drug trade does not seem to
   support those claims. Why would political organizations sell drugs then?
   Most often the question of why organizations engage in the drug trade
   has been explored in the context of organizations that are either
   criminal or violent, thus leaving a large hole in the literature about
   how violence and legality intersect with other exploratory factors. We
   explore this issue more fully by looking at both violent and nonviolent
   organizations using the Middle East Minorities at Risk Organizational
   Behavior dataset, which has data on over 100 ethnopolitical
   organizations in the Middle East. Very few of these organizations are
   involved in the drug trade and yet all of those are engaged in violence
   at the same time. We explore what factors, other than violence, make
   this rare behavior for political organizations more likely.},

Abstract = {The British, Finnish and French governments are currently attempting to
   increase the share of electricity produced by nuclear power. We examine
   the diverse metagovernance responses in the three countries as their
   governments seek to manage complex networks to realize their policy
   goals. An expanded role for nuclear power in electricity generation
   cannot be called in existence by government fiat and challenges stem
   from the nature of nuclear technology itself, the institutional and
   physical configurations of the energy industries within each country and
   the political systems within which each government is embedded. It is
   shown that the ability of the British, Finnish and French governments to
   respond to a serious policy challenge in energy provision is limited by
   these factors and is complicated further by the 2011 nuclear accident in
   Japan.},

Journal = {STUDIES IN CONFLICT \& TERRORISM},

Volume = {35},

Pages = {135-155},
Abstract = {Though the United States-led invasion of Iraq in March 2003 aimed to
   rapidly topple authoritarian leader Saddam Hussein via decisive victory,
   the unintended consequences of this historical event resulted in
   full-fledged sectarian warfare. Emerging out of this incident, the
   captivating populist figure Muqtada al-Sadr moved promptly to capture
   the spotlight for the Iraqi Shi'a. Muqtada al-Sadr's personal militia
   ultimately consolidated power under the designation Jaysh al-Mahdi with
   the sole objective of pushing Coalition Forces out of their cherished
   homeland. Despite its revolutionary disposition and use of violent
   tactics in the interim, Jaysh al-Mahdi is indeed a mere tool of Muqtada
   al-Sadr's strategic objectives, one that can be characterized as an
   Islamic activist movement striving to restore order to Iraq. After the
   Iraq invasion, Muqtada al-Sadr likely recognized the unfolding situation
   as the ideal opportunity to assume authority, in a lack thereof, in
   order to pursue his family's political goals for the Iraqi Shi'a.
   Militia members are fighting to win control of Iraq to install a Sadrist
   strain of governance, which would ensure their safety and protection
   from other elements of Iraqi society thereafter.},

Journal = {EAST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {28},
Number = {4},
Pages = {452-472},
Abstract = {Party system institutionalisation has traditionally been viewed as a
   necessary, but not sufficient, condition for the healthy functioning of
   democracy; yet the question of why some of these competitive party
   systems managed to institutionalise at the end of the second decade of
   party politics while others have not has not received the necessary
   attention. In order to begin to fill this gap, this article tackles the
   above-cited issue by trying to discover what have been the `causal
   mechanisms' explaining the different levels of institutionalisation
   observed in East Central European party systems. In order to do so, and
   contrary to the predominant literature, it constitutes a serious attempt
   to bring together both institutional and sociological approaches.},

Title = {Making Narrative Count: A Narratological Approach to Public Management
   Innovation},

Abstract = {Though the use of narrative has become widespread through many
   disciplines, it has yet to establish a strong footing in public
   administration. The article first explains why narrative analysis has
   not been incorporated into mainstream public administration as the
   latter has become increasingly empirical, quantitative, and hypothesis
   driven. The article then outlines a number of key narratological
   concepts that could readily be applied to the field. Demonstrating the
   possibilities they offer, the concepts are applied to the analysis of
   the 31 finalists in the 2008 and 2009 Innovations in American Government
   Awards to identify a dominant innovation fable incorporating incremental
   problem-solving and interorganizational cooperation. Because the Awards
   application process results in three distinct narratives-a detailed
   article application, a site visit report, and an oral presentation to
   the selection panel-the analysis focuses on the differences among them,
   with the application form representing an insider's story written by
   experts for an expert audience, the site visit report often
   incorporating a counter-narrative that points out the innovation's
   unresolved conflicts or uncertainties, and the oral presentation
   functioning as an advocacy narrative directed at a generalist audience.
   The article concludes with suggestions for further narratological
   research about public management innovation, taking advantage of the new
   application form to the Innovation Awards that was designed to elicit
   more explicit narratives. More generally, it raises possibilities for
   public administration scholars to incorporate narratological concepts
   and methods into their research.Translations by Claudia N. Avellaneda,

Booktitle = {AMERICAN DIPLOMACY},
Year = {2012},
Pages = {101-115},
Abstract = {Less has changed in US diplomacy at the United Nations than many
   observers expected when the Obama administration took office in January
   2009. In the UN Security Council, the United States has pursued a
   generally steady course that in many respects builds on the
   accomplishments of the Bush administration. Unexpectedly, the Security
   Council's pace of work diminished considerably during the first few
   years of the new administration. The most significant change is the
   atmospherics of US diplomacy, not its substance: the Obama
   administration has participated in processes that the Bush
   administration shunned and has toned down US criticism of the United
   Nations' perceived shortcomings.},

Abstract = {This symposium article examines how the threefold governance framework
   of the symposium actually works across multiple policy sectors and
   multiple politically systems. It undertakes a comparative survey of
   governance-related developments across three policy sectors:
   environment, education/higher education and forests. To control for
   differentiation in political structures, the article studies the policy
   sectors with respect to three political systems Canada, England and
   Germany, taking into account the role of the European Union, the federal
   systems and international actors. This broad macro comparative focus
   enables the authors to make one of the first empirical efforts to assess
   the presence and sweep of governance arrangements across both policy
   sectors and states; and to assess the degree of convergence around
   particular governance practices.},

Abstract = {This article assesses the significance of American diplomatic
   intervention in the de-escalation of two South Asian nuclear crises -
   the 1999 Kargil conflict and the 2001-2002 military standoff. The
   American role in those crises is often referred to as crisis manager or
   secondary in the context of the region's strategic and crisis stability.
   A careful analysis of American diplomatic interventions, however,
   reveals that the role is much greater, conceptualized here as deterrence
   diplomacy, meaning intense, focused diplomatic activity specifically to
   forestall crisis escalation and the outbreak of large-scale
   Indo-Pakistani war. More than is commonly realized, the United States
   was integral in the crisis strategies of both countries. It played a
   pivotal role preventing crisis escalation and the outbreak of
   large-scale conflict between India and Pakistan in both confrontations.
   And the American role was instrumental in the termination of those
   confrontations, particularly the Kargil conflict. Without America's
   effective deterrence diplomacy, any of the past South Asian crises could
   have escalated to the nuclear level. No global generalization can be
   made from this analysis because it is mostly South Asia specific.
   However, it is plausible to argue that the United States, as the key
   systemic power, will have an important role in future regional
   deterrence.},

Abstract = {The right to privacy is relatively new but has ever increasing
   importance. Different approaches toward its protection do exist at the
   moment; however, they all face challenges due to rapid technological and
   global changes. This article presents an idea of a new legal paradigm
   and its application in privacy protection. This legal paradigm gives
   equal attention to the forming of state-made law and social norms. It
   also emphasizes the cooperative relationship between the two lawmaking
   efforts. The new legal paradigm requires a shift from the traditional
   internal legal point of view, which overlooks the importance of social
   normative formation. Such a shift, however, may not be equally difficult
   in the Chinese-speaking world, where social norms derived from efforts
   searching for proper relationship among different roles in a society
   have long been the teaching of the Confucian school. Within the
   Confucian teaching, this article searches for the traditional Chinese
   idea of privacy and how it is placed in a series of self-cultivation
   needed to bring order to the societies, following with a preliminary
   sketch of the current development of privacy protection in Taiwan to
   demonstrate its distinctiveness under such Confucian influence, i.e.,
   emphasizing private ordering much more than legislative and
   administrative lawmaking. Since the success of the Taiwanese approach,
   or all future successful privacy protection, requires public spheres
   where concerns of different stakeholders can be reflected and dealt
   with, this article ends with a critical description of the development
   of the new research area, i.e., e-participation, and suggests how
   e-participation can be benefited by the idea of the new legal paradigm.},

Abstract = {From the 1930s to 1970s the United States (US) model of capitalism was
   based on a Keynesian growth model. Collective bargaining and pro-labour
   policies were widely accepted. Product market regulation was fairly
   extensive. Industrial policy in the US was less overt than in other
   advanced economies, but quite extensive in certain sectors. By the late
   1990s the US model had clearly coalesced around a new set of
   institutions based on a different set of complementarities: deregulated
   labour markets combined with shareholder-oriented finance and corporate
   governance to produce a system with highly flexible allocation of
   productive resources marked by high levels of financialization. This
   contribution explains this transformation as a combination of three
   variables: structural features of the US economy; the fragmented
   institutional character of US policy-making and regulation; and policy
   convergence between left and right.},

Volume = {49},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {129-145},

Abstract = {This article presents a model of development, civil war and climate
   change. There are multiple interactions. Economic growth reduces the
   probability of civil war and the vulnerability to climate change.
   Climate change increases the probability of civil war. The impacts of
   climate change, civil war and civil war in the neighbouring countries
   reduce economic growth. The model has two potential poverty traps - one
   is climate-change-induced and one is civil-war-induced - and the two
   poverty traps may reinforce one another. The model is calibrated to
   sub-Saharan Africa and a double Monte Carlo analysis is conducted in
   order to account for both parameter uncertainty and stochasticity.
   Although the IPCC Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) is used as
   the baseline, thus assuming rapid economic growth in Africa and
   convergence of African living standards to the rest of the world, the
   impacts of civil war and climate change (ignored in SRES) are
   sufficiently strong to keep a number of countries in Africa in deep
   poverty with a high probability.},

Abstract = {Why are the Basques and Catalans the most left-wing societies in Europe?
   Treating peripheral nationalism and ideology as two orthogonal
   dimensions, the literature to date has not yet provided a systematic
   theoretical account of this pattern. In an attempt to fill this gap,
   this paper explores how nationalism has marked the meaning of ideology
   in these regions. Contrary to the left, the right has been treated as
   the opponent of regional devolution. The findings highlight the need to
   revise the orthogonality assumption often made when employing these two
   dimensions in the study of public opinion in Catalonia and the Basque
   Country.},

Pages = {969-987},
Abstract = {What explains variation across national interest groups in their amount
   of lobbying on legislative proposals in the European Union (EU)? We
   present an argument that leads to the expectation that resource-rich
   associations engage in more lobbying on EU legislation than other
   associations. Moreover, we expect business associations to have
   privileged access to the European Commission and national governments;
   and citizens' groups to parliaments. Using original data from a survey
   of 1,417 interest groups in Germany, Ireland and Spain, we find support
   for these expectations. We conclude that national associations are
   heavily involved in EU lobbying, but that resource-endowment and type
   matter for access. The article is of relevance to the literatures on
   interest groups in the EU, the EU's (alleged) democratic deficit, and
   the role of civil society in governance beyond the nation state.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {19},
Number = {7},
Pages = {1089-1107},
Abstract = {The present study breaks new ground in the study of welfare reform by
   developing the theoretical argument that governments can choose between
   transparent policy retrenchment and less-transparent institutional
   retrenchment when pursuing welfare state contraction. Policy
   retrenchment is transparent because it reallocates substantial benefits
   and has direct and immediate consequences for welfare recipients.
   Institutional retrenchment is less transparent as it reallocates
   institutional authority and primarily has indirect long-term
   consequences. Owing to the difference in transparency and direct effects
   on the voter population, we theoretically propose that elected officials
   may choose strategically between policy and institutional retrenchment.
   Consistent with the theoretical argument, we demonstrate that policy
   retrenchment is more frequently used in times of economic hardship and
   on welfare issues protecting against risks that are imposed
   disproportionately on the lower social strata. Contrary to our
   expectation, however, left-leaning governments do not apply strategies
   of policy retrenchment more often than right-wing governments.},
