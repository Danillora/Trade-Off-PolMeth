Abstract = {STAR METRICS is a data platform that is being voluntarily and
   collaboratively developed by U.S. federal science agencies and research
   institutions to describe investments in science and their results. It
   initially emerged as a result of reporting requirements associated with
   the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act; it has developed in
   response to a recognized need to begin to systematically document
   federal investments in science and their immediate and long-term
   results. The eventual goal is to draw information from existing data on
   scientific and economic activities as well as from research
   institutions' and federal science agencies' systems to provide data that
   can be used for a more scientific analysis of science investments and
   their outcomes.},

Abstract = {This article argues that Ashley and Walker's `dissident exile' and
   Mill's `genius' are virtual mirror images of one another due to the fact
   that both subject formulations rely on the concept of individual
   autonomy. Postmodern iterations of subjectivity such as those found in
   the work of Ashley and Walker place a great deal of emphasis on alterity
   and ethical engagement, striving to move beyond the ethical limitations
   of Enlightenment liberalism that valorises the atomised, sovereign
   individual. But both Mill's genius, who can choose his or her own mode
   of existence or plan of life, and Ashley and Walker's dissident exile,
   who engages in self-making in a register of freedom, are inextricably
   bound up with and reliant upon one of liberalism's seminal concepts:
   autonomy. The implications of this in terms of theorising new forms of
   subjectivity in international relations are significant because
   replacing autonomy with heteronomy or recasting autonomy in relational
   terms fails to fully acknowledge how central autonomy is to the entire
   project of critique. The critical attitude that Ashley and Walker, as
   well as Mill, exhibit emanates from within Enlightenment liberalism;
   since the very act of critique rests on the exercise of individual
   autonomy, perhaps the most we can hope for in terms of new iterations of
   subjectivity may only be one that is more expansively `liberal'. Journal
   of International Relations and Development (2012) 15, 177-200.

Abstract = {The lack of democratisation in Armenia and Azerbaijan is by many
   observers argued to constitute a key obstacle to the Nagorno-Karabakh
   peace process, but other observers contend that the problem is that the
   respective leaderships are not sufficiently secure to agree to a
   difficult compromise. This article, however, finds that the relationship
   between regime types and conflicts is a lot more complex than is often
   argued in the literature, and that the Karabakh peace process has been
   undermined by the worst of two worlds: intense elite competition, but
   without the restraint and widened participation that democratisation
   could provide. (C) 2012 The Regents of the University of California.

Abstract = {China's economic growth and the high pace with which it plans and
   constructs its infrastructure networks have led to a renewed interest in
   its decision-making models and the Confucian values which are believed
   to underlie it. This article makes an attempt to show what these
   Confucian values entail, through what mechanisms they influence
   organisational and decision-making processes, what their positive and
   negative sides are, to what extent they permeate transport
   infrastructure planning in China and why it is not easy or
   straightforward to emulate these policy practices elsewhere. Adopting
   certain features imbued with Confucian values, such as aspects of
   collectivism, conceptions of the common good, moral reflection and
   empathy are not pointless in a non-Asian context, but the specific
   context of such `other' institutional environments must always be taken
   into account. Asian countries have grown stronger by selectively
   learning Western lessons; Western countries could reinforce the
   performance of their planning and policy-making processes in the future
   by looking eastwards and drawing inspiration from them while
   acknowledging vital differences. (C) 2012 Policy and Society Associates

Abstract = {The trend in government and public policy towards evidence-based policy
   making has recently been the subject of criticism from authors such as
   Ian Sanderson who argue that the insights of complexity theory undermine
   the claims of evidence that these forms of policy design advocate. While
   taking on board the primary claim of this critique, this article
   examines the contribution of complexity theory in more detail to suggest
   that the epistemological obstacles that complexity science identifies
   also challenge the kind of pragmatic, deliberative model that Sanderson
   prefers. Instead, it examines the work of Michael Freeden on failure and
   Michel Foucault on error to demonstrate the ways in which approaches
   that are less wedded to epistemological certainty can enable policy
   makers to think more creatively about the complex terrain they must
   navigate and develop more innovative and less risk-averse forms of
   political action.},

   duration in interstate wars},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {49},
Number = {2},
Pages = {321-334},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {What makes some wars longer and more severe than others is an important
   question in international relations scholarship. One underexplored
   answer to this question is the role that third party joiners play in
   lengthening conflicts, especially those states that intervene militarily
   after a war's initial stages. This article argues that late joining
   complicates bargaining by adding new issues to the war and increases
   uncertainty about the relative balance of forces. Thus, more information
   will be needed to resolve the bargaining impasse. This means additional
   fighting and a longer war. This lengthening in turn increases the number
   of casualties. This is a distinct process from simply having more
   participants in a war from the outset as those participants would not
   add uncertainty in the same way that late joiners do since questions
   about how those participants affect the relative balances of forces
   would be answered just as quickly as if there were only two participants
   at the outset. These claims are supported by a non-proportional hazards
   model regression, a Cox proportional hazards regression, and an ordinary
   least squares regression using the Correlates of War interstate war
   dataset.},

Abstract = {In debates about migration from Mexico, popular culture, especially
   music, can be an important political space for expressing feelings and
   thoughts about nativist discourses. Ann Cvetkovich's notion of
   ``archives of feelings{''} is helpful for understanding political texts
   that address the plight of Mexicans in music. Performances become
   reflexive spaces that foster agency by allowing for a critique of
   politics from outside of and within Latino communities. Interviews with
   participants in the Latino punk scene and an interpretation of the
   documentary film Beyond the Screams/Mas alla de los gritos show how punk
   lyrics, musical performances, and representations become interpretive
   sites when performed in public. The texts and performances discussed
   here create powerful transnational archives of feelings that contest
   official stories about the subordination of Mexicans and all Latinos.},

Title = {Electoral manipulation and the development of Russia's political system},
Journal = {EAST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {28},
Number = {2},
Pages = {105-118},
Abstract = {The allegations of electoral manipulation surrounding Russia's
   parliamentary election of December 2011 were nothing new. Regional
   elections in October 2009 resulted in victory for Putin's United Russia,
   followed by a walkout from the State Duma by the other parliamentary
   parties, to protest the elections' conduct. Multi-layered questions
   surround the role of electoral manipulation for different actors in
   Russia's political system. Analysis focused on the elections of October
   2009 shows that regime, opposition, and regional authorities all have
   conflicting motivations. For the regime, electoral manipulation helps to
   secure power and legitimacy, but its uncovering undermines that
   legitimacy. For the opposition, participation in elections provides an
   opportunity to both gain electoral representation and to de-legitimise
   the regime by declaring the ballot flawed. Regional leaders owe their
   positions to the regime and must balance any obligation to deliver
   `correct' election results against mixed signals on the nature of that
   regime and of democracy in Russia.},

Journal = {PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {90},
Number = {4},
Pages = {886-900},
Abstract = {This article explores the democratic values underlying public services
   when they are outsourced. Building on Rosenbloom and Piotrowski's
   (2005a, 2005b) framework, we examine whether and how administrative law
   norms - that serve as central democratic governance and accountability
   mechanisms in the administrative state - are extended to the new
   (private) frontline service providers. Through a study of the regulation
   of the privatized welfare-to-work programme in Wisconsin, we find that
   new forms of administrative law are evolving in third-party government.
   These forms differ from administrative law as it usually applies to
   public agencies in several important aspects. The findings highlight the
   active role of legislative and administrative mechanisms in the
   promotion of these new forms of administrative law; and they shed light
   on the transformations that administrative law norms undergo in the age
   of third-party government.},

Title = {New legislative settings and the application of the
   participative-democratic model of mainstreaming equality in public
   policy making: evidence from the UK's devolution programme},
Journal = {POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {33},
Number = {5},
Pages = {455-476},
Abstract = {Studies of established parliamentary contexts highlight institutional
   barriers to mainstreaming equality of opportunity in public
   policy-making. In contrast, this paper uses an actor-centred
   institutionalist perspective to explore the case of the new devolved
   legislatures in the UK purposively designed with mechanisms to broaden
   engagement in the policy process. It assesses progress in applying the
   participative-democratic model of mainstreaming to policy-making. The
   findings - based upon analysis of legislative proceedings and equality
   and human rights organisations' accounts - reveal that `system openness'
   has afforded opportunities to engage in - and influence - policy work.
   Yet, problems and shortcomings are also identified - signifying a
   `disconnect' between the rhetoric and reality of mainstreaming at the
   meso-level - and continuity with the preexisting policy style in UK
   governance. The wider significance of this is that potential gains
   afforded by the adoption of mainstreaming in legislative settings
   purposively designed to foster the engagement of exogenous interests can
   be negated by leadership issues and government failure to secure the
   full range of pre-requisites prescribed by mainstreaming theory.},

Title = {Conflict and trust: the mediating effects of emotional arousal and
   self-conscious emotions},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Pages = {19-56},
Abstract = {Purpose - Researchers suggest that trust building may be challenging in
   the face of conflict. However, there is an emerging proposition that
   conflict is critical for trust. Using affective events and attribution
   theories as a framework, the purpose of this paper is to present a model
   of the mediating effects of positive emotional arousal and
   self-conscious emotions in the relationship between conflict and trust.
   Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected from 325 students
   enrolled in varied postgraduate programs in a large business school. The
   authors employed Preacher and Hayes's bootstrapping SPSS macros to test
   the direct and mediation effects of the connection between conflict,
   emotions and trust.
   Findings - Results showed that task, relationship and process conflict
   were associated with differing aspects of positive emotional arousal
   (enthusiasm, excitement) and self-conscious emotions (guilt and shame).
   Similarly, behavioural guilt was linked with trust while emotions
   mediated the link between conflict and trust. Research
   limitations/implications The authors acknowledge that there are possible
   covariates (e.g. how long ago did the conflict occur?) with the
   variables used in the current study. Future research should include such
   covariates in the study of the relationship between conflict emotions
   and trust. Also, the data were largely cross-sectional, drawn from a
   relatively small sample. In future, researchers should examine similar
   constructs with longitudinal data and in large organisational sample. In
   spite of the above limitations, the validity of the results presented in
   this paper is not compromised. The study extends self-conscious emotions
   literature by demonstrating that guilt and shame have cognitive and
   behavioural properties and with differing connections with conflict and
   trust.
   Practical implications - The paper's findings suggest that managers who
   want to engender trust in conflict situations should stimulate task
   conflict to arouse enthusiasm and excitement. These discrete emotions
   are critical for building integrity based trust. Alternatively, by
   managing reparative emotions of guilt effectively, managers may increase
   levels of perceived trust. Overall, the results suggest that focusing on
   the effect of conflict on trust without considering the positive
   emotional arousal and self-conscious emotions could yield disappointing
   outcomes.
   Originality/value - The study provides new insights into the influence
   of conflict on trust and the mediating role of emotions (e.g. guilt and
   shame) in the link between conflict and trust. The paper also offers a
   practical assistance to individuals interested in building trust,
   especially in the face of conflict.},

Journal = {STUDIES IN CONFLICT \& TERRORISM},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {35},
Number = {3},
Pages = {193-210},
Abstract = {The activities of Hizballah in Latin America generally have been viewed
   by governmental authorities in the region as a security concern
   primarily because of its importance in bilateral relations with the
   United States rather than as an internal terrorist threat targeted
   against their sovereign interests. This article explores Hizballah's
   network and past activities in South America to assess the nature of
   Hizballah's strategic aims in the region in support of its global
   organizational goals. The author argues that the perception of Hizballah
   as a legitimate political organization by Latin American governments has
   hampered efforts to effectively apply counterterrorism resources to root
   out the entrenched Hizballah infrastructure in the region that can
   potentially carry out directives by the Hizballah leadership or by
   serving as a proxy of Iran.},

Journal = {POLICY AND POLITICS},

Volume = {40},

Pages = {3-19},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This article develops a distinct perspective on the continuities and
   contrasts between Thatcherite Conservatism and New Labour, interpreted
   through active citizenship policy. Revisiting Thatcherism, it argues
   that the roots of the New Labour approach to active citizenship can be
   traced to the late-Thatcher period. It explores six facets of New
   Labour's agenda, arguing in each case that there were affinities with
   Conservatism.These affinities further highlight continuities in the
   `social dimension' of an ongoing hegemonic project, whose objective is
   to overcome the `weak citizenship' characteristic of neoliberalism by
   mobilising citizen assent. Judged against this benchmark, the project
   may have had only limited success.},

Journal = {TERRORISM AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {24},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {235-258},
Abstract = {The Armed Revolutionary Forces of Columbia (FARC) and Kurdistan Workers
   Party (PKK) have both demonstrated an uncanny ability to transform
   themselves and adapt to changing environmental conditions. Integral to
   the groups are webbed criminal enterprises, cross-border sanctuaries,
   and internationally-oriented advocacy networks. Both organizations
   avoided catastrophic breakdowns through a combination of organic
   survival mechanisms and precise organizational restructuring. Since
   2008, the FARC moved away from a centralized wheel structure model
   toward a system of multiple decision-making nodes. Guerrilla units now
   operate in an atomized manner since they are often disconnected from the
   central leadership. This encouraged a growing number of FARC commanders
   to focus on narco-profits rather than the organization's ideological
   goals. Meanwhile, the PKK functions in an octopus-like manner, extending
   its tentacles into neighboring countries and Europe. However, the
   process of democratization in Turkey and improved international law
   enforcement collaboration increased internal as well as external
   pressure on the PKK to restructure. As a result the PKK is struggling to
   keep its far-reaching tentacles coordinated. The PKK misjudged its
   ability to manage political groups which weakened its ideological grip,
   yet the organization's control over criminal and guerrilla branches
   continues to be as fierce as ever. The FARC's and the PKK's
   organizational changes suggest that security agencies in Colombia and
   Turkey need to adapt their counterterrorism strategies also.},

Abstract = {Across Europe, there is an increasing demand for good evidence that can
   inform policies aimed at reducing violence against and among children
   and adolescents. However, there is still a paucity of high-quality
   research on effective prevention of bullying and violence, and
   researchers from different parts of Europe rarely discuss their
   findings. The focus section of this issue of the International Journal
   of Conflict and Violence brings together work by prominent prevention
   scholars from across Europe, who show that significant progress is being
   made. The introduction presents nine recommendations about how
   prevention research could be further strengthened in Europe.},

Abstract = {The governments of Hugo Chavez (Venezuela), Evo Morales (Bolivia), and

   contrast with those of the center-leftists in power in Argentina,
   Brazil, and Uruguay as well as the social democratic, socialist, and
   classical populist experiences of the past. All three governments have
   triumphed at the polls with large majorities, rely on the ongoing
   mobilization of their followers, and embrace radical democracy based on
   a strong executive branch and direct popular participation in decision
   making as opposed to corporatist mechanisms. The three governments have
   been characterized by steady radicalization, their movements consist of
   multiclass alliances, and their economic policies have diversified
   commercial and technological relations. They have also established close
   ties with neighboring center-left governments and have promoted unity
   arrangements in the continent to resolve political disputes that exclude
   the United States. Their movements have fashioned a new narrative of
   nationhood that links radical goals and nationalist sentiment with
   traditions of political and social struggle.},

Title = {Beyond the integrity paradox - towards `good enough' governance?},
Journal = {POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {33},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {97-113},
Abstract = {This article understands integrity in public administration as a
   metaphor for the crafting of accountable, transparent, competent and
   responsive public administration underpinned by the concept of public
   value. It further argues that the design of effective integrity agencies
   requires a broad understanding of the obstacles to the achievement of
   integrity in public administration, the options for integrity reform and
   the appropriate strategic framework for implementing them. It concludes
   that integrity in public administration provides a methodology for
   achieving `good enough' governance - a relative, evolving and culturally
   defined aspiration - otherwise known in mature democracies as
   representative, responsible and accountable government. It observes,
   however, that the achievement of integrity in public administration is
   as much a behavioural challenge as a problem of institutional design.
   Over the past two decades there has been a fascination with responding
   to integrity problems either through structural reform and the
   proliferation of integrity policy and processes to reinforce workplace
   integrity or by creating new institutions. These are often layered over
   existing institutions without due reflection on roles and
   responsibilities creating a crowded and inefficient policy and
   operational environment. Public organisations consequently spend a great
   deal of time, energy and resources on meeting compliance obligations
   rather than embedding integrity values in the hearts and minds of public
   servants. The removal of this integrity paradox remains the central
   challenge for integrity reform in Australia and has strong cadences in
   other Westminster style democracies.},

Title = {The Strategic Use of Soft Balancing: The Normative Dimensions of the
   Chinese-Russian `Strategic Partnership'},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {35},
Number = {2},
Pages = {197-222},
Abstract = {This article examines Chinese and Russian foreign policy and military
   strategy from the theoretical standpoint of soft balancing. Analysis of
   their thinking indicates that both seek to offset US military
   superiority without engaging American power directly. To that end,
   Chinese and Russian strategists have adopted `soft' or `normative' power
   assets as strategic capabilities in their military and foreign policy.
   Alternative norms, such as the concept of `sovereign democracy', allow
   China and Russia to deliberately ignore human rights issues in order to

Abstract = {Drawing from interviews, surveys, and other forms of research conducted
   in Lebanon, Gaza and the West Bank, and Mexico, this article compares
   Mexican cartels to Hamas and Hezbollah. The similarities between them
   are striking: these are all by necessity territorially specific
   organizations tied to relatively defined geographic locations, and have
   deep and sophisticated relationships with the states within which they
   operate. However, there are critical differences between Mexican drug
   cartels and Hamas and Hezbollah as well, the most important (according
   to an analysis of multiple definitions of terrorism) being the presence
   of political and ideological motivations. This analysis illustrates the
   conceptual challenges and classificational ambiguity involved in
   analyzing terrorism and organized crime.},

Abstract = {Bullying prevention programs have been shown to be generally effective
   in reducing bullying and victimization. However, the effects are
   relatively small in randomized experiments and greater in
   quasi-experimental and age-cohort designs. Programs that are more
   intensive and of longer duration (for both children and teachers) are
   more effective, as are programs containing more components. Several
   program components are associated with large effect sizes, including
   parent training or meetings and teacher training. These results should
   inform the design and evaluation of anti-bullying programs in the

Abstract = {This article examines state-civil society relationships in contemporary
   Russia. Its objective is to assess opportunity structures of Russian
   non-governmental organisations (NGOs) that are intertwined with the
   state. The article presents qualitative data from fieldwork in the
   Russian cities of Moscow, St Petersburg, Nizhniy Novgorod, and Perm in
   2009 and 2010. The focus of NGOs in the field of disability was chosen
   because of their roles as social service providers and as advocates for
   the rights of the disabled. The findings indicate that despite the
   Soviet legacy of an occupying state, Russian NGOs widen their
   opportunities by maintaining close relationships with state structures.
   Thus, litigation strategies seem to be an effective instrument for
   fostering social change for the benefit of the disabled.},

Booktitle = {AMERICAN DIPLOMACY},
Year = {2012},
Pages = {199-216},
Abstract = {The US Department of State has embarked on a significant expansion of
   personnel, yet still grapples with the consequences of severe cutbacks
   in the 1990s that now hamper its ability to fulfill more expeditionary
   tasks in the wake of 9/11. Historical factors slowed the development of
   career diplomacy in the US up to 1924, and in recent decades the State
   Department has been impacted by greater Congressional assertiveness in
   foreign affairs, an expanded role for other US agencies and the
   military, and increased security restrictions in the face of terrorist
   threats. Numerous studies have called for a greater emphasis on civilian
   diplomacy amid US military involvements in Iraq and Afghanistan. Current
   US strategy documents evoke a `whole of government' approach to
   nation-building as the primary context for devoting more resources to
   diplomacy and development. Over time, however, global trends toward
   multi-polarity and US fiscal limitations may require a more fundamental
   re-evaluation of the role and importance of career diplomacy in US
   foreign policy.},

Title = {Institutional complementarity between corporate governance and Corporate
   Social Responsibility: a comparative institutional analysis of three
   capitalisms},

Abstract = {The question of why and how firms' approach to Corporate Social
   Responsibility (CSR) differs across countries is one that can only be
   adequately addressed by giving a strong theoretical underpinning to
   research on comparative CSR. To this end, drawing on institutional
   theory and the institutionalist arguments of the comparative capitalism
   literature, we identify the mechanism by which national institutional
   arrangements influence CSR. We do this by (a) separating CSR from
   corporate governance, and identifying corporate governance as the
   missing link between the broader institutional arrangements that govern
   finance and labour and CSR, and (b) using the concept of institutional
   complementarity (a process of mutual reinforcement that enhances the
   value of both institutions) to specify the nature of the relationship
   between corporate governance and CSR. We refer to three models of
   capitalism-liberal market economies (LMEs, e. g. the USA and the UK),
   coordinated market economies (CMEs, e. g. Germany and Japan) and
   state-led market economies (SLMEs, e. g. France and South Korea)-as
   empirical sites for exploration of these ideas. We argue that CSR
   complements corporate governance systems by a logic of similarity (a
   link based on similar properties) and that, as change in the broader
   institutional arrangements and corporate governance occurs, CSR reflects
   and facilities this change.},

Abstract = {Renewable energy is clearly entering the mainstream. In 2010, an
   estimated 16.7\% of global final energy was supplied by renewable
   energy-including hydropower, wind, solar, geothermal, and traditional
   and modern biomass energy. Modern renewable energy provided about 8.2\%
   of this total, with traditional biomass accounting for an estimated
   8.5\% according to the REN21 Renewables 2012 Global Status Report.
   Further, renewables accounted for almost half of new electric capacity
   added worldwide during 2011, and generate about 20.3\% of global
   electricity based on generating capacity in operation at year's end.
   Market growth has been rapid in recent years, with an accelerated growth
   rate for some technologies over the past half-decade. The global
   economic crises of 2009 and 2011 slowed growth in some technologies and
   regions, but overall growth has continued.},

Pages = {215+},
Abstract = {With the 60th anniversary summit of NATO in 2009, the French ended their
   decades-old special position within the Atlantic Alliance by formally
   reintegrating the military command structures. Some people simply
   considered it to be a non-event due to the growing pragmatic
   participation of the French in NATO missions in the last two decades;
   others interpreted it as long overdue commitment that the French pushing
   for European defense could not be realized without NATO, while a third
   group was afraid of the French playing even more the enfant terrible
   from within the structures and impeding both effective decision-making
   and reform. It seems today that neither of these interpretations has
   come true. I argue that for French politics and policies, NATO
   re-integration was all but a non-event, showing that fundamental
   ideational constructions which constitute French policies have changed.
   Secondly, the French no longer seem to foster a strongly
   institutionalized European defense, but now opt for more pragmatic
   cooperations, which changes the scope of NATO re-integration. The Libyan
   intervention is a case in point. Furthermore, for the moment, the new
   French president Hollande does not seem to change this new approach},

Booktitle = {PANORAMA OF GLOBAL SECURITY ENVIRONMENT - 2012},
Year = {2012},
Pages = {339+},
Abstract = {The Arctic is clearly vital to Russia's relevance in world affairs.
   Natural resources are one of the major forces driving Russian policy as
   they are viewed as a basis for the economic development and determine
   its geopolitical influence. Moreover, the Arctic has always played a
   significant role from the perspective of Russian Navy. Russia is the
   only country in the world with a nuclear icebreaker fleet. On the
   geopolitical level, the most important for Moscow is maintaining nuclear
   deterrence by securing the open access of submarines to world's seas. As
   the forecast promises an ice-free Arctic by 2040, Russia has a
   well-developed commercial and transport infrastructure to take advantage
   of the opportunities it offers. The importance of the Arctic to Russia
   on the one hand, and the growing international interest on the other,
   has fueled Russia's determination to make its role as a central Arctic
   nation eminently clear by political, economic, and military means. As
   part of its effort to create a comprehensive presence in the Arctic,
   Russia has been steadily expanding its military component there since
   2007. Any foreign interest in the area, government, commercial or
   environmental, is seen as hostile intent. Naturally, Russian national
   interests will be challenged by other Arctic states all NATO members who
   can theoretically speak with one voice against Russia. Thus the Arctic
   region is likely to become a region of geopolitical competition.},

Abstract = {Local councillor recruitment operates in such a way that it favours the
   possibility for individuals with certain characteristics to enter and to
   remain in public office. One of the central questions then becomes: what
   are these characteristics and how do they influence the selection
   chances of these specific individuals? The aim of this contribution is
   to comparatively study a number of these questions for the population of
   local councillors in Europe. It evokes questions on the similarity or
   divergence of social biases in political recruitment in different local
   political systems. Do the same social background characteristics
   distinguish `the many' from `the few' in all countries under study? Do
   certain patterns in the `skewing' of social background emerge and to
   what extent can they be linked to different institutional histories in
   local government? As such this study is one of the first to structurally
   scrutinise local councillors in such a systematic variety of political
   systems.},

Abstract = {This article examines how same-sex partnership recognition (SSPR) was
   enacted into policy in Argentina. It begins by looking at the history
   and structure of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT)
   movements to explain why same-sex marriage, and not civil unions, became
   the primary goal. Next, it considers what the constitutional and
   statutory law was before the marriage bill passed and through which
   branches of government the law potentially could have been changed. Then
   it looks at how the LGBT social movement organizations have engaged with
   the three branches of government to advance the goal. Using an
   institutional lens, it then argues that elite allies and institutions
   amenable to change were critical to implementing the law recognizing
   same-sex couples. In Argentina, all three branches historically have had
   significant institutional powers to change the law, but lesbians and
   gays have had a hard time securing friends in these positions. Within
   this institutional framework, change was only possible after a
   significant number of allies-most importantly the President-supported
   same-sex marriage.},

Pages = {167-186},
Abstract = {Currently, citizen-users show a noticeable preference for in-person
   communication, over Internet-based delivery channels. As a result,
   governmental agencies still face high numbers of contacts via more
   traditional service channels such as phone and desk. This chapter deals
   with the issue of interactional performance in public e-service
   delivery. It offers a conceptual framework built on the literature of
   media choice and the theory of perceived justice. As such, it examines
   the interplay of service complexity, media richness, and social cues on
   individual media preferences. In addition, it presents key factors which
   lead citizen-users to the perception of a sense of equity through
   electronic communication. Finally, this chapter concludes by
   highlighting a number of possible directions for future action.},

Abstract = {This paper builds on the insights of Sawer and Laycock (2009) to explore
   similarities in the use of populist discourse by former Australian Prime
   John Howard and current Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper. While
   Sawer and Laycock label this discourse `market populism' and focus on
   economic issues, here it is argued that Howard and Harper's populism is
   better understood as `mainstream populism' due to the equal importance
   of sociocultural issues in their discourses. To demonstrate this, the
   treatment of issues such as immigration, multiculturalism, the culture
   wars, criminal justice, and childcare is considered. It is further
   suggested that such populist policies were used to satisfy rival wings
   of their respective parties - neoliberals and social conservatives -
   that do not always share the same priorities.},

Abstract = {This article examines the process of including commercial aviation in
   the EU's Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) relative to claims about the
   EU's leadership in international environment policy-making. It argues
   that in order to understand the politics and the emerging shape of
   specific regimes concerned with atmospheric pollution, scholars must
   examine the nature of the pollutant and the polluting process concerned,
   the commercial characteristics of the polluting industry, its regulatory
   framework and any competing mandates held by other international
   organizations. These factors explain the rationale for the EU's
   inclusion of aviation in the ETS and the resulting dilemmas faced by the

   ones being waged against her by Jehadi organizations like the
   Lashkar-e-Taiba and other proxy factions supported by the Pakistan Inter
   Services Intelligence Agency. Despite a few pro-active measures
   instituted by the government of India after the 26/11 Mumbai attacks,
   there is no clear counterterrorism policy that has been articulated
   either in the form of a doctrine or white paper. If India has to dispel
   the image of being a ``soft state,{''} it is imperative that the
   government clearly spells out its stand on terrorism.},

Abstract = {In India, the administrative system, with roots in the colonial past, is
   largely perceived as unresponsive and insensitive to the citizens' needs
   particularly in its vast rural hinterland. The common citizens at the
   rural village level often find themselves at the receiving end of a
   cumbersome, iniquitous, and unfair service delivery system with very
   little involvement or inclusion in governance processes despite the best
   intentions of the government. It is believed that Information
   Communication Technology (ICT) enabled e-governance through the local
   self governing units (Panchayats) at the village level could simplify
   civic governance, improve the public services delivery system, make
   government and administration more democratic and inclusive, and more
   accessible to the citizens at the local village level. In this context,
   the chapter attempts to examine the challenges to, and dimensions of the
   task of electronic delivery of government services through the local
   self-government Institutions called ``Panchayati Raj{''} in India.},

Abstract = {Which factors account for successful policy reform and what role does
   discourse play in the process? This article examines this empirical
   puzzle with reference to the issue of Greek reform failure. A matched
   comparison with Italy in the area of pensions reveals the salience of
   path shaping and the use of political discourse in narrowing down reform
   options and facilitating change. The Greek case of limited public
   information, incoherent preparation of the problem, and inner-circle
   decision-making, is contrasted with the Italian government's
   information-sharing and consensus-building campaign for the
   establishment of a pro-reformist discourse. Findings confirm the
   salience of institutional conditions but suggest that pure
   institutionalist accounts premised on rational choice thinking and the
   power of veto players should be complemented with more agency-driven
   accounts of public policy.},

Title = {The effectiveness of a mediation program in symmetrical versus
   asymmetrical neighbor-to-neighbor conflicts},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2012},

Pages = {440-457},
Abstract = {Purpose - The last decades, neighborhood mediation programs have become
   an increasingly popular method to deal with conflicts between neighbors.
   In the current paper the aim is to propose and show that conflict
   asymmetry, the degree to which parties differ in perceptions of the
   level of conflict, may be important for the course and outcomes of
   neighborhood mediation.
   Design/methodology/approach - Data for testing the hypotheses were based
   on coding all (261) files of neighbor conflicts reported to a Dutch
   neighborhood mediation program in the period from 2006 through 2008.
   Findings - As expected, cases were more often about asymmetrical than
   symmetrical conflicts. Moreover, compared to symmetrical conflicts,
   asymmetrical conflicts less often led to a mediation session; the degree
   of escalation was lower; and, particularly in asymmetrical conflicts, a
   mere intake session already contributed to positive conflict outcomes.
   Originality/value - Past research on the effectiveness of mediation
   programs mainly focused on cases in which a mediation session
   effectively took place. However, persuading parties to participate in a
   mediation session forms a major challenge for mediators. In fact, many
   cases that are signed-up for mediation programs do not result in an
   actual mediation. The current study examines the entire mediation
   process - from intake to follow-up.},

Abstract = {Information and Communication Technologies are being evaluated as an
   efficient and effective way to modernize the electoral process. These
   initiatives have initially been met with skepticism, as a number of

   the dimensions of electronic voting. This chapter adds to the existing
   body of knowledge on e-voting, while attempting to exorcise complexity
   and reevaluate under a perspicacious vision, the conflictual issues, by
   adopting a methodology with the ability to tackle highly unstructured
   problem settings. For this, systems theory is employed to provide a
   framework for perceiving and analyzing highly complex systems in an
   interdisciplinary method, as well as for designing within and for them.
   In this context, electronic voting is identified as a `soft'
   ill-structured human activity system, and soft systems thinking is
   applied to bring about improvement by resolving complex issues and
   providing a clearer perspective of related interdependencies.},

Abstract = {The Democratic Peace stands as one of the most coherent and recognizable
   programs of study in international relations. Yet despite the pages of
   research devoted to the subject and claims about its law-like nature,
   the democratic peace remains a highly contested finding. In large part,
   this contestation arises out of an enduring question: What exactly keeps
   democracies from fighting? Drawing on the securitization theory of the
   Copenhagen School as well as social psychology, this article claims that
   a critical mechanism of the democratic peace lies at the political
   junction between policymakers and the public. I argue that the
   democratic identity of the public, grounded in basic democratic norms
   essential for the function of any democracy at any time, plays an
   independent role in the construction of security and foreign policy in
   the United States. To test the argument, I examine the difficult case of
   the 1971 Bangladesh War, when President Richard Nixon sent the USS
   Enterprise carrier group to the Bay of Bengal. Analysis of public
   statements as well as administration documentation reveals that, while
   Nixon and national security advisor Henry Kissinger actively saw India
   as a threat to U.S. interests, they were constrained by their belief
   that the public would not accept a security argument with respect to a
   fellow democracy.},

Abstract = {Conditionality is widely used by international organisations to induce
   ``client states'' to engage in structural reform. In the European Union
   (EU) it plays an important role in ensuring that accession countries
   adopt EU rules as a condition of membership. Reliance on external
   incentives, however, limits the effectiveness of bilateral accession
   conditionality, especially for pre-accession countries with uncertain
   membership prospects. This article argues that multilateral institutions
   can boost the rule transfer effects of bilateral accession
   conditionality by reinforcing its incentive structure. The contention is
   tested by empirical research into the Energy Community in South East
   Europe. The research uses cross-national and cross-sectoral comparison
   to evaluate the rule transfer effects of Community institutions relative

Abstract = {Innovation intermediary organizations (IIOs) may build bridges between
   the demand and supply of knowledge. The understanding concerning the
   scope and functions of these intermediaries in the case of the
   agricultural sector is scarce, particularly for developing countries.
   The aim of this article is to discuss the functions played by IIOs
   operating in the segment of small farmers in the agricultural sector in
   the context of a developing country. The analysis allows extracting
   policy implications having in mind small farmers with different economic
   conditions and levels of innovativeness. This article uses a case study
   methodology. The main sources of information are interviews with members
   of the board and staff of the Produce Foundation, responsible for
   managing public resources to promote innovation processes in the
   agriculture sector in a specific state, Chiapas, as well as with
   farmers, technological suppliers, and researchers in this state.},

Title = {Moratoria in International Politics: A Comparative Analysis of the
   Moratoria on Genetically Modified Products and Commercial Whaling},
Journal = {BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICS \& INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {14},
Number = {4},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Little research has been conducted into the role of moratoria in
   international politics despite their importance in many areas of
   policy-making. This article investigates that role by a comparative
   analysis of two of the most prominent moratoria in recent years: the
   moratorium on genetically modified (GM) products imposed by the European
   Union (EU) in 1999; and the moratorium on commercial whaling imposed by
   the International Whaling Commission (IWC) in 1982. The main finding of
   the study is that while the formal role of these moratoria was to
   postpone making a substantive decision until further scientific research
   had been carried out, in practice they served very different political
   purposes: the EU GM moratorium dampened down political heat while the EU
   was under pressure from member states regarding environmental issues and
   from the US regarding trade issues; whereas the IWC moratorium was a
   moral denunciation of killing whales. The wider implication of the
   analysis is that moratoria are complex phenomena, varied in their
   functions and effects, and they deserve to be studied more seriously.},

   governance mechanisms. The authors explore two areas in which new
   mechanisms of global governance of health have emerged in the first
   decade of the 21st century: firstly, international assistance to finance
   healthcare and the Global Fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria;
   and secondly, the Social Protection Floor which aims to ensure basic
   social guarantees for all. They argue that human rights can help to
   combine and strengthen these mechanisms, serving as a guide for a true
   partnership between people across borders, rather than merely a set of
   norms imposed upon states. Through a Framework Convention on Global
   Health, the Global Fund could become the cornerstone of a global social
   protection regime and act as an incentive for compliance with the Social
   Protection Floor.},

Title = {Does Complex or Simple Rhetoric Win Elections? An Integrative Complexity
   Analysis of U.S. Presidential Campaigns},
Journal = {POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY},

Abstract = {Research suggests that the integrative complexity of political rhetoric
   tends to drop during election season, but little research to date
   directly addresses if this drop in complexity serves to increase or
   decrease electoral success. The two present studies help fill this gap.
   Study 1 demonstrates that, during the Democratic Party primary debates
   in 20032004, the eventual winners of the party nomination showed a
   steeper drop in integrative complexity as the election season progressed
   than nonwinning candidates. Study 2 presents laboratory evidence from
   the most recent presidential campaign demonstrating that, while the
   complexity of Obama's rhetoric had little impact on college students'
   subsequent intentions to vote for him, the complexity of McCain's
   rhetoric was significantly positively correlated with their likelihood
   of voting for him. Taken together, this research is inconsistent with an
   unqualified simple is effective view of the complexity-success
   relationship. Rather, it is more consistent with a compensatory view:
   Effective use of complexity (or simplicity) may compensate for perceived
   weaknesses. Thus, appropriately timed shifts in complexity levels,
   and/or violations of negative expectations relevant to complexity, may
   be an effective means of winning elections. Surprisingly, mere
   simplicity as such seems largely ineffective.},

Abstract = {Over the course of the past half century, some significant progress has
   been made in creating accountability mechanisms that have helped to
   serve human rights. Five are analyzed here: (1) the evolution of the
   European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), (2) Alien Tort Statute
   litigation, (3) universal jurisdiction, (4) the terrorism exception
   under US sovereign immunity law, and finally (5) the establishment of
   regional and international criminal tribunals. However, two related
   international law principlessovereign immunity and state
   responsibilitystand squarely in the way of achieving greater human
   rights protection. This article analyzes an ECHR case (Al-Adsani v.
   United Kingdom) that could have changed much of this almost immediately.
   However, in an extraordinarily close (98) vote, the court upheld the
   principle of sovereign immunityeven when this serves to protect a state
   that engages in torture, which is a jus cogens norm. One of the
   dissenting judges in this case exclaimed: What a pity! But the missed
   opportunity to protect human rights is more than just a pity. Rather, it
   is contrary to why international human rights law exists in the first
   place. The article closes by calling for the use of much different
   standards for assigning state responsibility.},

Abstract = {While scholars have focused on the macro-structural, institutional and
   legal dimensions at work in international anti-corruption, they have
   paid little attention to role of the more specific technologies through
   which social forces become entangled in efforts at combating corruption
   internationally. Drawing on studies of organisation, surveillance and
   governmentality, this article examines the capacity of performance
   indices to construct comparable and governable subjects in international
   efforts to combat corruption. It conceptualises performance indices in
   terms of technologies of distance, communication and surveillance and
   analyses a variety of corruption and anti-corruption indices, including
   corporate blacklisting as applied by the World Bank towards fraudulent
   corporations. It demonstrates how performance indices are implicated in
   the construction of standards and scripts for action against corruption,
   pointing to their importance for the determination of what constitutes
   legitimate social practice. More generally, the paper contributes to the
   study of global governance literatures by highlighting how practices of
   calculation, measurement and comparison can play a distinctive role in
   the constitution of spaces of governance. Journal of International

Abstract = {The literature on ``audience costs'' in International Relations suggests
   that a democratic leader's electoral accountability lends him or her a
   significant advantage in crisis-bargaining situations. But if elections
   are the primary source of a democratic leader's accountability, a
   democracy's advantage in crisis situations should disappear when its
   leader is no longer eligible for reelection. Accordingly, this article
   asks whether ``lame-duck'' presidents, those who are constitutionally
   prohibited from reelection, are systematically less effective than their
   reelectable counterparts in crisis-bargaining situations. Using a data
   set of all post-WorldWar II militarized interstate disputes initiated by
   presidential democracies, the author tests several hypotheses regarding
   lame-duck crisis behavior derived from Fearon's bargaining model. The
   findings generally support the audience costs model. Observed patterns
   of threat reciprocation and crisis hostility are consistent with
   Fearon's predictions. Crisis outcomes, however, do not appear to be
   affected by a democratic leader's lame-duck status.},

Abstract = {VERTICAL TRADE SPECIALIZATION AND THE FORMATION OF NORTH-SOUTH PTAs By
   MARK S. MANGER
   During the last two decades, the number of preferential trade agreements
   (ems) grew almost exponentially to over 270 by 2010. A majority of these
   are agreements between developed and developing countries. Existing
   models provide little economic rationale for these agreements, but the
   existing literature lumps North-South ems together with other types of
   trade pacts. This article offers an explanation focused on the movement
   of less capital-intensive manufacturing from North to South, which in
   turn stimulates the exchange of similar goods differentiated by unit
   value-also referred to as vertical intra-industry trade. The North
   exports more capital-intensive goods, while more labor-intensive goods
   are produced and traded by the South. This kind of specialization
   creates incentives for governments to support PTAs. The author tests
   this model using a new measure of vertical trade specialization and
   finds strong evidence that such specialization promotes PTA formation.
   North-South ems should therefore be seen as part of a broader shift of
   manufacturing from high- to middle-income countries.},

Abstract = {In the present article, we extend the notion of cultural threat posed by
   immigrants beyond its current conceptualization as symbolic,
   collective-level threats to American culture and identity. Instead, we
   argue that routine encounters with non-English-speaking immigrants cause
   many individuals to feel threatened because of real barriers to
   interpersonal communication and exchange. We draw upon survey and
   experimental data to demonstrate that local contact with immigrants who
   speak little to no English, as well as incidental exposure to the
   Spanish language, heighten feelings of cultural threat, which increases
   anti-immigrant sentiment and policy preferences.},

Abstract = {Political conflicts and intractable wars can be conceived as disasters
   of human activities and they affect the entire life of children and
   their families. An ecological-transactional perspective of human
   development is adopted in order to identify multilevel developmental and
   contextual trajectories that might facilitate or impede the willingness
   and readiness of people to engage openly and flexibly in
   conflict-resolution paradigms. It is proposed that building early
   trustful relationships at the interpersonal level is likely to enhance
   one's willingness and ability to explore the other side's goals in the
   conflict, and ultimately to consider reconciliation. At the same time,
   the absence of such trustful relationships is likely to induce more
   rigid and one-sided approaches in adulthood. Toward that end, the
   Palestinian-Israeli conflict serves as the main context of analysis.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes why formation of policy networks, which is an
   effective tool of European policy in different spheres, have lost
   significant part of its positive functions from the point of view of
   guaranteeing European energy security in case of European-Russian gas
   policy networks. This can be explained by the absence of effective
   international regime in gas trade as well as by failed transition to
   democracy, market economy and rule of law in Russia. As a result of
   this, German, Italian and French leaders involved into European-Russian
   gas policy networks face serious moral, legal and political dilemmas.

Abstract = {This paper analyses the application of competition policy regulation and
   its effect on market conduct and performance through the case study of
   communication satellite broadcasting in Japan. Focusing on structural
   regulations such as vertical separation and conduct regulations such as
   open access, this paper questions whether regulations have effectively
   led to contestable markets by examining the shareholding relationships
   of major player SKY PerfecTV. Findings presented here suggest that
   regulation designed in principle to achieve performance-oriented goals
   of contestability and diversity actually impaired the functioning of the
   market and the ability of industry players to obtain an adequate return
   on investment.},

Abstract = {Modern Nigerian poetry in English has proved to be a significant medium
   of action against authoritarian leadership in Nigeria. In historicizing
   the socio-political condition of regimes, Nigerian poets have responded
   to circumstances distinct to their historical period. This article
   examines the work of the younger writers widely regarded as the third
   generation of Nigerian poets, the condition of its production, and its
   `generational' response to the dictatorships of General Ibrahim Badamosi
   Babangida (1985-93) and the late General Sani Abacha (1993-8). The
   article argues that while older Nigerian poets also responded to the
   intense oppression caused by these regimes, the third generation poets
   represent one of the prominent counter-hegemonic cultural practices in
   the decade between the 1980s and the 1990s. United by a collective
   spirit, they raise a generational, coherent counter-hegemonic discourse
   against these regimes, despite the difficulties they had to face. The
   article is an attempt to map out this new, relatively unknown poetry and
   what might be called its aesthetics of rage.},

Abstract = {Russia's relations with Poland in the post-Soviet period have been
   greatly affected by their divergent historical narratives that have
   shaped their dominant identities and have been further promoted by the
   political elites to maintain these identities. However, Moscow's
   attempts to project a more positive image in Poland in recent years have
   involved re-articulating some elements of the official narrative.
   Drawing on social constructivism, this article presents a theoretical
   framework that can be applied to an analysis of Russia's foreign policy,
   and illustrates its benefits by examining Russia's policy towards
   Poland. International Politics (2012) 49, 434-448.

Abstract = {Russian foreign policy is both an expression of Moscow's internal
   political dealings around the presidential administration and the
   bureaucracies that support it, with their focus on the shaping and
   making of foreign policy, as well as its implementation, which is
   grounded in Russia's stated goal of its reassertion in the international
   system as a major power. This is a process that is embedded in
   continuous interaction between different levels of agency and the
   construction of understandings and perceptions, both at the domestic and
   the international level. Looking at foreign policy as a process, the
   article argues that the study of foreign policy should go beyond
   strictly positivist assumptions, as relations between the different
   actors and the foreign policy approaches that these suggest are embedded
   in structural, material and ideational dimensions. Departing from this
   conceptual frame, the article looks at Russian foreign policy, seeking
   to understand how the internal/external linkages take place in the
   process of policy construction, looking in particular at socialisation
   processes and normative adaptation. International Politics (2012) 49,

Abstract = {This paper analyses the relationship between fiscal decentralization and
   the level of the public debt in the twenty seven member countries of the
   European Union. Our panel data analysis points to the importance of size
   as fiscal decentralization reduces public debt in large and small
   countries, but not in medium - size countries. In addition, our results
   show that the number of government levels and average size of the lowest
   government unit is insignificant with respect to the public debt in
   these countries.},

Abstract = {This article looks at Russian foreign policy from the perspective of the
   individuals responsible for decision making. The focus on the individual
   level of analysis aims to shed light on the evolving dynamics of Russian
   foreign policymaking and complement existing analysis on the role of
   ideas, world views and influential groups in foreign policy analysis,
   with insights from neo-classical realism and constructivism. Whereas the
   former sees the state as the transmission belt between international
   power distributions and political action, the latter underlines the
   roles of ideas and norms to explain agency. In this context, the article
   is well placed to deal with the evolving relationship between leaders'
   views and situational constraints, including other actors involved in
   setting foreign policy priorities and the external environment. How are
   decisions taken in the context of Russia's foreign policy under
   President Putin and Medvedev? What is the role of the presidents from
   both a legal (constitutional) and a practical perspective? The article
   maps Russian political leaders' decisions, under Putin and Medvedev,
   using two case studies: Putin's decision to support the US-led post-9/11
   war on terror and Medvedev's decision to go to war with Georgia in 2008.

   Studies Association How does party politics influence trade outcomes?
   Previous studies offer a limited understanding of the role of political
   parties in trade policymaking due to their restrictive assumptions that
   downplay the distinct organizational identity of political parties and
   the competitive logic of their interactions. This paper develops a
   theoretical argument that emphasizes the competitive forces of party
   politics as a key determinant of party preference for trade and hence of
   trade outcomes. This theoretical argument is illustrated and tested in
   analysis of the trade implications of strategic interactions between
   mainstream parties and niche parties. The empirical analyses confirm
   that party strategic factors need to be assigned a substantial
   analytical weight in explaining trade outcomes.},

   International Studies Quarterly, doi: 10.1111/j.1468-2478.2012.00723.x
   ?(c) 2012 International Studies Association African states are both
   unusually large and well known for having artificial borders created
   during the colonial period. While African state size and shape have been
   previously shown to be correlated with negative development outcomes, no
   one has heretofore examined the origins of either phenomenon. Here, I
   show that African state size and shape are not arbitrary but are rather
   a consequence of Africas low pre-colonial population density, whereby
   low-density areas were consolidated into unusually large colonial states
   with artificial borders. I also show that state size has a strong
   negative relationship with pre-colonial trade and that trade and
   population density alone explain the majority of the variation in
   African state size. Finally, I do not find a relationship between
   population density and state size or shape among non-African former
   colonies, thereby emphasizing the distinctiveness of modern African
   state formation.},

Abstract = {The recent civil war literature suggests that negative economic shocks
   in low-income countries increase the risk of civil war. Foreign aid can
   be an effective conflict-prevention tool in times of severe economic
   conditions. Aid cushions government spending from the downward pressures
   of economic shocks, providing recipient governments with resources they
   can use to make rebellion a less attractive option for aggrieved
   domestic groups. Using Official Development Assistance (ODA) data
   covering 1990 through 2004, we find that foreign aid appears to be a
   useful tool for preventing civil wars in the wake of negative economic
   shocks, and as such aid should be assessed by donors with these
   conflict-suppressing aspects in mind.},

   example of this subgenre, the Colombian Gustavo Bolivar Moreno's Sin
   tetas no hay para so, reveals a complex dialogue between popular culture
   and the hegemonic discourse of the War on Drugs and middle-class
   morality. The soap opera critiques the victimization of women by drug
   traffickers and the latter's hypermasculinity while manipulating these
   issues to seduce and entertain with a spectacle of sex, drugs, and a
   life of luxury. From another perspective, it provides deterritorialized
   subjects a shared experience as a basis for discussion of their everyday
   lives. It paradoxically both essentializes women's subordination and
   sometimes even empowers female viewers to find and celebrate agency in
   its main character. The telenovelas offer a critique of patriarchal
   society and of the middle classes-this is why many women and the
   subaltern identify with it-but at the same time maintain the gendered
   body of (subaltern) women under the surveillance of the (global)
   patriarchal gaze.},

Abstract = {Previous research indicates that a lack of state capacity is a key
   determinant of internal armed conflict. Scholars identify several
   internal dimensions of state capacity, but have yet to explore how
   international finance influences state resources. This is surprising
   because sovereign lending has increased dramatically in recent decades
   and plays an increasing role in the functioning of developed and
   developing governments. In this article, we explore this relationship
   between a state's integration into global credit markets and its
   subsequent capacity to promote domestic stability. We argue that
   international capital increases a state's ability to respond to internal
   opposition because states with favorable credit terms can expand their
   resource base beyond domestic constraints to deter, accommodate, or
   repress opposition while maintaining a level provision of resources to
   their political base. We examine the influence that both capital access
   and credit terms have on the risk of civil conflict in 141 countries
   from 1981 to 2007. Our empirical results indicate that states with
   affordable credit access are indeed less likely to experience civil
   conflict.},

Abstract = {Why are some countries more prone to social violence than others?
   Despite the fact that annual deaths due to homicides worldwide outnumber
   those due to organized armed conflict by a factor of roughly 3 to 1,
   this question has received very little attention from conflict and
   development specialists in recent years. As a modest first step in
   addressing this gap in the literature we draw together insights from the
   conflict and criminology literatures to develop a model of social
   violence that accounts for both political-institutional and
   socio-economic factors. While there is an extensive literature on the
   socio-economic determinants of social violence, there are only a handful
   of studies that consider the significance of political-institutional
   arrangements. Using cross-country estimates of homicides produced by the
   World Health Organization as an indicator of social violence, we test
   our model using OLS regression analysis for a sample of more than 120
   countries. We find that countries with `hybrid' political orders
   experience higher rates of social violence than those with strong
   autocratic or strong democratic regimes, and that weakly
   institutionalized democracies are particularly violent. We also find
   robust associations between indicators of poverty, inequality and ethnic
   diversity and social violence. These results indicate that social and
   political violence share some common underlying causes. We conclude by
   suggesting that the apparent global decline in organized armed conflict
   and the concomitant rise in social violence in recent decades may be
   linked to world urbanization and the `third wave' of democratization in
   the global South, although further research is required to confirm this
   hypothesis.},

Abstract = {The political-economy literature has so far almost unanimously regarded
   Slovenia as the social-democratic exception in Central and Eastern
   Europe, due to a combination of highly consensual democratic
   institutions, low party polarization, strong social partners, and
   developed social dialogue. However, the situation, since the fall of the
   Liberal Democracy of Slovenia (LDS), which governed in 1992-2004, seems
   to be swiftly changing. Polarization has increased, union legitimacy
   declined, and social dialogue-especially in the aftermath of the
   2007-2009 financial crisis-has all but collapsed. The 2010 pension
   reform is an archetypical example of how Slovenia now much more
   resembles its quarrelsome Eastern neighbours than the idealized
   exception that political scientists usually point at.},

Abstract = {The importance of iconography as an art of resistance in contemporary
   social movements was manifested in the 2006 strike by members of
   Oaxaca's Local 22 of Mexico's National Union of Education Workers.
   Striking teachers used iconography that incorporated irony, poignant
   images, and cultural icons such as La Tehuana in presenting their
   demands for salary increments and a change in government. Ethnographic
   data collected in Oaxaca since 2006 allow an exploration of the various
   interpretations of these images. The images were an important visual
   component of the action, and there is little question that they stirred
   emotions in viewers, dividing public opinion between those who supported
   the movement and those who criticized the teachers for hurting Oaxaca's
   children and the state's economy.},

Abstract = {Since 9/11, counter-terrorism officials have fretted over the
   possibility of jihadist terrorists obtaining and deploying a nuclear
   weapon. Although acknowledging that such anxieties are well grounded, 1
   offer here a reconceptualisation of the jihadist terrorist nuclear
   threat that focuses alternatively upon the remote but real possibility
   that jihadist terrorists may seek to advance their goals by trying to
   provoke an Indo Pakistani nuclear confrontation. Such a confrontation
   would serve jihadist goals by aggravating religious polarisation on the
   sub-continent while dramatically weakening the Pakistani state. The
   system-destabilising consequences of such a catastrophe would likely
   also offer the jihadists their best opportunity to revive their
   faltering movement, which otherwise appears fated to terminal decline.
   In the light of this assessment, 1 argue that a higher priority must be
   accorded towards strengthening Indo Pakistani crisis stability and
   advancing regional reconciliation if the risk of a jihadist-provoked
   nuclear exchange is to be minimised. International Politics (2012) 49,

Abstract = {The processes of ``metropolization (uncontrolled urban sprawl) and
   globalization are among the most important factors that led to the Arab
   uprisings or revolutions. Authoritarian regimes in the Arab world were
   erected within the framework of traditionally closed economies that
   depended primarily on the rural population. By 2011, open economies with
   a strong urban component had developed. However, these changes failed to
   give rise to corresponding political transformations, inevitably
   creating obstacles and a breakdown of the existing social pact. The
   decline in oil income, indirectly caused by the financial crisis of
   2007, undoubtedly acted as a catalyst in the emergence of opposition
   movements against those regimes that were incapable of adapting to the
   new situation or ensuring social peace.},

Abstract = {This article describes and explains the variable extent to which
   domestic interest organizations seek access to the multiple venues
   provided by the European system of governance. A multivariate analysis
   of data collected in four member statesFrance, Belgium, the Netherlands,
   and Germanyreveals substantial variance in multilevel venue shopping,
   differences that disconfirm some descriptive accounts reported in the
   Europeanization literature. Surprising is that French organizations
   develop extensive multilevel strategies while the strategies of Dutch
   organizations are rather weakly Europeanized. Our analyses offer a
   better understanding of the factors that stimulate domestic interest
   groups to seek access to European Union-level policy venues. Factors
   such as the nature of policy issues in which groups are involved, the
   group's relation with domestic parties, and overall domestic
   embeddedness significantly explains multilevel venue-shopping. In
   contrast, other factors such as policy sector or the group's resources
   generate little explanatory power.},

Abstract = {This article draws on data from a study carried out on the evolution of
   specialist schools under New Labour in England in order to illustrate
   changes in educational governance. Shifts in policy-making power are
   highlighted,away from increasingly marginalised traditional corporatist
   partners, towards `denocracy' (Seldon, 2004) or greater political
   centralisation. `Presidentialisation' under Prime Minister Tony Blair
   was accompanied by fast-growing policy networks, lending legitimacy to
   centralised policy ideas while intensifying connections and blurring
   lines between state and non-state. However, while spaces and sites for
   policy activity became more extensive,they remained exclusive, with
   insiders and outsiders clearly defined.},

Abstract = {Why do states build international courts, submit cases, and enforce
   court judgments? This article examines the role of a court that is
   neither a ``decider{''} nor an ``information provider.{''} Litigation is
   costly and does not reveal private information. The court's ruling is
   not binding and bargaining can occur before and after the court has
   ruled. Nevertheless, an alternative dispute resolution mechanism
   emerges: court rulings can coordinate endogenous multilateral
   enforcement. Disinterested states will enforce to ensure that they can
   profitably use the court in the future. Accepting jurisdiction of the
   court allows a state to make efficiency-enhancing ``trades,{''} winning
   high-value disputes in exchange for losing low-value disputes. This is
   possible because litigation is a screening device: states only sue when
   they derive relatively high value from the disputed asset. The use of
   the court as a coordination device for multilateral enforcement allows
   for the existence of a court with endogenous enforcement and
   jurisdiction.},

Volume = {47},

Pages = {88-105},

Abstract = {Transitional justice literature has highlighted a negative relationship
   between enforced disappearances and reconciliation in post-conflict
   settings. Little attention has been paid to how human rights issues can
   become stepping-stones to reconciliation. The article explains the
   transformation of the Cypriot Committee on Missing Persons (CMP) from an
   inoperative body into a successful humanitarian forum, paving the way
   for the pro-rapprochement bi-communal grassroots mobilization of the
   relatives of the missing. By juxtaposing the experience of Cyprus with
   other societies confronting similar problems, the article shows how the
   issue of the missing can become a driving force for reconciliation. The
   findings indicate that a policy delinking humanitarian exhumations from
   the prospect of a wider political settlement facilitates positive
   transformation in protracted human rights problems and opens up a window
   of opportunity to grassroots actors.},

Abstract = {The major theories of International Relations (IRT) differ significantly
   as far as their concepts of conflict and cooperation are concerned.
   However, they share one common denominator: They are deeply rooted in
   Western experiences and intellectual history. Recently, a growing
   literature on the possibilities and benefits of a non-Western IRT has
   emerged. This article proposes a `via media': a theoretical approach
   that can be applied to Western and non-Western IR alike, taking into
   consideration the specific historical, ideational and cultural contexts.
   Based on social constructivism as developed by Alexander Wendt, it is
   argued that the existence of a collective identity among states in a
   given region can manifest itself in distinctive logics or cultures of
   anarchy. These are based on norms of conflict or cooperation that can be
   established through interaction, can be proposed by outside agents and
   localized, or can be affected by the re-negotiation of state identity
   caused by domestic events. In addition, there are cultural path
   dependencies: norms rooted in the cultural memory or consciousness of a
   region which tend to be ignored by interpretations that merely focus on
   current events or established Western models of cooperation. Area
   studies can contribute to provide this context.},

Abstract = {The existence and the effective utilization of opportunity structures by
   the Gagauz and Pridnestrovian elites between 1989 and 1991 enabled them
   to successfully mobilize wide parts of the population, take control of
   the administration and build parallel state structures out of the
   control of both Chisinau and Moscow. The Pridnestrovian elites were more
   successful in the effective utilization of such opportunity structures
   than their Gagauz counterparts. Access to vast economic and political
   resources, political unity, and strong organizational skills combined
   with a creative interpretation of the right to self-determination
   enabled the former to pursue their secession policy with greater
   efficiency. (C) 2012 The Regents of the University of California.

Abstract = {Climate change and its harmful effects are widely accepted. A common
   approach is to argue along the lines of Mill's harm principle: if we
   contribute to climate change, then we are likewise responsible for
   harming others and we have a negative duty to reduce our carbon
   emissions. This article argues that a negative duty leads to a
   philosophical fork in the road which does not necessarily entail carbon
   emissions reductions. Arguments for such reductions require further
   supplementation to close off possible non-conservationist alternatives.},

   the Link between State and Civil Society},

Abstract = {This work analyzes the link being generated between State and civil
   society organizations around social policies aimed at improving the
   quality of life of children with disabilities. It considers the context
   in which this link is being generated and the elements within that are
   recognized as priorities in terms of contributing to the social
   integration of this vulnerable group.
   Methodologically, the study combines qualitative and quantitative tools,
   integrating the analysis of the present content and key sources on
   policies for children with disabilities and the public-private link,
   considered with quantitative instrument by means of the multi-criteria
   AHP methodology. This methodological integration allows taking account
   of the context of the public-private link and its constitutive elements
   at the level of dimensions and components. In turn, it allows for
   quantitatively determining the priorities of these elements in relation
   to their contribution to the objective of the social integration of
   children with disabilities.
   Among the conclusions of this research is that this link is generated
   within a scenario configured by an institutional dimension (understood
   as the formal and informal regulatory framework in which the
   public-private approach develops); an organizational dimension
   (referring to the organizational resources of the State and the civil
   society put to the service of social policy aimed at integration of
   disabled children); and of a financial type (understood as the set of
   public ad private economic resources that support the initiative). These
   dimensions present relatively similar priorities in terms of the social
   integration of children with disabilities. As well, each of these is
   made up of different elements with specific priorities in relation to
   the goal of integration.
   Some identified challenges in this document are related to what
   institutional contexts offer the space to work on disseminating the
   rights of persons with disabilities, such that they contribute to these
   being recognized and enter the collective discourse in favor of the
   rights of children. At the organizational level, there is the challenge
   to strengthen the human capital involved with children with
   disabilities. The financial dimension highlights the importance of
   instruments such as transfers oriented to the rehabilitation of
   children, as well as the variability of revenues to sustain such
   initiatives when they provided from grants or from fundraising on the
   part of organizations themselves. This raises the question of whether
   the State should exercise its role in this dimension, for example,
   through subsidies in relation to the economic, social and cultural
   rights of children; and constituting the primary actor in ensuring the
   condition for the active exercise of the rights of children, including
   those children with disabilities.},

Abstract = {In spite of the fast-growing literature on indigenous peoples and
   self-determination, there is a striking absence of research into the
   gendered processes and effects of indigenous self-determination or, more
   generally, indigenous women and self-determination. This article
   examines the interconnections between indigenous self-determination and
   indigenous women's rights with a particular focus on the question of
   violence against women. It contends that for indigenous
   self-determination to be successful it must also address the question of
   violence against indigenous women. The article argues for a specific
   human rights framework that simultaneously accounts for indigenous
   self-determination and human rights violations of indigenous women.},

Title = {Rwanda's Vision 2020 halfway through: what the eye does not see},
Journal = {REVIEW OF AFRICAN POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {39},
Number = {133},
Pages = {427-450},
Abstract = {This paper considers the progress made in the implementation of Rwanda's
   Vision 2020 programme since its launch in 2000. At the halfway point,
   the overall picture is quite encouraging. Rwanda's economy is thriving
   and reported growth figures have been impressive. The country is on
   track to meet the Millennium Development Goals in the fields of
   education and health care. Its political leaders have been praised for
   their quality of technocratic governance and their proactive approach to
   creating an attractive business climate. However, some indicators remain
   problematic. This paper argues that the current strategy - one of
   maximum growth at any cost - is counterproductive to the objective of
   achieving the greatest possible poverty reduction. Strong economic
   growth, concentrated in the hands of a small elite, results in a highly
   skewed developmental path with limited trickle-down potential. A
   possible alternative lies in an exploration of a broad-based inclusive
   growth model founded on existing strengths and the notion of capacity
   building among rural small-scale farmers. Striving for a more inclusive
   concept of growth would appear to be crucial not only for successful
   poverty reduction, but also with a view to promoting long-term stability
   and peace in Rwanda.},

Abstract = {This article analyses Brazil's growing role in external development
   assistance. During Lula da Silva's presidency, cooperation with
   developing countries grew dramatically. While the official position is
   that Brazilian development assistance is moved not by national economic
   or political interests, but by international `solidarity', and does not
   reproduce the North-South traditional aid relations, we suggest that it
   is not completely divorced from national, sub-national or sectoral
   interests and cannot be viewed apart from Brazil's broader foreign
   policy objectives. Brazil does pursue political, economic and commercial
   interests and, concomitantly, has made a positive difference in the
   recipient countries. However, more empirical research and field
   investigation are needed to better gauge the impact of Brazil's
   assistance initiatives and their contributions to South-South
   cooperation more broadly. During Lula's terms (2003-2010), Brazil could
   be classified as a `Southern donor', which expresses the country's own
   novelties, and tensions, of simultaneously being a donor and a
   developing country.},

Abstract = {Focusing on the case of Thailand's ongoing insurgency in its southern
   Malay Muslim majority region, this article examines the circumstances
   surrounding individual's choices to engage in violent revolt and their
   conformity and non-conformity with the norms and disciplines of the
   movement in which they operate. Insurgent-driven violence in Thailand's
   southern border provinces has attracted considerable attention, but
   little has been published about the people who become ``Patani
   Warriors{''} (juwae). Based on the authors' direct encounters with
   current and former insurgents and study of Thai official documentation
   and captured insurgent propaganda material, this article presents the
   most detailed information currently available on southern Thailand's
   shadowy fighters. We argue that there is no single type of Malay Muslim
   insurgent: this variegated reality defies the normative ideals projected
   in insurgent's indoctrination material while it also poses a challenge
   for the Thai authorities to define in simple terms those who oppose the
   state.},

Title = {Is There a Specific Ambivalence of the Sacred? Illustrations from the

Journal = {POLITICS RELIGION \& IDEOLOGY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Pages = {53-73},
Abstract = {In the debate about the return of religion in politics, religious actors
   and discourses are viewed with a certain concern. Whereas some defend
   the peaceful effects of religion, most contributions understand
   religious truth claims as a challenge to democratic pluralism that
   presents a tendency toward violence. At best, the debate is summarised
   by Appleby's argument about the ambivalence of the sacred. We argue that
   this ambivalence is not specific to religious claims but inherent to all
   public claims about best solutions and fundamental questions in
   politics. The problem is not the claim of direct access to God's will
   and His truth, but the political use that different actors make of that
   claim, as it could be equally directed either to enforce peace or to
   escalate a conflict, like any secular discourse. Two empirical cases
   will be analysed where representatives of a monotheistic religion make
   strong religious truth claims contributing to peacebuilding and
   reconciliation during conflicts where religion was an important
   dimension: the apparitions of Medjugorje in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the
   movement of Sant'Egidio in Algeria.},

Journal = {COMMONWEALTH \& COMPARATIVE POLITICS},

Volume = {50},
Number = {4},
Pages = {535-554},
Abstract = {The smallest of Europe's microstates have experienced a unique, lengthy
   and incremental passage to sovereignty and their full participation in
   the organised relations of the international system. This contribution
   focuses on the long struggle of these states to achieve state equality
   and allowing their inclusion as equal members in interstate
   organisations and as legitimate holders of the full rights of legation.
   Important in this narrative is the incremental strategies of the
   microstates themselves, the waning interest in further exclusion by the
   international community, and the pressure and interventions exerted by
   neighbours, particularly the Council of Europe. The conclusion offers a
   comparative assessment of the smallest states in the developing world in
   a similar population class which never faced questions of legitimacy
   undermining their status and inclusion but which are extremely hard
   pressed economically in comparison to their wealthy European
   counterparts.},

Abstract = {While the identity of the European Union (EU) may have normative and/or
   other characteristics, it is fundamentally a large single market with
   significant institutional features and competing interest groups. Given
   these central characteristics, the EU may be best understood as a market
   power Europe that exercises its power through the externalization of
   economic and social market-related policies and regulatory measures.
   Such an exercise of power, which may occur as intentional or
   unintentional behaviour, suggests the EU is fully capable of using both
   persuasive and coercive means and tools to influence international
   affairs. By scrutinizing the EU's identity, official documents and
   initial evidence, the article provides an analytical framework for
   understanding what kind of power the EU is, what the EU says as a power
   and what the EU does as a power.},

Abstract = {The Junta de la Victoria (Victory Board; 1941-1947) was an Argentine
   antifascist women's group that sent aid to the Allies. With its 45,000
   members, the Junta became the largest women's political group before
   Juan Peron's presidency (1946-1955), when women obtained suffrage
   (1947). Unlike other women's anti-fascist groups in Europe and Latin
   America, the Junta concentrated on modeling and amplifying democratic
   practices in the face of an increasingly dictatorial government and Axis
   advances in World War II. Thus it was unique. To a certain degree, the
   Junta tried to implement a broader view of democracy that went beyond
   protecting individual rights, free elections, and the rule of law to
   include men and women of different classes, faiths, ethnicities, and
   regions in the polity. Aside from helping the Allies, it mobilised a
   spectrum of women and inserted them into the political arena, bridged
   differences among them, and fostered their engagement. It broadly
   disseminated its message in order to bring the masses into an
   anti-fascist orbit. While the Junta sought to renovate a democracy under
   siege, its conception of this type of governance had some shortcomings.
   Nevertheless, the Argentine case demonstrates that different contexts
   produced different anti-fascisms.},

Abstract = {Policy change occurs because coalitions of actors are able to take
   advantage of political conditions to translate their strong beliefs
   about policy into ideas, which are turned into policy. A coalition's
   ability to define a problem helps to keep policies in place, but it can
   also cause coalitions to develop blind spots. For example, policy
   subsystem actors will often neglect the need for coordination between
   governmental actors. We examine the financial crisis of 20072009 to show
   how entrenched policy ideas can cause subsystem actors to overlook the
   need for policy coordination. We first analyze the prevalent idea that
   policymakers should aim to keep inflation low and stable while employing
   light touch regulation to financial markets. We then demonstrate how
   this philosophy led to a lack of coordination between monetary and
   regulatory policy in the subprime mortgage market. We conclude with
   thoughts about the need for coordination in future economic policy.},

   LEARNING: A CASE FROM THE UK PUBLIC SECTOR},
Journal = {PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {90},
Number = {3},
Pages = {664-684},
Abstract = {Project-based initiatives form a major part of government investment
   and, so, learning from past projects should be a major concern for
   public sector organizations. Previous research has explored systems and
   processes for project-based learning but little research has examined
   the social and cultural factors that enable this learning to be applied
   with useful effect. This paper reports on two successive major UK
   government projects. The introduction of independent learning accounts
   (ILAs) and the subsequent introduction of educational maintenance
   allowances (EMAs) following the scrapping of the former. Although
   similar in many respects, the first was a major failure while the
   second, having learned the lessons of the first, was acclaimed as a
   success. Using a cultural analysis, this case study shows how
   project-to-project learning enabled the EMA project team to learn from
   the failed project. This resulted in two significant changes in
   government and civil service organizational culture.},

Abstract = {Questions have been posed about the lack of knowledge of the role public
   managers play in the policy process. In this study, following on the
   suggestions of Hicklin and Godwin and Meier in this journal, we identify
   different dimensions of the analystmanager divide among professional
   policy workers. Using the results of several recent large-N surveys of
   Canadian federal, provincial, and territorial policy workers, we explore
   the roles each group plays in the policy analytical process and the
   variations in their behavior in terms of duties and tasks, attitudes,
   and interrelationships. We also examine these to see the impact of
   federalism on professional policy practices. The study uncovers three
   groups of policy workers and policy managerscoordinator-planners,
   research-analysts, and director-managers. Differences between groups of
   policy workers are found for their policy-related work and their
   perceptions of tools of policy effectiveness, and differences between
   levels of government are identified for issues of time demands and
   coordination and tools of policy effectiveness. The implications of
   these findings for the study of public managers in the policy process
   are considered in conclusion.},

Title = {Debating the proper pace of life: sustainable consumption policy
   processes at national and municipal levels},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {21},
Number = {3},
Pages = {369-386},
Abstract = {Time, harriedness and various time-related strategies of slowing down
   the pace of life have been introduced as critical standpoints in the
   literature on sustainable consumption. However, the pace of life has
   received relatively little attention in official policy documents on
   sustainable consumption. Slow living and wealth-in-time appear as
   promising and catchy slogans that nevertheless leave few or no marks on
   environmental policy as it unfolds. Focusing on the policy processes of
   Local Agenda 21 in Helsinki and of the Finnish National Committee on
   Sustainable Consumption, an attempt is made to understand how expertise
   and lay understandings about the pace of life are constituted, and to
   account for how these themes are introduced, debated and marginalised in
   policy formulation.},

Journal = {CONTEMPORARY SECURITY POLICY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {33},
Number = {3},
Pages = {577-594},
Abstract = {A reaction by the Indian military to a series of violent crises with
   Pakistan, beginning with the Kargil conflict of 1999, Cold Start
   Doctrine (CSD) envisions limited attacks on Pakistan territory as
   non-nuclear retaliation against asymmetric and proxy attacks. Cold Start
   Doctrine and Pakistani responses show that the South Asian region is
   still adjusting to the consequences of overt nuclearization in 1998.
   India and Pakistan remain prone to arms racing and vulnerable to
   destablization. CSD is part of an action-reaction process, increasing
   risks of war and the risk that nuclear weapons would be used should war
   occur. It worsens the natural tension between India's desire for
   resolution through conventional conflict and Pakistan's declared
   willingness to escalate to nuclear first use. For India, CSD increases
   incentives to abandon its previous commitment to nuclear No First Use.
   Probable Pakistani responses include development of tactical nuclear
   weapons, forward deployment of nuclear forces, and pre-delegation of
   launch authority, increasing its problems of force protection, command
   and control, and escalation control. This article concludes, based on
   reliable sources, that neither of these war-like strategies benefits the
   two nuclear rivals as each state's policy options confront certain
   issues that invite strategic instability in South Asian region and
   should be reconsidered.},

Abstract = {Sierra Leoneans have long seen their governance institutions as
   unresponsive and inefficient. Following the civil war, the government
   adopted a plan of fiscal, administrative, and political decentralization
   to mitigate widespread corruption, enhance accountability, and reverse
   the over-concentration of central authority in Freetown. The key
   institutions of decentralization, the chieftaincy system and local
   councils, play important but uneven decision-making, management, and
   implementation roles, making the process prone to elite capture. This
   article analyses the peacebuilding implications resulting from variation
   in strategies to counter elite capture in decentralization. It argues
   that the UN's variation of this approach, which focuses on relations
   between elites, has yielded few positive results. A second variation,
   employed mainly by international and national non-governmental
   organizations (NGOs), focuses on rebalancing asymmetries between elites
   and non-elites, and has been more effective in sensitizing non-elites to
   demand good governance and accountability. The challenges of redressing
   power imbalances between chiefdom actors and non-elites remain, and in
   addition to continued, robust oversight of local councils, the
   chieftaincy system requires deeper reforms to guard against further
   marginalization of non-elites and to achieve liberal peacebuilding
   goals.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on Public Service Bargains (PSBs) in the
   Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) world in
   an age of austerity and makes four main claims. First, both logic and
   recent history suggest that states can respond to financial crises in
   more than one way. Second, we argue that the pressures on existing PSBs
   are not all the same in this group of states, given observable
   differences in their financial vulnerability. Third, we analyze
   countries' differential exposure to two other major challenges, namely,
   that of population aging and environmental risk. Fourth, we show that
   those areas of vulnerability can counteract one another in some cases
   but be mutually reinforcing in others, and we argue that triply
   vulnerable states in a composite analysis are those likely to face the
   strongest pressure to change their existing PSBs. We conclude that while
   homogenizing pressures cannot be ignored, PSB diversity is likely to
   continue.},

Journal = {POLITICS RELIGION \& IDEOLOGY},

Volume = {13},

Pages = {333-351},
Abstract = {This article argues that pre-existing networks and organizations were
   crucial to the development of liberation theology in Latin America.
   Drawing on concepts from social movement theory, I demonstrate that in
   the early and mid-twentieth century, the Catholic Churches in Brazil and
   Chile had favorable political opportunities, organizational resources,
   and insurgent consciousness which facilitated the rise of liberationist
   movements and organizations in both countries. For the case of Chile,
   data is drawn from forty interviews with Chilean activists and
   representatives of the Church with ties to social Catholic movements of
   the 1950s and 1960s. The article makes two contributions to the
   literature on liberation theology: (1) by placing lay activists at the
   center of analysis it offers a corrective to research which emphasizes
   the role of Church elites in the emergence of liberation theology; and
   (2) it demonstrates the importance of pre-existing networks and
   organizations for movement emergence. The article closes by examining
   the long-term consequences of activism and suggests directions for
   future research.},

   interactions involving baseline child characteristics and economic
   factors were tested. There were significant treatment effects for
   ADHD/impulsivity and aggression at the follow-up. Baseline development
   variables predicted higher prosocial behavior as well as lower
   aggressive behavior and ADHD at the follow-up. Economic risk factors
   predicted poor behavior outcomes at the follow-up. Development variables
   moderated the impact of PATHS on ADHD and aggression at the follow-up.
   However, for most outcomes, no main effects or moderation of treatment
   effects were found.},

Abstract = {How might work levels among low-income men be raised, as they were for
   welfare mothers in the 1990s? This study expands the relevant literature
   on both social policy and implementation. Low-skilled men owing child
   support and ex-offenders returning from prison are already supposed to
   work but often fail to do so. The reasons include both the recent fall
   in unskilled wages and the confusion of men's lives. Existing work
   programs in child support and criminal justice appear promising,
   although evaluations are limited. A survey covering most states shows
   that half or more already have some men's work programs, usually on a
   small scale. Field research in six states suggests the political and
   administrative factors that shape wider implementation of these
   programs. Work programs should preferably be mandatory, stress work over
   training, and be combined with improved wage subsidies. The federal
   government should provide more funding and evaluations.},

   European labor migration policies},
Journal = {CRITICAL POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {6},
Number = {4},
Pages = {379-401},
Abstract = {Labor migration has been revitalized as part of economic competition and
   growth strategies across Europe over the last decade. Scholars have
   framed policy changes towards more liberal recruitment as a turn towards
   `competition state' and Schumpeterian innovation goals. This article
   evaluates the extent to which British, French and German labor admission
   policies are dominated by competition state logics. I apply a cultural
   political economy perspective, thereby substantiating this relatively
   new approach analytically and testing its usefulness for capturing the
   economic governance of labor migration. I argue that the highly
   selective arrangement of admissions - with regard to skill-level
   targeted, and causal, spatial, and operational foci of recruitment -
   creates a fragmented cultural political economy of labor migration.
   While competition state logics shape the economic imaginary of
   `high-skilled global labor competiveness', rival logics dominate the
   imaginaries of `skilled national labor shortages', and `lower skilled EU
   labor self-sufficiency'. Findings pinpoint limits of competition state
   theory in explaining contemporary labor migration policy. I demonstrate
   that semiotic and regulatory selectivity is a key remedy for coping with
   competing state projects and associated policy tensions. The political
   ordering of labor migration simultaneously entails amplification and
   silencing of competition state logics in policies.},

Journal = {TERRORISM AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {24},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Approaches to terrorism and peacebuilding have a complex relationship
   with each other, which may be explained according to four categories
   outlined in this article. These range from blocking each others' aims,
   nullifying terrorism, supporting a very limited, or a broader peace
   process. Each of these categories has implications for the inclusion and
   reconciliation of a wide range of actors and the hybrid nature of the
   emerging peace. This relates to the critical approach of using theory to
   create emancipatory forms of peace, which is used as a basis for the
   examination of the production of hybridity via the interaction of
   approaches to terrorism and peacebuilding in five cases in this article.
   These include Sri Lanka, Kashmir, the Middle East, Nepal, and Northern
   Ireland. We argue that ``post-liberal{''} possibilities for a hybrid
   form of peace (which are inherent in such conflicts) offer a
   ``post-terrorist{''} potential for peace processes.},

Journal = {CONTEMPORARY SECURITY POLICY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {33},
Number = {2},
Pages = {311-336},
Abstract = {Longer wars between mismatched opponents often end with the militarily
   weaker side showing unexpected strengths. This article tests this
   tendency in two short wars in which overwhelming force superiority was
   applied in massive air attacks. Operation Enduring Freedom (the 2001
   American campaign in Afghanistan) and Operation Cast Lead (the 2008-2009
   Israeli campaign in Gaza) both began with air offensives that shifted to
   air-supported ground combat, but Enduring Freedom (a Type A operation)
   gave priority to aerial attack, while in Cast Lead (Type B) air
   operations primarily paved the way for ground combat. Neither campaign
   was fully decisive, suggesting that the residual capabilities of weaker
   combatants apply to short as well as protracted hostilities. The Type A
   attack was decisive against the Taliban, but not against al Qaeda. The
   more intensive Type B case, Cast Lead, did not lead to greater
   decisiveness than its counterpart, with Israel emphasizing force
   demonstration to enhance deterrence of attack, yet not seeking to
   destroy Hamas's residual military capability. The problem of translating
   large military superiority into decisive war results is also evident
   recently in more common, stretched out, and restrained airpower use
   supporting higher-priority ground combat, as in NATO's 2011 intervention
   in Libya and the aerial drone campaign in Pakistan supporting NATO war
   making in Afghanistan.},

Abstract = {This study explores a refined model of public/private sector cleavage
   voting. Assuming that market and work experiences are crucial for people
   to develop common political views, it investigates three contexts that
   shape government employees' willingness to vote as a single
   constituency: the branch of public sector production, the occupational
   status, and the type of service economy. Estimation results obtained
   from regressions on European Social Survey (ESS) data indicate that
   government employees in public health, education and service production
   rather than public administration utilize sector cleavage voting.
   Regardless of their actual occupational status, public health and
   education employees show persistently stronger attitudes in favour of
   expanding state responsibility. With respect to party choice, stronger
   signs of alignment along the sector cleavage are observed in Social
   Democratic service economies. In sum, the public/private sector cleavage
   continues to matter in a more complex way than a simple sector dichotomy
   would suggest.},

Abstract = {The evidence of coming climate change has generated catastrophe-like
   statements of a future where a warmer, wetter, and wilder climate leads
   to a surge in migrant streams and gives rise to new wars. Although
   highly popular in policy circles, few of these claims are based on
   systematic evidence. Using a most-likely case design on Kenya 1989-2004,
   with new geographically disaggregated data on armed conflicts below the
   common civil conflict level, this study finds that climatic factors do
   influence the risk of conflicts and violent events. The effect is
   opposite to what should be expected from much of the international
   relations literature; rather, it supports the observations made by
   recent anthropological studies. Years with below average rainfall tend
   to have a peaceful effect on the following year and less robustly so for
   the current year as well. Little support is found for the notion that
   scarcity of farmland fuels violence in itself or in election years. More
   densely populated areas - not areas with a low land per capita ratio -
   run a higher risk of conflict. Election years systematically see more
   violence, however. The findings therefore support the notion that
   large-scale intergroup violence is driven by calculation and political
   gain rather than desperate scrambles for scarce land, pasture, and water
   resources.},

Volume = {24},

Pages = {105-119},
Abstract = {A series of incidents over the past two decades has indicated that some
   terrorist groups are interested in acquiring and using improvised
   chemical devices (ICDs). Although the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention
   (CWC) is a disarmament treaty that is legally binding only on sovereign
   states that join it voluntarily, the Convention fortuitously includes
   several provisions that can help its members to prevent chemical
   terrorism or to manage the consequences of an attack. This article
   examines the articles of the CWC that are relevant to counterterrorism
   and discusses how their implementation could be improved at the national
   and international levels. The article also addresses the role that the
   CWC secretariat, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical
   Weapons (OPCW) in The Hague, currently plays in preventing and
   responding to incidents of chemical terrorism, and the political factors
   that constrain its activities in the counterterrorism field.},

Journal = {CONTEMPORARY SECURITY POLICY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {33},
Number = {2},
Pages = {360-383},
Abstract = {This article follows the recent trend of bringing the Organization of
   American States (OAS) back into the debate on regional security,
   previously dominated by the accomplishments of European institutions and
   the shortcomings of their Asian and African counterparts. The study of
   the OAS is advanced here through application of an analytical framework
   derived from institutionalist theory. A security organization may change
   its form during its lifetime and pursue different kinds of tasks. The
   oldest regional security institution, the OAS was designed for
   collective security. This yielded to collective defence during the Cold
   War, and to cooperative security in the 1990s. After 11 September it
   returned to collective defence, but the contradictory reassertion of
   United States leadership and the emergence of South American regional
   power made hemispheric cooperation more difficult again. The OAS's main
   achievement is the extension of essential principles -democracy, human
   rights, and peaceful conflict resolution -to the entire hemisphere. As a
   diversified institution addressing a wide variety of security
   challenges, however, the OAS must find a coherent project alongside more
   focused sub-regional organizations such as the Union of South American
   Nations (UNASUR).},

Pages = {109-126},
Abstract = {Media attention is fundamental to the policy process and policy change
   in punctuated equilibrium theory. In this literature, media attention is
   usually conceptualized as fomenting or contributing to shifts in
   attention, positive feedback, and large-scale policy change. This
   article extends how we understand the role of the media and punctuated
   equilibrium by arguing that media coverage can also contribute to
   negative feedback and stability in the political system. Media attention
   should also slow down the speed of policymaking and the momentum for
   policy change as new policy participants and problem definitions enter
   the debate. Using event history analysis, this article tests the effects
   of media coverage on the length of time it takes legislation, once
   introduced, to become law for public laws from the 109th U.S. Congress
   (200506). Findings provide support for media attention putting the
   brakes on policymaking. Controlling for other factors, the speed of bill
   passage slows down as media attention increases. This effect decays over
   time for high levels of media coverage.},

Abstract = {The European Union (EU) aspires to become a truly comprehensive
   international security actor, coherently utilising the different kinds
   of instruments at its disposal. To this end, Lisbon Treaty reforms aim
   to equip EU policy with a stronger sense of strategic direction by
   bringing external assistance instruments of the EU under the guidance of
   the High Representative. However, pursuing the norm of a more holistic,
   strategic international security policy has arguably threatened a key
   norm which contributes to the EU's normative identity, namely the
   apolitical character of its aid. This article explores the friction
   between these two norms in the EU's international policy, particularly
   in the context of the arrangements concerning the European External
   Action Service. Furthermore, this article argues that the gradual move
   towards a more strategic deployment of the EU's external assistance is
   inevitable, as it reflects the strategic principles defined by the EU in
   the last decade.},

   Studies Association Preferential trade agreements (PTAs) limit
   member-states trade policy discretion; consequently, policy uncertainty
   is mitigated. Reductions in policy uncertainty stemming from accession
   to a PTA improve the resource allocation decisions of the voters and
   reduce deadweight losses from the need to self-insure against policy
   uncertainty. The resultant increase in efficiency improves an incumbent
   government'sparticularly a democratic government'schance of surviving in
   office. We test this prediction using survival analysis, adjusting for
   potential selection biases using propensity score matching. We find
   robust support for the proposition that governments that sign PTAs
   survive longer in office than observationally similar governments that
   do not sign. In addition, we find that this effect is stronger in
   democracies than in autocracies.},

Abstract = {The tourism sector in developing regions that are highly integrated into
   international markets has noticeable effects on the growth of the
   informal economy. For women vendors on the beach and the marina of Cabo
   San Lucas, Mexico, where the economy revolves around tourism and real
   estate, hawking souvenirs is an opportunity for empowerment and income,
   but it can also lead to their exploitation and self-exploitation. While
   women may suffer discrimination within the tourism sector, ambulant
   vending contributes to the reduction of poverty and may give women a
   greater say in their households and their communities. Nonetheless these
   women are marginalized by their low incomes and lack of social security,
   their lack of access to the education that might lead to formal-sector
   employment, their residential segregation, and, for some, the racism
   directed at indigenous people.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {11},
Number = {4},

Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {If gendered discourse is narrated by a woman, the female voice becomes a
   trope of identity and powertransgressing, dismantling, violating the
   law, and speaking her violation. By linking corporeal violence and
   linguistic, textual, and critical discursive violence engendered in
   representation, one inevitably confronts the body as the contested site
   of horrific memory, resistance, defiance of invisibility, and
   de-silencing. In Nora Okja Keller's poetically complex novel, Comfort
   Woman, the voice of a Korean comfort woman recounts her individual past
   and the past of her collective self. Akiko speaks of her body, abused by
   Japanese soldiers, as the broken nation of Korea, as a link to other
   violated women, as well as to her mother, grandmother, and daughter, who
   remain alive in her confused mind and spirit. At the same time, her
   daughter tries to lead a modern life in Hawaii but is powerfully drawn
   into her mother's past and current life and body. It is through the
   voiced violated female body that the cultural identity of Korea
   confronts the historical authority of the Japanese occupation, but only
   in death can Akiko return to her rightful spiritual country.},

Abstract = {How can international organizations persuade governments to adopt policy
   recommendations that are based on private information when their
   interests conflict? We develop a game-theoretic model of persuasion that
   applies regardless of regime type and does not rely on the existence of
   domestic constituency constraints. In the model, an international
   organization (IO) and a domestic expert have private information about a
   crisis, but their preferences diverge from those of the government,
   which must choose whether to delegate decision making to the expert.
   Persuasion can take place if the international institution is able to
   send a credible signal. We find that this can take place only if the
   preferences of the IO and the domestic expert diverge and the
   institution holds the more moderate policy position. This result
   contrasts with conventional wisdom, which holds that the necessary
   condition for IOs to exert influence is support from a domestic
   constituency with aligned preferences. Our model suggests that, far from
   being an obstacle to international cooperation, polarized domestic
   politics may be a necessary condition for IOs to exert effective
   influence.},

Abstract = {During intractable conflicts, competitive victimhood refers to the
   subjective belief that one's own ingroup has suffered more than the
   outgroup. Although competitive victimhood is considered an important
   inhibitor of reconciliation processes, no research has attempted to
   examine ways of reducing it. The present study aims to fill this gap.
   Kosovar Albanians students (N = 170) were asked to report their
   perception of ingroup and outgroup victimhood during the protracted
   violence between Serbs and Albanians in Kosovo. Our findings revealed
   that frequent and high-quality extended contact with outgroup members
   and identification with a common ingroup reduced competitive victimhood.
   The effects of extended contact and common ingroup identification were
   fully mediated by increased perspective taking and trust toward the
   outgroup, and by decreased outgroup infrahumanization. The implications
   of these results for restoring fractured intergroup relations are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {Rebel groups that confront the government frequently become engaged in
   fierce and violent struggles with other groups. Why does a rebel group
   who is already fighting with the government become engaged in yet
   another struggle, thereby sacrificing scarce resources in the fight
   against other rebel groups? This article addresses this puzzle by
   providing the first global study on the determinants of interrebel
   violence. The authors argue that this violence should be understood as a
   means to secure material resources and political leverage that can help
   the group prevail in the conflict with the government. The quantitative
   analysis builds on new data on armed conflict between nonstate actors,
   1989-2007. The results show that interrebel conflict is more likely when
   the rebel group fights in an area with drug cultivation, when the group
   is in control of territory beyond government reach, when the group is
   either militarily strong or weak in relation to other rebels, and where
   state authority is weak.},

Abstract = {In UK public service broadcasting, recent regulatory change has
   increased the role of the private sector in television production,
   culminating in the British Broadcasting Corporations (BBC) introduction
   of ocreative competition' between in-house and independent television
   producers. Using the concept of ocognitive variety', we focus on the
   increasing role of the independent sector as a source of creativity in
   the delivery of programming for the BBC. The paper shows that the
   intended benefit of introducing new competencies has been thwarted by,
   at the micro-level, a high level of cognitive proximity between in-house
   and external producers and, at the meso-level, a conflict in values
   between the BBC and the independent sector, with many of the larger
   producers responding to a commercial imperative that encourages
   creativity in profitable genres, but leaves gaps in other areas of
   provision. Tracing these meso-level institutional effects has
   implications for micro-level analyses of innovation, notably communities
   of practice theory.},

   the market. Therefore this article develops a policy typology for
   government intervention aimed at creating green markets. The typology
   distinguishes between four types of policy based on the balance between
   the supply-side and demand-side policy instruments. On the basis of the
   typology, a hypothesis on their ability to expand green markets is
   generated and tested in a comparative analysis of the performance of
   organic food policies in Denmark, Sweden, the UK and the US, focusing on
   their impact on organic consumption. Our analysis demonstrates that
   cross-country variation in organic food consumption is explained by
   differences in the packages of policy instruments applied, controlling
   for numerous systemic and individual-level alternative explanations. The
   analysis suggests that for environmental and political reasons,
   governments should apply more demand-side instruments when introducing
   environmental policies.},

Abstract = {While the issue of establishing a missile defence capability in the
   Euro-Atlantic area was excluded from EU security debates, and left to
   bidding contests between Washington and some European capitals, it was
   nevertheless endorsed at the NATO Lisbon Summit in November 2010. This
   course of action might come as a surprise in the light of the few cases
   of missile defence operational implementation in the United States. It
   might also raise questions about the technology architecture and the
   command. This article however provides an approach of missile defence as
   a technique of governance through the instruments, launched by the
   United States in the perspective of building technical alliances on the
   global scale.},

Abstract = {This article presents six theses on targeted killing as a form of
   political violence. These explore the power relations, lawfare, scopic
   regimes, forms of spatial management and symbolic communications which
   suggest that the practice of targeted killing arises from the failures
   of the Western global counter-insurgency campaign to achieve its aims.
   Therefore, rather than demonstrating omniscience and omnipotence,
   targeted killing is indicative of the Western position of weakness in
   the wars of the colonial present.},

Abstract = {While extensive scholarship has shown that it is possible to maintain
   global economic openness after hegemony, economic liberalization is
   still thought to be unlikely prior to hegemonic ascent. This assumption
   is based on the conventional narrative that Great Britain began lowering
   its trade barriers in the 1820s as it began its hegemonic ascent. This
   article shows that Britain began pursuing an open trading structure in
   the 1780s-in precisely the multipolar world that hegemonic stability
   theorists claimed would be least likely to initiate the shift. This
   change in commercial strategy depended crucially on the intellectual
   conversion of a key policymaker the Earl of Shelburne from mercantilist
   foreign economic policy to Adam Smith's revolutionary laissez-faire
   liberalism. Using the case of ``the world's most important trading
   state{''} in the nineteenth century, this article highlights the
   importance of intellectuals as well as their ideas in shaping states'
   foreign policy strategies. It also provides further evidence of key
   individuals' significance and their decisions at ``critical
   junctures.{''}},

Abstract = {The courts have hitherto played a remarkably limited role in the working
   of devolution in the United Kingdom. In this respect, the UK has been an
   exception to practice in most federal or decentralised systems, where
   the courts have tended to assume a prominent role in adjudicating
   intergovernmental disputes. This article examines whether political
   congruence contributed to this minimal role for the courts in IGR. It
   argues that additional factors are also at play: the limited role
   accorded to lawyers and legal issues in the UK's system of government,
   the flexibility of the devolution settlements, and the political nature
   of the UK's constitution, which make it both possible and desirable to
   resolve intergovernmental disputes by different means. While the courts
   are likely to become more prominent as a result of third-party
   litigation, particularly as devolved legislatures become more active,
   the limited role of the courts in most intergovernmental matters appears
   unlikely to change.},

Abstract = {In Algeria, there have been sporadic localized protest movements, often
   with a limited agenda and specific demands. However, unlike other Arab
   countries ravaged by massive popular rebellions, Algeria was immune to
   that kind of social upheaval until now. As a preventive tactic, the
   authorities launched political reform proposals to guide the country
   toward a democratic government. But a review of the proposals reveals
   that the process, as it now stands, is not intended to significantly
   alter the political statu quo. This paper suggests that neither the
   legislative package, in itself, nor the manner in which it is being
   debated and adopted, will guarantee the reforms that many Algerians
   want.},

Abstract = {Within the emerging field of experimental economics, field experiments
   (that is, experiments in natural settings as opposed to the lab) have a
   distinct place, for they are designed to act as a obridge' between lab
   experiments and the real world. They are of particular sociological
   interest because they claim to explain phenomena hitherto seen as
   sociologys terrain, and some exponents see economics as capturing that
   terrain. Field experiments in work relations are taken as the focus
   because these relations throw particular light on the operation of
   social factors in experimental settings. The experiments have two linked
   weaknesses: they see these social factors as largely fixed attributes of
   individuals rather than as collective phenomena emerging through
   interaction; and they have an ontology which is limited in its ability
   to recognize multiple causal powers and causal conditions. These can be
   overcome through a sociological view of labour relations as a contested
   terrain combined with a realist ontology. This view offers guides to
   further experiments and forms the basis of a well-constructed bridge.},

Abstract = {In this article, we examine the relationship between presidential
   patronage and federal agency performance. Using Program Assessment
   Rating Tool (PART) management scores for 1,016 federal programs during
   the Bush Administration, we compare the performance of federal programs
   administered by appointees from the campaign or party against programs
   run by other appointees or career professionals. We introduce new means
   of overcoming the shortcomings of PART scores in order to make reliable
   inferences from this measure of federal program performance. We find
   that federal programs administered by appointees from the campaign or
   party earn lower PART scores than programs run by other appointees or by
   career executives. We conclude that although appointing persons from the
   campaign or party provides presidents an important source of political
   capital and arguably improves accountability, it also has costs for
   agency performance.},

Abstract = {The advocacy coalition framework (ACF) pays special attention to
   ``so-called{''} policy brokers when explaining policy change. However,
   this prominent policy approach neither clearly defines who the policy
   brokers are nor identifies under which institutional rules they have an
   influence on policy processes and outputs. This article thus formulates
   two theoretical hypotheses that complement the ACF and then proceeds to
   undertake the first empirical testing of these hypotheses within the
   Swiss climate policy (1990-2008). The empirical results show that, in
   the case under investigation, the strategic interest-based behavior of
   two policy brokers (i.e., one public administration and one political
   party), as well as two institutionalized veto points (i.e., optional
   referendum and parliamentary committee), are crucial factors explaining
   policy brokers' influence on policy process and change.},

Abstract = {Some argue that there is an organic connection between being religious
   and being politically conservative. We evaluate an alternative thesis
   that the relation between religiosity and political conservatism largely
   results from engagement with political discourse that indicates that
   these characteristics go together. In a combined sample of national
   survey respondents from 1996 to 2008, religiosity was associated with
   conservative positions on a wide range of attitudes and values among the
   highly politically engaged, but this association was generally weaker or
   nonexistent among those less engaged with politics. The specific
   political characteristics for which this pattern existed varied across
   ethno-religious groups. These results suggest that whether religiosity
   translates into political conservatism depends to an important degree on
   level of engagement with political discourse.},

Abstract = {Presidential and parliamentary elections in Abkhazia are pluralistic and
   competitive. They have led to the transfer of power from government to
   opposition forces. This in itself is a remarkable fact in the
   post-Soviet context, where the outcome of elections very often is
   determined in advance by the ruling elite. The article explains how and
   why this form of electoral democracy could occur in Abkhazia, arguably
   the most ethnically heterogeneous of all post-Soviet de facto states.
   Drawing on a wide variety of primary sources and data from within
   Abkhazia, particularly interviews with key players, the author describes
   the remarkable willingness of the main political actors to compromise
   and assesses to what extent Abkhazia's democratic credentials are
   sustainable (C) 2012 The Regents of the University of California.

Abstract = {In late 2010 the leaders of the major British political parties were the
   most inexperienced of the post-war era. This short article discusses
   this development. It shows how unusual this is, comparing the leaders of
   2010 to their post-war predecessors. It demonstrates that this
   development is unlikely to be some fluke, before considering the causes
   of the transformation, which it suggests can be attributed to two
   things: the changes in the election methods used by the political
   parties which seem to have led to less experienced candidates being
   elected as well as the changing nature of political experience', with
   career politicians gaining political experience before entering the
   Commons.},

Title = {Global Commons Revisited},
Journal = {GLOBAL POLICY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {3},
Number = {1},
Pages = {61-71},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Global commons are areas and resources defined as being beyond sovereign
   jurisdiction. They are socially constructed and this article identifies
   four: the high seas and deep seabed, Antarctica, outer space and the
   global atmosphere although attempts to designate new areas as commons
   are also noted. The construction of global commons, it is argued, has
   been determined by shifts in human knowledge, capability and perceptions
   of scarcity. The commons problem, as defined by Hardin and other
   analysts arises from the ecological consequences of open access, but
   also from the renewed concerns of strategists about the military use of
   common spaces. In the international system a primary response has been
   to extend sovereignty and the degree to which the global commons have
   been enclosed is assessed. An alternative model is provided by the
   negotiation of common heritage status, but since the experiment with the
   deep sea bed this has not found favour in the Arctic, Antarctic and
   elsewhere. In terms of the continuing management of the commons the
   international community has resorted to an array of regulatory regimes
   of varying coverage and effectiveness},

Abstract = {This article seeks to shed light on the ongoing debate about the extent
   of Al Qaeda's involvement in homegrown jihadist conspiracies in the
   West. Focusing on the London-based jihadist movement in the 1998-2008
   decade, the article uses network analysis to test the domestic and
   transnational integration of Western networks. The evidence stems from
   an extensive database of individuals involved in jihadist terrorist
   conspiracies in the West compiled by the authors. Results show that Al
   Qaeda developed a branch organization in the United Kingdom during that
   period. A sociogram of U.S.-based networks is indicative of a dispersed
   topography, and a comparison shows the British model may not be
   representative of Western networks overall.},

Abstract = {In this article, we contrast the long-term consequences of
   incrementalism and punctuated equilibrium. We test what the impact of
   each of these types of policy change is on long-term budgetary outcomes
   for the American states. Policy scholars have applied both theoretical
   approaches to the study of budgetary spending as an extension of
   policymaking. Given the two contrasting paradigms of policy change, we
   develop the following line of inquiry: Does punctuated equilibrium
   create a different budget in the long term than incrementalism? We
   address this question through an analysis of American state budgets
   because the U.S. states provide a rich variation in both budgetary
   outcomes and political institutions. We use budget data from all
   American states across all government functions for the period between
   1984 and 2009. We find that, first, state budgets and budget functions
   vary in their degree of punctuation and, second, the degree of
   punctuation in a state's budget function corresponds to smaller
   long-term growth. Additionally, the kind of spending matters:
   allocational budget categories are more likely to exhibit punctuations.},

   freedom},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},

Abstract = {This article explores how European research co-operation has evolved
   from being a `spending' policy to one now focussed on establishing an
   `internal market for research'. It identifies how the Commission enabled
   adoption of reforms in this policy area when similar attempts earlier
   had been dismissed. By concentrating on one mode of institutional change
   known as `layering', two strategies effecting reforms are inductively
   specified. It is proposed that the Commission could pursue a sectoral
   strategy (intensifying coordinative efforts in the research field) and a
   lateral strategy (shifting research targets to another policy field) to
   trigger some of the sectoral transformation now observed. Three policy
   instruments for researcher mobility bring the propositions to life: the
   European Charter and Code of Conduct for researchers, the scientific
   visa package and the portability of supplementary pensions. The article
   concludes that cross-sectoral interaction generates the
   under-conceptualized dynamics in area formation beyond moments of `grand
   bargaining'.},

Title = {Australian Fascism? A Revisionist Analysis of the Ideology of the New
   Guard},

Abstract = {In the past few decades, the New Guard - a paramilitary movement in New
   South Wales during the Great Depression - has become the subject of a
   robust body of academic literature. Almost ubiquitous in this literature
   is the claim that the New Guard and its leader Eric Campbell were
   fascist in nature. This article suggests that, when analysed within the
   context of several leading works in the field of fascist studies,
   certain elements of the movement's ideology chiefly its commitment to
   individualism - render the label `fascism' inappropriate. By analysing
   the rhetoric contained in its publications and the speeches of its
   leaders, this article breaks down the ideology of the New Guard into its
   constituent components and positions it on the fringe of an Australian
   conservative tradition that had evolved since the Great War. In doing
   so, it concludes that Campbell's `fascist turn' in the second half of
   1932 represented a logical progression of the New Guard's ideology
   rather than a revolutionary shift from latent to open fascism.},

Abstract = {Researchers have been exploring government repressive behavior for
   decades, but the greatest improvements have come in the last two. For
   example, greater theoretical specification has allowed us to determine a
   great deal about what repression is and why it occurs, while greater
   methodological sophistication has allowed us to test these theories
   rigorously. Despite or rather because of these advancements, however, we
   know comparatively little about what impact repression has on other
   social, economic, and political phenomena. This article reviews our
   general knowledge of the topic and attempts to improve our understanding
   of how repressive action influences behavioral challenges to
   governments.},

Abstract = {Utilizing a new theory for examining critical junctures, we seek to
   better understand the nature of industrial policy change in Ireland
   during the 1950s and macroeconomic policy change in Sweden in the 1980s.
   Did these policy changes constitute critical junctures, or something
   less, and if so why? The theory consists of three elementseconomic
   crisis, ideational change, and the nature of the policy changethat must
   be identified for us to be able to declare with some certainty if a
   policy change constitutes a critical juncture. Herein, we will be
   examining the roles of a variety of change agents including the media,
   central banks, and politicians. Our findings will help explain why Irish
   industrial policy was transformed in the late 1950s, while Swedish
   macroeconomic policy underwent only minor change in the early 1980s.},

Abstract = {Since they promote separation from national frameworks, independentist
   parties are easily labelled as anti-system parties. This contribution
   shows how a study of party dynamics in three Western Mediterranean
   island jurisdictions (Sardinia, Balearic Islands, and Corsica) leads to
   a rather different conceptualisation of their nature and influence.
   Political parties favouring independence are still likely to influence
   other political parties and the political system as a whole. They do so
   mainly by adopting various, often ambiguous, accommodative strategies,
   which relate to their difficulty in attaining and/or maintaining a
   significant party status and electoral presence. Above all, the
   independentist parties' influence is highly variable, especially in
   relation to their closest rivals, and can only be evaluated by taking
   into consideration external factors, such as state organisation. Thus,
   one needs to examine the independentist parties' political interactions
   and influence on policies, and not just their teleological and
   ideological positioning.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {19},
Number = {2},
Pages = {275-291},
Abstract = {The article introduces the distinction between labour market- and life
   course-related social programmes and discusses why it matters
   politically. Life course risks are by and large uncorrelated with the
   income distribution, so the median voter will be comparably favourable
   towards generous provision. Left-and right-wing governments will
   therefore enact similar policies, and constitutional veto points will
   play no role for provision because no political actors will use them to
   block change. The median voter is less favourable towards labour
   market-related programmes that protect against risks that first and
   foremost adversely affect low-income individuals. Right-wing governments
   therefore have greater leeway to implement retrenchment on labour
   market-related programmes. Yet, in the event of external shocks to the
   labour market like rising unemployment and globalization, the median
   voter becomes gradually more exposed to labour market risks, which in
   turn reduces the room for right-wing retrenchment.},

Volume = {19},

Pages = {1396-1413},
Abstract = {The development of the EU asylum and migration policy is often explained
   as the result of `venue-shopping', that is, the move by policy-makers to
   an EU policy venue in order to avoid national constraints. This article
   demonstrates that, contrary to what would have been expected on the
   basis of this widespread view, EU co-operation on asylum matters has
   actually led to a rise in the legal standards applicable to
   asylum-seekers and refugees. This outcome can be mainly explained by
   broader changes that have gradually affected the EU `system of venues'
   and have thereby decreased the likelihood of more restrictive measures
   being adopted in the EU asylum policy venue. This has important
   implications for the EU governance of asylum and migration in general.},

Abstract = {This article investigates political demography as a predictor of the
   onset and prevalence of inter-communal conflict and different political
   outcomes in cases with conditions that are otherwise quite similar.
   Applying a most similar systems design, the article compares the
   Mauritius and Fiji to assess the currency of independent variables to
   which the article posits political demography as a complementary
   explanation. The article posits demographic equilibrium between groups
   in ethnopolitical conflict as favourable towards democratic
   consolidation; a demographic imbalance, by contrast, appears to have the
   opposite effect. Political demography distinguishes itself from
   commonplace ex post facto explanations since demographic trends can be
   projected into the future. The findings thus have implications for
   conflict prevention, especially in Small Island Developing States which
   are among the world's most conflict-prone societies.},

Abstract = {An investigation of whether and to what extent a peer-led model is able
   to counteract mechanisms underlying bullying in peer groups, seeking
   clarification of divergence in reported results on the efficacy of
   peer-led models. Two studies were carried out in Italy within a project
   tackling bullying and cyberbullying in secondary schools. In the first
   study (n=386), concerning the first phase of the project, a significant
   decrease was found only for cyberbullying, most of all for male peer
   educators. For the second study (n=375) the model was improved and
   significant effects were found for several participating groups (peer
   educators and the experimental classes), who exhibited a decrease in
   bullying, victimization, and cybervictimization. Results suggest that
   peer educators can act as agents of change in the broader context.},

Journal = {REVIEW OF POLICY RESEARCH},

Volume = {29},

Abstract = {The human species is again becoming nomadic. Each year, about two
   billion persons move across large geographic distances (not to mention
   people in virtual mobility through information and communication
   technology). Many of these people have weak or unreliable identification
   documentsand many poorer people in developing countries do not even have
   these documents. In 2000, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)
   calculated that 50 million babies (41\% of births worldwide) were not
   registered at birth. In this scenario, a personal identification scheme
   based on birth registration and state-issued passports is less and less
   tenable. Biometrics appears to offer a viable technological solution.
   However, the technology itself is subject to popular critique, warning
   of dystopian futures of overwhelming surveillance and loss of privacy.
   The best answer to those who fear an Orwellian future is to engage with
   the technology and seek to ensure that biometric identification systems
   are developed in positive ways. We suggest that identification schemes
   become problematic when the reciprocity of identification goes
   unnoticed, forgotten, or (what is worse) is intentionally bypassed. The
   dynamics of identification should be reciprocal, dialogical, and
   involving mutual recognition. In the traditional political domain, this
   is the recognition by the state of a citizen and by the citizen of the
   state. In the digital age, identification systems must increasingly
   transcend geopolitical borders. A globally recognized identification
   scheme is therefore a necessity. However, it is merely the nature of the
   borders that has changed herenot the nature of identification. Our call
   will be: no identification without representation.},

Abstract = {Prior to the Internet, information available to the public on white
   extremist groups, such as the United White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan,
   came from news events which prevented these groups from controlling the
   information presented to the public about themselves, their
   organization, ideals, or goals. But the Internet has allowed these
   groups to develop websites through which they can directly dictate their
   image to vast audiences. The purpose of this study was to explore the
   relationship between political orientation and fundamental Christian
   beliefs and agreement with the values of a white extremist group, as
   presented by the United White Knights on their website. Results suggest
   political orientation and Christian fundamental beliefs are
   significantly related, but not as strong as expected, to agreement with
   the values of the United White Knights: as levels of conservatism and
   Christian orthodoxy increase, the more likely a person is to be in
   agreement with the group's values/beliefs. These findings support the
   notion that some Klan organizations, such as the United White Knights,
   are taking steps to rebrand their image into a more mainstream
   organization with an ideology similar to white, religious and political
   conservatives.},

Abstract = {This article discusses a number of significant negative externalities
   generated by free capital flows and analyses certain justifications for
   regulating the capital account regime as an efficiency-enhancing tool
   used to limit externalities. This interventionist tool may limit the
   deviation of private equilibrium from social optimization by both
   improving the composition of capital flows and mitigating the
   accompanying distorted incentive that creates externalities. To avoid
   financial turbulence or economic crisis, countries (in particular,
   emerging economies) are urged to avoid the damaging influences of
   free-market ideology.},

Pages = {51-65},
Abstract = {We use the lens of human trafficking to assess the distance between the
   public claims and the private domestic actions of a leader in the global
   human rights community. With this consideration of the variation between
   the anti-trafficking policies promoted by the Netherlands in the public
   international sphere and those policies implemented in Aruba and the
   Lesser Antilles, we bridge the gap between the literature on ``cheap
   talk{''} and the emerging literature on human rights and human
   trafficking. We demonstrate that, although the Netherlands has been a
   leader in establishing public international commitments to battle human
   trafficking, it has failed to effectively address the issue in territory
   under its control. The international commitment of the Netherlands is
   not matched by domestic policy implementation in the Islands. This casts
   doubt on the sincerity of the commitment of the larger international
   community to combating trafficking and raises serious questions about
   the underlying reasons for the lack of successful implementation of
   antihuman-trafficking policies.},

   the subject of biopolicy, and use a case study analysis to illustrate
   the approach adopted in this book.
   Findings - While this chapter is at one level a simple introduction, at
   another level it tries to orient to reader to the remainder of the
   larger work. The one case study illustrates an approach using
   evolutionary theory to examine policy implications of knowledge from the

Abstract = {A qualitative study of Austria's national strategy against violence in
   the public school system introduced in 2008. The national strategy
   developed by researchers consists of six activity domains with specific
   goals and projects defined for each. The evaluation (1) analyzes how the
   realized projects contributed to the six activity domains, (2) evaluates
   the national strategy at a general level, and (3) provides future
   recommendations. Eight members of the steering committee were
   interviewed at two points in the implementation process. The systematic
   interviews were coded according to the goals of the activity domains.
   According to the interviewees most of the projects have been
   satisfactorily implemented. Networking and cooperation with the
   different actors in the field of violence prevention and cooperation
   among steering committee members have been improved. However, the
   national strategy has not achieved the intended public recognition. The
   lessons learned from the evaluation and its results are discussed.},

   neoliberal social change},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {21},
Number = {2},
Pages = {248-267},
Abstract = {Many organisations in both public and private sectors have recognised
   the challenge posed by climate change and have developed `Climate
   Champion', `Green Team' or `Environmental Coordinator' schemes. On the
   basis of interviews with 36 champions in large organisations and
   analysis of their role as `environmental citizens' in the workplace, it
   is argued that, overall, the champions are thoroughly embedded in a
   neoliberal understanding of social change. They conceived of their
   colleagues (and their employers) as neoliberal agents and accepted that
   a neoliberal ethic should govern their relations with others. However,
   when asked about their own motivations for action, champions used a much
   wider range of discourses. They often appealed to ideas of `justice',
   `responsibility to future generations' and `doing the right thing'.
   Encouraging climate champions to engage in `ordinary moral reasoning'
   about climate change with their colleagues might be an important first
   step to prompting critical reflection on the limits of a neoliberal
   approach to social change.},

Abstract = {This article examines the factors that led to the rise of Cesar E.A.
   Virata as ``chief technocrat{''} during the martial law period
   (1972-1986) as well as the circumstances that led to his downfall. The
   article puts forward the argument that Virata's entry into the power
   elite was due to his technical expertise and the support he received
   from President Ferdinand E. Marcos, the International Monetary Fund and
   the World Bank because of a shared development perspective. Such
   support, however, was not sustainable due to the political and economic
   instability in the country spawned by the anti-dictatorship movement.
   This movement was fueled by the leadership's corruption, failed economic
   policies, the global economic recession and human rights violations,
   among others. Marcos also compartmentalized his technocrats, which
   weakened Virata's political clout, and Virata also had no political mass
   base to draw his support from, reducing him to an appendage of the
   political leadership and foreign capital.},

Journal = {PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {90},
Number = {1},
Pages = {3-18},
Abstract = {This symposium, Conceptualizing New Governance Arrangements', takes up
   the challenge of refining governance theory to better integrate work in
   several disciplines, most notably politics, public administration and
   law. To this end, we argue for a theoretical framework that profiles
   three key dimensions of governance: institutional, political and
   regulatory. This framework, in our view, offers new insights into the
   nature and operation of various governance arrangements, and offers the
   potential to assess and measure change within such arrangements over
   time. After describing our methodology for selecting and analysing the
   case studies profiled in the symposium, we introduce each of the
   articles that apply our three-dimensional governance framework. These
   articles employ the framework to consider a variety of contemporary
   governance scenarios that vary widely by sector (environmental, climate
   change, forestry and education policy) and level of analysis
   (sub-national, national, and bi-national).},

Title = {Towards a new aid paradigm: South Africa as African development partner},
Journal = {CAMBRIDGE REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {25},
Number = {4},
Pages = {535-556},
Abstract = {As the largest African economy and the leading African aid-provider,
   with plans to establish an aid agency, South Africa is often ranked
   among the developing world's `emerging donors'. However, the country's
   development cooperation commitments are smaller in scope, scale and
   ambition than the aid regimes of the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, China)
   or Gulf state donors. Given its limited resources and domestic
   socioeconomic challenges, South Africa prefers the role of `development
   partner'. In this role, South Africa's development cooperation in Africa
   has ranged from peacekeeping, electoral reform and post-conflict
   reconstruction to support for strengthening regional and continental
   institutions, implementing the New Partnership for Africa's Development
   (NEPAD) and improving bilateral political and economic relations through
   dialogue and cooperation. This article seeks to determine whether
   Pretoria's development cooperation offers an alternative perspective to
   the aid policies and practices of the traditional and large rising
   donors. We conclude that South Africa does not fit neatly the `donor'
   category of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's
   (OECD's) Development Assistance Committee (DAC) and neither is
   Pretoria's aid-spending typically `ODA' (official development
   assistance). Instead, with its new aid agency, South Africa occupies a
   unique space in Africa's development cooperation landscape. With fewer
   aid resources, but a `comparative advantage' in understanding Africa's
   security/governance/development nexus, South Africa can play an
   instrumental role in facilitating trilateral partnerships, especially in
   Southern Africa.},

Year = {2012},
Volume = {24},

Abstract = {In modern day Irish republicanism, ``dissident{''} is a vague and
   imprecise term. It is utilised by the media and mainstream politicians
   to collectively label a broad range of groups and individuals who reject
   that participation in constitutional politics, in its current form, will
   achieve their ultimate goal of a United Ireland. This article
   investigates the discourse from the mainstream media and politicians
   surrounding dissident groups in order to explore the construction of the
   ``dissident{''} profile. The piece then considers the composing and
   transporting of the political messages from two republican groups,
   Republican Sinn Fein (RSF), and the 32 County Sovereignty Movement
   (32CSM). This article undertakes a content analysis of the two group's
   newspapers (Saoirse and Sovereign Nation) over a time period of seven
   years and will question how ``dissidents{''} attempt to defend and
   justify their position in relation to this mainstream media narrative,
   assessing how dissidents attempt a counter-narrative. The aim of such
   analysis is to discover more about how ``dissidents{''} attempt to
   portray themselves and justify their position on the republican
   spectrum.},

Pages = {259-278},
Abstract = {Violence in Mexico related to drug trafficking has expanded enormously,
   and observers have begun using terms like terrorism, nacro-terrorism,
   and criminal insurgency to label the violence. However, arguments that
   Mexico is the victim of growing terrorism are both exaggerated and
   unconvincing. While there have been many murders of innocent civilians,
   these killings do not seem to have been motivated by a political,
   ideological, or religious cause. This analysis seeks to understand the
   nature of the expanding violence in Mexico. It starts from the premise
   that the violence is a complex and multi-layered phenomenon with a
   variety of different rationales and motivations. From this perspective,
   a pyramidal approach to the violence can be identified. At the base of
   the pyramid is the notion of drug-related violence as the medium of
   rational strategic competition in a highly lucrative illicit market. A
   second layer in the pyramid emphasizes factionalism within the
   organizations as well as a process of contracting out for much of the
   violence to youth gangs and specialists. And a third perspective on the
   violence puts less emphasis on organizations and more on the
   degeneration of norms and inhibitions.},

Abstract = {With the arrest and conviction of members of the Greek Revolutionary
   Organization 17 November in the early 2000s, the chapter appeared to be
   closing on one of the last of a generation of urban guerrillas in
   Western Europe. Before the end of that decade, however, not only had a
   new batch of violent political organizations arisen in Greece, but the
   country had also experienced its worst social unrest in over thirty
   years. With a view to helping fill an emerging descriptive and
   analytical gap, this article summarizes key features of political
   violence in Greece between 1974 and 2011, and highlights the importance
   of three factors to explaining the resumption of organized political
   violence in the 2000s: the socio-economic environment, the treatment of
   radical demands by the political system, and the dynamics of violence
   between the state and non-state groups. In so doing, the article
   includes an unprecedented account of the role of the state and far-right
   organizations in the escalation of political violence in Greece. The
   article goes on to critically review expert, political, and media
   accounts of the evolution of political violence in the country, and
   concludes by considering pertinent policy implications.},

   Association Recent research suggests that double taxation treaties
   (DTTs) increase bilateral foreign direct investment (FDI). However,
   entering such a tax treaty is not unambiguously favorable for both
   partners if their bilateral FDI positions are asymmetric. Due to the
   usual bias toward residence-based taxation in DTTs, net capital
   importers can face a considerable loss of tax revenues when entering
   these treaties. Nevertheless, there is an ever denser and growing global
   network of such treaties. This article argues that net capitalimporting
   countries are caught in a prisoners dilemma: Collectively, they would be
   better off refusing to sign DTTs, but each one has an incentive to sign
   DTTs to gain a competitive advantage. Countries will look toward and be
   influenced by the policy choices of other focal countries and will
   follow their DTT activity. We find evidence for such spatial dependence
   in our analysis of DTT diffusion in a global sample over the period
   19692005. Dyads are more likely to sign a DTT the more DTTs have
   previously been concluded by the regional peers of the dyad members as
   well as by other countries who compete with at least one of the dyad
   members in terms of export product structure.},

   International Studies Association How do international organizations
   deal with the persistent challenge of uncertainty? The most intuitive
   answer is through regulation. Yet, rules are not always the best
   solution in times of uncertainty or in dealing with complex and diverse
   problems. More ambiguous policies that leave room for interpretation,
   can often be more functional for an international organization (IO);
   moreover, ambiguities can also be a source of powerand are therefore
   often a subject of conflict among institutional actors. Focusing on the
   case of International Monetary Fund conditionality policy, this article
   provides several key insights into IO practices. It provides an account
   of the different forms that ambiguity can take in international
   organizations and develops an explanation for why institutional
   ambiguities appear and persist. Looking inside the IO black box, the
   study examines how interests, institutional culture, and legitimacy
   concerns shape actors support for ambiguity, and how these preferences
   combine with broader structural factors to produce a predisposition
   toward institutional ambiguity. Finally, this article points toward
   certain implications of organizations tendency toward ambiguity,
   suggesting that this may play an important role in enabling
   institutional expansion.},

Abstract = {This article provides a framework for the comparative study of
   international systems. By analyzing how international systems are
   framed, scripted, and performed, it is possible to understand how
   interstate relations are interpreted in different historical periods and
   parts of the world. But such an investigation also has general
   implications-inter alia for a study of the nature of power, the role of
   emotions in foreign policymaking, and public opinion formation. Case
   studies are provided by the Sino-centric, the Tokugawa, and the
   Westphalian systems. As this study shows, the two East Asian systems
   were in several respects better adapted than the Westphalian to the
   realities of international politics in the twenty-first century.},

Abstract = {Cyprus is a divided island. Despite the lack of a comprehensive peace
   agreement reunifying the country, in 2004 trade commenced across the
   Green Line that separates the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities. The
   volume of trade has grown steadily since, but has it reached its full
   potential? First, a gravity equation is estimated by using an
   `out-of-sample' estimation strategy to predict potential trade for the
   period from 2004 to 2009. We observe a sizable gap between potential and
   actual volumes of trade. We then attempt to account for this gap by
   analyzing economic, legal, and social-psychological barriers that can
   explain this difference. It is found that (1) actual trade has only
   reached around 10\% of its potential, with (2) legal constraints
   accounting for 35\% of the missing trade, (3) extra transportation costs
   for about 5\%, and (4) unmeasurable and social-psychological barriers
   for a significant amount of between 48\% and 60\%, depending on the
   year. The findings suggest that attention must be paid to the objective
   barriers to trade as well as the subjective interpersonal and
   intercommunal perceptions that can affect trade and ultimately, peaceful
   resolution of the conflict. These findings have implications for other
   conflicts in which divided communities with the potential for trading
   across a shared border seek to maximize the joint economic and political
   gains of emerging interdependence.},

Abstract = {Since the end of the civil war in the early 1990s, Peru's tourist
   industry has been organized around an obsession with the Incan past. One
   rapidly growing segment of the industry aims to allow tourists to
   experience the Q'ero mysticism of the highlands in a somewhat
   ``authentic{''} context. A case study of a center of this spiritual
   tourism in the Sacred Valley of the Incas that focuses on the
   transmission of energy healing rites raises questions about the
   possibility of real cultural exchange under conditions of asymmetry and
   about the impact on indigenous communities of this appropriation and
   commodification of their spirituality.},

Abstract = {Croatia represents in many respects a unique case in the world in the
   way it standardized the right to vote, the electoral model, and the
   pattern of political representation of the diaspora in the national
   parliament. Besides standard theoretical arguments that explain the
   right of diaspora members to vote in parliamentary and presidential
   elections in the country, the authorities made use of a number of
   contextually specific political, economic, military, and moral reasons
   for that. It was shown that principled reasons which were used to
   justify legalizing diaspora voting rights and institutionalization of
   special electoral models as well as the patterns of political
   representation in the Croatian parliament were subordinated to the
   interests to symbolically integrate the Croats from Bosnia and
   Herzegovina in the political system of Croatia, who would then, as a
   sort of generic voters, secure safe votes and bonus seats for the
   Croatian Democratic Union.},

Journal = {POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY},

Volume = {33},
Number = {5},
Pages = {723-742},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Although a considerable amount of research exists regarding the transfer
   of political orientations within the family, little systematic attention
   has been devoted to studying the transmission of place (territorial)
   identities in contexts where such identities constitute a basic cleavage
   of political competition. This article examines the transfer of place
   identities in Catalonia, Spain, where contending identities, along with
   left-right ideology, give shape to a distinctive regional political
   life. Using data from region-wide household surveys, we analyze the
   reproduction of place identities as observed in parent-child pairs and
   triads and find that it exceeds the reproduction of other political
   orientations, including left-right self-location and party preference.
   The direct transmission model fares well against the rival hypothesis of
   indirect transmission via parental social characteristics and the
   competing impact of the local context. Parent-child congruence varies
   according to the homogeneity of parental place identities, the same-sex
   and cross-sex combinations of parents and their children, and the ethnic
   composition of neighborhoods.},

Abstract = {This article addresses a ``goals paradox{''} that suggests that both
   congruence and diversity in organizations' goals influence success in
   collaboration. Using extensive empirical data, we develop a framework
   that portrays goals as an entangled, dynamic, and ambiguously
   hierarchical web of variously perceived, higher- and lower-level goals
   that can be characterized across six dimensions: level, origin,
   authenticity, relevance, content, and overtness. We then explore the
   paradox in terms of the framework and so propose a much elaborated
   theoretical understanding of it. This provides theoretical and practical
   understanding relevant to management and governance in and of
   collaboration.},

Abstract = {This article makes both a theoretical and empirical contribution to
   understanding economic nationalism. It does this first through providing
   an appropriate definition of the term. Taking issue with the generalised
   remit of economic nationalism in recent writings, it suggests that it
   consists of practices to create, bolster and protect national economies
   in the context of world markets. Taking this definition, the subsequent
   history section identifies economic nationalism's rise in the late 19th
   century, the impetus of crisis after 1929 and its institutionalisation
   after 1945. Simultaneously, the accelerating growth of world markets
   through greater exports undermined the reality of national economies.
   This takes us to the period after the financial crash of 2008. In its
   aftermath, commentators warned of a resurgence of economic nationalism,
   that is, protectionism. Some states did increase tariff levels but this
   has not led to a generalised increase in barriers to trade in the
   pursuit of national economies for interrelated reasons: (1) the
   integration and therefore interdependency of economies; (2) the
   complexity of the global economy, making it all but impossible to
   separate by nationality; (3) the greater extensity of world markets
   compared to the mid-20th century; (4) the redundancy of the various
   models of economic nationalism.},

Volume = {10},

Abstract = {This paper examines the compliance of the system of financing the local
   self-government in Slovenia with the basic principles of the theory of
   decentralisation, and with the guidelines of the European Charter of
   Local Self-Government, thereby focusing primarily on the level of
   coverage of costs within the municipal competence by using the allocated
   appropriate expenditure resources. We ascertained that, overall, during
   the observed period from 2007 to 2009, the Slovenian municipalities were
   adequately supported financially because average expenditures were
   around 9\% lower than the appropriate expenditure resources. Major
   system anomalies were detected in a micro-analysis of selected groups of
   municipalities, especially through a relatively large range between the
   lowest and highest costs. The range was between (sic)319 and (sic)1,167
   per capita (an average of (sic)527). A similarly great range was
   perceived also in the appropriate expenditure amount (between (sic)416
   and (sic)1,196 with an average of (sic)558), and in the index of
   resource coverage with expenditures where the range was between 0.50 and
   1.75 (an average is 1.09). In spite of the fact that there were fewer
   than 15\% of the municipalities that fell under the threshold
   categories, the sustainability of the entire system worsened due to the
   cross-impact effect when a relatively small amount of appropriate
   expenditure belonged to some municipalities with high costs. This was
   especially evident in the case of urban municipalities. Thus, urban
   municipalities recoded, on average, up to +13\% more costs with an
   average of 26-percent smaller value of the appropriate expenditure
   amount.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the relationship between international
   election observation, election fraud, and post-election violence. While
   international electoral missions could in principle mitigate the
   potential for violence by deterring election fraud, the ability of
   international observers to detect manipulation may in fact induce
   violent uprisings. Serious irregularities documented by international
   observers provide credible information on election quality, which draws
   attention to election outcomes and alleviates coordination problems
   faced by opposition parties and society. When elections are manipulated
   to deny citizens an opportunity for peaceful contestation and
   international observers publicize such manipulation, violent
   interactions between incumbents, opposition parties, and citizens can
   ensue. Consequently, the author expects that fraudulent elections
   monitored by international organizations will have an increased
   potential for subsequent violence. This expectation is evaluated
   empirically in an analysis of post-election conflict events for African
   elections in the 1997-2009 period. Using original data on electoral
   manipulation and reputable international election observation missions,
   findings show that the presence of election fraud and international
   observers increases the likelihood of post-election violence. Matching
   methods are employed to account for the possibility that international
   observers' decisions to monitor elections are endogenous to the
   occurrence of violence in the electoral process. Results for matched
   samples confirm the findings in the unmatched sample. A variety of
   robustness tests show that the results are not influenced by the
   operationalization of independent variables and influential
   observations.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the structures of civic networks and their
   roles in steering the political choices of party and union elites
   regarding the retrenchment or expansion of welfare states in four
   recently democratized developing countries. Utilizing coaffiliation
   networks built upon two waves of World Values Surveys and evidence from
   comparative case studies for Argentina, Brazil, South Korea, and Taiwan,
   the study develops two explanatory factors that account for variations
   in welfare politics: cohesiveness and embeddedness. In Argentina and, to
   a lesser degree, in Taiwan, party and union leaders' cohesive
   relationships, being disarticulated from the informal civic sphere,
   allowed them to conduct elite-driven social policy reforms from above,
   by launching radical neoliberal reforms (Argentina) or by developing a
   generous transfer-centered welfare state (Taiwan). In Brazil and South
   Korea, however, party and union leaders' durable solidarity embedded in
   wider civic communities enabled them to resist the retrenchment of
   welfare states (Brazil) or implement universal social policies (South
   Korea) based on bottom-up mobilization of welfare demands. This article
   demonstrates that elites in the formal sector make markedly different
   political choices when confronting economic crisis and democratic
   competition depending upon their organizational connections in formal
   and informal civic networks.},

Abstract = {Using a well-grounded theory of organizational citizenship behavior,
   this study attempts to extend the meaning of the good soldier syndrome
   beyond its common boundaries of the business sector. We follow
   Bettencourt's (2004) conceptualization and model of change-oriented
   organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) to explain why and how public
   employees engage in activities targeted at changing and improving the
   public work environment and its job processes even when no formal
   rewards are offered in return. We extend Bettencourt's model and
   demonstrate its usefulness and contribution to public administration
   organizations, focusing especially on leadership behavior, leader-member
   exchange relations, and perceptions of organizational politics in public
   agencies. A field study of 217 public personnel in a large public health
   care organization yields interesting findings, demonstrating the
   uniqueness of change-oriented OCB over classical OCB measures
   (individual and organizational), the general positive effect of
   leadership on OCB and the moderating effect of perceptions of politics
   in this relationship. Implications of the findings are developed and
   discussed in the context of modern public administration.},

Abstract = {During its period in office (1996-2007), the Liberal National coalition
   government increased stratification in the Australian welfare system by
   differentiating the norms and instruments applied to claimants groups.
   This article explores whether Australians accurately registered these
   developments by comparing voter assessments of policy generosity to
   different groups with an objective assessment of the direction of policy
   change. We find that voters were more likely to have recognised
   increased generosity to the middle class, and to have underestimated the
   tougher policies faced by some groups at the bottom of the socioeconomic
   scale. Their misrecognition of hardship raises broader questions for the
   political sociology of the welfare state.},

Title = {Incumbents, successors, and crisis bargaining: Leadership turnover as a
   commitment problem},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {49},
Number = {4},
Pages = {517-530},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Leadership turnover may produce significant foreign policy changes when
   leaders differ from their predecessors in their preferences over the
   resort to war and when they cannot commit to implement inherited
   policies. How, then, does the expected behavior of an incumbent leader's
   successor affect crisis bargaining in the present? I analyze a
   leader-centric model of crisis bargaining in which (a) the distributive
   outcomes of crises affect political survival, (b) leadership turnover
   implies the accession of a new leader with potentially different
   preferences, and (c) successors can renegotiate inherited settlements.
   In equilibrium, the sensitivity of an incumbent's political survival to
   making concessions interacts with the resolve of the successor to affect
   both the terms of settlement and the occurrence of war. First, political
   survival incentives can lead an incumbent to demand more than her
   adversary is willing to concede, provoking war when the successor is of
   similar resolve. Second, when a politically sensitive incumbent will be
   followed by a resolute successor, her adversary may grant otherwise
   unnecessary concessions to bolster the relatively irresolute incumbent
   in office. Finally, when a politically sensitive incumbent will be
   followed by an irresolute successor, her adversary may attack in order
   to depose the incumbent, hastening her replacement to secure better
   bargains in the future. Predictions about the present balance of resolve
   and leaders' survival incentives may thus be fundamentally altered in
   light of the future balance of resolve.},

Abstract = {The ``proximate casualties{''} hypothesis holds that popular support for
   American wars is undermined more by the deaths of American personnel
   from nearby areas than by the deaths of those from far away. However, no
   previous research has tested the mechanisms that might produce this
   effect. This omission contributes to three areas of lingering
   uncertainty within the war support literature: whether national or local
   losses have a greater effect on war support, whether the negative
   effects of war deaths are durable or temporary, and whether the negative
   effects of war deaths have a greater influence on the most or least
   attentive citizens. Analysis of Iraq War data shows that local losses
   have a greater effect on war support than national losses, that these
   casualty effects decay rapidly, and that citizens who closely follow
   news at the national and local levels are least affected by new
   information about war costs. These findings run contrary to the
   prevailing cost-benefit calculus model of war support.},

   been important studies that have mapped the fields of peace studies (PS)
   and conflict resolution (CR), the focus usually has been on tracing
   their historical evolution and typical areas of application. In
   contrast, this article aims to examine PS and CRs philosophical
   assumptions and commitments, topics more rarely investigated. Rather
   than assuming that CR and PS are analyzing, diagnosing, and addressing
   conflict in the same way, this study will trace their respective
   philosophical genealogies (including, where possible, variations within
   each) and the concrete implications of these stances in terms of
   intellectual wagers about power, truth, structure, and conflict. These
   findings will tell us more about what is happening in these two fields
   and guide future study.},

Abstract = {The recent turn to China's traditions has the potential to correct for
   the Eurocentrism of Political Science theories. Nevertheless, the
   overwhelming emphasis on political thought, especially Confucianism, may
   have its drawbacks. This article suggests that political scientists who
   are interested in building theories and drawing policy implications
   should study the verifiable, i.e., history. Unless the purpose is to
   study philosophy for its own sake, political scientists should study
   political thought in practice, rather than political thought divorced
   from history. This article first discusses why it is important to
   examine history beyond thought. It then analyzes why scholars should not
   conflate political thought with historical practice. It anchors the
   analysis with a high-profile recent book on ancient Chinese thought.},

Abstract = {This rejoinder article takes the contributions in the Special Issue of
   Cooperation and Conflict - Vol. 46(3) - on Neutrality and `Military
   Non-Alignment' as point of departure for a discussion of some of the
   problems former neutrals face in shaping their foreign and security
   policies. The author argues that current and future developments
   regarding neutrality norms are dependent on internal factors such as
   national identity and public opinion, and on external factors such as
   the military non-aligned states' relationships to EU, NATO and, not
   least, the UN. The possibility of a `Second Option' of full-scale
   military cooperation if a preferred neutral position fails is discussed.
   Increased UN activism, for example, connected with the R2P concept and
   the tendency to outsource major UN-mandated military operations to NATO,
   is touched upon as well as the Libya crisis of 2011 and some of its
   implications for European foreign and security policy cooperation.
   Special attention is given to current Swedish debates on military
   non-alignment and NATO membership.},

   Association While delegation to international organizations has received
   substantial attention in the international relations literature, the
   issues of institutional choice and delegation levels remain
   understudied. Existing research examines donor countries decision to
   distribute aid bilaterally or turn to a multilateral organization; this
   article shifts the focus toward a closely related, but often overlooked,
   decision that donors need to makethat is, they select an agent from a
   range of international organizations and determine the level of
   delegation to a given agent. I argue that in their delegation decisions,
   donors are guided not only by standard calculations of delegation costs
   and benefits, but also by policies that international development
   agencies adopt and implement. These policies are shaped by member
   governments preferences, and a donor country will delegate more to the
   organizations whose members have foreign policy preferences more in line
   with the donor countrys own preferences, ceteris paribus. The article
   presents a set of empirical tests that lend support to this argument.
   Cross-country data on European development aid given during the period
   19602000 are used in the analyses.},

Abstract = {How do perceptions of procedural fairness shape the preferences that
   citizens have for transitional justice (TJ) in postauthoritarian
   countries? This article uses original opinion poll data collected in
   Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic to investigate this question. It
   shows that differences in the demand for TJ are explained by how
   citizens perceive whether the TJ process commits errors-that is, whether
   the innocent are condemned (falsely convicted) or the guilty are
   exonerated (falsely acquitted). This is so even after accounting for
   threat perceptions of former autocrats and voting behavior. After
   comparing the ways in which citizens' perceptions of errors in the TJ
   process shape their demand for lustration in the three postcommunist
   countries, the author discusses the implications of these findings for
   scholars of democratic consolidation, social psychologists, and policy
   makers designing TJ systems.},

Abstract = {State weakness is one of the main obstacles for democratic stability.
   Yet under certain circumstances even a mere electoral democracy may gain
   stable support from the citizenry. Mere electoral democracy is best
   understood as a regime of elite governance endowed by a certain support
   from the citizens but without any ambition of the ruling elite to
   increase the quality of democratic rule. This article explores the
   historical reasons of this specific type of political regime in Bosnia
   and Herzegovina, Croatia, and Serbia. Departing from the empirical
   examples from the Western Balkans, the article comes to some rather
   general conclusions about the concept and sequence of democratization:
   Conducting elections too early may produce serious challenges to
   sustainable democratization. The general population's primary interest
   mostly lies in the stabilization of state apparatus and its ability to
   produce common goods rather than in the fast establishment of electoral
   democracy and formal democratic institutions. For a better understanding
   of the real level of specific course and paths of democratic
   ``consolidation,{''} the democracy rankings like Nations in Transit and
   Bertelsmann should focus on in-depth analyses of the main actors'
   political and economic practices.},

Abstract = {The rights-based approach to development has swept through the global
   development assistance sector during the last fifteen years. As a
   result, bilateral development donors, international organizations, and
   development-oriented nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) are
   increasingly committed, in theory, to implementing human rights. This
   commitment has dramatically accelerated the discursive and
   organizational merger of the global human rights and development policy
   communities. What impact-if-any has the rights-based approach had on the
   structure, resources, and work styles of development NGOs? This article
   offers five empirically grounded hypotheses to guide future research.},

Abstract = {This article discusses the shifting roles of the Norwegian state as
   landlord and entrepreneur in developing and maintaining its national oil
   and gas industry. Drawing from endogenous-growth and small-state
   theories, the article discusses the roles of the Norwegian state as
   infant industry developer, mature industry controller, and national
   company owner. The Norwegian petroleum experience shows how a
   nation-state expressed clear visions and goals for an industrial sector,
   and took the role as leader of industrial and economic developments
   itself. The case argues that for a strategic national industry to be
   competitively developed and retained and social goals reached, a strong,
   comprehensive, and dynamic interaction between the state and industry,
   led by the state, may be necessary.},

Abstract = {Returning to liberalism's Scottish Enlightenment precursors suggests
   that the liberal order might best be described by the tension between
   its assertions about the smoothing natural harmonies within the social
   order and its doubts about whether those harmonies can appear
   spontaneously and therefore require aggressive projects of reform and
   correction. Although committed to the inevitability and inexorability of
   progress, such doubts led Scottish Enlightenment figures to strategies
   that even today continue to mark liberalism's effort to purify modern
   progress of tragedy's taint. We continue to justify apparent social
   failings as necessary to the natural order, regarding them instead as
   advantages in a Providentialist manner (Smith and Hume). We preserve our
   faith in commercial society by aggressively reforming and correcting
   those inside and outside others who resist the inevitabilities we have
   embraced (Millar). We accept the disorders and instabilities inherent in
   modern market society, but replace our hope in the automaticity of
   adjustment with a belief in the capacity of the state or some form of
   international governance to resolve tensions in some higher-order
   liberalism (Steuart). We call for a moral revival to restore values that
   our contemporary liberal institutions cannot possibly sustain
   (Ferguson). In sum, maintaining liberalism's idealised vision of itself
   in the face of these necessary limits and ill consequences calls forth
   the purificatory zeal of the fundamentalist. If we wish to move past a
   response that offers us more liberalism and more zeal as a solution to
   the problems of liberalism, we need something that is both within and
   beyond liberal fundamentals: a liberalism that accepts truths beyond
   itself; that looks to multiple ontologies for political and ethical
   resources; and that accepts plural and multiple versions of virtue and
   progress negotiated between liberalism's fundamentals and varying local
   ideals and conditions. Journal of International Relations and

Abstract = {This article examines the effect of UN actions on the duration of
   international crises. Four different types of action - assurance,
   diplomatic engagement, military involvement, and intimidation - and
   three different outcomes - compromise, victory, and stalemate - are
   considered. After building on the existing literature to develop
   expectations of how a third party like the UN shapes crisis
   trajectories, hypotheses are tested using the International Crisis
   Behavior (ICB) data and a new events dataset on UN activity. Results
   from competing-risks models reveal that UN military involvement does
   well to decrease the risk of one side achieving victory, and diplomatic
   engagement increases the ability of the belligerents to reach a
   compromise in the long run. Moreover, diplomatic engagement accompanied
   by military involvement substantially hastens the pace of stalemate
   outcomes. Both tactics, however, have some trade-offs. Military
   involvement can decrease the sense of urgency for compromise; diplomatic
   engagement can be used for insincere motives and increase the risk of
   one-sided victory over time. UN actions of assurance and simple
   intimidation have considerable shortcomings as crisis management
   vehicles.},

   Ukrainian Orange Revolution of 2004 are examined from the perspective of
   both the causes of popular engagement and the elite interaction. The
   authors argue that the model of Electoral Revolutions based on democracy
   promotion from outside and election fraud as a trigger for action does
   not fully explain either what brought people to the streets or why there
   was not a clear move to democratization in these cases. Instead, they
   show that corruption, failed administration, and state weakness were the
   triggers, that the opposition politicians were from the old
   administration, that people were repeating what they had done before in
   demonstrating, and that the mass movements did not result in the growth
   of civil society, increased popular engagement, or (on their own)
   significant democratization. (C) 2012 The Regents of the University of

Title = {The future of the modal split in China's greenest city: Assessing
   options for integrating Dalian's fragmented public transport system},
Journal = {POLICY AND SOCIETY},

Abstract = {Dalian used to have a very favorable modal split (for public transport)
   and had the honor of being an environmentally friendly city among its
   peers in China only a few years ago. However, momentous and when it
   comes to sustainability rather deleterious is evolving in the past five
   years or so: automobiles have flooded the city along with car-friendly
   policies being promulgated at both the central and local levels of
   government. Consequently, the market share of public transport has been
   substantially eroded since then. Apart from the rapid motorization that
   weakened Dalian's position as a green city, another factor fueling the
   downward trend of transit attractiveness has been the growing
   fragmentation in transit services. Given the fact that the motorization
   process is irreversible and restricting car purchase and use is unlikely
   to work out in China, if something needs to be done to maintain Dalian
   as a clean and comfortable living habitat, then lifting the
   fragmentation in the transit system is the only way to do this.
   Therefore, this paper explores where the fragmentation originates, and
   how it can be counteracted. A mathematical model is thus built to test
   the effectiveness of reducing fragmentation in improving transit
   service. And the results show that the modal split after system
   integration is going to tilt more strongly towards transit, while for
   service quality levels for users cannot expect much improvement. These
   modeling results have significant implications for the future public
   transport administration in Dalian. (C) 2012 Policy and Society

Abstract = {Charismatic and Pentecostal elements of global Christianity serve key
   roles in the production of free market hegemony within and between
   states, societies and markets across the world. While many of the
   institutions of these Christian social forces are fiercely
   decentralised, this popular global movement has converged on key
   elements of a shared conception of the world which links core,
   semi-peripheral and peripheral societies across national boundaries and
   class distinctions. These activities highlight the necessity of linking
   the emergent narratives on `global religious economy' with the larger
   narratives of Critical IPE. It is argued here that Gramsci provides us
   with useful conceptual tools with which we may contextualise specific
   transnational religious movements and social forces within the framework
   of globalisation and the production of neoliberal hegemony within and
   between specific states, societies and markets. International Politics

Abstract = {In this article we draw upon both critical and feminist international
   political economy (IPE) approaches in order to interrogate processes of
   change effecting specific localities in the context of neoliberal global
   restructuring. We give a closer focus to our interest in the
   global/local nexus by concentrating on issues of citizenship, community
   and discourse and practice on community cohesion. After setting out our
   framework, we develop a critique of community cohesion policies and
   practices in contemporary Britain. We then briefly review some of the
   current literature on gender and citizenship paying particular attention
   to how issues of material inequality, poverty and exclusion currently
   figure in academic debates. We conclude that gender inequality must be
   taken seriously if strong and cohesive communities are to be realised
   and that there is a need for further research that connects critical and
   feminist IPE to emerging critical literatures on community and
   citizenship. International Polities (2012) 49, 195-214.

Abstract = {In a recent paper Jan Ruzicka and Nicholas J. Wheeler have posited that
   the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) is an example of several
   trusting relationships. The authors assert that since the end of the
   1990s the trusting relationships embodied in the NPT have come under
   strain and that this accounts for the fact that the treaty is facing
   growing pressures that are eroding what has been an effective barrier to
   nuclear weapons proliferation. This article questions the assumptions
   underlying this analysis. It argues that the approach taken by Ruzicka
   and Wheeler fundamentally misconceives the dynamics of nuclear
   non-proliferation. The policy implications generated by this approach
   are impractical and downright dangerous as they fail to address the
   causes of proliferation and instead exacerbate the problem further.},

Abstract = {This paper presents an exploratory study on higher civil services in
   Latin American, based on the analysis of professionalization reforms in
   four countries: Peru, Chile, Mexico and Argentina. To provide a broader
   perspective, two international cases -New Zealand and Australia- are
   also included, since both countries were pioneer in the development of
   managerial capabilities in their public administrations, and have had a
   great impact in the modernization process in Latin America.
   Based on these six cases, both regional and international, we search for
   lessons and good practices for Latin America, under the assumption that
   the inclusion of regional cases allows for recommendations that consider
   local contextual conditions that either limit or favor reform
   implementation.
   The research on which this paper is based was developed for a consulting
   project commissioned by the Chilean government, with the goal of
   identifying experiences focused on the development of higher civil
   services at the national level, in order to nurture the Sistema de Alta
   Direceion Publica. The New Zealand and Australian cases were chosen for
   their inspiring role in the creation of the Chilean reform. Other three
   regional cases were also included because of their potential value to
   provide fresh ideas for its improvement: the Servicio Profesional de
   Carrera (Mexico), Cuerpo de Gerentes Publicos (Peru) and the Cuerpo de

Abstract = {This article begins with Marshall's essay on citizenship and its
   significance in confirming equal social standing, seen here as a
   precursor to work on rights and recognition. Taylor and Honneth are
   taken as exemplars of a dialogical perspective, whereby recognition
   through rights can provide a source of identity formation, though
   Honneth's approach is broader in scope, being less confined to the issue
   of cultural rights. This work is argued to be complementary to the
   status-based approach to rights found in Lockwood's work on civic
   stratification, and the insights derived from both authors provide the
   basis for interrogation of a legal case history on UK withdrawal of
   welfare from in-country asylum claimants. Analysis of this history draws
   attention to the role of judgment in forging a link between rights and
   recognition.},

Volume = {35},

Pages = {5-32},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {For almost two decades, experts and defense establishments the world
   over have been predicting that cyber war is coming. But is it? This
   article argues in three steps that cyber war has never happened in the
   past, that cyber war does not take place in the present, and that it is
   unlikely that cyber war will occur in the future. It first outlines what
   would constitute cyber war: a potentially lethal, instrumental, and
   political act of force conducted through malicious code. The second part
   shows what cyber war is not, case-by-case. Not one single cyber offense
   on record constitutes an act of war on its own. The final part offers a
   more nuanced terminology to come to terms with cyber attacks. All
   politically motivated cyber attacks are merely sophisticated versions of
   three activities that are as old as warfare itself: sabotage, espionage,
   and subversion.},

Abstract = {This article explores the effect of connectivity on strategic affairs.
   It argues that the effect on war's character is potentially, although
   not yet shown in practice, considerably large. Its effect upon the
   distribution of power among states in the international system is small,
   contrary to the claims of `cyberwar' alarmists. All told, however, its
   effect upon strategic affairs is complex. On the one hand, it represents
   a significant advance in the `complexification' of state strategies,
   understood in the sense of the production of intended effects. On the
   other hand, strategists today - still predominantly concerned with the
   conflicts and confrontations of states and organised military power -
   are generally missing the power which non-traditional strategic actors,
   better adapted to the network flows of the information age, are
   beginning to deploy. These new forms of organization and coercion will
   challenge the status quo.},

Title = {Turtles all the way down: bounded rationality in an evidence-based age},
Journal = {POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {33},
Number = {5},
Pages = {367-379},
Abstract = {Evidence-based policy-making (EBPM) has become both a catch-cry and
   aspiration of governments. Drawing on `the evidence', governments seek
   to focus on `what works' and so avoid the pitfalls of policy driven by
   ideology or values. Critics of EBPM remind us that the policy process
   remains messy and uncertain and that while research may deliver the
   latest scientific evidence, it is not always translated effectively into
   policy. We argue that the problems with EBPM run much deeper. This is
   not only because of the way in which knowledge is employed by
   policy-makers but because of the way in which knowledge is collected and
   communicated to policy-makers. It is well understood that policy actors
   are boundedly rational and this impacts upon the way in which evidence
   is used in the policy process. What has not been clearly articulated and
   is the focus of this article is that bounded rationality applies equally
   to the production of evidence. Drawing on the work of Polish
   microbiologist Ludwick Fleck we discuss how the process of
   systematically collecting and communicating evidence can undermine the
   aspirations of EPBM. We illustrate this argument with reference to
   recent policy debates about obesity.},

Journal = {TERRORISM AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE},

Volume = {24},

Pages = {825-852},
Abstract = {The article examines Israel's successes and failures during the Second
   Intifada. It argues that Israel's advances came from an effective
   counterterrorism campaign involving a mix of military operations,
   defensive measures, and in particular improved intelligence gathering.
   Domestic resilience also proved strong in the face of a brutal terrorism
   campaign. Yet long-term victory remains elusive for Israel. Deterrence,
   always difficult against terrorist groups, is growing harder for Israel.
   Hamas's control of Gaza, and the mistrust and hatred sown during the
   Second Intifada, have hindered a political deal between Israel and
   moderate Palestinians. Much of what went into successful
   counterterrorism, notably the security barrier and the aggressive
   campaign of raids and arrests, does not jibe with most visions of what
   peace would look like and makes a deal harder to achieve. To make a
   peace deal work, Israeli counterterrorism must change, with measures
   including relocating parts of the security barrier, bolstering moderate
   Palestinian politicians, and working with, as opposed to undermining,
   Palestinian security forces in the West Bank.},

Abstract = {Will China's development of a new generation of nuclear weapons impact
   US-China security relations in important ways? One's answer depends on
   how one views the following: whether or not Chinese leaders believe that
   they are only now acquiring a secure second strike capability; the scope
   of coercive power that secure second strike capability provides to
   conventionally inferior actors; the meaning of China's `No First Use'
   Doctrine; and the prospects for escalation control in future crises.
   Applying Cold War theories and tapping Chinese doctrinal writings this
   article concludes that China's nuclear modernization program might prove
   more consequential than is commonly believed.},

Abstract = {Understood as one among a number of world regions, North America is an
   enigma displaying many diverse realities. Seen in its formal
   institutionalization by NAFTA, it is considerably less than meets the
   eye. When examined in such governance spheres as transborder water
   management or the steel industry, it turns out to have considerably more
   substance than one might first have suspected. In other cases, such as
   the regulation of financial services or intellectual property rights,
   what appears as continental policy harmonization is really a
   manifestation of globalization. In contrast, antiterrorist border
   security measures are just what they seem: US-driven inter-governmental
   policy co-ordination in which the hegemon ends up depending on the
   periphery's collaboration. As for determining where North America is
   heading, global market consolidation in the automobile industry suggests
   that the continent has lost its chance to become a regional regulatory
   space. The 2005 Security and Prosperity Partnership (SPP) of North
   America may have renewed the three federal governments' commitment to
   reconciling the US priority for border security with the periphery's
   need for prosperity but it did not give any sign that North America was
   an embryonic EU about to develop along the lines of the European model.},

Title = {Preferences for Political Coalitions in Spain},
Journal = {SOUTH EUROPEAN SOCIETY AND POLITICS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {17},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {487-502},
Abstract = {Spanish political parties opt whether or not to form alliances with
   other parties for a number of reasons, one of which is the coalition
   preferences of their voters. This work explores to what extent party
   preferences and ideological proximity on the two main dimensions of
   political competition in Spain affect voters' coalition preferences.
   Using survey data from 2009, we find that voters' coalition preferences
   are greatly affected by ideological proximity, especially on the
   left-right axis, whereas decentralisation preferences are much more
   salient for the supporters of regionalist parties. However, this general
   pattern varies depending on the coalition being assessed.},

Title = {Political Violence and the Illicit Economies of West Africa},
Journal = {TERRORISM AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {24},
Number = {5},
Pages = {787-806},
Abstract = {This comparative analysis draws on field research in several West
   African countries to illustrate the dynamic relationships between
   political violence and organized crime in this sub-region. These
   relationships are often transactional, and almost always on a temporary
   basis. While some alliances of convenience may be forged, in other cases
   an adversarial relationship exists between organized crime and terrorist
   networks. In some cases, key actors within West African governments have
   benefited from these relationships. We then examine recent policies and
   strategies pursued by the U. S. and the international community that, in
   the name of combating terrorism, seek to constrain the illicit economies
   of the region, but in doing so may do more harm than good. The article
   concludes with some policy recommendations based on this analysis.},

Abstract = {After the Second World War, the United States led the world in the
   reform of global governance. It also articulated and implemented a grand
   strategy to cope with the bipolar order that the war had brought into
   being. Confronted at present with a comparable crisis in global
   governance amid massive shifts in the global distribution of wealth and
   power, the United States has yet to articulate a vision, lead reform
   efforts, or reformulate its global strategy. This lapse from leadership
   reflects changes in the US political system that reinforce a militarized
   approach to foreign policy and make it difficult, if not impossible, for
   the United States to formulate strategic initiatives or to implement
   them through diplomacy and other measures short of war.},

Abstract = {Latin America's military dictatorships in the 1970s produced some of the
   worst human rights abuses in the Americas in the twentieth century. The
   Catholic Church was positioned to denounce the repression, yet the
   episcopacy's reaction varied by country. Why? In critiquing a prominent
   claim that competition from Protestant sects was the primary source of
   this variation, the article argues instead that the history of
   Churchstate relations in a given country represents a path-dependent
   process presenting different incentives to Church episcopacies when they
   are faced with state violations of human rights. Where Church-state ties
   are close, episcopacies are not expected to publicly denounce the state.
   Where a strict separation between Church and state exists, denunciations
   of abuse are expected to be more forthcoming. This argument is
   illustrated with a comparison of Church-state relations in Argentina,
   Chile, Brazil, and Uruguay and re-assessed using a broader regional
   sample.},

Abstract = {The French State has been investing in the development of the
   information society, which has become an important frame of reference
   for local institutions. At the local level, municipalities are the
   leading actors constructing the information society. In some French
   municipalities, the introduction of the e-participation tool is still an
   ongoing process which generates debate. This chapter, based on a case
   study, discusses not only the factors that contribute towards the
   acceptance of the e-participation tools by local government actors but
   also why e-participation is rejected. The analysis shows that the
   attitudes towards e-participation by local councilors are mainly
   influenced by the degree of control they have over the device, and the
   vision of local democracy.},

Title = {The New Counterterrorism: Contemporary Counterterrorism Trends in the
   United States and Israel},
Journal = {STUDIES IN CONFLICT \& TERRORISM},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {35},
Number = {1},
Pages = {37-58},
Abstract = {In the first decade of the twenty-first century we are witnessing the
   emergence of a new form of counterterrorism in several democratic
   states. This new counterterrorism is ideological-religious in its
   rhetorical outlook, networked in its organizational structures,
   increasingly lethal in its operational tactics and more and more brutal
   in its methods. The shift to an ideological-religious discourse can be
   traced back to a conceptual transformation about the nature of
   terrorism, from the notion of terrorism as a ``crime{''} to that as a
   ``war{''}. The latter, differently from the former, requires ideological
   justification, which in states with strong religious constituencies,
   such as the USA and Israel, can partially be sought and acquired on a
   religious basis. Second, the new counterterrorism is based on
   normalization of extra-judicial means in the fight against terrorism.
   This has happened at three levels: by creation of overt and covert
   extra-jurisdictional domains-or legal black holes-outside of the human
   rights regimes of democratic states, by legitimization of torture at
   political, intellectual and popular cultural levels and by increasingly
   widespread use of extra-judicial killings of terrorist suspects. Third,
   the tactics used by new counterterrorism agencies are increasingly
   lethal and lead to disproportionately high number of casualties among
   innocent civilians. This development is to a large extent due to
   hardening of traditional counterterrorism targets and use of imprecise
   technology and intelligence in operations. Finally, the new
   counterterrorism is networked and often beyond the control of the
   judicial sovereignty of courts. This is largely due to informal contacts
   developed within the framework of the post 9/11 extraordinary rendition
   program and outsourcing and privatization of counterterrorism related
   activities and the ensuing contractual arrangements between state
   institutions and private enterprises.},

Abstract = {Uncommon sense - Inter-service rivalry and democratic control of the
   military This article examines civil military relations and Danish
   Defence Agreements. A principal Agent approach is taken in a case study
   of the creation of the first modem Danish defence agreement in 1960, in
   which Denmark was to honour NATO membership while discussing
   participation in NATO's forward defence and defence of Danish territory.
   The military and politicians exchange proposals and directives (1957-60)
   and NATO's supreme allied commander is involved. The result is a
   historic political consensus. The involvement of the three services in
   the process assists in balancing the information asymmetry and furthers
   a joint compromise shaped by political intent. A joint ideal in
   organizing the defence force has since promoted organisational evolution
   where military advice has been increasingly monopolised. This calls for
   increased attention to the institutionalisation of the agent in the
   effort to avoid information asymmetry and promote democratic control of
   the military.},

Abstract = {Do victims have particular demographic characteristics that
   differentiate them from non-victimized persons? Does ethnicity delineate
   between the victims and the non-victims of violence during armed
   conflicts, as the media often claims? Have the political cleavages
   dividing the communities increased the severity of violence? This study
   addresses these issues by analyzing data from ``the People on War
   project{''} (the PoW project) through latent class analysis (LCA). Data
   were collected by the International Committee of the Red Cross (the
   ICRC) at the 50th anniversary of the signature of the Geneva Conventions
   in 1999 throughout twelve armed conflict zones in the world.

Abstract = {Management pressures in fields like education force managers to control
   professionals. This generates friction. Professionals will not easily
   comply with control objectives; they feel responsible for clients and
   quality. Researchers have studied how professionals are affected and how
   they resist managerial interference. How managers themselves are
   affected by managerialism, whether they adopt control logics and are
   `driven away' from work floors, is hardly studied. This paper studies
   how school managers relate to managerialism and whether they are
   primarily loyal to managerial agendas, or to professional workers and
   clients. On the basis of a qualitative study, we conclude that school
   managers are important mediators of managerialism. They feel loyal to
   performance pressures, but also to teachers and pupils. How they act in
   specific situations depends on how they deal with this friction within
   managerial work.},

Abstract = {An evaluation of the success of the evidence-based ConRed program, which
   addresses cyberbullying and other emerging problems linked with the use
   of the internet and seeks to promote a positive use of this new
   environment. The main aims of the ConRed program are a) to improve
   perceived control over information on the internet, b) to reduce the
   time dedicated to digital device usage, and c) to prevent and reduce
   cyberbullying. The impact of the program was evaluated with a
   quasi-experimental design with a sample of 893 students (595
   experimental and 298 control). The results of the mixed repeated
   measures ANOVAs demonstrate that ConRed contributes to reducing
   cyberbullying and cyber-dependence, to adjusting the perception of
   information control, and to increasing the perception of safety at
   school.},

Abstract = {There are many small states in the international system, which have
   considerably fewer capacities than their bigger counterpart. The study
   of multilateral negotiations in the European Union (EU), conferences
   taking place under the umbrella of the United Nations (UN), negotiations
   on the set up of an International Criminal Court (ICC), as well as the
   compliance bargaining in the World Trade Organisation (WTO) reveals that
   small states can sometimes be very influential-despite their size. Small
   states tend to be most likely to punch above their weight if the
   negotiations take place in an institutionalised arena with
   majority-based decision-making rules in which each state has one vote or
   in contexts in which decisions are made unanimously, if they are
   selective in negotiations and concentrate their capacities on the most
   important issues, engage in capacity-building activities to maximise
   their ideational resources, if they make use of institutional
   opportunity structures such as chairing meetings and engaging in
   agenda-setting, and if they individually or collectively apply
   persuasion strategies from early on.},

Title = {Europe's deliberative intergovernmentalism: the role of the Council and

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {19},
Number = {2},
Pages = {161-178},
Abstract = {The European Union's (EU's) responses to the economic and financial
   crisis provided a vigorous illustration for how the role of the Union's
   core intergovernmental bodies - the European Council and the Council -
   has evolved in recent years. The European Council has emerged as the
   centre of political gravity in the field of economic governance. The
   Council and the Eurogroup fulfil a crucial role as forums for policy
   debate. The emphasis on increased high-level intergovernmental policy
   co-ordination is the reflection of an integration paradox inherent to
   the post-Maastricht EU. While policy interdependencies have grown,
   member state governments have resisted the further transfer of formal
   competences to the EU level and did not follow the model of the
   Community method. Instead, they aim for greater policy coherence through
   intensified intergovernmental coordination. Given its consensus
   dependency, this co-ordination system can best be conceptualized as
   deliberative intergovernmentalism.},
