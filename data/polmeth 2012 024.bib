Title = {Fighting the good fight? Legitimating violence in a world of contested
   and contingent moral frameworks},

Abstract = {Starting from violence's widely acknowledged status as a wrong, this
   article critically explores attempts to legitimate violence through
   appeals to moral frameworks that determine the ends for which violence
   may be employed. Recognizing that such frameworks exist on all sides of
   violent conflict, it argues that since there will never be complete
   agreement on their content or application, nor complete certainty about
   which moral framework is the `correct' one, it becomes impossible to
   distinguish legitimate from illegitimate violence either
   non-controversially or with certainity. Two problems result: our own
   `legitimate' violence may reproduce rather than limit violence by
   sparking `legitimate' violence in return, and our own use of violence
   may actually be unjust, despite our intentions. If we wish to avoid
   these problems yet maintain our moral commitments - however contested or
   contingent we must employ nonviolent means to wage our conflicts, as
   such means remain legitimate despite disagreement or uncertainty
   regarding ends. International Politics (2012) 49, 671-695.

Abstract = {This article presents empirical findings regarding the relationship
   between human rights awareness and corruption in provision of services.
   Drawing on a household database from central India and people's
   experiences of using public services, the impact of human rights
   awareness and training campaign is analyzed through a natural
   experiment. The study finds that the poor and the less educated are most
   penalized by corruption. Frequency of bribes paid by family business
   owners is higher than that of others. In all cases, awareness of human
   rights reduces incidence of bribery. The article concludes that a human
   rights awareness and training campaign even when not directed against
   corruption can significantly reduce corruption.},

Title = {Does it really take the state?},
Journal = {BUSINESS AND POLITICS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3, SI},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This paper explores the role of the state for an effective engagement of
   multinational corporations (MNCs) in corporate social responsibility
   (CSR). 1 In the OECD context, the ``shadow of hierarchy{''} cast by the
   state is considered an important incentive for MNCs to engage in CSR
   activities that contribute to governance. However, in areas of limited
   statehood, where state actors are too weak to effectively set and
   enforce collectively binding rules, profit-driven MNCs confront various
   dilemmas with respect to costly CSR standards. The lack of a credible
   regulatory threat by state agencies is therefore often associated with
   the exploitation of resources and people by MNCs, rather than with
   business' social conduct. However, in this paper we argue that there are
   alternatives to the ``shadow of hierarchy{''} that induce MNCs to adopt
   and implement CSR policies that contribute to governance in areas of
   limited statehood. We then discuss that in certain areas such functional
   equivalents still depend on some state intervention to be effective, in
   particular when firms are immune to reputational concerns and in
   complex-task areas that require the involvement of several actors in the
   provision of collective goods. Finally, we discuss the ``dark side{''}
   of the state and show that the state can also have negative effects on
   the CSR engagement of MNCs. We illustrate the different ways in which
   statehood and the absence thereof affect CSR activities of MNCs in South
   Africa and conclude with some considerations on the conditions under
   which statehood exerts these effects.},

Abstract = {Individualism, cultural pluralism, and pressures from globalization are
   putting a strain on matching demand and supply of public services.
   Citizens want tailor-made solutions, professionals in delivery systems
   need degrees of freedom to customize supply, and complexity brings along
   information asymmetries and strategic behavior. All this calls for a new
   look at interactive governance. This article develops a mode of
   situational contracting that reveals preference at the level of the
   individual actor, generates trust in mutual adjustment, and creates
   scope for customization and innovation in public management. It sets out
   a strategy, presents results of an early application in the Netherlands,
   and suggests further applications.},

Abstract = {Ethical issues and challenges inevitably arise during fieldwork and are
   a fundamental part of the research process. Too often, however, they are
   neglected. In following the standard trajectory of fieldwork, data
   analysis, write-up, and publication, scholars do not always spend enough
   time openly addressing ethical issues or sharing experiences from the
   field. The purpose of this article is to encourage and stimulate debate
   on research ethics, to demonstrate why research training (certainly in
   the UK) needs to give more priority to this issue, and to move away from
   what are often very abstract discussions by dealing with the subject in
   a concrete and practical way that draws upon personal insights. The
   article is based upon the author's experiences of conducting fieldwork
   in Bosnia-Herzegovina (BiH) in 2008 and 2009 and focuses on four key
   issues that arose-objectivity, interviewer-interviewee relationships,
   representation, and reward. Underscoring the limitations of ethical
   codes, it advocates a situational approach to research ethics that is
   sensitive to context and involves interviewees in helping us to develop
   more ethical research procedures.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the development over time of the automotive
   and textile industries post-1989 in four Central European countries in
   order to identify the key reasons behind sectoral growth or decline. The
   analysis demonstrates a divergent pattern of sectoral development, one
   that is in contrast to the perceived initial endowments of the countries
   and the structural positions of the sectors at the outset of the
   transition. Comparing the two sectors and individual success stories
   within them against a broader background of sectoral success and failure
   allows us to understand and isolate factors that lie behind the high
   status of the automotive sector by not only regional but also
   international standards. The article identifies three crucial factors
   that can be attributed to these outcomes: presence of foreign capital in
   the sector, active government support, and cooperative strategies among
   the firms in the sector and among the firms and other institutions in
   the countries.},

Journal = {BUSINESS AND POLITICS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {14},
Number = {2},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Among the factors providing incentives to monitor the behaviour of input
   suppliers are the regulatory requirements to which downstream firms are
   subject. We develop a formal economic model to examine the relationship
   between the strictness of the regulatory environment and downstream
   firms' incentives to act as inspectors of their sub-contractors. We
   consider the interaction between a downstream producer and an upstream
   input supplier. The downstream chooses the probability with which to
   monitor the upstream's compliance and the upstream chooses a compliance
   level which determines compliance of the end product with quality or
   environmental regulation. We find that the strictness of regulation
   affects the downstream's monitoring strategy in combination with the
   level of quality or environmental standards. If the standards are
   sufficiently low then the strictness of regulation increases incentives
   to monitor the upstream. Contrary, if the standards are sufficiently
   high then the pressure on the downstream to monitor the upstream is
   relaxed and the strictness of regulation decreases incentives to
   monitor. We argue that the strictness of regulation should not be
   treated in isolation as a factor determining the choice of downstream
   firms to monitor their input suppliers.},

Abstract = {Multiple public administration survey research projects have asked
   respondents to assess the level of red tape in their organizations. Many
   of these surveys use the following questionnaire item: ``If red tape is
   defined as `burdensome rules and procedures that have negative effects
   on the organization's effectiveness,' how would you assess the level of
   red tape in your organization?{''} Unfortunately, no research has tested
   the ways in which the language used in this item may bias responses.
   This research uses data from a 2010 national survey of 2,500 local
   government managers in the United States to test three variations of the
   Organizational Red Tape scale, investigating whether there is variation
   in perceived organizational red tape based on the question wording. The
   findings from this research contribute to the red tape literature by
   providing empirical evidence that the definition used in the
   Organizational Red Tape scale, a commonly used questionnaire item in
   public administration research, influences responses about red tape
   perceptions.},

Abstract = {The article reviews the relevant theory and research linking information
   and bargaining efficiency and presents results of an analysis of
   negotiation times associated with 290 franchise renewal agreements. Data
   reveal three main findings: (1) information revealing a history of poor
   performance by the supplier resulted in a 74\% increase in negotiation
   time, (2) a 1\% increase in the value of a contract increased
   negotiation time by 18\%, and (3) the participation of an expert
   resulted in a 24\% decrease in negotiation time. We also consider and
   test various moderator and mediator effects and conclude that the length
   of the previous relationship between the parties neither directly nor
   indirectly affects the negotiation time in a substantively meaningful
   way nor does it mitigate the negative effect of conflict history.},

Abstract = {In seeking to maintain their power, many African regimes rely on
   strategies of extraversion, converting their dependent relations with
   the external world into domestic resources and authority. This article
   assesses the relationship between extraversion and political
   liberalization, a dimension of African democratization that has been
   somewhat underappreciated in recent empirical studies. African countries
   vary in their extraversion portfolios, or the dimensions of their
   relations to the outside world that they can instrumentalize, and these
   variations correspond both to different degrees of vulnerability to the
   demands of foreign donors and to different preferences from the donors
   themselves. We find four quantitative measures of extraversion
   vulnerability to be statistically associated with the initial
   transitions of the 1989-1995 period and with the `consolidations' at
   different levels of democracy observable between 1995 and 2011. These
   findings shed new light on both democratic and hybrid regime
   trajectories in Africa.},

Title = {Similarities and Differences of Supply and Demand in the Training of

Abstract = {The training of public managers is a challenge for the reform and
   modernization of public affairs. In Chile, until 2009, just under half
   of the 58 existing universities offered master's programs related to
   public administration, public management, public policy and other
   similar topics.
   This work shows a study that reviews the correspondence between the
   supply of master's programs in the mentioned areas with the demand of
   different proposals, from both, the Latin American Centre for
   Development Administration (CLAD) and the Organization for Economic
   Cooperation and Development (OECD), as well as the theory of governance.
   This document focuses in the analysis of the training programs of
   Chilean universities and its consistency with public institutionalism
   expressed by the High Public Management System (SADP) of Chile. The
   study concludes by recognizing a clear line between these two
   dimensions, which may be due to the high linkage of both the supply and
   demand with the model of New Public Management (NPM).},

   Association International aid agencies are increasingly placing social
   accountability at the heart of their governance reform programs,
   involving a range of social activist mechanisms through which officials
   are rendered answerable to the public. Crucially, aid agencies are not
   just promoting these mechanisms in emerging democracies, but now also in
   authoritarian societies. What then are the likely political regime
   effects of these mechanisms? We approach this by examining who supports
   social accountability, why, and the implications for political
   authority. Focusing on the Philippines and Cambodia cases, it is argued
   that, to differing degrees, social accountability mechanisms have been
   subordinated to liberal and/or moral ideologies favoring existing power
   hierarchies. These ideologies often privilege nonconfrontational
   statesociety partnerships, drawing activists into technical and
   administrative processes limiting reform possibilities by marginalizing,
   or substituting for, independent political action pivotal to the
   democratic political authority of citizens.},

Abstract = {Chinese writings on international relations increasingly invoke history.
   In the past Chinese and foreigners alike have seen China's foreign
   policies through the lens of history, but recent Chinese stress on the
   ``harmonious world{''} resulting from Confucianism has shifted the
   discussion. It serves as a guide to resurgent claims for leadership, a
   source of legitimation for why China deserves leadership, and a warning
   of how its leadership may be abused to the detriment of countries
   agreeing to regionalism or multilateralism. Claims to superiority raise
   tensions in Japan, South Korea, and elsewhere where hopes had existed
   for a shared view of history. They arouse controversy among advocates of
   socialist ideology who fear that Confucianism will eclipse communism.
   The increasingly hereditary elite of Party leaders continues to bridge
   the gap between these two types of memory, but they face an ideological
   challenge at home and a credibility challenge abroad.},

   formation: Transversal consultation in the Belgian Mental Health Sector},
Journal = {POLICY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {31},
Number = {2},
Pages = {145-158},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This contribution focuses on a policy consultation process: the
   ``transversal consultation{''}. Launched in 2007 in the Belgian Mental
   Health Sector, this consultation had to capture the experience-based
   knowledge of service users and professionals involved in local projects
   aimed at experimenting working conditions in mental health care
   networks. This policy challenges the existing hospital-centred model of
   care, characterized by a medical approach and professional
   specialization, by promoting instead a pluridisciplinary approach in
   mental health care networks.
   In this contribution, a case of this transversal consultation process is
   analysed by relying on a theoretical framework drawn from the Sociology
   of Organizations and the Sociology of Public Action. The analysis
   emphasizes the strategic use that is made of the consultation process,
   and stresses the gap observed between its formal objective and its
   perceived outcome: more than producing experience-based knowledge about
   mental health care networks, the transversal consultation challenged
   power relations sustaining the current organization of the mental health
   system. It shortly discusses, as a conclusion, the outcome of the
   initiative. (C) 2012 Policy and Society Associates (APSS). Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {The Codex Espangliensis, a collective work dealing with political and

   interpretation of the pre-Columbian world, the conquest, the cultural
   transformations resulting from the collision between Western and
   indigenous worlds, and economic interdependence in present-day America.
   An analysis of the work achieved through concepts of the baroque shows
   how it uses baroque strategies, manifested in its physical form (one
   long foldable sheet, in the style of the pre-Hispanic codices), its
   mixing of historical periods and cultural referents, and its use of
   fragmentation and parody, all of which produce a defiant alternative
   reading that resists the flow of symbolic information supporting
   American official discourse.},

Abstract = {In a widely cited study, Collier, Hoeffler \& Soderbom show that
   economic growth reduces the risk of post-conflict peace collapse -
   particularly when the UN is present with a peace mission. These findings
   are encouraging for interventionist international policymakers. We
   replicate their study using data from the UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict
   Database instead of the Correlates of War database. We generate a series
   of different datasets on the basis of different coding criteria commonly
   used in the literature, and rerun a simplified version of their model.
   Our results do not support their findings regarding the risk-reducing
   effect of economic growth and UN involvement. At best, the results are
   mixed. Some of the models even suggest that economic growth may increase
   the risk of post-conflict peace collapse. Overall, we are forced to
   conclude that the impacts of economic growth and UN involvement on the
   risk of post-conflict peace collapse are neither clear nor simple. The
   differences in the results seem to be driven by two sources: the
   conflicts included in the original datasets and the coding of the start
   and end dates of the conflicts.},

Journal = {REVIEW OF POLICY RESEARCH},

Volume = {29},

Pages = {358-382},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {A vast economics literature embraces taxation of the carbon content of
   fossil fuels as the superior policy approach for reducing greenhouse gas
   emissions. However, experience around the world suggests that carbon
   taxes face exceedingly difficult political hurdles. Federal experience
   in the United States and in Canada confirms this pattern. This article
   reviews sub-federal policy development among American states and
   Canadian provinces, a great many of which have pursued climate policy
   development. With one major exception, explicit carbon taxation appears
   to remain a political nonstarter. At the same time, states and provinces
   have been placing indirect carbon prices on fossil fuel use through a
   wide range of policies. These tend to strategically alter labeling,
   avoiding the terms of tax and carbon in imposing costs. The article
   offers a framework for considering such strategies and examines common
   design features, including direct linkage between cost imposition and
   fund usage to build political support.},

Title = {Coalitions within the Egyptian Banking Sector: Catalysts of the Popular
   Revolution},
Journal = {BUSINESS AND POLITICS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Among the triggers of the Egyptian Revolution are the sentiments of
   resentment against the convoluted alliances between private businesses
   and policymakers that deprived the masses of their fair share of the
   high GDP growth. But does this indictment extend to the Egyptian banking
   sector? Based on a field survey and a dataset of 3218 business loans
   made by 33 banks during 1999-2010, this research differentiates between
   growth catalysts and crony coalitions within the Egyptian banking
   sector. The results of the Generalized Estimating Equations reveal that
   preferential lending to politically-connected businesses has a negative
   impact on employment and income distribution. Loans to small and medium
   enterprises and public firms help enhance income distribution and job
   generation, albeit that the soft-budget constraint on loans to public
   firms deters growth. The paper presents some policy recommendations that
   could help exorcise patrimonialism and clientelism and enhance growth
   alliances within the sector that controls most of the credit flow in the
   Egyptian economy. The study is not only of grave importance to the
   Egyptian nation whose members are actively engaged in refurbishing its
   institutional framework, but is of equal significance to other emerging
   economies that are keen to install equity, political stability and
   socioeconomic prosperity.},

Abstract = {Specialists used to study Tunisia's political system for its longevity
   and stability. It was an ``almost perfect{''} authoritarian state: the
   Ben Ali regime simulated consensus among different sectors,
   accommodating them and making compromises, while maintaining a virtual
   police state. Few specialists foresaw the 2010-2011 revolution. The
   crisis did not suddenly occur; rather it was a product of a lengthy
   political cycle. ``Cracks{''} in the system appeared, which provoked
   increasing scrutiny of the sources of the legitimacy of its power.
   Beyond conspiracy theories and romantic visions of revolution, this
   paper examines the emergence of an opposition movement over a long
   period of time, and tries to avoid interpreting the overthrow of Ben Ali
   as solely the result of a series of events.},

Abstract = {This paper compares the explanatory power of two models of UN
   intervention behavior: (i) an organizational mission model built around
   the proposition that variations in the amount of resources that the UN
   devotes to different conflicts primarily reflect the degree to which a
   conflict poses a challenge to the UNs organizational mandate of
   promoting international peace and stability and (ii) a parochial
   interest model that revolves around the purely private interests of the
   five veto-holding members of the UN Security Council (the so-called
   P-5), i.e., interests that are either unrelated to or at odds with the
   UNs organizational mandate. Examining data on UN conflict management
   efforts in more than 270 international crises between 1945 and 2002, we
   find that measures of the severity and escalatory potential of a
   conflict are significantly better predictors of the extent of UN
   involvement in international crises than variables that measure P-5
   interests that do not align with the UNs organizational mission of
   acting as a global peacemaker. This suggests that the UN adheres more
   closely to the humanitarian and security mission laid out in its Charter
   than critics of the organization often suggest.},

Abstract = {This article argues that international political economy (IPE) needs to
   engage in a close reading of computer code. This, I argue, will open up
   IPE to a very important resource for understanding and explaining many
   of the forces of capitalism operating today and which are instantiated
   and reflected within computer code. 1 also suggest a way in which the
   `global', particularly in relation to financial markets and systems,
   might be read from within the new space of flows represented by computer
   code and software. There is no doubt at all that software is a hugely
   important global industry, and that software is critical to the
   functioning of multinational companies, governments and non-governmental
   institutions. Therefore, it is curious that so little attention is paid
   to code itself as an empirical object within IPE. In this article, I
   want to introduce some of the main contours of the debate and introduce
   some important concepts for why a close reading of code could be useful
   to IPE scholars. International Politics (2012) 49, 277-296.

Abstract = {Flag use generates passionate debates that fundamentally turn on
   questions of the appropriate extent and limits of freedom of speech. The
   national flag is a natural and forceful medium with which to express
   one's views about a nation. Yet its use in this way also generates
   controversy and emotionally charged reactions. The purpose of this
   article is to assess attitudes in political culture towards flag use in
   the context of wider freedom of speech considerations. By analysing
   events in Australia, the United States and New Zealand, the article
   argues that public responses to flag use as a medium of political
   expression demonstrate a flawed understanding of the meaning, import and
   effect of freedom of speech and its limits. This has significant
   implications, exposing the extent of fragility of freedom of speech on
   controversial issues, and its persistence despite differences between
   jurisdictions in the manner and extent of free speech protection.},

Abstract = {The four state-like entities on the territory of the former Soviet Union
   that emerged about twenty years ago have successfully defended their
   precarious independence until today. However, we still know very little
   about the internal political developments in these de facto states,
   because so far most research has focused on the regional and
   international dimensions of the now ``frozen{''} secessionist conflicts
   which brought them into being. The authors of this issue argue that it
   is high time to have a closer look at the developments inside these de
   facto states for several reasons. First, in order to understand whether
   there is mutual dependence between internal political structures and
   processes and the chances of international recognition. Second, the
   post-Soviet de facto states are model cases for internal transformation
   or even democratization efforts as a strategy of internal and/or
   external legitimacy building. Finally, the issue proves that the
   reluctance of academia to analyze the political systems of these
   entities for fear of legitimizing regimes that do not deserve it is not
   reasonable: the post-Soviet de facto states are fully grown states for
   all but international recognition - they are not supposed to disappear
   because we refuse to admit this fact. (C) 2012 The Regents of the

Abstract = {We report the results of a study examining the effects of vertical
   strategic alignment (that is, the degree to which strategic stances are
   consistent across different organizational levels) on public service
   performance. Longitudinal multivariate analysis is undertaken on a panel
   of public organizations over four years. We find that alignment on a
   prospecting strategy leads to better performance, but that no such
   effect is observed for a defending strategy. We also find that high
   levels of prospecting alignment produce stronger positive performance
   effects in centralized organizations and when environmental uncertainty
   is high. The implications of these findings for research and practice
   are considered in the conclusion.},

Abstract = {This study presents a synthesis of quantitative and qualitative research
   on compliance with EU directives. We identify and code 12 theoretical
   arguments tested in 37 published compliance studies and evaluate the
   robustness and representativeness of their findings. Our synthesis
   reveals robust findings for the `goodness-of-fit' and `institutional
   decision-making' arguments, while results on `actors' policy
   preferences' and `administrative efficiency' remain ambiguous. A closer
   examination of the studies' research design suggests policy and country
   selection effects. Specifically, most studies focus on environmental and
   social policies and rarely include complying Scandinavian states and
   non-complying Southern states. We therefore recommend a cautious
   interpretation of existing compliance findings and, for future
   compliance research, a more careful selection of countries and policy
   fields.},

Abstract = {This paper challenges a conventional wisdom: that when discussing
   political systems, small is democratic. And yet, can there be paradises
   without serpents? The presumed manageability of small island spaces
   promotes and nurtures dispositions for domination and control over
   nature and society. In such dark circumstances, authoritarian rule is a
   more natural fit than democracy. By adopting an inter-disciplinary
   perspective, this paper argues that small island societies may be
   wonderful places to live in, as long as one conforms to a dominant
   cultural code. Should one deviate from expected and established
   practices, the threat of ostracism is immense. Formal democratic
   institutions may and often do exist, and a semblance of pluralism may be
   manifest, but these are likely to be overshadowed by a set of unitarist
   and homogenous values and practices to which many significant social
   players, in politics and civil society, subscribe (at least in public).},

Abstract = {With an unemployment rate over 20 per cent and following the passage of
   an economic austerity plan and the Prime Minister's announcement that he
   would not be standing again, the local and regional elections of 22 May
   2011 saw the incumbent Socialist Party obtain its worst results in the
   history of Spanish democracy and lose most of its municipal and regional
   power. In the Basque Country, Bildu, a coalition dominated by members of
   ETA's political wing, obtained very high popular support. We comment on
   the context, the campaign and the results of the elections and then
   discuss the extent to which the results are due to the economic crisis.},

Abstract = {This article aims to analyze a case of outward-bound move of state
   governments in the realm of external loans during the period of the
   so-called Old Republic (1890-1930) in Brazil. Based on the definition of
   ``financial paradiplomacy,{''} it argues that the Brazilian historical
   experience in this regard would have been a typical case of
   paradiplomatic action. Broad statistical survey of foreign loans
   borrowed by states, the rescue of primary sources about the subject and
   historical perspective give relevant support to characterize the period
   as a time of early financial paradiplomacy.},

Abstract = {Countries: the Case of NATO Response Force The aim of the contribution
   is to propose an answer to two questions: how do the governments bargain
   on the domestic level about foreign policy issues and how do the
   governments create budgets for short notice military deployments. To
   accomplish this goal, the article looks at the case of the NATO Response
   Force and how the eight former socialist countries from the Central and
   Eastern Europe, namely Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Lithuania,
   Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia, allocate resources for their
   national contributions. It uses theoretical propositions of two-level
   games and the bureaucratic politics model to help to understand the
   influence of the domestic politics on foreign policy issues in general
   and budgeting procedures in particular.},

Journal = {COMMONWEALTH \& COMPARATIVE POLITICS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {50},
Number = {1},
Pages = {27-52},
Abstract = {This paper offers a first comprehensive account of popular voting
   intentions in Africa's new electoral democracies. With reference to
   aggregate and survey data from 16 countries, this paper shows that
   competitive elections in Africa are more than mere ethnic censuses or
   simple economic referenda. Instead, Africans engage in both ethnic and
   economic voting. Not surprisingly, people who belong to the ethnic group
   in power intend to support the ruling party, in contrast to those who
   feel a sense of discrimination against their cultural group. But, to an
   even greater extent, would-be voters in Africa consider policy
   performance, especially the government's perceived handling of
   unemployment, inflation, and income distribution. Moreover, a full
   account of the intended vote choice in Africa also requires recognition
   that citizens are motivated - sincerely or strategically - by partisan
   considerations; they vote for established ruling parties because they
   expect that incumbents will win. This paper shows that voters attempt to
   associate themselves with prospective winners because they wish to gain
   access to material benefits and to avoid retribution after the election.
   These dynamics are most evident in African countries where dominant
   parties restrict the range of electoral choice.},

Abstract = {Institutional and economic development has recently returned to the
   forefront of economic analysis. The use of case studies (both historical
   and contemporary) has been important in this revival. Likewise, it has
   been argued recently by economic methodologists that historical context
   provides a kind of ``laboratory'' for the researcher interested in real
   world economic phenomena. Counterterrorism economics, in contrast with
   much of the rest of the literature on terrorism, has all too rarely
   drawn upon detailed contextual case studies. This article seeks to help
   remedy this problem. Archival evidence, including previously unpublished
   material on the DeLorean case, is an important feature of this article.
   The article examines how an inter-related strategy, which traded-off
   economic, security, and political considerations, operated during the
   Troubles. Economic repercussions of this strategy are discussed. An
   economic analysis of technical and organizational change within
   paramilitarism is also presented. A number of institutional lessons are
   discussed including: the optimal balance between carrot versus stick,
   centralization relative to decentralization, the economics of
   intelligence operations, and tit-for-tat violence. While existing
   economic models are arguably correct in identifying benefits from
   politico-economic decentralization, they downplay the element
   highlighted by institutional analysis.},

Abstract = {Since 2010, the financial crisis has raged across Europe, taking down
   governments of several members of the euro-zone in the process. Despite
   strong pressure for reform, and many meetings of heads of state, the
   problems are far from over. The crisis has been widely represented as a
   sovereign debt fiasco and a failure of fiscal policy by five peripheral
   member states (Greece, Portugal, Spain, Italy, and Ireland). However,
   the real causes of the predicament of the euro-zone are more complex. A
   satisfactory understanding of the crisis is only possible if we
   distinguish among four phases: background factors, including structural
   flaws in the original design of the Maastricht Treaty; capital flows and
   fiscal deficits; dynamics of divergence, especially regarding
   competitiveness; and the crisis dynamics. In this contribution we
   identify three sets of factors - i.e., market spillovers and policy
   externalities, insufficient information related to the management of
   risk, and perverse incentives related to the configuration of rules and
   institutions - that may lead to inefficient international outcomes in
   the environment of structural interdependence and full capital mobility,
   address how policy coordination can improve the results, explain how the
   euro-zone crisis developed, and explore a number of possible solutions.},

Pages = {25-42},
Abstract = {Explanations of the dynamics of EU judicial politics must also account
   for its incidence. Incidence relies on a relationship between three
   arenas those for norm-setting, litigation and judgments - with each
   conditioning the possibilities for action in the others. Through a study
   of all 2007-2009 preliminary rulings we find two predominant dynamics
   here. `Patrol norms' dedicated to securing common policies give rise to
   low salience judgments dominated by transnational enterprise and
   national administration litigation. `Thickly evaluative norms' are
   concerned with articulating certain values. Dominated by litigation by
   domestic undertakings and non-commercial actors, these norms generate
   the Court's most salient judgments.},

Title = {Reconciliation via Truth? A Study of South Africa's TRC},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Pages = {189-209},
Abstract = {Within the transitional justice literature, there is much speculation
   about the relationship between truth and reconciliation, yet little
   concrete empirical evidence. This is perhaps unsurprising, as measuring
   this relationship and proving causation poses significant challenges.
   Focused on South Africa's truth and reconciliation commission (TRC), the
   aim of this article is not to definitively answer the question of
   whether truth leads to reconciliation but rather to explore possible
   ways of gauging and assessing this. To this end, it poses and engages
   with three subquestions: Is truth-telling healing for victims, how much
   truth is needed for reconciliation, and is it enough that people simply
   accept the truth? The article's principal argument concerns the third of
   these questions. It proposes that for reconciliation to take place,
   acceptance of the truth is not sufficient. The truth must penetrate
   society to the extent that it helps to bring about fundamental changes
   in the way that people live their daily lives and relate to one another.
   Hence, in order to measure whether truth aids reconciliation, one
   possible approach is to focus on the practical and attitudinal effects
   of truth within a society. The impact of truth on behavior and outlook
   is an important area for future research. This is an empirical study
   that draws upon 15 semi-structured interviews conducted in South Africa
   in July and August 2010.},

Journal = {POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {33},
Number = {4},
Pages = {297-312},
Abstract = {This article analyses some of the `numbers' behind the migration
   phenomenon and immigration policy design in the USA. The principal aim
   of this study is to assess the use of quantitative data and analyses,
   migration statistics and the mass media to support the passage (or
   justify the failure) of recent key initiatives that affect undocumented
   or illegal immigration in the USA, in particular immigration originating
   in Mexico. The study concludes that the misuse of numbers, the
   production of media spectacles that present illegal immigrants as quite
   harmful for the US economy and society, and the politicisation of the
   immigration process in general, have had a major impact on recent failed
   attempts to reform the dysfunctional US immigration system. These
   factors also influenced the passage of Arizona's SB 1070 in 2010, as
   well as the recent passage of other anti-immigrant legislation in more
   US states. Overall, the `mathematics' of Mexico-US migration is not
   always reliable. Some questionable numbers have been recently used to
   justify inappropriate and ineffective migration policies.},

Abstract = {This article is concerned with exploring the recent observations of
   Lieutenant-General Lamb who stated that there was no simple binary
   between counterintelligence (COIN) and counterterrorism (CT).
   Specifically, the article will use the intelligence-gathering,
   assessment, and target identification processes and methods used on
   operations in Iraq and Afghanistan to examine this further. What makes
   this an interesting exercise is that the effectiveness of a COIN/CT
   intervention totally depends on whether an insurgent has been properly
   identified. If the wrong person has been targeted then kinetic,
   influence, or policing activities are at best exploratory and at worst
   wasteful or even positively harmful. Thus, by investigating the
   intelligence model that frames the way adversaries and communities are
   identified, it becomes possible to understand the limitations in the
   processes and methods used. At the same time this approach makes it
   possible to cast light on how and to what extent various techniques

Title = {Varieties of co-production in public services: time banks in a UK health
   policy context},
Journal = {CRITICAL POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {6},
Number = {4},
Pages = {402-433},
Abstract = {Time banking is a third-sector initiative that enacts principles of
   co-production and offers a model with which to understand how users can
   become actively involved with professionals and other stakeholders in
   the delivery of public services. This article explores possible lines of
   tension between principles that underpin time banking practices and
   principles informing the health policy field in the United Kingdom. We
   develop a framework rooted in the logics approach to critical policy
   analysis with which to track shifts in conceptions of co-production at
   three nodes situated along the full length of the public service chain:
   (1) service provision and distribution; (2) service delivery; and (3)
   service governance. Our analysis reveals discrepancies in the way
   co-production principles can be defined, interpreted, and linked to
   broader notions of social justice: recognition-based interpretations
   with a transformative accent, and choice-based interpretations with an
   additive accent. We conclude that the health care regime, if understood
   as a `regime of choice', will invariably prove to be a rather
   inhospitable environment for time banks, whose co-production principles
   are much more in tune with what we call a `regime of recognition'.},

Pages = {289-310},
Abstract = {How can one state maintain deterrence against another state undergoing
   an uncertain political transition? A debate within fourth wave
   deterrence theory focuses on whether and when a tailored approach, based
   on cultural, organizational, and idiosyncratic characteristics of a
   target state, has the greatest value. Tailored deterrence may not be
   appropriate under conditions of domestic political uncertainty in the
   target state, often those most in need of deterring. A more promising
   alternative for a defending state may be deterrence management.
   Deterrence management compensates for insufficient or low-confidence
   assessments of a target's values, organizational structure, power
   distribution, or cultural idiosyncrasies that prevent employment of
   tailored deterrence strategies intended to manipulate such factors. To
   make this case, I combine insights from deterrence theory with an
   exploration of the uncertain politics of a post-Kim Jong-il North Korea
   and the unpredictable process of power consolidation. Deterrence
   management may be applicable in cases of imperceptible leadership
   transitions in other target states. While no panacea, the deterrence
   management approach reinforces stability while remaining flexible enough
   to accommodate change.},

Abstract = {This article reassesses what is at stake in the historical turn in
   international relations (IR) and the attendant debate between the Second
   Wave of neo-Weberian historical sociology (WHS) and Political Marxism
   (PM). Firstly, it endeavours to recast what is at stake in the
   `historical turn' in IR: the critique of reification and chronocentrism.
   Secondly, it examines WHS's argument against reductionism in the light
   of Weber's own work. We show how the Weberian dualism between the
   politics and the economics inhibits its capacity to complete its project
   of historicizing IR. Finally, it explains why recent Weberian's defence
   of multicausalism creates even more obstacles on the road towards an
   ontologically consistent historical turn.},

Abstract = {It has been a general finding across Europe that very few job matches
   are facilitated by public employment services (PES). The article
   explains this failure by highlighting the existence of a double-sided
   asymmetric information problem on the labour market. It is argued that
   although a PES potentially reduces search costs, both employers and
   employees have strong incentives not to use PES. The reason is that
   employers try to avoid the `worst' employees, and employees try to avoid
   the `worst' employers. Therefore these services get caught in a low-end
   equilibrium that is almost impossible to escape. The mechanisms leading
   to this low-end equilibrium are illustrated by means of qualitative
   interviews with 40 private employers in six European countries.},

   to the Peace Process},
Journal = {TERRORISM AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {24},
Number = {5},
Pages = {671-705},
Abstract = {Increasingly, scholars are applying Social Movement Theory to explore
   how radical Islamist groups strategically employ framing to legitimize
   the use of violence. What has not been explicitly examined, however, is
   under what conditions radical frames are more resonant with the public
   than more moderate alternatives. This article argues that the strength
   of a particular frame depends on the credibility of the competing
   claim-makers. Drawing on public opinion polls from the Palestinian
   Territories, the article shows that the resonance of Hamas' frames
   vis-a-vis the peace process between 1993 and 2006 depended on the
   ability of the Palestinian leadership to maintain its legitimacy. Since
   the Gaza take-over and Hamas' shift to a position of leadership rather
   than opposition party, the organization's inability to deliver in the
   economic realm or to even feign any progress regarding the peace process
   damaged its credibility and reputation. Accordingly, its frames
   vis-a-vis the peace process also started losing their resonance with the
   public. An understanding of the dynamics of credibility can also help
   explain the continued moves towards national reconciliation between
   Hamas and Fatah.},

Abstract = {This article examines developments in the analysis of communal conflict
   over the past twenty years, exploring insights regarding the

   constructions of narratives making sense of civil strife. The piece
   compares analyses from differing paradigms and disciplines, including
   terrorism studies, the sociology of violence and war, and the
   anthropology of violence. The article explores how shifting emphases
   from both participants and analysts cast incidents of violence in a
   different light, proscribing differing potential intervention strategies
   and interpretations of outcomes. Highlighting these shifts provides new
   space for analyses and greater understanding of the potential costs and
   consequences of intervention.},

Journal = {CAMBRIDGE REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {25},

Pages = {123-142},
Abstract = {The main purpose of this article is to shift the dollar vs Euro debate
   away from US-EU centrism to perspectives from emerging markets. Drawing
   on 40 semistructured financial elite interviews in Brazil and China, the
   key research question studied here is whether the US dollar is
   malfunctioning as the leading international currency in these parts of
   the world, and, if so, whether the Euro can be an alternative to the
   greenback. The results show that the status of the dollar as the main
   anchor in the monetary system is seriously questioned among financial
   elites in China and Brazil. As yet, though, the Euro does not represent
   an alternative to the dollar because of its fiscal and political
   fragmentations. However, despite these institutional shortcomings, the
   European currency is seen as an ideational role model for
   super-sovereign monetary integration out of dollar unipolarity based on
   consensual negotiations not only on a regional, but also on a global
   scale.},

Abstract = {This article employs social constructivist approaches drawn from social
   movement theory and international relations to explain outcomes of
   insurgency and counterinsurgency. It argues that mobilizing civilians
   requires the formation of hegemonic social relations that legitimate
   coercive force in defense of the political community. Four social
   mechanisms are hypothesized to be relevant in the creation of hegemony:
   brokerage, diffusion, reflexive self-restraint, and self-fulfilling
   prophecies. This constructivist theory of hegemonic competition is then
   evaluated using a case study of insurgency and counterinsurgency in
   Iraq's al-Anbar province.},

Title = {French nuclear idiosyncrasy: how it affects French nuclear policies
   towards the United Arab Emirates and Iran},
Journal = {CAMBRIDGE REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1},
Pages = {143-169},
Abstract = {This article elaborates the notion of `nuclear idiosyncrasy' as a
   specific understanding of what nuclear weapons and energy are, what they
   stand for and what they can do. It then assesses the persistence of
   nuclear idiosyncrasy over time and its effects on French nuclear
   policies in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Iran. Based on interviews
   in France, Geneva and the UAE, this article contributes to three debates
   within foreign policy analysis and nuclear history. Is a regional
   approach necessary to understand the framing of foreign policies in the
   twenty-first century? Does a change in leadership fundamentally affect
   the orientations of nuclear policies? Are the risks of nuclear
   proliferation in the Middle East and the measures to prevent it
   similarly understood by all the players in the international community?
   First, it shows that French nuclear policies in the Middle East are not
   shaped by dynamics specific to the region as the often invoked notion of
   an `Arab policy of France' would suggest. Secondly, in-depth analysis
   leads one to reject the idea of a major change between the nuclear
   policies of Presidents Chirac and Sarkozy. Thirdly, persistent French
   nuclear idiosyncrasy leads also to rejection of the idea of convergence
   towards a shared understanding of the proliferation threat in the Middle
   East.},

   reformists and radicals within the Climate Camp. Contrary to surface
   appearances and expectations derived from previous studies of
   environmental direct action groups, it is found that Climate Campers do
   not share a radical approach. The consequent drift towards reformism
   caused tension and contributed to the demise of Climate Camp as a
   national network. One way to avoid future tension might be for all
   participants to recognise the value of a multi-pronged approach to
   solving climate change. Allowing the Camp to act as a bridging
   organisation would reduce potential for fragmentation and collapse.},

Abstract = {The implementation of the European Union Bird and Habitat Directives in
   the field of water infrastructure has caused severe project disruptions
   in the past. The prevalence of negative experience has triggered a new
   approach, which aims to integrate site-specific characteristics of
   ecosystem and project objectives during the development of the initial
   project design. This is termed integrated nature design. In this paper
   we advance the hypothesis that applying integrated nature design in
   Natura 2000 areas can increase the chances of a project being approved
   in case appeal is made to the courts. To test our hypothesis we have
   carried out a quasi-experimental comparison of two coastal zone
   development projects in the Netherlands. Our analysis demonstrates that
   a coastal development project in a Natura 2000 area has a greater chance
   of success if its design integrates nature, provided that the project
   administration and scientific findings are favourable.},

Abstract = {What should commitment to the norm of equality mean in human rights
   discourse? The focus of this article is on the relation between the
   intrinsically individualistic character of human rights-the fact that
   they apply to all individuals equally-and the other equalities that
   human rights discourse, in its broadest sense, has found it necessary to
   endorse. It is shown how, in order to take fuller account of specific
   aspects of human-rights-violating behavior that arise in the world as it
   is, a commitment to the norm of equality in human rights discourse
   should explicitly mean a commitment to three distinct, competing but
   interacting principles of equality. It is also shown how, because of the
   different balances they give to these principles, some influential
   liberal theories of nondomestic justice fail to properly capture the
   importance of this interaction to the human rights project at large. To
   that end, I explore two competing approaches to rights: that favored by
   some cosmopolitan-liberals and that proposed by John Rawls.},

   Association It is now widely accepted that the classic arguments
   regarding the structural power of business are too structuralist.
   Subsequent research has focused on a widening array of independent
   variables that shape the variability of such power. This paper extends
   this research tradition, arguing that structural power theory has given
   insufficient attention to governmental actors, typically the targets of
   such power. The paper argues that ideas and the ideational processes
   through which government and state leaders construct threat perceptions
   regarding structural power can be important in mediating such power. The
   literature on power typically argues that power shapes ideas and
   disciplines target subjects. This paper revises this logic by arguing
   that the ideas of target subjects can also shape power. The papers
   arguments then are essentially constructivist, but the paper extends
   such arguments by insisting on a greater role for agency than is often
   found in constructivist reasoning.},

   Security and Defence Policy},
Journal = {GLOBAL POLICY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {3},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {79-86},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This article puts forward the argument that the EU should be understood
   not as a nation-state in the making but as a new type of polity that
   could offer a model of global governance. It uses the example of the
   Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) to illustrate the argument. It
   suggests that CSDP is designed to make a contribution to global security
   rather than to protect borders using military force, as in the case of
   classic nation-states. It proposes that CSDP should be explicitly based
   on the concept of human security and should acquire human security
   capabilities that include both military and civilians operating
   according to human security principles in a way that is more like law
   enforcement than fighting wars. To achieve this, the CSDP would require
   stronger political backing and this would mean increasing the
   representativeness and accountability of the EU. By the same token, an
   effective CSDP would increase the legitimacy of the EU. Policy
   Implications center dot The EU should explicitly adopt the concept of
   human security as a basis for external security policy both at the level
   of high and low politics. center dot CSDP should be greatly strengthened
   with more resources devoted to the kind of military and civilian
   capabilities required for human security missions. center dot New
   mechanisms, including perhaps a pan-European election for a single
   president of the Commission and Council should be introduced in order to
   increase the accountability and deliberative engagement of the Union.},

Title = {Should I stay or should I go? A comparative study of banking sector
   policies and the strategies of Central American business groups},
Journal = {BUSINESS AND POLITICS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {14},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The article seeks to explain how policies affect business groups'
   decisions to stay or leave a sector of activity in a liberalized
   economy. The article utilizes a comparative historical approach to
   explain how business groups in six Central American countries decided to
   enter, remain in or leave the banking sector. Using case studies of the
   main banks belonging to business groups in the region, the article seeks
   to identify how particular sequences of policies lead to the formation
   of two major strategies. A portfolio one, characterized by a shortterm
   interest in the banking sector; and an organic one, in which the banking
   sector plays a more important role for the whole group. Looking at the
   impact of three policies (nationalization, privatization and
   liberalization), I show that previous nationalization had contributed to
   a dominant portfolio strategy in Costa Rica and El Salvador. The absence
   of nationalization favored the dominance of an organic strategy in
   Guatemala and Honduras. Additionally, the cases of Nicaragua and Panama
   are analyzed as examples of how other events, such as early
   internationalization and early liberalization, can favor a more mixed
   scenario.},

   with regime-changing popular uprisings. Nicolae Ceausescu's Romania was
   no exception. Why, when faced with a sovereign debt crisis in the 1980s,
   did his regime choose to pay its foreign debt as early as possible, at
   the cost of economic recession and dramatically compressed consumption?
   How did these choices relate to the regime's failure to survive the end
   of the decade? The article argues that while exogenous shocks shattered
   the economic bases of the regime, it was the ideas with which the regime
   understood development and interpreted the crisis that shaped government
   policy responses in the 1980s. When the price of oil and development
   finance went up abruptly in 1979, the low energy efficiency of Romanian
   industry pushed the country into a situation where debt levels became
   unsustainable. Committed to a view of development that blended
   nationalist and Stalinist ideas, but with a focus on policy sovereignty,
   Ceausescu diagnosed the crisis as evidence that debt-financed
   development and policy independence were incompatible. Consequently the
   regime decided to pay off foreign debt through a mix of austerity,
   import substitution, and export-led accumulation of dollar reserves. By
   the time all debt was paid off in 1989, the regime's economic sources of
   legitimacy were exhausted. In the external environment of 1989, this
   policy regime change contributed to political regime change even in the
   absence of an organized civil society. In addition to casting a new
   light on the causal mechanisms of the Romanian revolution of December
   1989, the findings of this article contribute to emerging scholarship
   that stresses the nexus between debt-induced economic crisis and popular
   uprisings.},

Abstract = {While the study of the causes of civil war is a well-established
   subdiscipline in international relations, the effects of civil war on
   society remain less understood. Yet, such effects could have crucial
   implications for long-term stability and democracy in a country after
   the reaching of a peace agreement. This article contributes to the
   understanding of the effects of warfare on interethnic relations,
   notably attitudes of ethno-nationalism. Two hypotheses are tested:
   first, that the prevalence of ethno-nationalism is higher after than
   before the war, and second, that individuals who have been directly
   affected by the war are more nationalist than others. The variation in
   ethno-nationalism is examined over time, between countries, and between
   ethnic groups. Three countries that did not experience conflict on their
   own territory serve as a control group. The effect of individual war
   exposure is also tested in the analysis. Sources include survey data
   from the former Yugoslavia in 1989, shortly before the outbreak of war
   in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, and in 2003, some years after the
   violence in the region ended. Contrary to common beliefs, the study
   shows that ethno-nationalism does not necessarily increase with ethnic
   civil war. The individual war experiences are less important than
   expected.},

Journal = {POLICY AND SOCIETY},

Volume = {31},
Number = {4},
Pages = {319-330},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This article explores the nature of ownership in a reform of the
   multi-donor-funded agricultural advisory service in Uganda. We argue
   that although there was a long process of programme formulation in which
   all stakeholders were heard, ownership was not as encompassing as it
   first appeared. In essence, the agricultural reform programme
   represented market-oriented values that were not echoed in large parts
   of the Ugandan polity. The eventual reversal of policy, back to
   government-provided extension, and to a large programme of heavily
   subsidised input supply, testifies to that. In addition, key
   stakeholders, notably local politicians and officials in the Ministry of
   Agriculture, Animal Industry, and Fisheries (MAAIF), were shut out from
   the original programme and this threatened its viability. If a genuine
   analysis of the economic and political context had been carried out, the
   donors might have anticipated this. Instead, they were revealed as
   ill-equipped to counteract the politicisation and re-claiming of
   ownership by the Ugandan government. (C) 2012 Policy and Society

Journal = {POLICY AND POLITICS},

Abstract = {This article explores the process of policy learning from abroad from a
   knowledge utilisation perspective, using examples of health policy
   making in the Department of Health in England. It argues that
   information about policy abroad is often heterogeneous and difficult to
   obtain systematically and therefore does not fit easily with notions of
   evidence-based policy making. While some officials interviewed for this
   study did regard policy examples from other countries as a substitute
   for evidence, especially in areas in which research evidence was
   insufficient, others appeared to be less confident about its validity
   and generalisability. Department of Health officials reported a great
   variability in strategies to obtain such information, with processes
   often constrained by pressures on time and resources. They were also
   highly selective in exploring policy examples from abroad, with most
   respondents stating that they were largely interested in generating
   ideas to address domestic policy problems, often relating to details of
   policy. The iterative process of using this information thus raises
   questions about the extent to which looking abroad contributed to
   genuine policy learning.},

Abstract = {Kenya's enduring ethnic violence is frequently explained with reference
   to the mobilization of ethnicity from above, and relatively little
   attention has been paid to the participation of ordinary people.
   Focusing on the violence that followed the 2007 general elections, this
   article explores how bottom-up processes of identification and violence
   interacted with incitement from above. It argues that autochthonous
   discourses of belonging and exclusion engendered an understanding of
   ethnic others as `immigrants' and `guests', and these narratives of
   territorialized identity both reinforced elite manipulation and operated
   independently of it. Kenya's post-election violence can thus be
   understood as a bottom-up performance of narratives of ethnic
   territorial exclusion operating alongside more direct elite involvement,
   organization, and incitement. The durability of these narratives, as
   well as their inherent plasticity, has significant implications for the
   potential for further violence and the prospects for democratization.},

Abstract = {Which factors drive the onset of multiparty mediation? Despite numerous
   studies explaining the onset of international mediation in conflicts,
   the literature offers little insight into when we are likely to see
   `multiparty mediation', that is, mediation attempts that are conducted
   by a coalition of interveners. The latter are different from those
   interventions that only see one mediator, however: mediators forming a
   coalition are likely to be constrained by different domestic factors and
   may have different incentives than states pursuing unilateral
   approaches. Thus, ignoring these patterns can have serious consequences
   for our theoretical expectations and empirical inferences on mediation
   onset. In order to address this shortcoming, this article introduces
   concepts from the coalition-formation literature to the existent
   research on mediation, and examines the onset of multiparty mediation
   from a twofold perspective. First, there are supply-side determinants,
   that is, interveners' incentives for multiparty mediation. Second, the
   author studies demand-side influences, that is, factors pertaining to
   the belligerents. By analyzing data for 1950-2000, the following
   research's main contribution stems from the empirical test of the
   theoretical framework in a quantitative research design. The results
   point to a disconnect between the factors that promote single-party
   mediation onset and those that promote multiparty mediations.},

Abstract = {The 2010 general election was the first in the UK in which a series of
   televised leaders' debates were broadcast. This article takes forward
   research on mediated political performance and the relationship between
   celebrity and politics through an analysis of these debates. By
   discussing how the candidates perform personality, the article
   highlights the use of performance in constructing informality and a
   personalised audience address, contrasting these with where candidates
   engage in conventional political speech-making. The article also
   examines the strategic use of language, particularly where it is
   designed to align speakers with the public in opposition to the
   political establishment. The article argues that celebrity should not be
   viewed as an innate quality but instead as an interpretative set of
   frames, the terms of which are established through performance. The
   article concludes by reflecting upon the implications that can be drawn
   about the relationship between performance, framing and political
   celebrity.},

Abstract = {Numerous scholars have observed a decline in more coercive police
   tactics used to control demonstrations since the 1960s in North America
   and Western Europe. Such claims, however, are largely based on rather
   unsystematic observation, and almost no research directly examines the
   evolution of protest policing during this entire period. To address this
   gap, the authors use semiparametric logistic regression to examine
   reported police presence, the use of arrests, and the use of force at
   15,965 US protests occurring between 1960 and 1995. The results confirm
   that while there has been an absolute decline in more repressive
   policing behavior, the transitional process was not a monotonic, linear
   process. The authors also investigate the different evolutionary
   patterns of each type of protest policing. The authors further
   demonstrate that African American initiated events, government targets,
   social movement organization presence, protest forms, the use of force,
   and arrests have variable impacts on police responses over time.},

Title = {Global patterns of maritime piracy, 2000-09: Introducing a new dataset},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {49},

Pages = {605-617},

Abstract = {This article introduces the Maritime Piracy Data (MPD), a dataset
   dedicated to understanding the nature, dynamics, and causes of
   contemporary piracy and armed robbery against ships. Data on maritime
   piracy are presented in two formats: an event set and an annual,
   country-level set. The event data track every maritime piracy attack
   reported to the International Maritime Bureau's Piracy Reporting Center
   (IMB/PRC) for a total of 3,413 events between 2000 and 2009. Entries
   provide event details including date, geo-coded location, attacker
   nationality, victim nationality, success, vessel type, violence level,
   loot taken, and/or ransom demanded. The annual data count the number of
   piracy events emanating from the world's 147 coastal countries over the
   same decade for a total of 1,470 observations. Entries include
   country-level information regarding the maritime sector including
   coastal shipping traffic, coastline length, seaports, distances to major
   sea lane chokepoints, and merchant marine size. The article describes
   the main features of the data, provides descriptive statistics, and
   briefly illustrates their potential utility for research. The MPD has
   potential utility for scholars examining non-traditional threats
   generated by non-state actors; for those studying the potential
   relationships between governance and conflict on land and piracy at sea;
   and for individuals engaged in policy-relevant analyses evaluating the
   effectiveness and efficiency of counter-piracy strategies and tactics.},

Title = {Measuring institutions: Indicators of political rights, property rights
   and political instability in Zimbabwe},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {49},
Number = {4},
Pages = {593-603},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This article presents a new dataset of indicators of political freedom,
   property rights and political instability for Zimbabwe for the period
   1946 to 2005. The dataset is constructed by systematically coding the
   three concepts of political freedom, property rights and political
   instability along a multitude of dimensions. The lengthy time coverage
   of the dataset allows country-specific econometric analysis to evaluate
   generalizing propositions about the effects of political institutions on
   economic outcomes. The dataset also contributes to the dynamic analysis
   of the effects of political institutions on conflict, a contentious
   issue in political science. Correlations between the new measures reveal
   that while political instability has a strong and negative relationship
   with property rights, it has no significant relationship with political
   freedom. The finding supports the notion that political conflict is
   significantly higher in the in-between category of semi-democracy than
   at either end of the democracy scale. The validity of the dataset is
   supported by its strong correlations with other conceptually and
   operationally different measures of political institutions. The new
   dataset has begun to be employed in country-specific time-series studies
   of the link between institutions and economic outcomes. Two core results
   are that property rights influence the volumes of foreign direct
   investment (FDI) in Zimbabwe and that negative spillover effects of poor
   institutional environments can occur between neighbouring countries. It
   is feasible to extend the geographical coverage of the dataset by
   applying our methodological framework to other countries.},

Abstract = {This article explores political mobilization, legitimacy, and identity
   in the Angolan Central Highlands from the anti-colonial struggle of the
   1960s until the end of the civil war in 2002. It examines how the rival
   movements, MPLA and UNITA, competed for support, and considers the
   nature of the relationships between political-military elites and the
   Angolan people. Whereas much scholarship on civil war has focused on the
   emergence of rebellions against the state, I argue that such an approach
   to the Angolan war is inappropriate since both protagonists were founded
   as anti-colonial movements and both organizations developed
   characteristics of states to different degrees. Central to each party's
   narrative was an ideology of the state as a complex of ideas and
   practices that linked together responsibilities towards the population,
   prerogatives of violence, and the identity of the nation. People
   expressed support for either or both movements in terms of common
   interest and identity, which in turn were shaped by the political
   education of the movement in control at the time.},

Abstract = {One of the defining features of modern states is their incorporation of
   notions of political and social community based on shared language,
   history, and myths. However, large numbers of citizens in modern states
   have come to believe their national communities are under threat from
   several modern forces, including immigration. Using the European Social
   Survey (2002-9), this article explores the extent to which perceived
   threats posed by large-scale immigration undermine national political
   communities by reducing trust in national politicians and political
   institutions. The findings indicate that even after controlling for
   other predictors of trust in the political system, concerns about the
   effect of immigration on the national community have an impact on trust
   in politics. Moreover, having a lengthy postwar history with mass
   immigration mediates this effect, while the potentially mobilizing
   effects of far-right parties on the relationship between concern about
   immigration and political distrust are somewhat limited.},

Abstract = {Given the myriad of human rights abuses that occur globally and daily,
   why are some nations on the receiving end of a substantial amount of
   international opprobrium, while others receive far less attention and
   condemnation? The authors contend that the increasing presence of human
   rights organizations in such states is the critical link between the
   local and the international. Increases in the number of such groups
   contributes significantly to the generation of Amnesty International
   urgent actions, one of the most-often-utilized tools in naming and
   shaming campaigns against human rights abusing regimes. The authors find
   strong support for nearly all their hypotheses.},

Abstract = {Whistleblowing has emerged as a key element of regulatory strategy. This
   article provides a brief, theoretical analysis of the claimed affinities
   between whistleblowing, self-regulation and corporate social
   responsibility. It then addresses a series of key issues in relation to
   whistleblowing: the individual, organisational and social
   characteristics associated with the decision to blow the whistle (or
   not); the consequences of reporting organisational harm for
   whistleblowers; and the robustness of legal protections for those who
   report such harm. Finally, it raises a series of challenges to the idea,
   reality and potential of whistleblowing as part of an effective
   self-regulatory strategy.},

Abstract = {In this research note, we examine the nature of, and influences on,
   parliamentary oversight in Ghana. We find that while macro-institutions
   are important when examining good governance and legislative
   effectiveness, meso-level institutions (such as oversight tools) are
   more important than previously acknowledged. We also detect a positive
   relationship between an increase in legislative oversight facilities and
   the reputation of parliament and its members, the legitimacy of
   democracy and political institutions, and the success in curbing
   corruption. And finally, we confirm that the successful functioning of
   institutions depends on the presence or absence of specific contextual
   factors. In the case of Ghana, these factors are a relatively low level
   of partisanship at the committee level, parliament's ability to find
   alternative sources of information, and the demand for good governance.},

Number = {1},
Pages = {124-141},

Abstract = {In recent years, several large-scale data-collection projects have
   produced georeferenced, disaggregated events-level conflict data which
   can aid researchers in studying the microlevel dynamics of civil war.
   This article describes the differences between the two leading conflict
   events datasets, the Uppsala Conflict Data Program Georeferenced Events
   Dataset (UCDP GED) and the Armed Conflict Location Events Dataset
   (ACLED), including their relative strengths and weaknesses. The aim of
   the article is to provide readers with some guidelines as to when these
   datasets should be used and when they should be avoided; it finds that
   those interested in subnational analyses of conflict should be wary of
   ACLED's data because of uneven quality-control issues which can result
   in biased findings if left unchecked by the researcher. The article
   concludes that those interested in non-violent events such as troop
   movements have only ACLED to choose from, since UCDP has not coded such
   data, but again warns researchers to be wary of the quality of the data.
   Finally, while the creation of these datasets is a positive development,
   some caveats are raised in relation to both datasets about the reliance
   on media sources.},

Abstract = {The spread of Augusto Boal's Theater of the Oppressed across the
   Americas and the rest of the world can be understood in terms of Deleuze
   and Guattari's metaphor of the rhizome, whose nomadic habit of growth
   and propagation mirrors the power of Theater of the Oppressed to
   reproduce itself in more than 70 countries worldwide. The Theater of the
   Oppressed rhizome is now deeply rooted in academia and has sprouted in
   classrooms and in the streets, bringing together students, scholars,
   administrators, policy makers, and community activists in the pursuit of
   social justice and human rights. An examination of its use as a
   pedagogical tool calls attention to its potential for creating a world
   in which human rights are appreciated and protected. Its use is
   particularly timely today given the worldwide attention to the rights of
   the indigenous peoples represented by the adoption of the United Nations
   Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in 2007.},

   notion of negative freedom, most notably Quentin Skinner and Philip
   Pettit, and the adherents of the prevailing liberal notion of negative
   freedom, most notably Ian Carter and Matthew Kramer. The debate between
   these two parties concerns the question of what negative freedom is.
   While Carter and Kramer argue that negative freedom is simply the
   absence of interference, Skinner and Pettit argue that negative freedom
   is first and foremost the absence of arbitrary power to interfere (or,
   in short, domination) and only in a secondary sense also the absence of
   interference. In this article I argue that the republican notion of
   negative freedom is implausible, since it entails that situations
   involving only domination are as inimical to negative freedom as
   situations involving both domination and dominating interference; and,
   moreover, that Pettit and Skinner themselves find the idea that these
   two situations are equally inimical to negative freedom implausible.},

Abstract = {The global expansion of capoeira has radically transformed the practice
   and reach of the Afro-Brazilian fight/dance/game known as capoeira. Once
   a weapon of the weak, informally learned by male slaves on the streets
   and outlawed by Brazilian authorities, capoeira today is taught to men,
   women, and children in schools, health clubs, dance studios, and
   community centers throughout Brazil and around the world. Accompanying
   the global commodification and consumption of capoeira as an exotic,
   hip, multicultural activity is a trend within Brazil to professionalize
   its teaching. Recent debates around the institutionalization of capoeira
   offer a revealing window onto the contradictions of nationalism,
   citizenship, and democracy in Brazil. While the increased emphasis on
   pedagogy and professionalism is transforming the actual ``play{''} of
   capoeira, the practice remains, albeit in new ways, a mobilizing agent
   in the struggle against social inequalities and uneven citizenship in
   Brazil.},

Abstract = {If womens rights norms have become internationally acknowledged, is it
   reasonable to assume that the status of women worldwide has improved
   because of international norms? It is argued here that the assumption of
   a global-to-local flow of norms inherent in most of the global norm
   diffusion literature is simplistic. To provide a more adequate
   theoretical framework, the paper juxtaposes the debate on the impact of
   international regimes and the power of global norms with an
   interdisciplinary mix of transnational approaches that identify
   multidirectional processes of appropriation and contestation of global
   norms. Departing from the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of
   Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) as the most authoritative and
   steady piece of the international womens rights discourse, the
   transnational perspective developed here proposes three main
   constellations of traveling global norms: global discourse translation,
   impact translation, and distorted translation.},

Title = {DRIVING THE GREAT APES TO EXTINCTION: PERSPECTIVES FROM CONSERVATION
   BIOLOGY, POLITICS, AND BIOETHICS},
Booktitle = {BIOPOLICY: THE LIFE SCIENCES AND PUBLIC POLICY},
Series = {Research in Biopolitics},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {179-209},
Abstract = {Purpose - This study addresses the great apes' fatal situation in the
   wild by integrating perspectives from conservation biology, conflict
   research, and bioethics.
   Design/methodology/approach - We introduce the great apes' red list
   status and describe habitat destruction and bushmeat commerce as main
   threats to their survival. We analyze the complex context in which great
   ape extinction takes place in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)
   and thereby focus on a threatening factor that is interlinked with
   habitat destruction and bushmeat commerce: armed conflict.
   Findings - The study shows that some characteristics of so-called ``New
   Wars'' are apparent in the DRC and that they directly or indirectly
   impact the great apes' situation. Because the human role in the animals'
   extinction is so severe and so obvious, ethical consequences become
   apparent. Animal ethics (the welfare as well as the rights approach) has
   to acknowledge the severity of the situation of the great apes in the
   wild. Implications for the human-animal relationship and the human
   identity come into play. After all, we have to ask ourselves what it
   means for us and for coming generations if our nearest relatives are
   going to be extinct one day.
   Practical implications - It is argued that conservation policy has to
   include insights from conflict research. Likewise, peacemaking has to
   address ecological consequences of warfare.
   Originality/value - Our findings promote an interdisciplinary approach.
   Armed conflict as a threatening factor to great ape survival has so far
   largely been neglected within the literature on conservation biology as
   well as in conflict research.},

Abstract = {Two U. S. studies report a differential effect of identity centrality
   and in-group superiority on reactions to in-group victimization and
   in-group harm-doing. Study 1 (N = 80) found that higher identity
   centrality predicted less justification for freely-recalled in-group
   victim events, whereas higher in-group superiority predicted more
   justification for freely-recalled in-group harm-doing events. Study 2 (N
   = 105) reexamined these findings in specific contexts of historical
   victimization (Pearl Harbor) and harm-doing (Hiroshima and Nagasaki),
   finding that in-group superiority was a predictor of reactions to
   historical in-group harm-doing (justification, emotional reactions,
   importance of events), whereas centrality was a predictor of reactions
   to historical in-group victimization.},

Abstract = {Utilizing the case of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri
   Lanka, I make a three-part explanation for the critical role the
   religious organization, ideological fitness, and state capacity played
   in the formation, institutionalization and consolidation of the LTTE in
   the Tamil ethnic mobilization process. Firstly, I show how the Tamil
   religious re-awakening during the British colonial period led to
   religious practices which consolidated the social dominance of the
   Vellalar caste and blocked the upward economic, social and political
   mobility of the other Tamil castes, thus enabling the emergence of
   lower-caste groups such as the LTTE in the 1970s. Secondly, I
   demonstrate that the LTTE's ideology privileged its nationalist goals
   over Marxist doctrinal purity because of the LTTE's commitment to
   improved intra-Tamil caste equality; an ideological approach which only
   increased the LTTE's legitimacy within the Tamil community and
   solidified its institutionalization as a viable Tamil group. Finally, I
   demonstrate how the intense intra-Sinhalese elite-level bidding wars,
   driven by the partisan competition for power among the dominant
   Sinhalese parties of the early 1980s, reduced the autonomy and capacity
   of the Sri Lankan state and enabled the consolidation of the LTTE as the
   leader of the Tamil ethnic mobilization drive.},

Title = {Cognitive-experiential self theory and conflict-handling styles Rational
   and constructive experiential systems are related to the integrating and
   compromising conflict-handling styles},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {23},
Number = {4},
Pages = {362-381},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine how the rational and
   experiential systems according to the cognitive-experiential self theory
   (CEST) are related to conflict-handling styles.
   Design/methodology/approach - Using a correlational design, data were
   collected using an on-line survey system examining CEST
   information-processing systems and five conflict-handling styles. A
   total of 426 undergraduate students, with paid jobs, complete the
   on-line survey.
   Findings - Results showed that the rational system, experiential system
   and constructive thinking had significant positive relationships with
   both the integrating and compromising conflict-handling styles.
   Additionally, the rational system had a positive relationship with the
   dominating conflict-handling style and the experiential system and
   constructive thinking had a positive relationship with the obliging
   conflict-handling style. The rational system and constructive thinking
   had a negative relationship with the avoiding conflict-handling style.
   Research limitations/implications - The study established a positive
   connection between CEST information-processing systems and
   conflict-handling styles among undergraduate students, however the
   results of the study may not be as directly comparable with real and
   established leaders.
   Originality/value - Being the first study to examine the connection
   between the CEST information-processing systems and the five
   conflict-handling styles, the paper offers interesting insights about
   how the choice of information-processing systems can influence the
   choice of conflict-handling styles across a wide range of situations.},

   Persistence},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT AND VIOLENCE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Pages = {76-95},
Abstract = {According to forty years worth of research, dissent always increases
   repression whereas state coercive behavior has a range of different
   influences on dissident activity. If the outcome of government action is
   uncertain, why do authorities continue to apply repression? We explore
   this ``puzzle of repressive persistence{''} using official records of U.
   S. government activities against the Republic of New Africa, a Black
   Nationalist organization active in the late 1960s and early 1970s. In
   particular, we investigate three proposed answers to the puzzle:
   repression is effective but in a way not currently considered;
   repression functions by mechanisms not hitherto considered by
   quantitative researchers; or those who use repression are not actually
   interested in eliminating dissent. We find that persistence in this case
   can be attributed to: 1) a long-term plan to eliminate challengers
   deemed threatening to the U. S. political-economy and 2) the influence
   of particular agents of repression engaged in a crusade against Black
   radicals. Both factors increased the likelihood of continued coercion
   despite short-term failure; indeed such an outcome actually called for
   additional repressive action. These insights open up a new area of
   research for conflict scholars interested in occurrence, persistence and
   escalation.},

Abstract = {Contrary to the dominant view in the scholarly literature on European
   institutions, where the European Commission is generally described as a
   unitary actor whose acts are primarily influenced by a political agenda
   and/or considerations of self-interest, this article argues that a
   variety of opinions coexist within the Commission staff. Based on the
   largest attitudinal survey ever conducted on Commission officials, it
   documents the existence of a sizeable minority of intergovernmentalists
   and analyzes their attitude towards the institution they serve and their
   views on its place in the integration process.},

Abstract = {Studies of individuals or groups that use violence or terrorism in the
   pursuit of political goals typically focus on the specific actions that
   these individuals or groups have taken, or may take, and on the policies
   that defenders against such actions adopt in response. Comparatively
   less attention is devoted to the preconditions that may lead to the
   contemplation and commitment of such actions and how or why defenders
   may obviate these actions before they occur or why they may never occur.
   This case study is an examination of the politics of Quebec separatism,
   which looked set to follow a violent path in the 1960s and early 1970s,
   but ultimately did not, and explores why it did not.},

Volume = {24},

Abstract = {Despite an increasing number of attacks by violent anti-Good Friday
   Agreement (GFA) Republicans from 2009 there is still relatively little
   understanding of the nature of these organizations or the likely
   longevity of their campaign(s). This analysis argues that the current
   upsurge of violence is likely to continue for the foreseeable future,
   due to a combination of factors that entrench republican ideology. The
   fractured nature of anti-GFA groups and the declining stature of the
   Provisional movement are key factors that energize anti-agreement
   sentiment. In particular, this study identifies the Internet as one of
   the most significant emerging drivers in that it has the potential to
   sustain social networks that create and reinforce a traditional minded
   Irish Republican constituency implacably committed to using violence in
   pursuit of its goals.},

Title = {Re-enchanting democracy as a mode of governance},
Journal = {CRITICAL POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Pages = {19-39},
Abstract = {In this article, I explore the contribution of governance
   micro-practices to the transformative co-production of policy processes
   and political cultures, drawing on experiences of `democracy-in-action'
   in the finegrain practices of spatial planning and urban policy.
   Following an introduction, the first section introduces the tensions
   which the designs and practices of programs in these fields are called
   upon to negotiate, and the experimentation in both fields which reaches
   towards more participative and `people-centered' ways of working. I
   illustrate the challenges and potentials for such transformations
   through two cases of energetic civil society governance activity, one
   (from north east England) where old social democratic practices have
   lived on, and another (from central Japan) where more participative
   practices centered on people's daily life concerns have evolved. I then
   outline a conception of a participative, pluralistic, richly-informed,
   people-centered polity, drawing on older contrasts between elite and
   participative forms of democracy. I argue that, in current times in
   countries such as the UK, the new forms of `network governance' which
   are appearing within and around the long-established designs and
   practices of representative democracy hold a potential for more
   people-centered forms to emerge. How far such potentials are realized,
   however, depends on contingent particularities and struggles. I conclude
   by offering a range of hypotheses about qualities to encourage in the
   particularities of micro-practices for those seeking to promote more
   progressive governance cultures and resist regressive trajectories.},

Abstract = {The geopolitical situation of Ukraine predestines, as well as, limits
   its foreign policy and economic direction, as related to the
   all-European political and security view of this important international
   state. More than 20 years after gaining independence, the Russian
   federation must be considered a very important neighbour, whose presence
   based on economic bonds, political experience and historic reminiscences
   cannot be totally eliminated in the process of creating the foreign
   policy strategy. For this reason, Russian power politics and
   agricultural force noticeably influence Ukrainian policy internally, as
   well as externally. Mostly since the departure of orange forces and the
   entrance of Yanukovych to the presidential Office (February 2010),
   Moscow concentrated on the fulfillment of a more ``balanced{''} foreign
   policy of Kiev. It should be noted that the Russian vector affects
   mostly the realms of Ukrainian security and economic policies. These
   notions have been recast into concrete results that were advantageous
   for Russia, as in the extending the stay of Black Sea Fleet (B SF) and
   in the factual taking back of the Ukrainian intention of entering NATO.
   Another aspect was the complication of relations between the Ukraine and
   the EU, as well as the delay of accepting the Association Agreement
   because of Timoshenko's imprisonment.},

Title = {Relationship conflict in supervisor-subordinate dyads: a subordinate
   perspective},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {23},
Number = {2},
Pages = {192-218},
Abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to offer insights regarding antecedents and
   consequences of relationship conflict in supervisor-subordinate dyads,
   regardless of the demographic characteristics of the dyads. The authors
   explain the causes and outcomes of relationship conflict utilizing an
   affective approach, and suggest that factors such as moods, values, and
   situational context play an important role in influencing relationship
   conflict and its outcomes - intention to quit and trust in supervisor.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors surveyed 200 employees of
   multiple companies in the greater Atlanta, Georgia area. They utilized
   hierarchical regression, (with the inclusion of two- and three-way
   interaction terms) to test their hypotheses and interaction effects.
   Findings - Negative mood and positive mood interacted to impact the
   level of relationship conflict experienced by subordinates.
   Subordinates' collectivism values strengthened the impact of the
   positive mood-negative mood interaction on relationship conflict.
   Mentoring and supervisor-subordinate dyad tenure moderated the
   relationship conflict to outcomes associations.
   Originality/value - The study goes beyond traditional relational
   demography research in order to offer new insights and perspectives on
   the causes and outcomes of relationship conflict at different
   hierarchical levels from an affective approach, specifically, moods
   theory. Since relationship conflict is an inevitable process, an
   understanding of antecedents and consequences of the conflict can allow
   managers to be better equipped to create a healthy work environment.},

Abstract = {E-Governance, inclusive of e-democracy, e-government, and e-business,
   has the power to improve processes, connect citizens, and build
   interactions with civil societies. The infusion of Information
   Communication Technologies (ICTs) by the governments, civil society
   organizations, and political institutions to engage citizens, have
   promoted greater participation in the process of governance. E-Democracy
   encompasses all forms of electronic interaction between the elected
   government and the electorate. Examples include e-voting,
   e-consultation, e-representatives, e-campaigning, online deliberative
   polling, e-petitions, and e-referendums. India is the largest democracy
   in the world and a frontrunner in the use of ICTs for e-governance and
   e-democracy. The last few elections witnessed a surge in the use of new
   technologies inclusive of Internet, social networking, and mobile
   technologies, alongside the traditional forms of electioneering. This
   chapter examines the e-governance and e-democracy strategies, and the
   innovative new media technologies used by political parties, industrial
   corporations, and other organizations that have e-engaged the citizens.},

Abstract = {The Danish government's counter-radicalization Action Plan of 2009 had
   intended and unintended effects. Primarily targeting Danish Muslims, it
   employs neoliberal governmentality approaches of governance through
   individual support and response, information and knowledge, empowerment,
   surveillance and intervention, and anti-discrimination. It aims to
   prevent radicalization by transforming, shaping, and disciplining
   illiberal and violence-prone ``radicals{''} into active, liberal
   citizens. Prolonged fieldwork and in-depth interviews with seventeen
   Muslims from a targeted milieu reveal skepticism about the effectiveness
   of the measures. Implementation of the action plan in practice may yield
   iatrogenic effects.},

Abstract = {Islamist extremists in Afghanistan and elsewhere are exaggerating their
   successes in inflicting casualties on American and other International
   Security Assistance Force (ISAF) forces. This article quantifies the
   exaggeration for the month of November 2010, putting the claimed
   casualty rate at approximately one-half battalion per month. It provides
   an analysis of how and why this is occurring, and links this extremist
   strategic communication effort to dominant historical master narratives
   in the region that may produce sympathy among intended recipients of the
   messages. The authors argue that these measures undertaken by the
   extremists can be countered successfully through the use of similar
   story forms, more timely reporting, use of side-by-side comparisons, and
   use of similar reporting venues. These steps could challenge the
   credibility of the Taliban reports, reduce sympathy, and diminish
   potential recruitment.},

Journal = {POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {40},
Number = {2},
Pages = {234-255},
Abstract = {Drawing from the literature on public participation and stakeholder
   collaboratives, this article investigates the influence of power and
   wealth, as well as political and economic context on the output of
   stakeholders advisory committees convened to formulate state greenhouse
   gas (GHG) mitigation policies. Using small sample regression techniques,
   we analyze the outputs of stakeholder groups in 18 states that have
   completed Climate Action Plans to reduce GHGs. We find that an increase
   of 1 percent in the number of energy industry representatives that
   participate in Climate Action Councils significantly predicts a 4
   percent reduction of GHG mitigation targets for the energy sector. More
   surprisingly, the results also show that where the utilities represent a
   larger share of the state economy, the Climate Action Plans identify
   more aggressive GHG reduction goals for the energy sector. We also find
   that the political orientation of the executive of the state is not
   correlated with GHG mitigation requirements for the energy sector,
   suggesting that GHG mitigation is less partisan at the state level than
   in Washington, DC. We find no evidence that state wealth is associated
   with GHG mitigation requirements. Finally, we suggest additional
   research needed to clarify the role of stakeholder participation
   processes in the evolving arena of climate change policy.},

Title = {Managing Relative Decline: A Neoclassical Realist Analysis of the 2012
   US Defense Strategic Guidance},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY SECURITY POLICY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {33},
Number = {3},
Pages = {487-511},
Abstract = {The Defense Strategic Guidance (DSG), released by the White House in
   January 2012, was widely acknowledged as the most significant
   reassessment of America's strategic posture in a decade. Sustaining U.S.
   Global Leadership: Priorities for 21st Century Defense is not simply a
   response to systemic-level threats and interests, but reflected
   principles best articulated by neoclassical realism (NCR). By examining
   systemic, domestic, and elite influences affecting the United States in
   2012, this article demonstrates that the DSG illustrates the core
   principles of neoclassical realism. The strategy reflected the Obama
   administration's filtration of systemic-level imperatives through elite
   perceptions and domestic politics. The DSG is realist because it sought
   foremost to address systemic challenges, including American relative
   decline. It is neoclassical realist because the strategy was markedly
   influenced by elite perceptions and domestic politics, resulting in
   deliberate gambles. Neorealism continues to have great value explaining
   systemic trends, but it cannot explain the specific foreign policies of
   individual states. NCR provides a way to retain the most effective
   analytical features of neorealism while incorporating the influence of
   domestic politics and elite perceptions on state policy-making.
   Neoclassical realism is a promising theoretical framework for foreign
   policy analysis, but further testing and refining is needed to ensure
   that it retains its descriptive accuracy and predictive capability.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {19},
Number = {9},
Pages = {1377-1395},
Abstract = {Rapporteurs rely on secretariat officials to provide policy information
   that is independent from vested interests. They require this information
   to be provided quickly, so that lobbyists' policy claims can be verified
   ahead of the completion of the draft report. However, it turns out that
   officials' accumulation of specific policy expertise is endogenous to
   the lobbying process. Secretariat officials are generalists lacking the
   detailed policy information that they are called upon to supply.
   Entrenched interests including the Commission fill the void by providing
   officials with policy information and on occasion even loan them their
   experienced staff, thereby indirectly lobbying the rapporteurs. This
   activity directly affects the content of European Union legislation, as
   the information that rapporteurs receive and act upon is less
   independent than might have been expected. These ideas are analysed with
   the aid of over 150 structured interviews with policy actors, and with
   the aid of the results of an EP internal questionnaire.},

Title = {Information Flow and Communication Deficit: Perceptions of
   Brussels-Based Correspondents and EU Officials},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {34},
Number = {4},
Pages = {305-322},
Abstract = {This study contributes to the debate on the European Union (EU)
   `communication deficit' by assessing EU-media relations. Previous
   literature has examined the way EU institutions interface with
   journalists, but tells us little about potential differences between
   these institutions' communication performance. Moreover, research tends
   to address the main actors of this process, Brussels-based
   correspondents and EU officials, separately. Drawing on interviews with
   both groups, we established a direct comparison of their perceptions on
   (1) the press work of each EU institution; (2) the interaction between
   EU institutions; and (3) their own informal contacts. Results show that
   specific communicative patterns are aroused from the various
   institutions, the EU inter-institutional cooperation is negatively

Abstract = {As Chancellor of the Exchequer during the late 1920s, Winston Churchill
   was at the center of British strategic decision making about how to
   respond to the naval challenge posed by Japan's rise as a rival sea
   power. Churchill downplayed the likelihood of war with Japan. The
   leadership of the Royal Navy disagreed: they saw Japan as a dangerous
   threat to the security of the British Empire. Examining this dispute
   between Churchill and the Admiralty highlights the awkward political,
   economic, and strategic tradeoffs confronting British leaders between
   the world wars.},

Journal = {REVIEW OF AFRICAN POLITICAL ECONOMY},

Volume = {39},
Number = {132, SI},
Pages = {261-278},
Abstract = {This paper explores the cultural foundations of contemporary network
   capitalism in East Asia, and its implications for African enterprise
   development. It considers how neo-Weberian perspectives on the cultural
   determinants of East Asian network success have served to validate
   intensified processes of labour exploitation while glossing over the
   role of the state in making networks work for development. It is argued
   that the ideology of the Confucian ethic draws on notions of social
   solidarity to normalise the use of unfree labour in capitalist
   accumulation strategies, while concealing the critical role of the state
   in mobilising society around cultural values and socialising risk to
   diffuse potentially disruptive social tensions. The obfuscation of these
   processes in cultural analyses of Asian network success has cast the
   poor performance of African enterprise networks as a product of cultural
   dysfunction, obscuring underlying processes of state withdrawal and
   policy failure. The problems arising from Chinese business networks in
   Africa bring out the contradictions of cultural interpretations of
   network dynamism.},

   Design/methodology/approach - In total, 358 undergraduate students from
   the University of Santiago de Compostela were classified into four
   different affective groups (happy, inactive, sad, and surprised) based
   on their actual emotional experience and asked to complete ROCI-II.
   ANOVA were conducted to test hypotheses.
   Findings - Results reveal that affective groups statistically differ in
   their self-reported conflict management styles. Positive moods and
   feelings have been found to be related to the preference for more
   cooperative strategies.
   Research limitations/implications - This study is exploratory in nature
   and since hypotheses were only partly supported, future research should
   address this topic in depth. Practical implications It has been
   suggested that, in order to handle conflicts properly, individuals
   should take into account both their cognition and emotion.
   Originality/value - This paper sheds light on current research in the
   prediction of conflict behavior by examining the impact of affect out
   from the lab.},

Abstract = {This article explores some of the issues for policy scholars arising
   from the increasing attention paid to `emotion' and `affect' in
   contemporary social science. One such issue is in the focus placed on
   detailed ethnographic methods and interpretive forms of analysis, and
   the problem this raises for drawing out connections to changing regimes
   of governing and wider shifts in policy and politics. A second lies in
   the modernist traditions of policy studies, traditions which privilege
   the rational actor and deliberative subject. This article uses my own
   recent research to tease out some issues of method and of theory in
   conducting a research project that seeks to connect individual working
   lives to some of the major cultural and social change in Britain over
   the last 60 years. The article begins by outlining the project and some
   of the issues raised in interpreting `emotion', then goes on to show how
   I tried to link ethnographic data to wider questions of policy and
   power. The final section offers two different critical repertoires that
   have the capacity to link emotions and emotion work to analysis of
   shifting governmentalities and material conditions of work. Throughout
   my aim is to enhance the possibility of interdisciplinary conversations
   by introducing concepts and analytical framings from beyond the
   traditions of policy studies.},

   Case of Environmental NGOs1},
Journal = {ETHNOPOLITICS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Pages = {159-181},
Abstract = {This research tests the hypothesis that social identities play a key
   role in the success or failure of democracy, as individuals often hold
   ethnic and regional identities in a mutually exclusive fashion,
   resisting calls to act politically on other identities that cut across
   them. Activists in environmental non-governmental organisations were
   interviewed in Latvia, Poland and Ukraine in order to examine the policy
   process in an area that cuts across regional and ethnic lines. The
   results support the argument that ethnic and regional divisions harm
   cooperation on environmental issues, though other hypotheses cannot be
   ruled out.},

Abstract = {A summary of current knowledge on successful responses to cyberbullying
   differentiating between three different response domains: reducing
   risks, combatting the problem, and buffering negative impact. A
   systematic literature search yielded thirty-six relevant studies, most
   of which report findings regarding general prevention strategies (e. g.,
   anti-bullying policies or cybersafety strategies) and the use of coping
   strategies such as seeking support, responding (retaliation or
   confronting), technical solutions, and avoidant and emotion-focussed
   strategies. Whilst a few studies report perceived success, very few
   measure the success of the strategies in relation to risks and outcomes.
   There is a clear lack of evidence concerning successful responses.},

Journal = {EAST EUROPEAN POLITICS},

Volume = {28},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {298-309},
Abstract = {Presidentialism and other institutional factors have been major
   influences on the development of Russia's party system. Why and how they
   have influenced party development has changed over time. This article
   looks at these changes and explains them as a response to the evolving
   neo-patrimonial system in Russia. Rules establishing electoral
   institutions have been particularly important and have been changed
   according to the needs of regime stability. Russian party development
   has flowed and ebbed as a result, particularly as electoral rules have
   changed. One function of parties under Yeltsin was as vehicles that
   signalled which interests had to be negotiated with by Yeltsin or
   incorporated into the regime. Under Putin, and as rules have changed,
   this function ended, and United Russia as the paramount party became a
   vehicle for controlling interests instead. The article ends with some
   speculation about the sustainability of this pattern of political
   development.},

Title = {Obama, Clinton and the Diplomacy of Change},
Booktitle = {AMERICAN DIPLOMACY},
Year = {2012},
Pages = {159-177},
Abstract = {Is diplomacy important and can diplomats make a difference? This article
   examines these questions in the context of American foreign policy
   during the first two years of the Obama administration. The policy of
   George W. Bush's administration in Iraq and Iraq, unilateral in form and
   controversial in substance, ensured that foreign policy was a major
   issue in the election campaign, with all of the major candidates
   agreeing that American diplomacy needed to be restored. Candidate Obama
   went beyond the consensus about restoring the status and influence of
   the State Department, however, to argue that the United States should
   talk without preconditions, even with regimes of which it did not
   approve. In office, Obama and his Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton,
   rhetorically elevated diplomacy to an equal standing with defence and
   development, provided resources for greatly expanding the Foreign
   Service, and stressed the importance of taking advantage of developments
   in information technology to strengthen public and `digital' diplomacy
   in the service of civilian power. They also `reset' certain key
   bilateral relationships and `reengaged' multilateralism. However,
   American diplomacy under Obama remains framed by the increasingly
   questionable assumption that its renewed openness to talking, its
   continued military superiority and its claim to embody universal values
   will continue to confer upon it the mantle of global leadership. If US
   administrations continue to assume that this is so, then American
   diplomacy will face the challenge of trying to bridge the increasingly
   widening gap between their aspirations and the means available to
   sustain them.},

Abstract = {This article explores change in local democracy through analysis of the
   views of councillors in Britain. It is argued that within an overarching
   representative process, local democracy takes representative,
   participatory, market and network forms. Using data gathered by
   questionnaire and interview, the article analyses the views of
   councillors on these different forms. It finds that there are
   differences between councillors in their attitudes to the different
   versions of democracy, although in the main councillors demonstrate most
   support for a traditional local representative democratic system. The
   article concludes that councillors continue to act in a manner that is
   out of step with the thrust of reform.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the main characteristics of the (re-)emerging
   foreign aid policies of the Visegrad countries (the Czech Republic,
   Hungary, Poland, Slovakia), concentrating on the allocation of their aid
   resources. I adopt an econometric approach, similar to the ones used in
   the literature, for analysing the aid allocation of the OECD DAC donors.
   Using this approach, I examine the various factors that influence aid
   allocation of the Visegrad countries, using data for the years between
   2001 and 2008. The most important conclusion is that the amount of aid a
   partner country gets from the four emerging donors is not influenced by
   the level of poverty or the previous performance of the recipients
   (measured by the level of economic growth or the quality of
   institutions). The main determining factor seems to be geographic
   proximity, as countries in the Western Balkans and the Post-Soviet
   region receive much more aid from the Visegrad countries than other
   recipients. Historical ties (pre-1989 development relations) and
   international obligations in the cases of Afghanistan and Iraq are also
   found to be significant explanatory factors. This allocation is in line
   with the foreign political and economic interests of these new donors.
   Although there are clear similarities between the four donors, this
   paper also identifies some individual country characteristics. Journal
   of International Relations and Development (2012) 15, 65-89.

Abstract = {This article addresses the question of how governments can set up and
   manage, in an increasingly complex policy environment, processes of
   public consultation that lead to good outcomes. Drawing upon insights of
   democratic theory and literature on network and interactive governance,
   the article discusses the organization and outcomes of public
   consultation processes. The analysis of four Belgian cases shows that
   the absence of open process rules does not prevent good outcomes.
   Second, the level of managerial autonomy is positively correlated with
   the intensity of process design and management. Third, cases with
   intensive process design and management have better overall results.
   These findings question some normative assumptions in the literature,
   positing the need for open process rules regarding entrance, scope of
   discussion, and interaction. Intensive process design and management
   with rules properly accommodating the policy situation is possibly a
   better means of achieving good results than rule openness. These
   findings challenge the need for legislation stipulating in detail who
   needs to be consulted, about what, and how.},

Abstract = {The present article attempts to shed light on the Gnostic infrastructure
   underlying the philosophy of Alfred Rosenberg, chief ideologue of the
   Nazi movement, based on his book The Myth of the Twentieth Century and
   other writings. Within this frame of reference I wish to elaborate on
   Eric Voegelin and Hans Jonas' early characterization of Nazism as
   `Modern Gnosis', applying their theoretical framework to Rosenberg's
   Wel-tanschauung. I would like to suggest a structural analysis of
   Rosenberg's political religion, and to point out the way
   theological-Gnostic principles were translated into a racial-secular
   eschatology, while performing a conceptual reversal in Gnostic thought
   that converted the transcendental God into an immanent manifestation of
   the race-soul. This transfiguration of Gnostic transcendence into an
   `immanent' or `organic' worldview, which considers nature or race as a
   divine substance and the primary source of life, enabled Rosenberg to
   turn the Nordic man into the founding subject of history, and to
   transform politics into an instrument that facilitates racial
   redemption.},

Abstract = {We report our findings on cross-societal variations in values concerning
   Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) held by senior executives from
   five economies. We find that executives in all five economies are
   concerned with the roles of their firms in society, with those in Japan
   most so and those in Hong Kong least so. However, executives in each
   context have different conceptualizations of how firms contribute to
   society. The data suggest variation along three dimensions: implicit
   versus explicit CSR, stakeholder-oriented versus production-oriented CSR
   within implicit CSR and different main stakeholders within
   stakeholder-oriented CSR. We discuss the implications of these findings
   for future research on CSR and for comparative business systems.},

Journal = {CAMBRIDGE REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS},

Volume = {25},

Pages = {669-682},
Abstract = {Several scholars have suggested that ASEAN's institutionalization can be
   attributed to the EU's influence as a `model power'. The notion of the
   EU as a model power is premised on the assumption and belief that
   Europe's history of regional cooperation presents a viable blueprint for
   other regions. This article argues that the EU exerts some power over
   ASEAN-but merely as a `reference point'. The EU's influence is not an
   active one; the organisation essentially serves as a passive reference
   point for ASEAN. The obvious and arguably most important example of this
   referencing is the framing of the ASEAN Charter in 2007. This article
   disagrees with scholars who reduce ASEAN's institutionalization to an
   imitation of the EU form without the substance. Instead, it shows how
   ASEAN has innovated as a regional organization through its Charter and
   Intergovernmental Human Rights Commission.},

   Studies Association The Great Recession, Euro contagion, Middle East
   upheavals, nuclear proliferation, and expansion of rights, among others,
   highlight the centrality of diffusion to international studies. This
   Presidential Address outlines building blocks for a shared
   conceptualization of diffusion that is attentive to the initial
   stimulus; the medium through which information about the stimuli may/may
   not travel to other destinations; the political agents un/affected by
   the stimulus positive or negative externalities, who aid or block the
   stimulus journey to other destinations; and outcomes that enable
   discrimination among grades of diffusion and resulting equilibria.
   Various issue areas illustrate how initial stimuli may/may not change
   preferences, transform identities, trigger emotions, alter strategic
   choices, and affect outcomes. I advance three related considerations.
   First, to avoid selection bias, understanding what does not diffuse (the
   Vegas counterfactual) should be as central as what does. Concepts such
   as firewalls and sedimentation are essential for gauging a mediums
   relative immunity/vulnerability to diffusion. Second, weaving domestic,
   regional, and global considerations into a single analytical framework
   reduces omitted variable bias and enables systematic cross-regional
   comparisons. Third, these building blocks imbue the study of diffusion
   with political dynamicsentailing strategic interaction, contingency,
   incomplete information, and unintended effectsthat defy determinism,
   automaticity, or teleology. Similar causal mechanisms may yield
   different outcomes under different domestic, regional, and global
   conditions. And different mechanisms may yield similar outcomes under
   comparable circumstances. I highlight the challenges inherent in
   assessing the outcomes of diffusion given competing empirical findings,
   epistemologies, and normative readings of what does/does not and
   should/should not diffuse, and outline an agenda for future research.},

Abstract = {The great technological transformation involving Internet, must
   reconsider many of the traditional elements of analysis that have been
   used when face issues of institutional politics, public policies and
   public administrations. In this contribution, there are some
   alternatives to facilitate a better understanding of what is involved
   with the times in which we are immersed, both representing a break with
   many of the fundamentals underlying the representative delegation in the
   political field, as regards the administrative intermediation in the
   management field.
   This document examines the most common guidelines that have been
   followed so far -which characterize Internet as a new tool to keep doing
   better or more nimbly what has been done-, noting what for us are clear
   limits to this approach. Finally, it is analyzed the extent to which the
   Internet can encourage, and indeed is already favoring, changes in the
   elaboration, formation and implementation of public policies, and how
   those changes requires repositioning the place and role of governments
   and public administrations.},

Abstract = {Although Ecuador is home to a large number of indigenous peoples, the
   country failed to produce the number of internationally recognized
   indigenista intellectuals or governmental policies that emerged in
   Mexico or Peru, countries with similar demographic profiles. Despite
   being one of the first countries to endorse proposals that emerged out
   of the Instituto Indigenista Interamericano (Inter-American Indian
   Institute) formed at Patzcuaro, Mexico, in 1940, indigenista
   institutions were unable to gain traction in Ecuador. The shortcomings
   of a national indigenista institute in Ecuador were due to the failure
   of its liberal leaders to present a sufficiently radical critique of
   indigenous realities. Their failure opened spaces that allowed a
   grassroots movement to grow, leading to the organization of militant
   indigenous federations that pressed for economic and social justice.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we introduce the main strengths of Raymond Aron's
   political judgment concerning the `` friend- enemy{''} polarity. In
   light of that question, we revisit Aron's political philosophy in order
   to show its `` intention{''} and the way it accounts for to the tension
   between domestic politics and international relations, norm and
   exception, the `` meaning{''} of politics ( friendship) and the
   permanent possibility of war ( enmity). Aron's critical analysis of Carl
   Schmitt's criterion of the `` political{''} turns out to be a
   particularly revealing example of Aron's approach. The article then
   identifi es the `` lessons{''} to be drawn from the Aronian outlook
   concerning the understanding of the nature of the political world, its
   changing confi gurations and its genuine seriousness.},

Abstract = {Despite some notable accomplishments, the effort underway since 2008 to
   ``reset{''} U.S.-Russian relations on a foundation of mutual interests
   is far from secure. In the past the Russian Federation and the U.S. have
   moved through a number of cycles where phases of rapprochement have
   given way to intensified strategic competition. This pattern could
   reproduce itself if a momentum of expanded cooperation is not sustained.
   Today, in critical areas such as democratization and respect for human
   rights, arms control, counter proliferation, energy security, and
   regional stability, conflict is becoming more pronounced. If the reset
   agenda is to lead forward to a more substantial redefinition of the
   U.S.-Russian relationship these underlying sources of conflict will need
   to be addressed. For the promise of rapprochement to be realized the
   U.S. and its allies must look beyond the limited goals of the reset as
   originally defined towards a strategy of more comprehensive engagement
   designed to bring Russia into the fold as a cooperative member of the
   Western security community. Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The
   Regents of the University of California.},

Abstract = {The authors present a model of the relationship between the spread of
   new military technologies and the occurrence of war. A new technology
   could shift the balance of power, causing anticipatory war as one side
   tries to prevent the other from obtaining it. When one side already has
   it, war is more likely when the shift in power is large, likely, and
   durable. When neither side has it, war is more likely when the expected
   shift is asymmetric (e.g., one side is more likely to get it) and when
   the two sides fear that a war will occur once one of them has it. The
   authors illustrate the model with historical examples from the spread of
   firearms (the Musket Wars in precolonial New Zealand) and of nuclear
   weapons (the end of US nuclear monopoly and the 1967 Six-Day War). A
   broader implication is that major power competition can unintentionally
   cause wars elsewhere.},

Abstract = {In the early to mid-20th century Laski was a prominent critic of British
   Idealist political philosophy. Laski's political thought helps reveal
   weaknesses in the Idealism of Green and Bosanquet, who did not pay
   sufficient attention to divisions within society. Social unity, state
   sovereignty and the general will are among the concepts upon which Laski
   focused. The strength of Laski's criticism can be enhanced by drawing
   upon Gramsci's influential political thought. Laski and Gramsci were
   concerned with similar processes in the politics of capitalist
   countries. A Gramscian method justifies drawing the concept of hegemony
   from Gramsci's work and using that concept in support of Laski's
   arguments.},

Abstract = {Since John Street's article on celebrity politics in 2004, the integral
   role of celebrities in contemporary humanitarian politics has been
   increasingly acknowledged in the study of international relations.
   However, as argued in this article, this research has been limited to
   analysing appearances rather than examining the aesthetics of celebrity
   representations and their thought worlds that contribute also to the
   structures, relations and processes of world politics. This article
   addresses this dearth of critical attention and proposes an approach to
   engage with celebrity humanitarian imaginaries politically by turning to
   critical humanitarianism and cultural and post-colonial studies. It
   concludes that by failing to acknowledge the historicity, conditions and
   effects of celebrity humanitarian intelligibilities and imaginaries in a
   globalised world, research in this area is in danger of missing the very
   location of politics. What is called for is future research that
   broadens the understanding of this activity in world politics without
   closing the question of the political.},

Abstract = {This study analyzes the impact of management quality, spending, problem
   severity, and political factors on states' air pollution control
   outcomes and provides insights for improving the measures and methods
   used in public management and government performance research. The
   analysis illustrates the importance of selecting proper outcome measures
   and taking into account the interaction of management and spending when
   conducting empirical analysis into the causes of government performance.
   Additionally, the author demonstrates the benefits of conducting
   comparative empirical analysis using different, but theoretically
   connected, outcome measures. The findings and analysis presented should
   be of particular interest to public administration scholars seeking to
   conduct research that produces practical insights for public managers
   and policy makers on improving public management and government
   performance.},

Year = {2012},
Volume = {39},
Number = {4},
Pages = {181-200},

Abstract = {A major legal reform of Chilean environmental institutions was approved
   in November 2009, at the end of Michelle Bachelet's administration. In
   sharp contrast with the external pressures that provided the impetus for
   the establishment of the country's environmental institutions in the
   early 1990s, this time the driving forces came mainly from an ``internal
   demand,{''} a broad social and political consensus about the need to
   improve the environmental framework. This consensus was a consequence of
   the institutional breakdown revealed by a local movement that emerged in
   Valdivia, southern Chile, in response to a major ecological disaster
   produced by the effluents of a pulp mill that polluted a protected
   wetland and caused the death and migration of an endangered population
   of black-necked swans. Although the Valdivian movement did not succeed
   in stopping the disaster and restoring the wetland, it triggered an
   unprecedented examination of the performance of environmental
   institutions, finally forcing the 2009 environmental reform. The
   resonance of the Valdivian movement can be understood in the context of
   dozens of environmental conflicts that had been accumulating for more
   than a decade, largely as an effect of the crisis of legitimacy of
   environmental institutions. Although this recently approved legislation
   represented an overall advance, it failed to address the issues that led
   to the institutional breakdown, in particular the need for
   democratization of decision making and the broadening of public
   participation. Paradoxically, thus, the reform perpetuated the crisis of
   legitimacy that underlay its origin, reinforcing the exclusionary
   mechanisms that largely explain socio-environmental unrest and
   ecological destruction in Chile.},

Abstract = {Why do states make disingenuous treaty commitments? Under what
   conditions will countries refrain from entering cooperative agreements
   with which they do not expect to comply? This article addresses these
   questions by analyzing how states that are pursuing nuclear weapons
   treat the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). The authors develop a
   distinction between two types of noncooperative behavior. The first is
   cheating while part of the NPT (predation) and the second is pursuing
   nuclear weapons outside of the treaty (abstention). The authors'
   argument is that democratic proliferators are more likely to abstain
   because executives in democracies are domestically constrained to a
   greater degree than authoritarian leaders. Statistical tests in a sample
   of all countries with active nuclear weapons programs from 1968 to 2004
   provide evidence in favor of our argument. Controlling for confounding
   variables and the factors that motivate states to pursue nuclear
   weapons, the results show that states with greater constraints on
   executive authority are less likely to choose predation. Yet, electoral
   mandates do not appear to dissuade governments from making disingenuous
   treaty commitments. These findings have important implications for
   nuclear proliferation, the credibility of international commitments, and
   efforts to link domestic political institutions with international
   outcomes.},

   Studies Quarterly, doi: 10.1111/j.1468-2478.2011.00716.x ?(c) 2012
   International Studies Association On the eve of World War II, eight
   countries had completely abolished the death penalty and another six had
   banned it for ordinary crimes. As of early 2008, 92 countries had
   prohibited capital punishment for all crimes and 10 more had ruled it
   out for ordinary crimes. The goal of this article is to account for the
   pattern of national abolition of the death penalty since 1960. We
   hypothesize that certain kinds of democracies are more liable to end
   capital punishment than others. Specifically, the negotiated form of
   democracy produced by parliamentary systems with proportional
   representation (consensus democracy in Lijpharts terms) is more likely
   to do away with the death penalty than are other forms of democracy. As
   previous research indicates, democratic transitions also increase the
   likelihood of abolition. Finally, international influences can also tip
   countries toward abolition. We suggest that incentives provided by
   international organizations, particularly in Europe, have drawn some
   countries toward abolition. The empirical analysis of approximately 150
   countries for the period 19602005 confirms our expectations.},

Title = {Zapatista and counter-Zapatista protests: A test of

Volume = {49},

Pages = {459-472},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This study represents the first systematic analysis of the interactions
   between pro-Zapatista and counter-Zapatista protestors in Chiapas,
   Mexico, and the first empirical test of movement-countermovement
   theories in a transitional democracy. Three claims are tested: (1)
   movement protests trigger countermovement protest activity; (2)
   different political parties at different levels of government trigger
   movement-countermovement protest activity; and (3) victories won by one
   side of a conflict, viewed as procedural concessions, trigger further
   pro- and countermovement protest activity. These hypotheses are tested
   using negative binomial models and data on Zapatista-related protest
   activity between 1994 and 2003. The results show that: (1) movement and
   countermovement protests have a positive, reciprocal effect on both
   groups' future protest activity; (2) movement and countermovement
   protesting groups use the dominant political party as a target of
   protest. The characteristics of the electoral cycle and rise of
   multi-party competition at all levels of government do not have a
   consistent effect on protest activity; (3) granting procedural
   concessions to pro-movement actors generates more protest activity among
   both groups. However, granting procedural concessions via social
   programs and public works to the population irrespective of its sympathy
   to either side of the movement-countermovement conflict decreases
   movement protests and increases countermovement protests.},

Abstract = {Party political incongruence in the UK after 2007 has had a moderate
   effect on both the machinery of intergovernmental relations and the
   dominant modes of intergovernmental interaction. In assessing changes in
   intergovernmental structures, we find more frequent meetings and more
   formalised interactions. A preference for informal bilateral exchange,
   however, still prevails. In assessing changes in the nature of
   intergovernmental relations, we find some intensification of conflict,
   but amid continued co-operation. While one might find more pronounced
   changes after longer periods of party political incongruence, we argue
   that the limited effect observed thus far can be traced back to: (i)
   formal-legal features of the UK multi-level polity; (ii) the nature of
   the policy sectors requiring intergovernmental co-ordination (iii); the
   specific political dynamics within the constituent governments; and (iv)
   the mitigating role and structure of non-elected institutions such as
   the civil service and the judiciary.},

Abstract = {Policies to improve energy access and energy efficiency are often
   discussed, designed and assessed in isolation from each other. In this
   paper, we highlight possible synergies in these two domains of policy
   making by looking specifically at some key household end uses that are
   the first to be met once improved access has been provided. By building
   in efficiency considerations at the very inception of activities aimed
   at improving access, effective energy supply available is potentially
   increased, the level of energy services that can be provided by the
   existing capacity and infrastructure or from existing budgets available
   is also enhanced, and the potential for reducing the cost for those
   populations for which cost has the highest consideration is also
   improved. In particular, we recommend two areas where policy maybe
   leveraged to benefit both access and efficiency objectives, first in the
   setting of standards, labels and codes and second coupling energy
   subsidies for access with rebates or grants for more efficient end use
   devices.},

Abstract = {Lustration was not legislated in Romania to date, but it was discussed
   by deputies and senators of all ideological persuasions, especially from
   2005 to 2007. Declarations delivered in front of the house,
   interventions during debates of lustration-related draft bills and
   contributions to a parliament-sponsored public discussion reveal that
   for Romanian legislators lustration can bring about moral cleansing and
   a break with the past, provide retributive justice for victims of
   communism, facilitate elite replacement, prevent future violence, and
   help countries enjoy the benefits of European Union accession, although
   it punishes valuable individuals, runs against European values, is
   impractical and unconstitutional.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to suggest strengthening of the current
   role of community-based organization (CBO) in rural Korea, such as its
   all-events approach, by adopting the guerilla approach for the ultimate
   goal of effective local emergency management. In so doing, the paper
   first analyzes the real picture of CBO's all-events approach and the
   alternatives available to CBO's guerilla approach via four components:
   (1) local government, (2) local schools, (3) neighboring industry; and
   (4) local residents. The major tenet of this paper is that CBO should
   focus more, like a guerilla or an irregular soldier, on managing local
   emergency, besides all other events in rural Korea, with the support of
   the four components.},

Abstract = {As with the identification and labelling of many mental health problems,
   the adoption of PTSD within DSM can be said to arise from
   contemporaneous social and political contexts: specifically the return
   to the United States of many war-affected veterans from Vietnam (Scott,
   1993). The specific circumstances of the recognition of PTSD within
   DSM-III have led several commentators to discuss it in terms of social
   construction (e.g., Summerfield, 2001). The current review argues that
   the orientation of theory and research aimed at understanding PTSD has
   been particularly informed by Western individualistic constructions of
   social phenomena. Our review calls for a blending of approaches to
   understanding post-traumatic stress by considering the social structures
   and contexts in which it is expressed and in particular by considering
   how a group-level analysis can inform incidence, diagnosis, and
   expression of post-traumatic symptoms.},

Abstract = {The economic and political outcomes of market globalization continue to
   be complex. As international corporations engage developing markets,
   they increasingly find consumers who lack market sophistication,
   meaningful purchasing options and economic leverage. Such conditions are
   ripe for the exploitation of these market segments but also can be
   mitigated by enlightened managers willing to thoughtfully consider their
   ethical and professional obligations to vulnerable consumers. This paper
   builds on a normative ethical framework, labeled the integrative justice
   model (IJM) for impoverished markets that was introduced in the
   marketing and public policy literature. Specifically, the paper will
   extend the normative ethics of the IJM by proposing logically reasoned
   decision principles for managers, particularly in MNC subsidiaries, that
   might better shape ethical business strategy when targeting impoverished
   segments. Additionally, numerous case examples are given to illustrate
   how a number of these decision principles are already being applied by
   companies around the world. Such an approach can serve as a
   counterweight to the difficulty of crafting global regulations for
   market development.},

   explaining the substantial differences in womens employment trajectories
   that still exist within and across countries. It covers research that
   emphasizes economic and normative rationalities in womens employment
   decisions and work that focuses more on the structural constraints to
   womens employment. It discusses recent research developmentsconceptual
   and methodological advancesand based on the identification of central
   research gaps and methodological challenges, it indicates avenues for
   future research. Finally, the paper casts a critical view on the
   oexplanatory power' of contemporary research on womens employment and
   discusses appropriate research designs for the evaluation of policy

Abstract = {We investigate the factors attracting FDI into highly diversified
   Russian regions during the phase of transition, and verify the impact of
   transition experience on the current FDI inflow. Using cross-sectional
   and panel data, we demonstrate that the highly inhomogeneous investment
   pattern is explained, in addition to classical demand factors, by
   specific economic and socio-institutional regional characteristics.
   Russia appears as an idiosyncratic country where foreign investors seek
   a stable social and institutional context. Using recent FDI data we show
   that transition experiences influence current FDI inflow, particularly
   when the strength of the institutional environment and availability of
   infrastructures are taken into account. (C) 2012 The Regents of the

Abstract = {Since 2004 China has set up over 700 Confucius Institutes and Confucius
   Classrooms around the world to promote its language and culture and
   thereby to shape its image. Despite this impressive number Confucius
   Institutes are surprisingly understudied, especially in terms of their
   actual structure, operation mode and activities. This paper uses German
   Confucius Institutes as a case study to bridge this gap. It first
   discusses the concepts of public and cultural diplomacy and culture
   institutes as a conceptual tool to analyze Confucius Institutes. It then
   turns to the case study to provide empirical data to better understand
   this instrument of China's image shaping efforts. It argues that
   Confucius Institutes are connected to the rise of China and a unique
   member of the family of national culture institutes.},

Abstract = {Can Kantian cosmopolitanism contribute to normative approaches to
   immigration? Kant developed the universal right to hospitality in the
   context of late eighteenth-century colonialism. He claimed that
   non-European countries had a sovereign right over their territory and
   the conditions of foreigners' visits. This sovereign prerogative limited
   visitors' right to hospitality. The interconnected and complementary
   system of right he devised is influential today, but this article argues
   that maintaining the complementarity of the three realms involves
   reconsidering its application to contemporary immigration. It situates
   Kant's Perpetual Peace within the context of debates about conquest and
   colonialism and argues that Kant's strict conception of sovereignty is
   justified by his concern in maintaining a realm of sovereignty that is
   complementary with cosmopolitanism and his prioritization of mutual
   agreements in each of the realms, particularly in a context of
   international power asymmetry. In Kant's time, European powers
   appropriated cosmopolitan discourses to defend their right to visit
   other countries and it was necessary to strengthen non-Europeans'
   sovereign claims. The strength and hostility of the visitors made
   limited hospitality and strong sovereignty act in tandem to keep away
   conquerors, expanding cosmopolitanism. Today, individuals from poor
   countries migrate to wealthier ones where they are subject to a
   sovereign authority that excludes them. Sovereignty and cosmopolitanism
   no longer work complementarily, but rather strengthen powerful state
   actors vis-a-vis non-citizens subject to unilateral rule. Maintaining
   the pre-eminence of the right to freedom, the article suggests that only
   through the creation of cosmopolitan spaces of politics can we reproduce
   today the complementarity that Kant envisioned.},

   not regional income but the saliency of the second dimension of party
   politics that drives preferences for regional redistribution. Second, I
   analyse whether the relationship between partisan attitudes and
   redistributive preferences is conditional on the saliency of the second
   dimension across various regions. Third, I also investigate whether the
   relationship between partisan attitudes and redistributive preferences
   changes between cohorts within a given party system.},

Abstract = {This article offers an intellectual history of theoretical work devoted
   to explaining asymmetric conflict outcomes since World War II. Three
   factors are critical to understanding how the literature has evolved.
   First, the concept of ``asymmetric conflict{''} encompasses a number of
   overlapping literatures, including insurgency, terrorism,
   counterinsurgency, and most recently, civil wars. Second, and
   interrelated, the field of inquiry has been unproductively divided
   between military and academic thinkers, with insufficient engagement
   between the two communities. Third, the popularity of the field of
   inquiry following the events of September 11, 2001, and the subsequent
   American-led military operations in Afghanistan (2001) and Iraq (2003)
   have resulted in analyses that are empirically rich, but have provided
   little in the way of theoretical advances. The conclusion offers an
   overall assessment of the field of inquiry into asymmetric conflict
   outcomes, suggested directions for future research, and a table of major
   contributors to the literature, their key questions, case universes,
   intended contributions, and theoretical limitations.},

Title = {Regulatory Stringency and Policy Drivers: A Reassessment of Renewable
   Portfolio Standards},
Journal = {POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {40},
Number = {4},
Pages = {730-756},
Abstract = {Renewable energy policy has far-reaching implications for national and
   international economic, environmental, and political sustainability, but
   thus far within the United States it has been almost entirely the
   province of state governments. This article examines the factors
   motivating state-level policymakers to adopt different forms of a
   renewable portfolio standard (RPS), highlighting the distinction between
   degrees of policy stringency, ranging from entirely voluntary
   participation to rigorous and strictly enforced targets. In the process
   we introduce a new metric for assessing stringency, more precise and
   reliable than the various proxies used previously, and analyze its
   relationship to drivers of policy adoption. We find that policies of
   different stringencies are motivated by systematically different
   underlying factors. State-level citizen political ideology is a
   significant predictor of RPS policy adoption, particularly for voluntary
   and weak policy designs. Strong policy designs, on the other hand, are
   best predicted by ideology at the government level, i.e., the degree of
   institutional liberalism. These findings may inform current
   implementation and program evaluation efforts, and potentially point the
   way toward more effective policy choices if and when an RPS moves
   forward on the national policy agenda, while the stringency metric
   central to this analysis can be of use to other policy scholars
   concerned with topics both within and beyond the realm of energy policy.},

Abstract = {In this article, we examine the relationship between judicial behavior
   on the Chilean Constitutional Tribunal and the political background of
   its judges since the constitutional reforms of 2005. We first examine
   judges' positions on rulings and find that some distinction has emerged
   among judges with different political backgrounds and between partisan
   members and nonpartisans. Notably, these distinctions vary across
   subject matter and case type. Second, we examine the judges' behavior in
   nonunanimous cases using a multidimensional scaling analysis and find
   that the pattern of dissent coalitions is consistent with a general
   separation between the judges with center-left and right backgrounds.
   Finally, we examine several cases to illustrate the patterns on the
   Tribunal in this period. We conclude that some ideological differences
   on the Tribunal have emerged while a broadly ``political{''} pattern of
   judicial dissents has so far not occurred.},

Year = {2012},
Pages = {1-19},
Abstract = {Over the past decade, performance information has been widely available
   to citizens along with the expansion of e-government, which has
   magnified communications between citizens and government as well as
   citizen direct participation in government business. If citizens are
   informed more about government performance, citizen trust in government
   should improve. However, there is, in effect, little use of performance
   information by citizens, since availability to citizens is not very
   visible. To disseminate the results of performance measurement
   effectively, government should pay attention to the improvement of
   performance measurement systems and performance reporting systems with
   citizen-centered approaches. User-friendly reporting should not just
   simplify the multi-layers of performance measurement for improving
   performance itself. Rather, this chapter suggests applying different
   approaches to present complicated performance information to citizens.
   Performance reporting should be constructed in modernized, innovative,
   and user-focused ways to stimulate the use of performance information by
   external stakeholders, which can promote government accountability.},

Abstract = {Following its victory in the spring 2008 general elections, the
   centre-right coalition led by Silvio Berlusconi formed a government that
   appeared to be the most cohesive in the history of the Second Republic.
   Three-and-a-half years later, in November 2011, Berlusconi was forced to
   resign, ending a long period in which he had dominated Italian politics.
   By analysing the 2008-11 political-economic cycle, with special
   attention to the local elections and the referendums of May and June
   2011, we argue that the downfall of Berlusconi's government can be
   explained by the interplay of the international economic crisis, the
   scandals related to the prime minister's private life, the divisions of
   the parties of the centre-right and the shrinking of its parliamentary
   base.},

Journal = {PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION},

Volume = {90},
Number = {3},
Pages = {737-758},
Abstract = {This article looks at the use of institutionalized publicprivate
   partnership (PPP) arrangements by local governments for the delivery of
   different types of infrastructure. It starts by analyzing the mixed
   company model from a theoretical point of view, in particular the
   potential for internal regulation and the achievement of a relational
   agreement. Then, after discussing the practicalities of crafting this
   type of governance structure, four Portuguese case studies are examined.
   The empirical evidence on mixed companies operating in the water, waste,
   transportation, and education sectors shows that the extreme complexity
   involved in the whole life-cycle management of these companies usually
   leads to a poor protection of the public interest.},

Title = {Beyond soft balancing: small states and coalition-building in the ICC
   and climate negotiations},
Journal = {CAMBRIDGE REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {25},
Number = {3},
Pages = {345-366},
Abstract = {The role of small states has been largely neglected in research on the
   process and outcome of multilateral negotiations. Even though these
   states may be active in the agenda-setting processes or display a
   specific engagement in certain thematic aspects of negotiations, in the
   end game the outcome of negotiations has been perceived to be dependent
   on the bargaining between major powers. However, small states also have
   strategies at their disposal to compensate for these weaknesses. Two
   principal ones come to mind, prioritization or niche diplomacy, and
   coalition-building to join forces with like-minded states in order to
   draw on their resources, expertise and manpower. In the article, we
   compare two cases of small state coalitions in multilateral
   negotiations, namely the Like Minded (LM) group in the negotiations that
   led to the establishment of the International Criminal Court (ICC), and
   the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) in United Nations climate
   negotiations. While the two coalitions resort to similar strategies,
   they have not been comparably successful. We will show that the ability
   to translate discursive power into measurable effects on outcomes
   ultimately depends on the institutional setting of the negotiations and
   the nature of the issue that coalitions are tackling.},

Title = {The currencies of carbon: carbon money and its social meaning},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {21},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {604-620},
Abstract = {Following the rapid development of carbon markets, little attention has
   been devoted to what precisely is being traded. Some authors have
   speculated that carbon can be considered as a form of money (Button;
   House and Victor). Not only is making money from carbon possible via
   several market devices but this process has also enabled the
   construction of carbon as a form of money. The importance of the social
   underpinnings of the commodification of carbon is highlighted and,
   following arguments about the performativity of economics (Callon), it
   is shown that carbon can perform functions similar to those of money.
   Following Actor-Network Theory, market devices such as registries or
   exchange platforms are explored to show how the market is constructed
   through them. Using the work of Zelizer and others on the sociology of
   money, it is argued that the construction of carbon money should be seen
   as a fundamentally social (rather than `merely' technical) process.},

Pages = {843-858},
Abstract = {Though best known for its coverage of key policy areas, the Maastricht
   Treaty also introduced important institutional reforms. Building on the
   Single European Act, these pertained mainly to strengthening the
   legislative role of the European Parliament and extending the scope of
   qualified majority voting to more policy areas. Treaty-based
   institutional reform continued in the post-Maastricht period. Due to the
   twin challenges facing the EU in the aftermath of Maastricht - Central
   and Eastern European enlargement, and the gaping `democratic deficit' -
   the focus of such reform shifted to the modalities of qualified majority
   voting and the size and composition of the Commission. The highly
   contentious nature of these issues thwarted effective institutional
   reform in the 1990s, overshadowed the work of the 2002-2003
   Constitutional Convention, and dominated the intergovernmental
   conferences preceding the failed Constitutional Treaty and the
   subsequent Lisbon Treaty.},

   `public-private' regulation. Second, in the new millennium regulation
   shifted towards `private-public', with regulators paying more attention
   to the demands of large financial firms. This tendency is explored
   through a critical study of `technical' decision-making by EU
   regulators, focusing upon the Committee of European Securities
   Regulators and rating credit agencies. Third, as from 2010 EU
   policy-makers react to the spillover of the financial crisis from
   markets to member states, some limits to private-public governance have
   been underlined. The paper concludes with a discussion of positions
   taken by the European Parliament, moderating claims made for `technical'
   rule-making and opening up the possibility of wider intellectual and
   policy debate.},

Abstract = {How is the organisational structure of urban environmental stewardship
   groups related to the diverse ways that civic stewardship is taking
   place in urban settings? The findings of the limited number of studies
   that have explored the organisational structure of civic
   environmentalism are combined with the research on civic stewardship to
   answer this question. By bridging these relatively disconnected strands
   of research and testing their expectations on a structured sample of
   civic groups that were surveyed in New York City, a statistically
   significant relationship is found between the organisational structure
   of groups and both the organisational characteristics, as well as the
   types of environmental work they are doing. How these findings advance
   the research on urban environmental stewardship is discussed, as well as
   what these results tell us about the ways civil society engages in urban
   stewardship more broadly.},

Abstract = {This contribution considers mechanisms for rule-based fiscal policy
   co-ordination to replace the failed Stability and Growth Pact in the
   euro area. It argues in favour of soft debt targets as a means of
   addressing problems caused by excessive debt. It is shown how such
   targets can be safely operated, supported by an effective excess debt
   protocol. A division of labour between fiscal and monetary policy is
   proposed, whereby fiscal policy is used for long-term targets and
   monetary policy for short-term stabilization. We then design a
   monitoring agency, in the form of a fiscal policy commission for Europe,
   to make the excess debt protocol operational. The contribution also
   addresses the issue of moral hazard, by proposing that governments be
   abandoned to financial markets at the upper debt limit, a commitment to
   be spelled out in advance. Finally, this framework is set within the
   idea of fiscal space. We show how structural reforms can expand that
   fiscal space.},

Abstract = {The notion of ``counterinsurgency{''} (COIN) has for some years been the
   central concept driving military operations in Afghanistan, and before
   that, in Iraq. It constitutes the dominant idea influencing much current
   military planning of the major Western powers. This study questions the
   assumptions and relevance of the thinking behind counterinsurgency
   doctrine. It suggests that the ultimate effect of its dominance is to
   reduce the highly contingent nature of war to a list of techniques, the
   application of which are regarded as a sufficient precondition whenever
   states deem that they are confronted by conflicts that can be described
   as an ``insurgency.{''} Such assumptions are both arbitrary and risk
   crowding out necessary, although by their nature very difficult,
   political judgments that are required for the effective construction and
   implementation of strategies that seek to ensure that the ends sought
   are proportional to the means employed.},

Pages = {392-405},
Abstract = {It has been argued that the decision of key Western states to support
   Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence from Serbia, in 2008,
   was driven by the fear that had this not happened there would have been
   a danger of renewed violence and instability. This begs the question as
   to whether this situation could have been averted had the United Nations
   taken a more active role in pacifying Kosovo following the intervention
   in 1999. This article argues that this was not in fact possible. For a
   variety of reasons, which will be explored, it was simply impossible to
   institute full-scale disarmament. Moreover, efforts to tackle the
   elements of organized resistance, which was built around former members
   of the Kosovo Liberation Army, would have precipitated a conflict in the
   territory at a far earlier stage.},

Title = {Close Encounters of the Tribal Kind: the Implementation of Co-option as
   a Tool for De-escalation of Conflict - The Case of the Netherlands in
   Afghanistan's Uruzgan Province},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {35},
Number = {5, SI},
Pages = {713-734},
Abstract = {In contemporary counter-insurgency campaigns de-escalation is typically
   achieved by obtaining the local population's collaboration. The
   rationale underlying this approach is that such collaboration spawns
   control over the population and therefore weakens the insurgent's
   position. This article seeks to understand how this approach is
   practised in the reality of contemporary counter-insurgency warfare. In
   Iraq as well as Afghanistan counter-insurgents were confronted with
   fragmented indigenous societies in which the various local segments were
   dominated by local power-holders. Consequently, obtaining the local
   population's collaboration required co-option of these agents. As such a
   strategy of co-option is a highly localized approach, this article
   focuses on Afghanistan's Uruzgan province and analyzes the
   implementation of co-option by the Netherlands' Task Force Uruzgan
   (TFU), which operated there from 2006 to 2010. The analysis discusses
   how the counter-insurgents obtained a profound understanding of
   Uruzgan's societal landscape and how co-option of local power-holders
   became part of the counter-insurgency routine. In the end, co-option was
   successfully implemented as TFU even succeeded in obtaining the
   collaboration of previously marginalized elements of the population.
   However, as the methods employed for co-option were mainly of a
   persuasive nature, the TFU co-option strategy was less effective in
   containing the influence of notorious spoilers. Thus this case study
   provides an insight into the dynamics and limitations of co-option as a
   tool for de-escalation in contemporary counterinsurgency warfare.},

Abstract = {This study sets out to explore the institutional embeddedness of civic
   engagement in the form of monetary donations and volunteering by firms
   in Western Europe. Drawing on a recent analysis of Corporate Social
   Responsibility (CSR), two contradictory hypotheses-institutional mirror
   versus substitute-are discussed focusing on three institutional spheres:
   corporatism, welfare arrangements and statism. The paper argues for
   moving beyond a linear perspective and takes the interaction of
   institutional spheres into account. Using a comparative quantitative
   multilevel approach, institutional, sectoral and organizational
   determinants of enterprises' civic engagement are empirically analysed
   drawing on a survey of small-and medium-sized firms in 17 Western
   European countries. While firm size remains an important determinant of
   civic engagement, it is shown that the impact of welfare arrangements is
   conditional on the presence of corporatist arrangements and vice versa.
   This suggests that civic engagement both mirrors and substitutes for
   existing institutions, depending on underlying institutional
   complementarities.},

Abstract = {Recent attempts at developing social-structural accounts of the
   international order have suggested that the international system might
   be analysed in terms of patterns of vertical differentiation and
   stratification. Taking up this challenge, this article argues that
   inequality should be understood as part of the `deep structure' of the
   international system rather than in terms of the attributes of
   individual states. It suggests that we can understand how stratification
   and vertical differentiation emerge by examining five dimensions along
   which processes producing asymmetry occur, focusing on transactions
   between actors. These dimensions are: inter-state political hierarchy;
   secular socioeconomic development within societies; global
   stratification within the world economy; the dynamic of competitive
   development; and the process of overall collective management and
   supranational governance of the international system/global order. The
   historical intersection of these forms of stratification has produced an
   emergent, historically contingent division within the international
   order familiar to students of international politics as the North-South
   divide.},

Abstract = {This paper presents evidence of ethnocultural coexistence strategies as
   a counterargument to more pessimistic views for inter-ethnic relations.
   The community under ethnographic investigation is the semi-isolated,
   southern village of Kassumba, Guinea-Bissau in West Africa. The minority
   Islamic Nalu ` claim territorial hegemony while spiritist Balanta
   immigrants outnumber the Nalu ` three to one. This paper finds that
   inter-ethnic cooperation through hospitality, mutually beneficial
   economic arrangements, and the fashioning of individual-and
   community-level social bonds are important approaches to making a living
   in this village. This paper contributes to the ongoing discussions
   regarding the relationships between cultural identity, livelihood and
   the politicized organization of space.},

Abstract = {This article discusses the 2011 legislative election results in Portugal
   and the context in which they took place. After describing how the
   economic and financial crisis unfolded, leading to the European
   Union/International Monetary Fund bailout, it analyses the campaign
   strategies of the major parties. On the basis of a post-election survey,
   the article then discusses how successful these strategies were, and
   concludes by analysing the aftermath of the election in terms of
   government formation.},

Journal = {CRITICAL POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {6},
Number = {3},
Pages = {243-260},
Abstract = {This article seeks to problematize notions of objective policy
   evaluation using the techniques of interpretive policy analysis, and use
   the findings to develop a new evaluation and new proposals for policy
   improvement. It presents evidence from ethnographic fieldwork on the
   same set of urban regeneration (or renewal) policies in two Scottish
   neighborhoods between 1989 and 2009. The analysis showed that the policy
   was variously understood as a failure or a success in four different
   ways: as a failure within the rationality of official evaluation; as a
   failure because of the stigma in wider society against deprived
   neighborhoods; as a failure in some ways by local community activists
   describing their lived experience through local knowledge; and as a
   success through local knowledge of the improvements to the physical
   environment. It demonstrates how policy problem definition and
   evaluation are closely intertwined and therefore for a policy to be
   judged a success requires a nuanced understanding of policy problems
   within their wider social context.},

Title = {The impact of the Australian High Court on elite opinion},
Journal = {COMMONWEALTH \& COMPARATIVE POLITICS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {50},
Number = {2},
Pages = {171-189},
Abstract = {Institutional theory suggests that policy views of a Court in democratic
   regimes are never far out of line for long with the policy views of the
   dominant lawmaking majorities because of relatively regular turnover in
   the membership of the Court. The result is the Court may provide
   legitimacy to majoritarian policies and can sometimes influence elite
   preferences. The authors develop and test a theory of legitimation using
   a data set administered to all candidates running for a seat in both
   houses of the Australian National Parliament. Using methods originally
   developed in public opinion research, they explore whether political
   elites respond to decisions made by the High Court in the area of
   governmental regulation of work environments. Their findings indicate
   that the High Court was able to effect a structural change in elite
   opinion.},

Abstract = {The effect of immigration preferences on electoral outcomes in Spain is
   understudied. This paper hypothesises that, even in the absence of a
   radical right party, immigration preferences can be associated with
   mainstream voting when they are incorporated into established axes of
   political conflict. The analyses show that the electoral strength of
   immigration preferences is connected with the strength of the
   centre-periphery cleavage in Spain. More specifically, immigration
   preferences are a stronger determinant of the vote for parties with
   relatively more pro-decentralisation stances, among individuals with
   more coherent immigration and decentralisation attitudes, and in regions
   where the centre-periphery cleavage is stronger.},

Abstract = {The financial crisis had significant implications for the fiscal
   positions of OECD. As nations seek to cope with the economic
   contraction, budget deficits and debt have risen to near record postwar
   levels. As the crisis in Europe and other advanced economies has
   deepened, fiscal consolidation will have to be coupled, and even
   preceded, by actions to jump-start crippled economies. Nonetheless, when
   fiscal consolidation becomes necessary, nations that procrastinate by
   waiting for a crisis to provide cover for the politically hard choices
   will pay a steep price indeed both economically and politically. Many in
   the academic and policy community have raised questions about whether
   advanced democracies have the political wherewithal to respond to
   gathering fiscal pressures through early and timely action. Recent
   fiscal actions in advanced nations suggest that democracies are not
   doomed to wait for market shocks and crises. Rather, leaders have shown
   that fiscal sacrifice can be achieved in ways that promote electability.
   In this article, we discuss the impetus for democratic fiscal actions
   and the strategies used to gain public support.},

   Situations},
Journal = {POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {40},
Number = {2},
Pages = {256-273},
Abstract = {The literature on the management of policy networks has expanded greatly
   in the past decade. In spite of this attention, no consensus has emerged
   on how to measure collaboration or even what constitutes collaboration.
   This article uses data from a postdisaster survey to compare some
   existing approaches to measuring collaboration. We analyze various
   survey-based measures ranging from respondent-defined collaboration to
   activity-based or contact-based measures. We recommend that scholars
   consider opportunity costs as a key component in differentiating between
   significant collaboration and basic coordination (or parallel play).
   Based on this opportunity cost approach, we consider the distinctiveness
   of disaster collaboration.},

Title = {European Responses to US Diplomacy: `Special Relationships',
   Transatlantic Governance and World Order},
Booktitle = {AMERICAN DIPLOMACY},
Year = {2012},
Pages = {65-83},
Abstract = {This article explores the contrasting diplomacies of the United States
   and the European Union, drawing attention to the characteristics of the
   United States as a `warrior state' and the European Union as a form of
   `trading state' in which a complex and hybrid form of diplomacy is
   produced through the interplay of European and national foreign
   policies. It then pursues the argument that the interplay of US and EU
   diplomacies has generated an evolving EU-US diplomatic system, which in
   itself is hybrid and multi-dimensional. The article explores the context
   within which the EU-US diplomatic system has evolved and is evolving,
   and proposes three key patterns of diplomatic relations as the core of
   the system: `special relationships' reflecting specific ties between the
   United States and key EU member states; `transatlantic governance'
   reflecting the growth of transatlantic transactions and demands for
   their management; and `world order diplomacy', which is centred on
   global governance institutions, patterns of intervention and crisis
   management. The article explores these patterns as they have manifested
   themselves during the George W. Bush and Obama presidencies, and
   concludes by asking whether the implementation of the Lisbon Treaty in
   the European Union is likely to bring about significant change in the
   patterns of EU-US diplomacy.},

Abstract = {In order to understand how exemplary work is done in the complex urban
   environment of disadvantaged neighborhoods, we studied a group of 43
   individuals - civil servants, professionals and active citizens - who
   make a difference. Various so-called `exemplary practitioners' were
   found in the literature and in the neighborhoods of five cities. The
   working methods of exemplary practitioners show a mix and a dose of
   entrepreneurialism, strategic networking and empathic engagement that
   differ from standard bureaucracy but fit very well with what is needed
   in disadvantaged neighborhoods. Two striking examples illustrate these
   working methods.},

Title = {Distinctive Characteristics of American Diplomacy},
Booktitle = {AMERICAN DIPLOMACY},
Year = {2012},
Pages = {1-25},
Abstract = {My central claim is that the United States has conducted a distinctive
   form of `anti-diplomacy', accepting in practice many diplomatic norms
   and practices while remaining reluctant to acknowledge the fact. To
   support this claim, this article argues that since its rise as a world
   power, the United States has participated in international society's
   diplomatic culture in a distinctive way and that this distinctiveness
   stems from seven interconnected characteristics of American diplomacy:
   (1) America's long-held distrust and negative view of diplomats and
   diplomacy, which has contributed to the historical neglect and
   sidelining of the US Department of State in the United States'
   policy-making process; (2) a high degree of domestic influence over
   foreign policy and diplomacy; (3) a tendency to privilege hard power
   over soft power in foreign policy; (4) a preference for bilateral over
   multilateral diplomacy; (5) an ideological tradition of diplomatically
   isolating states that are considered adversarial and of refusing to
   engage them until they meet preconditions; (6) a tradition of appointing
   a relatively high proportion of political rather than career
   ambassadors; and (7) a demonstrably strong cultural disposition towards
   a direct, low-context negotiating style. A consequence of these
   distinguishing characteristics is that American diplomacy tends to be
   less effective than it might otherwise be, not only in advancing the
   United States' own interests, but also in advancing wider international
   cooperation. A goal here is to provide a working framework with which to
   evaluate any US administration's relationship to diplomacy as the
   country's interests and identity evolve.},

Abstract = {To promote a multicultural society, the South Korean government has
   adopted various policies to create an environment conducive for the
   social, economic, and political participation and integration of
   marriage immigrants. To this end, political trust and political efficacy
   are important considerations. Using data from a survey of 138
   respondents, this study examined the political attitudes of marriage
   immigrants according to selected characteristics: origin, age, area of
   residence, length of residence, income, and education. The study found
   that their average political efficacy and trust are low and their modal
   political orientation is alienated. Marriage immigrants have distinct
   concerns and their political attitudes appear to be related to the
   challenges of adapting to Korean society and influenced by the policy
   environment. The observed variations in their political efficacy and
   trust do not systematically follow the trends observed in other studies
   of South Koreans and citizens in other countries and require further
   investigation.},

   the connection between Internet use and civic engagement of rural
   Internet users. Based on the surveys implemented by the China Internet
   Network Information Center (CNNIC), the authors find that using the
   Internet does enhance the level of civic engagement among rural Internet
   users in China. However, better use of the Internet faces some
   obstacles, too. They are the young age of rural users and the limited
   Net bandwidth. Implications of these obstacles are discussed. The
   chapter concludes that, under certain circumstances, there is great
   potential for Chinese rural Internet users to become more actively
   engaged in public affairs in the future.},

Abstract = {This study examined the contribution of verbal behavior to the creation
   of rapport in negotiation, while methodologically addressing the issue
   of dependence between dyadic measures, which is inherent to the concept
   of rapport, with the Actor-Partner Interdependence model. The approach
   adopted is substantially different from that of past research, which
   emphasized the contribution of nonverbal behavior to rapport and used
   averaged rapport to asses it. Drawing both from the theoretical concept
   of rapport and from Politeness theory, the authors developed the Verbal
   Rapport Assessment scale. The authors found that rapport is indeed
   encoded in the verbal behavior and that various verbal behaviors
   contribute to negotiators' sense of rapport, as well as to the judgment
   of negotiators' rapport behaviors. Likewise, the authors found that a
   negotiator's sense of rapport was primarily affected by his partners'
   verbal behavior and by the interaction between behaviors of both sides.
   These findings emphasize the importance of the verbal channel and the
   dyad in creating rapport in negotiation. Negotiation in the twenty-first
   century is often characterized by exclusively verbal interactions (via
   telephone, chat, and e-mails); negotiators from many different fields
   can benefit from these findings.},

Abstract = {The European Union (EU) has launched an impressive number of crisis
   management missions since its Common Security and Defence Policy became
   operational in 2003. This article analyses the agenda-setting phase of
   these civilian and military operations in order to explain why the EU
   has sent troops, policemen, judges, prosecutors and monitors across
   three continents. It presents an institutionalist perspective and argues
   that the former High Representative Javier Solana and his officials have
   been instrumental in putting various operations on the agenda. They have
   employed deliberate agenda-setting strategies, such as venue shopping,
   conflict expansion and issue framing, to further their bureaucratic
   interest of launching new missions. Solana and his officials had the
   ability to affect the agenda-setting process thanks to their pivotal
   position in policy making. This gave them with superior information on
   the state of play and an early mover advantage as well as strong
   international networks. The article provides empirical evidence from the
   crisis management missions in Aceh, Bosnia, Chad and Kosovo. It
   concludes with the changes to the Common Security and Defence Policy
   after the Treaty of Lisbon.},

Abstract = {In this article we investigate the effect of social networks on the
   quality of political thinking. First, the article introduces new social
   network concepts into the literature and develops the corresponding
   measures. Second, the article explores the quality of political thinking
   as a concept and develops its measures based on the volume and the
   causality of thoughts, and their integrative complexity. We make use of
   a survey to collect information on social networks and the experimental
   manipulation controls for the effect of policy frames. Our findings
   consistently show the significant negative impact of cohesive social
   networks on the quality of policy-relevant thinking. We conclude that
   close-knit social networks could create social bubbles that would limit
   how one communicates with others and reasons about politics.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICS},

Volume = {49},

Abstract = {Increasingly, international law is used to address a variety of issues
   that do not fit nicely within political boundaries. Therefore, we must
   remain critical of the use of international law to address issues such
   as climate change. In order to do so this article will look at the
   domestic analogy and how it has shaped our understanding and
   expectations of the use of international law. In several respects, the
   international system mirrors domestic society. Yet, there are very real
   and significant differences that hamper our ability to effectively use
   international law to address these issues. As global capitalism expands
   and reaches ever-further corners of the world, practical problems
   continue to escalate and repercussions become increasingly serious and
   irreversible. These practical problems carry with them equally important
   ethical issues. Perhaps international law as currently conceived and
   applied is incapable of adequately addressing such issues. International

Journal = {HUMAN RIGHTS QUARTERLY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {34},
Number = {4},
Pages = {927-958},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The norm of civilian immunity, which holds that civilians must not be
   intentionally targeted in war or subjected to mass killing, is widely
   supported and considered a jus cogens principle of international law.
   Yet not only does mass killing remain a recurrent feature of world
   politics, but perpetrators sometimes avoid criticism or punishment. This
   article argues that the paradox can be explained by understanding that
   civilian immunity confronts a protracted struggle with competing
   ideologies, some of which have proven resilient, and that decisions
   about how to interpret the norm in specific cases are subject to
   intervening contextual variables.},

Abstract = {In this article, we analyze the links between some cases of biodiesel
   production from waste cooking oil (WCO) and the passing of the Biofuels
   Act by the Argentinean parliament. The analysis is guided by a
   theoretical-methodological approach based on tools drawn from the social
   studies of technology field.
   The employment of eatable crops in the biofuel industry sparked a global
   debate concerning the drawbacks. Critics argue that it deepens the
   capital-intensive monoculture agricultural production, driving away
   small farmers and peasants from their lands.
   Far from these debates, in southern Buenos Aires Province, there were
   alternative biodiesel production experiences whose main objective was
   providing solutions to social and environmental problems. After the
   Biofuels Act was passed, the new scenario posed unprecedented
   challenges.
   The socio-technical approach allowed operating a systemic interpretation
   of these processes, bringing new insights to explain the construction of
   sustainability-or impracticality-of technological policies aimed to
   promote social inclusion.},

Abstract = {War crimes trials are claimed to hold the capacity to contribute to a
   range of ambitious justice goals in post-conflict societies, such as the
   public recognition of victims' experiences, the promotion of respect for
   the rule of law, and the fostering of reconciliation. This article
   unsettles these claims through a case study of the UN-sponsored Serious
   Crimes Process in East Timor. It charts the practical and political
   constraints upon the Serious Crimes Process which undermined its ability
   to achieve its own goals. In addition, it draws on interviews with East
   Timorese survivors to demonstrate the difficulties faced by the Serious
   Crimes Process in fully meeting locally grounded demands for justice.
   This analysis illustrates the inherent limits of war crimes trials in
   responding to calls for justice, which transcend the possibilities of
   the criminal law.},

Abstract = {Developments in international investment arbitration have expanded the
   scope of investment protection well beyond the intention of states
   making investment treaties, to the detriment of developing states and
   their peoples. These developments take place on the basis of the
   trickle-down theory that wealth enhancement will benefit everyone.
   Rather, such wealth enhancement has made the rich richer and the poor
   poorer. The restoration of the law based on normative values, requires
   the taking of measures described in the Osgoode Hall Public Statement on
   the International Investment Regime. This article describes the measures
   advocated by the Statement in their policy context.},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Political parties have generally been disregarded in the literature on
   political obligation. In this article I argue that, regardless of
   whether ordinary citizens or residents of a polity have any political
   obligations, partisanship generates its own kind of political
   obligations. Participating in party politics qua party members,
   supporters, activists or even mere voters produces benefits that
   generate corresponding and proportionate political obligations for those
   who enjoy them. The political obligations of partisans are easier to
   justify than those of ordinary citizens as the conditions under which
   the benefits of partisanship can be rendered excludable are easier to
   obtain.},

Month = {FAL},
Abstract = {Structural international theory has become largely a matter of
   elaborating ``the effects of anarchy.{''} Simple hunter-gatherer band
   societies, however, perfectly fit the Waltzian model of anarchic orders
   but do not experience security dilemmas or warfare, pursue relative
   gains, or practice self-help balancing. They thus demonstrate that ``the
   effects of anarchy,{''} where they exist, are not effects of
   anarchy-undermining mainstream structural international theory as it has
   been practiced for the past three decades. Starting over, I ask what one
   needs to differentiate how actors are arranged in three simple anarchic
   orders: forager band societies, Hobbesian states of nature, and great
   power states systems. The answer turns out to look nothing like the
   dominant tripartite (ordering principle, functional differentiation,
   distribution of capabilities! conception. Based on these cases, I
   present a multidimensional framework of the elements of social and
   political structures that dispenses with anarchy, is truly structural
   (in contrast to the independent-variable agent-centric models of Waltz
   and Wendt), and highlights complexity, diversity, and regular change in
   the structures of international systems.},

Abstract = {The article presents an analysis of ``informal institutionalization{''}
   in post-Communist Russia in theoretical and comparative perspective. It
   is devoted to critical analysis of existing explanations of the
   dominance of subversive institutions that is, those rules, norms, and
   practices that at first sight partly resemble institutions of modern
   democracy, good governance and rule of law, but in fact inhibit them.
   While ``pessimists{''} focus on cultural and historical embeddedness of
   subversive institutions in Russia, ``optimists{''} draw their attention
   to patterns of post-Communist state-building, and ``realists{''} point
   out the major role of special interests groups in turning growing pains
   of informal governance in Russia into its chronic deceases. (C) 2012 The

Abstract = {This article is the first systematic exploration of the leadership
   selection process in the Romanian party system. We use process-tracing
   and qualitative tools, using data from party statutes and documents of
   the national conventions. We focus on the parliamentary political
   parties throughout the entire post-communist period. The analysis shows
   that nothing has changed at the level of centralization of decision, and
   inclusiveness with the members' involvement remaining marginal in all
   parties. The competitiveness of the internal elections presents a more
   diverse and dynamic picture. We propose a novel typology for cross-case
   comparisons that illustrates the association between informal
   decentralization and increased competitiveness. Second, we advance
   explanations for the persistence of the ``exclusiveness{''} status quo
   that take into account intraorganizational, institutional, and exogenous
   factors.},

Abstract = {This article uses the medium of film to analyze masculinities at the
   intersection of the regionally specific with the typical: the peripheral
   factory town with the universalizing panelak, or apartment block. This
   article addresses how the private spaces in industrial regions achieve
   new meaning when the role of the factory or public space, idealized in
   communist propaganda, has undergone a dramatic transformation. After the
   narratives that made spaces ``great{''} became irrelevant in 1989 and
   the panelaky and factories lost their metaphorical meanings, they became
   simply apartment buildings and privately owned worksites. Within these
   spaces, many working-class men in industrial regions have faced more
   difficult transitions than women because they, as idealized workers
   under socialism, were more invested in the system and lost more from its
   collapse. Through an analysis of common themes in films released roughly
   fifteen years after the Velvet Revolution, the author asks how these men
   relate to the panelak, or private space, when excluded from the
   masculine, public space of the factory. How does the employment
   situation impact the family unit? What solutions do directors present to
   these men who find themselves ill-equipped for life in the industrial
   periphery after the post-1989 transition? This article draws from and
   contributes to recent work in the field of Czech gender studies and
   functions as a Czech case study on the relationship between gender and
   space in the former Eastern Bloc.},

Abstract = {Growth in membership and intensifying responsibilities require much
   greater adaptability in organizational structures and administrative
   arrangements at international than at national levels. The ongoing
   transformation toward multilevel governance seems to empower
   international organizations and thus shines a new spotlight on
   international civil servants. We know little, however, about what
   motivates this growing class of bureaucratic elite. Against this
   background, this article explores the question as to how officials of
   the European Commission relate to the recent management modernization
   within their institution (Kinnock reform). Competing explanatory
   approaches (opportunity, socialization, and governance views) are used
   to develop hypotheses about the relationship between Commission
   officials and their acceptance of or opposition to administrative
   reform. The main finding is that the individual attitudes of Commission
   officials toward administrative change can best be explained by the
   opportunity model, which emphasizes the rational calculation of
   individual costs and benefits.},

Abstract = {A basic principle of good government is that politics should be
   restricted to the input side, whereas the bureaucracy should operate
   independently of political considerations. However, previous literature
   documents an implementation gap between unitary political aims and
   varied local outcomes, which occasionally can be attributed to political
   reasons; both bureaucratic ideology and that local political
   constituencies can shape implementation and affect outcome. So far,
   however, research has neglected the question of whether one of these
   effects is conditioned by the other. This article presents original data
   on the political orientation of public employees in the Swedish Social
   Insurance Administration that allow these two factors to be tested
   together for the first time. The main finding is that neither the
   bureaucratic ideology nor the political orientation of the local
   community independently affects the outcome but that the real effect of
   political ideology on implementation takes the form of an interaction
   effect between the two. This interaction effect visualizes so that a
   rightward shift in bureaucratic ideology significantly reduces the
   number of annual sick leave days per capita when the political
   orientation of the local community is right leaning. Hence, political
   ideology only affects welfare state outcome by restricting policy
   implementation in a situation in which restrictive public employees are
   positioned in restrictive local communities.},

Abstract = {For decades, political scientists have grappled with the role identity
   has played in ethnic conflict. Surprisingly, these scholars have been
   unsuccessful in rigorously conceptualising some key terms in the field
   of ethnic studies. How can the causal forces of ethnic strife be
   unravelled if scholars cannot even agree on the meanings of essential
   concepts? This article carefully delineates the differences between
   ethnicity, ethnic groups and ethnic group identity, while showing the
   conceptual mistakes of some of the field's leading scholars. Often
   treated synonymously, these concepts are quite distinct: ignoring this
   not only makes for sloppy scholarship, but has grave policy
   consequences.},

Title = {Reforms to the Social Security System. Lessons from an Organizational
   Vision},
Journal = {REVISTA DEL CLAD REFORMA Y DEMOCRACIA},
Year = {2012},
Number = {53},
Pages = {187+},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The article discusses the organizational implications as a result of the
   new forms of social security systems in the areas of health, pensions
   and unemployment insurance, as a result of set of reforms implemented in
   the last decades. Accordingly, the purpose is to examine to what extent
   these changes can be understood from an organizational vision. The paper
   focuses on studying and analyzing the organizational dimension of the
   social security systems as an important step to understand the current
   effects, practices and routines of the actors involved in such reforms.
   To achieve this, the document attempts to carry out an exploration of
   the experiences from other countries based on the implementation of
   comprehensive reforms of social security systems; in which such changes
   have been made aimed at creating financially sustainable systems, but at
   the same time in comprehensive terms of regulation and administration.
   We have chosen the cases of Norway, Australia and Colombia, for its
   ability to draw lessons, looking to highlight the differences in size,
   type of economy and political system, region and culture. This is to
   maximize the range of observation of the effects and organizational
   challenges and full of ambitious reforms in the social security system,
   under regulation strategies and comprehensive management.
   In order to accomplish the above, the main organizational dimensions are
   presented as well as the methodological considerations that guide the
   cases. That is to say, the nature of the public organizations involved,
   the coordination mechanisms as well as the instruments of regulation.
   Then, we describe these cases, in order to construct lessons and
   dilemmas of the social security systems. Finally, some lessons,
   reflections and conclusions are shown, among which the fact that the
   current design of social security systems is the product not only of
   economic, fiscal and financial pressures, but also a set of particular
   dynamics of an organizational nature such as the existence of a weak
   coordination between the main bodies of both the financing and the
   provision of services, which has led to greater organizational
   complexity, the generation of fragmentation processes within governments
   and hybrid models of organization, either through partnership schemes or
   through the construction of new types of organizational networks.},

Abstract = {Participatory governance programs, which institutionalize
   governmentcivil society interactions through the promotion of public
   deliberation and decision making, are being adopted by local governments
   to harness a wide range of outcomes believed to be positively associated
   with citizens' and civil society organizations' active involvement in
   public life. This article draws from an original survey administered to
   833 individuals elected to leadership positions in Brazil's
   municipal-level participatory budgeting program. Analysis of these data
   using a series of outcome variables and a set of individual- and
   municipal-level variables demonstrates that civil society organization
   (CSO) leaders now engage in direct negotiations with other CSOs, form
   alliances with other CSOs and carry these practices into other
   institutional venues, which helps to undercut traditional clientelistic
   practices while also empowering citizens and enhancing the quality of
   democracy. Further, citizens living in communities that directly benefit
   from public works won through participatory budgeting are empowered by
   credible state commitment. Citizens not directly affiliated with a CSO
   continue to rely on their direct connections to government officials,
   thus demonstrating that individuals' type of involvement in civil
   society has a significant impact on how participatory governance
   arrangements can affect basic statesociety relationships.},

Journal = {REVIEW OF POLICY RESEARCH},

Volume = {29},
Number = {3},
Pages = {383-407},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Policy makers who embrace market-based approaches to environmental
   regulation, typically eschew carbon taxes in favor of the political
   advantages of cap and trade, which offers lower visibility of costs to
   consumers and the opportunity to allocate valuable permits freely to
   industry. Against this backdrop, the article examines two surprising
   proposals for carbon taxes, by the government of British Columbia (BC)
   and by the federal Liberal Party of Canada. Both reflected a triumph of
   party leaders' normative good policy motives over good politics. The BC
   tax alone succeeded first because it was adopted by a party already in
   government. Second, the onset of a recession before the next elections
   shifted voters' attention to the economy, which advantaged the BC
   Liberals but disadvantaged their federal counterparts. However,
   proposals for carbon taxes were unpopular in both jurisdictions,
   offering a cautionary tale concerning the fate of politicians' normative
   commitments absent electoral backing.},

Abstract = {This article explores intergovernmental relations between the devolved
   Welsh Assembly Government and the central UK government through the
   prism of two case studies focusing on examples of Welsh sub-state
   diplomacy, the first being international activity aimed at promoting
   trade and investment and the second the Wales for Africa programme. The
   article focuses in particular on the implications for WalesUK relations
   of partial party incongruence brought about by the formation of the
   LabourPlaid Cymru coalition government in Cardiff in the summer of 2007.
   The authors also examine the early indications of the impact of full
   party incongruence following the formation of the ConservativeLiberal
   Democrat coalition government in London in June 2010.},

Abstract = {Intergovernmental relations serve several purposes: to resolve conflicts
   of competence; to deal with overlaps and externalities; to harmonise
   policies; and to respond to new policy challenges. The United Kingdom is
   not a federation but an asymmetrically devolved system where the central
   government doubles up as the government of the largest part. This makes
   the application of federal intergovernmental theory problematic. At the
   same time, federations are tending to move from co-operative to
   competitive federalism. There is no case for greater policy
   harmonisation. On the contrary, the increased divergence between the
   dominant English legislative majority and majorities in the devolved
   territories points to increased autonomy and less harmonisation. There
   is scope for policy learning within competitive devolution, particularly
   on new policy challenges.},

Volume = {25},

Abstract = {This article examines the phenomenon of increased political pressures on
   governments in four Westminster systems (Australia, Britain, Canada, and
   New Zealand) derived from changes in mass media and communications,
   increased transparency, expanded audit, increased competition in the
   political marketplace, and political polarization in the electorate.
   These pressures raise the risk to impartial public administration and
   management performance to the extent that governments integrate
   governance and campaigning, allow political staff to be a separate force
   in governance, politicize top public service posts, and expect public
   servants to be promiscuously partisan. The article concludes that New
   Zealand is best positioned to cope with these risks, in part because of
   its process for independently staffing its top public service posts. The
   article recommends this approach as well as the establishment of
   independently appointed management boards for public service departments
   and agencies to perform the governance of management function.},

Abstract = {Explanations for the persistence of violence in the eastern part of the
   Democratic Republic of Congo blame the incendiary actions of domestic
   and regional leaders, as well as the inefficacy of international
   peace-building efforts. Based on several years of ethnographic research,
   this article adds another piece to the puzzle, emphasizing the perverse
   consequences of well-meaning international efforts. I argue that three
   narratives dominate the public discourse on Congo and eclipse the
   numerous alternative framings of the situation. These narratives focus
   on a primary cause of violence, illegal exploitation of mineral
   resources; a main consequence, sexual abuse of women and girls; and a
   central solution, extending state authority. I elucidate why simple
   narratives are necessary for policy makers, journalists, advocacy
   groups, and practitioners on the ground, especially those involved in
   the Congo. I then consider each narrative in turn and explain how they
   achieved prominence: they provided straightforward explanations for the
   violence, suggested feasible solutions to it, and resonated with foreign
   audiences. I demonstrate that the focus on these narratives and on the
   solutions they recommended has led to results that clash with their
   intended purposes, notably an increase in human rights violations.},

Journal = {POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {33},
Number = {2},
Pages = {179-193},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Threat perception is a powerful tool in international and intergroup
   conflict. Realists in international relations argue that the perception
   of threat in intergroup conflict is a function of power asymmetries
   between groups. In contrast, social constructivists in international
   relations suggest that a shared sense of identity or similarity can
   reduce, and in some cases eliminate, perceptions of intergroup threat.
   Consequently, threat perception might be influenced by both the value
   similarities and the power asymmetries between the ingroup and the
   outgroup. In this article, we present an attempt to test empirically how
   individuals evaluate the similarity of cultural and political values
   compared with another nation (outgroup) and assess its implications for
   cooperation among states in the international system. The results of two
   experiments demonstrate that both power and perceived value similarity
   play an important role in threat perception among states and discuss
   implications for future research.},

Abstract = {Recognising the limitations of existing conceptualisations of path
   dependence, this article advances a `path-interdependent' approach to
   account for endogenous policy change by incorporating a more central
   role for agency through learning and problem-solving mechanisms.
   Additionally, it argues that monolithic conceptualisations of
   institutions should be unpacked to reveal their configurative elements.
   In doing so, attention is drawn to the way in which intra-policy
   dynamics may generate pressures for change and to the possibility for
   the mutual existence and co-evolution of continuity and change. These
   arguments are illustrated empirically through two cases of radical
   reform in European Union (EU) cohesion policy.},

Abstract = {This article provides foundations to Polanyi's famed argument that
   monopoly power in the global capital market served as an instrument of
   peace during the Pax Britannica (1815-1914). Our perspective is novel-we
   focus on the role of intermediaries and certification. We show that when
   information and enforcement are imperfect, there is scope for the
   endogenous emergence of ``prestigious{''} intermediaries who enjoy a
   monopoly position and as a result, control government actions. They can
   implement conditional lending: they subject the distribution of credit
   to the adoption of peaceful policies. Prestigious intermediaries act
   that way because of their concern with maintaining an unblemished track
   record when wars increased risks of default. Our analysis, which brings
   together insights from different disciplines, provides a significant
   extension to, and departure from, recent research on how countries
   accumulate reputational capital.},

Title = {Can Complexity Move UK Policy beyond `Evidence-Based Policy Making' and
   the `Audit Culture'? Applying a `Complexity Cascade' to Education and
   Health Policy},

Abstract = {For much of the twentieth century UK public policy has been based on a
   strong centralist, rationalist and managerialist framework. This
   orientation was significantly amplified by New Labour in the 1990s and
   2000s, leading to the development of evidence-based policy making (EBPM)
   and the audit culture a trend that looks set to continue under the
   current government. Substantial criticisms have been raised against the
   targeting/audit strategies of the audit culture and other forms of EBPM,
   particularly in complex policy areas. This article accepts these
   criticisms and argues that in order to move beyond these problems one
   must not only look at the basic foundation of policy strategies, but
   also develop practical alternatives to those strategies. To that end,
   the article examines one of the most basic and common tools of the
   targeting/audit culture, the aggregate linear X-Y graph, and shows that
   when it has been applied to UK education policy, it leads to: (1) an
   extrapolation tendency; (2) a fluctuating crisissuccess policy response
   process; and (3) an intensifying targeting/auditing trend. To move
   beyond these problems, one needs a visual metaphor which combines an
   ability to see the direction of policy travel with an aspect of
   continual openness that undermines the extrapolation tendency,
   crisissuccess policy response and targeting/auditing trend. Using a
   general complexity approach, and building on the work of Geyer and
   Rihani, this article will attempt to show that a complexity cascade tool
   can be used to overcome these weaknesses and avoid their negative
   effects in both education and health policy in the UK.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we investigate how international law shapes leaders
   decisions regarding the use of force in the context of territorial
   disputes. We argue that if the legal principles relevant to the dispute
   are capable of suggesting a focal point, international law will have a
   powerful role to play in informing leader behavior. Specifically, if a
   focal point exists, the state that it favors will avoid using force and
   prefer negotiations when considering an initial challenge to the status
   quo. However, we expect focal points to have the opposite effect once
   states are involved in a militarized dispute. Under these circumstances,
   the state with a legal advantage will be more likely to escalate the
   level of military force. Using a series of statistical tests, we find
   strong support for our theoretical argument.},

Title = {Four dialogues and the funeral of a beautiful relationship: European
   studies and new regionalism},
Journal = {COOPERATION AND CONFLICT},

Abstract = {This article engages in the debate on (the study of) regionalism in
   providing an overview of the nexus between European Studies (ES) and
   (New) Regionalism (NR). While the immediate purpose for doing so is to
   set the stage for the future debate on regional dynamics, this
   exploration can also be perceived as a case study into (the plurality of
   forms of) inter/intra-disciplinary dialogue demonstrating the necessity
   of engaging in `dialogues about dialogues'. The article starts by
   developing a new typology of four different ideal-typical notions of
   dialogue: hierarchical, reflexive, transformative and eristic models of
   dialogue. Each of these models is then used to examine different ways of
   answering questions about why a dialogue between ES/NR should be of
   interest or not; what ES has to offer; what the coveted impact of such a
   dialogue is supposed to be; and, finally, which promises and pitfalls
   such a conversation holds. In this fashion, the stage for future debate
   addressing regional integration is outlined. It is concluded that these
   futures look bleak, however, especially because ES and NR no longer
   appear as each other's ideal partner-in-dialogue and the relationship is
   likely to come to an end and hence await its own funeral.},

Abstract = {Do the shaming activities of HROs (human rights international
   non-governmental organizations) have a direct influence on state
   behavior? We argue, consistent with existing scholarship, that states
   targeted or shamed by these organizations do improve their human rights
   practices. However, mere shaming is not enough. Improvements in human
   rights practices result from the interaction of shaming by HROs with (i)
   a domestic presence of HROs within the targeted state and/or (ii)
   pressure by third-party states, individuals, and organizations. Using a
   new data set of the shaming events of more than 400 HROs toward
   governments, we test these propositions quantitatively and find
   widespread support for the arguments. This research provides the first
   global quantitative evidence of the conditional importance of HRO
   shaming in transnational advocacy efforts.},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Prime ministers have been crucial figures in British politics for nearly
   three centuries and the media now give them more prominence than ever.
   Polling data on prime ministerial popularity suggest that there has been
   an increasing tendency for voters to take a negative view of the
   incumbent prime minister. Moreover, almost every post-war premier has
   left office less popular than when he or she took over. This trend has
   not affected opposition leaders, however. Despite the fact that they
   dominate media coverage of British politics, voters' reactions to prime
   ministers are less good predictors of party preferences than appraisals
   of the general competence of the government. This suggests that while
   valence theorists are right to draw attention to the role of party
   leaders as a means of providing voters with a short cut in
   decision-making, the importance of leader evaluations should not be
   exaggerated.},

Journal = {HUMAN RIGHTS QUARTERLY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {34},
Number = {1},
Pages = {88-112},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This article warns that the human security discourse and agenda could
   inadvertently undermine the international human rights regime. Insofar
   as human security identifies new threats to well-being, new victims of
   those threats, new duties of states, or new mechanisms for dealing with
   threats at the inter-state level, it adds to the established human
   rights regime. When it simply rephrases human rights principles without
   identifying new threats, victims, duty-bearers, or mechanisms, however,
   at best it complements human rights and at worst it undermines them. A
   narrow view of human security is a valuable addition to the
   international normative regime requiring state and international action
   against severe threats to human beings. By contrast, an overly broad
   view of human security ignores the human rights regime; by subsuming
   human rights under human security, it also undermines the primacy of
   civil and political rights as a strategic tool for citizens to fight for
   their rights against their own states.},

Abstract = {The G20's renewal of faith in the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
   during the 2008 financial crisis appears to have reversed the IMF's
   declining relevance evident in the years preceding the crisis. This
   article examines this putative revival of the IMF, arguing that the
   G20's actions contained a paradox of delegation. On the one hand, the
   nature of the G20's replenishment of the IMF's resources during the
   crisis (mostly through credit lines available to the IMF) as well as the
   independence the major G20 economies can afford to have from the IMF
   (given that they are not beholden to its resources) has meant that the
   G20 countries faced low sovereignty costs in reviving the IMF. On the
   other hand, truly re-establishing the IMF's relevance would impose
   higher sovereignty costs, specifically in the form of strengthened IMF
   surveillance over G20 economies. This paradox of delegation suggests
   that the G20's action toward the IMF does not inform properly whether
   the G20 states have contemplated the trade-off between suffering
   sovereignty costs and achieving gains from delegation. In this regard,
   the proper role of the IMF in the governance of the global economy
   remains uncertain.},

Abstract = {Building on the work of the United Nations Intellectual History Project,
   this article argues that the ideology of human development has now
   become the driving normative force behind the global policies supported
   by the UN in the area of development. The first part focuses on the UN's
   official discourse of the past two decades, and shows how it has been
   influenced by the concept of human development. The second section
   examines a set of global policies that illustrate how the UN has sought
   to put the principles of human development into practice. The article
   concludes that while human development ideology has represented for
   twenty years the most credible critique of mainstream development
   policies, its impact - like that of the UN in world affairs - remains
   nonetheless limited.},

Abstract = {Gauteng, South Africa's economic center, has a history of social
   exclusion by virtue of differentiated access to employment, income,
   assets, and education. Levels of civic engagement prior to 1994 were
   limited by the absence of universal political suffrage and a society in
   which the majority of the population was denied the right to participate
   in decision-making based on racial discrimination. The achievement of
   universal suffrage in 1994 created the foundations for greater civic
   engagement. However, as social interaction and societal governance
   becomes increasingly electronically mediated (through the Internet, Web
   2.0 technologies, and mobile content platforms), a large proportion of
   the population is excluded from these new forms of on-Net interaction.
   This chapter argues that policies that push universal household
   broadband service can contribute to reducing social exclusion through
   creating the foundation for households to operate as units of production
   and overcome economic deprivation, thus laying a stronger basis for
   civic engagement.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {19},
Number = {8, SI},
Pages = {1168-1187},
Abstract = {France's model of capitalism experiences a crisis with multiple aspects.
   First, the French model of capitalism has undergone deep reforms since
   the 1980s. Second, the French political life is characterized by a
   political crisis: the vanishing of the space for mediation between the
   divergent expectations of the social groups composing the dominant
   social bloc. These crises are linked. First, because the institutional
   reforms undertaken since the 1980s have changed French capitalism, its
   institutional complementarities, the profile of socio-political groups,
   and have contributed to destabilizing social alliances. Second, because
   the political crisis has pushed policy-makers to turn to institutional
   change as a necessary condition for opening up new spaces of mediation.
   This contribution surveys the main changes experienced by the French
   model over the past 30 years, analyses the break-up of the traditional
   social alliances and presents the elements of the political crisis in
   relation to neoliberal structural reforms.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {35},
Number = {5, SI},
Pages = {663-687},
Abstract = {In Western operations in Afghanistan, small European powers escalate in
   different ways. While Denmark and the Netherlands have contributed to
   Western escalation through integration with British and US forces,
   Norway and Sweden have done so by creating a division of labour allowing
   US and British combat forces to concentrate their efforts in the south.
   These variations in strategic behaviour suggest that the strategic
   choice of small powers is more diversified than usually assumed. We
   argue that strategic culture can explain the variation in strategic
   behaviour of the small allies in Afghanistan. In particular, Dutch and
   Danish internationalism have reconciled the use of force in the national
   and international domains, while in Sweden and Norway there is still a
   sharp distinction between national interest and humanitarianism.},

Abstract = {The article explores the contentious meanings in Northern Ireland not
   only of `democracy' but also of `British'. It examines the influence of
   ideas of majoritarian democracy in Northern Ireland and how the
   legitimacy of that majoritarian narrative was challenged after 1969. The
   difficulties of developing an alternative and shared narrative of
   democratic participation, known as power-sharing, is considered and the
   current outline of the so-called Northern Ireland political `model' of
   democratic politics is described and its operative strengths and
   deficiencies identified.},

Abstract = {Data protection has emerged as a major corporate and government concern
   worldwide. The focus is on secure handling of data so as to ensure
   privacy of customer data and security of corporate data. Privacy and
   security laws in countries are not harmonized; compliance regulations
   are different too. As the global hub of outsourcing, India is faced with
   a challenge of demonstrating compliance with varying compliance
   regulations in countries. The Data Security Council of India (DSCI)
   considers the Best Practices Approach as a practical and realistic way
   to enhance adherence to data security and privacy standards, and to
   enable a service provider to demonstrate compliance. Getting these
   standards recognized through contracts can promote data protection. An
   industry association can act as a third party self-regulatory
   organization to promote these standards and enforce them among its
   members through certification or privacy seals, thereby helping
   implement data protection in international data flows.},

Abstract = {This article introduces a collection of essays on the elections of
   2010-11 in Italy, Greece, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, Cyprus and the
   Turkish Cypriot community. It examines the impact of the European
   sovereign debt crisis on electoral trends in the era of the Greek and
   Portuguese bailouts. After briefly examining the crisis economies, it
   investigates patterns of abstention, incumbent punishment and opposition
   success, including the rise of regional, anti-party, far-right and
   racist parties. The article concludes, following Krastev (Journal of
   Democracy, vol. 13, no. 3, 2002, pp. 39-53), that the crisis is creating
   `democracy without choices' in Southern Europe with potentially
   destabilising consequences throughout the region.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the possible course of the U.S. foreign. and
   security policy (USFP) under the next presidency. In a nutshell, I argue
   that whichever of the two major candidates were to be elected, there
   would be no substantial revision of the current U.S. grand strategy. The
   argument is structured as follows: First, grand strategy as an
   organizing concept for the following inquiries is introduced. Second,
   competing visions of Barack Obama and Mitt Romney are presented. Third,
   the analysis of these visions against the background of the key current
   global and domestic drivers is put forth. Finally, in the conclusion,
   implications for Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) are suggested.},

Journal = {CAMBRIDGE REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS},

Volume = {25},
Number = {2},
Pages = {269-293},
Abstract = {The Doha round of multilateral negotiations has witnessed the relocation
   of Southern powers towards the core of the World Trade Organization
   (WTO) decision-making structure. Brazil and India are the only
   developing countries that have participated consistently in all major
   ministerial phases of the Doha round between 2001 and 2008. Their
   consolidation as trading powers cannot be attributed solely to their
   status as emerging economies. Their projected legitimacy as
   representatives of the global South has operated as a catalyst in
   facilitating their relocation. In various phases of negotiations,
   however, Brazil and India have refrained from playing a proactive role
   in driving negotiations forward. Their defensive stance has raised
   questions about the two countries' prospects for systemic leadership in
   world trade. In explaining this condition, this article will argue that
   Brazilian and Indian trade diplomacy is consistently directed towards
   maintaining broad bases of followership. Brazil and India are disposed
   to exercise assertive leadership only when that accommodates the
   expectations and preferences of their followership in the global South.
   Their preoccupation with constantly reasserting their Third World image
   often renders blocking agreement the preferable strategy to avoid paying
   a high price in terms of legitimacy.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the role of the World Bank as an agent of
   international policy transfer in post-war reconstruction and
   development. A heuristic method which integrates policy transfer network
   theory, participant observation and implementation analysis is developed
   and then used to map the process of policy-oriented learning
   underpinning the emergence and development of the Islamic Republic of
   Afghanistan's National Solidarity Programme (NSP). Drawing on the
   findings of a mid-term evaluation conducted by the authors for the World
   Bank it reveals that initial World Bank funding of the NSP was
   opportunistic; a voluntary form of policy transfer emerged from a
   cohesive policy transfer network which mainly drew lessons from the
   Kecamatan Development Project (KDP) in Indonesia, leading to the
   development of a culturally insensitive model of community-driven
   development; but due to the technocratic expertise of key indigenous
   actors and the technical support of facilitating partners, these
   elements of the programme were successfully mitigated during operational
   delivery. It concludes that `Rational' lesson-drawing which avoids the
   `learning paradox' - learning that leads to inappropriate transfer - can
   be successful. In other words, lesson-drawing can be a progressive
   learning activity, but only if the programme is culturally assimilated
   through comprehensive evaluation and piloting, builds on existing
   organisational strengths and is transferred by high-quality indigenous
   knowledge elites. Local solutions must be found to local problems which
   deliver public value in terms of direct social or economic benefits to
   the citizenry. Indeed, although development outcomes have been less than
   impressive, the NSP has delivered significant gains to the Afghan people
   with regard to institution-building and social solidarity at the
   national and community levels.},

   partisanship and political ideology},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {21},
Number = {5, SI},
Pages = {712-733},
Abstract = {Despite the scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change and its
   implications, there is considerably less certainty or strength of belief
   among the general public in some industrialised countries. One
   explanation for the lack of consensus is the partisan nature of
   political debate about climate change. A survey of Australian
   politicians demonstrates that political party affiliation and ideology
   have a powerful influence on climate change beliefs. Politicians from
   Labor and Green parties (centre-left and progressive parties) exhibited
   beliefs that were more consistent with scientific consensus about
   climate change than non-aligned or conservative leaders. Moreover,
   political ideology (left-right) emerged as the most important predictor
   of politicians' climate change beliefs. These findings highlight the
   role of political partisanship and ideology in undermining consensus
   around climate change and suggest the need to build consensus through
   constructing climate change messages that appeal to closely held values
   and which advance the discussion of solutions along non-partisan lines.},

Title = {How the European Union does not work: national bargaining success in the
   Council of Ministers},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {19},
Number = {9},
Pages = {1294-1315},
Abstract = {We know surprisingly little about whether the content of European Union
   (EU) legislation reflects the preferences of some member states more
   than others. The few studies that have examined national bargaining
   success rates for EU legislation have conceptual and methodological
   weaknesses. To redress these problems I use a salience-weighted measure
   to gauge the relative success of member states in translating their
   national preferences into legislation, and test two plausible, competing
   hypotheses about how the EU works: that no state consistently achieves
   more of what it really wants than any other; and that large member
   states tend to beat small ones. Neither hypothesis receives empirical
   support. Not only do states differ far more significantly in their
   respective levels of bargaining success than previously recognized, but
   some of the smaller states are the ones that do especially well. The
   article's main contribution - demonstrating that the EU does not work as
   most people think it does - sets the stage for new research questions,
   both positive and normative. In the last section I make a tentative
   start to answering two of the most important: which factors explain the

Abstract = {The stable and closed nature of the Czech party system and the failure
   of most new political parties have been among the most salient features
   of Czech democracy over the past two decades. The results of the 2010
   parliamentary elections seemed to mark a break with this pattern:
   support for two main parties slumped to historically low levels and two
   new parties, TOP09 and Public Affairs (VV), entered parliament. This
   article seeks to put the `political earthquake' of 2010 into perspective
   by mapping the development of new parties in the Czech Republic from the
   mid-1990s and relating them to comparative literature and typologies of
   new party emergence. It concludes that of the two successful new parties
   in 2010, Public Affairs was, by far, the more novel and important
   phenomenon.},

Abstract = {The article evaluates whether democratization has increased Congress's
   oversight of bureaucrats in Mexico. To this end it analyzes the
   investigation commissions created by the Chamber of Deputies between
   1997 and 2006. Since the PRI lost its absolute majority in the lower
   chamber the political conditions and climate have been in place to allow
   legislators to exercise greater control over public policies. However,
   Congress's effectiveness at really holding the government to account is
   still limited. The results show that the number of investigation
   commissions have multiplied since 1997, but their effectiveness at
   highlighting misdemeanors by bureaucrats remains poor. A ``most likely
   case{''} is studied to illustrate the factors that hinder the
   accomplishment of effective supervision.},

Title = {EU-driven judicial reforms in Romania: a success story?},
Journal = {EAST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {28},
Number = {1},
Pages = {23-42},
Abstract = {This article examines the impact of the European Union (EU) and domestic
   actors on the development of judicial quality (rule of law) across two
   key dimensions: judicial capacity and judicial impartiality. It argues
   and shows empirically that although the EU has been crucial in eliciting
   change in the judicial capacity dimension, it was largely unsuccessful
   in changing aspects of the judicial impartiality dimension. The author
   concludes that the EU's involvement in Romania through accession
   conditionality has been of limited success: that is, the EU had a
   considerable impact on improving de jure judicial quality, but it was
   unable to affect rule implementation and thus failed to create de facto
   judicial quality. Methodologically, this article makes use of a detailed
   case-study method with proces-stracing. Data are drawn from a number of
   primary and secondary sources such as official governmental documents,
   reports, surveys and scholarly literature relevant to the topic.},

Title = {A THEORY OF CULTURE-SWITCHING: LEADERSHIP AND RED-TAPE DURING HURRICANE
   KATRINA},
Journal = {PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {90},
Number = {4},
Pages = {851-868},
Abstract = {This article draws upon studies of organizational culture and
   sense-making to develop a theory of culture-switching. Culture-switching
   occurs when organizational actors shift emphasis from one existing
   organizational cultural assumption to another to reshape organizational
   action. The concept is demonstrated in a case study of the Hurricane
   Katrina response by the US Department of Defense (DOD). A slow initial
   DOD response arose because of self-imposed red-tape designed to limit
   engagement in crisis response, reflecting a cultural assumption of the
   need to maintain autonomy. DOD leaders altered the nature of the
   response by committing to another widely-shared cultural assumption: a
   `can-do' approach to achieving difficult goals regardless of obstacles.
   The case illustrates how different organizational cultural assumptions
   interact with red tape to foster either inertia or a proactive response.},
