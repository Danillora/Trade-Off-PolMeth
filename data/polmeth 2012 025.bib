Abstract = {Al-Shabaab, an Islamist non-state armed actor, is gaining legitimacy by
   adopting a variety of strategies under conditions of state collapse in
   Somalia. This article examines some of the strategies it is implementing
   to solicit community support and hence gain legitimacy. Using the
   political process approach as an analytical framework, the article
   argues that state collapse in Somalia has created political
   opportunities for Al-Shabaab to adopt the deployment of Somali
   nationalism and xenophobia, the use of propaganda, social
   transformation, and the provision of social services as strategies to
   acquire legitimacy. The findings demonstrate that there is a
   relationship between the local-level governance void created by state
   collapse and Al-Shabaab's use of Islamism as a political ideology to
   execute these strategies to legitimise itself. By doing so, it has in
   the process delegitimised the country's Transitional Federal Government,
   portraying itself as providing alternative local-level governance in
   Somalia. Al-Shabaab's legitimacy in Somalia is, therefore, largely a
   function of state collapse and Islamism.},

Pages = {121-132},
Abstract = {A Conservative accepts that democracy entails government by and
   (especially) for the people, but what constitutes the people is seen not
   in narrow but in expansive terms: the people are not confined to those
   who constitute a present transient majority but encompass rather past
   and future generations. Democracy is tempered by the need to avoid
   dictatorship of the masses, entrusting the task of governing to those
   chosen by the people and able to lead in interests of the people.
   Government entails a balance between accountability and autonomy, a
   balance delivered by the Westminster system of government, a system
   challenged by attempts at fundamental constitutional change.},

Journal = {CRITICAL POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {6},
Number = {3},
Pages = {337-348},
Abstract = {Backcasting, in contrast to forecasting, is a technique of policy
   analysis that was developed with respect to energy policy in the 1970s
   and that, since then, has been expanded in the scope of its application.
   This expansion has especially been to areas - such as sustainability and
   environmental issues - where future trends are themselves deemed to be
   part of the problem. In the past decade, a more participatory, `second
   generation' approach to backcasting has also emerged. This essay reviews
   these developments, particularly examines the application of backcasting
   to water policy, and indicates a potential for backcasting to be
   developed more generally as a policy tool. A central point is that
   backcasting, by making explicit the role of values, is especially
   relevant to the development of critical policy studies.},

Abstract = {This work evaluates the receptivity of the Spanish electorate to policy
   positions that are distant from the status quo. To that end, two spatial
   voting models are considered: the proximity and the directional model.
   The analysis also evaluates the econometric consequences of employing
   subsidiary measures of the status quo in policy spaces. The result
   suggests that the majority of the Spanish electorate adjusts to a hybrid
   model of spatial voting, where proximity dominates. Only the supporters
   of the main opposition party are receptive to non-moderate policy
   declarations. Altogether, this work helps unravel the microfoundations
   of party competition in Spain.},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In this article, I argue that after having experienced a distinctly cool
   relationship throughout most of the post-war period and for the 10 years
   following the end of the Cold War, India and North Atlantic Organization
   (NATO) are now gradually moving towards each other. Indeed, during the
   past decade, NATO's `out-of-area' operations have taken it eastwards
   from the Mediterranean, while India's `extended neighbourhood' framework
   has brought it westwards from the Indian subcontinent. This has created
   a geopolitical overlap between these two actors, most notably in
   Afghanistan but also elsewhere in the Indian Ocean. Common advocacy of
   liberal democracy and overt concerns over jihadist destabilization have
   brought these two actors together. In NATO's post-Cold War search for
   relevance and India's post-Soviet search for partners, they have found
   each other. Unstated potential concerns over China are also a feature in
   this strategic convergence. However, while NATO has adopted a flexible
   range of `Partnership' frameworks, India's sensitivity on retaining
   `strategic autonomy' will limit their cooperation to informal ad hoc
   arrangements. International Politics (2012) 49, 98-116. doi:

Abstract = {In what ways does religion matter as justification for violence? Based
   on a larger study of the Pakistani Taliban and their communication and
   recruitment materials, this article presents some of its main findings
   in a condensed form. It summarizes the lessons learned about the various
   roles religion plays in providing justification for taking up arms,
   namely: as an object to be defended; as a threat; as the purpose of
   armed struggle; as a (blurred) limit on war; and, finally, as imagery
   and myth. Although this article specifically looks at the case of the
   Pakistani Taliban and their religious justifications of violence, the
   findings might also find resonance in other cases of violent religious
   movements. The final sections of the article briefly discuss the
   potential implications of the findings for an overall understanding of
   the `nature' of religious violence.},

   gender equality policies at EU level and the fight against corruption at

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {33-50},
Abstract = {Scholars have identified a number of societal features that contribute
   to the support of human rights. Controlling for the most prominent of
   these factors, we examine the degree to which judicial independence (JI)
   exerts an autonomous positive effect on human rights. We use a
   cross-sectional design, drawing on data for the 27 European Union
   members and its four prospective members, in conjunction with ordinary
   least squares (OLS) regression. We find that multiple indices of JI
   based on expert judgment, which include institutional but predominantly
   behavioral measures, reveal JI producing the most powerful positive
   effect in the support of human rights among the variables included in
   the analysis. Multiple measures of JI based on public surveys of the
   trustworthiness of a society's judicial institutions exert a positive,
   but not statistically significant, effect on support of human rights.
   Indeed, these latter effects are eclipsed by the relative equality of a
   society's national executive and legislature and its GDP/capita.
   Surprisingly, judicial review exerts no statistically significant effect
   on human rights protection, counter to the conventional wisdom that has
   driven so many constitutional designers in the post-World War II era.
   Our findings suggest that, while an independent judiciary holds the
   greatest potential for protecting human rights, constitutional drafters
   should focus less on institutional elements related to judicial
   independence and judicial review. Rather, those crafting constitutions
   intended to protect human rights should look to dispersing government
   power by enhancing electoral competitiveness and fostering judicial
   independence.},

Abstract = {The political theory of ideologies proposes a distinct way of conceiving
   of and analysing political thought, especially as it appears in the
   wild. Exploring the claim that there is a form or mode of thinking
   specific and proper to politics, and that it is the concern of the
   political theory of ideology, the article examines two of the leading
   contemporary approaches in this field: the morphological analysis of
   Michael Freeden and the discourse analysis associated with Ernesto
   Laclau. In showing how each produces a distinct object for theoretical
   analysis (respectively, the concept and the signifier) the case is made
   for constituting a third object - the political argument - the
   apprehension of which requires the integration of aspects of the
   rhetorical tradition into the political theory of ideologies. The
   conclusion briefly outlines some of the possible implications, for
   political theory and analysis more generally, of the rhetorical
   conception of political thought and ideology.},

Abstract = {The agricultural policy agenda has been broadened with farm policy
   issues now interlinking with other policy domains (food safety, energy
   supplies, environmental protection, development aid, etc.). New actors
   promoting values which sometimes conflict, or which are not always
   easily reconcilable, with those previously guiding agricultural policy
   have entered the broader agricultural and food policy domain. The
   studies of various new policy issues inter-linking with the agricultural
   policy domain included in this special issue show that value conflicts
   are addressed in different ways and thus result in inter-institutional
   coordination and conflict unfolding differently. Studies of
   inter-institutional policy making in the agricultural policy sector have
   the potential to contribute to theoretical developments in public policy
   analysis in much the same way as agricultural policy studies did in the
   past. (C) 2012 Policy and Society Associates (APSS). Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {An examination of gender mainstreaming in the Latin American development
   policy of the European Union through quantitative and qualitative
   analysis of policy programming documents suggests that the
   transformative potential of this approach has been neglected. The
   language used in the documents is more the typical ``Women in
   Development{''} language than one that reflects the inclusion of both
   women and men in the planning for the achievement of gender equality.
   Exclusion of women's organizations from the drafting process and the gap
   between civil society's and the European Union's framings of gender
   (in)equality in Latin America may be responsible for this situation.},

Volume = {31},

Abstract = {The scale of the ambition to decouple emissions growth from energy
   consumption runs counter to decades of debates and literatures on the
   limits of government. Transport biofuels are an early and influential
   case of the policy capacity challenge in the transition to low-carbon
   economies. The case stands analytically for the policy-maker's dilemma
   of maintaining long-term policy goals as credible commitments, despite
   the flexibility and adaptability in policy-making required to achieve
   them under high political, technological and market uncertainty. This
   paper compares US and EU biofuels policy processes in these terms. It
   reveals an intertemporal choice embedded in biofuels policies which
   tests the capacity to account for future benefits from a low carbon
   future in current policy processes; if the pathway to their achievement
   is uncertain and politically contested in the implementation phase, then
   future benefits may be heavily discounted, shortening policy-maker
   horizons and rendering the transition process politically vulnerable.

Abstract = {Economic development is a process of continuous industrial and
   technological upgrading in which any country, regardless of its level of
   development, can succeed if it develops industries that are consistent
   with its comparative advantage, determined by its endowment structure.
   The successful strategy for developing countries is to exploit the
   latecomer advantage by building up industries that are growing
   dynamically in more advanced, fast growing countries that have endowment
   structures similar to theirs. By following carefully selected lead
   countries, latecomers can emulate the leader follower, flying geese
   pattern that has served well in effectively catching up economies since
   the 18th century. The emergence of large middle income countries such as
   China, India, and Brazil as new growth poles in the world, and their
   dynamic growth and climbing of the industrial ladder, offer an
   unprecedented opportunity to all developing economies with income levels
   currently below theirs-including those in Sub-Saharan Africa. Having
   itself been a `follower goose', China is on the verge of graduating from
   low skilled manufacturing jobs and becoming a `leading dragon'. That
   will free up nearly 100 million labor intensive manufacturing jobs,
   enough to more than quadruple manufacturing employment in low income
   countries. A similar trend is emerging in other middle income growth
   poles. The lower income countries that can formulate and implement a
   viable strategy to capture this new industrialization opportunity will
   set forth on a dynamic path of structural change that can lead to
   poverty reduction and prosperity.},

Abstract = {Research on public service networks has identified a variety of
   mechanisms to foster coordination, including trust and reciprocity
   norms. This article argues that network actors are also driven by a
   desire to avoid blame. Network membership is often a political
   responsibility rather than a voluntary act, and members may be at least
   as attuned to their extra-network organizational reputation as to their
   intra-network reputation, creating an incentive to utilize blame
   avoidance strategies when failure occurs. Blame avoidance strategies
   undermine intra-network trust and coordination, representing a
   significant threat to the implementation of public policy. To illustrate
   the potential of the concept for network theory, blame avoidance
   strategies are identified under the conditions of high political risk
   and task salience, as represented by the crisis response network in the
   U. S. disaster of Hurricane Katrina.},

Abstract = {What impact does the way a civil war is terminated have on the
   post-conflict democratization process? This study analyses whether
   certain types of conflict termination are positive for post-conflict
   levels of democracy. It is argued that negotiated settlements, being at
   large more cooperative, are more conducive for democratization than
   truces or military victories. Stabilizing measures rarely leave
   possibilities for contestation of elites and thus few incentives to open
   up post-war society. The empirics reveal that negotiated settlements are
   the best way to end a conflict if democracy is to develop in its
   aftermath.},

Title = {Social Issues, Authoritarianism, and Ideological Conceptualization: How
   Policy Dimensions and Psychological Factors Influence Ideological
   Labeling},
Journal = {POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {33},
Number = {4},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Ideology's crucial theoretical and empirical role in explaining
   political behavior makes it imperative that scholars understand how
   individuals conceptualize and apply ideological labels. The existing
   literature on this topic is quite limited, however, because it relies
   almost exclusively upon data from the 1970s and 1980s, and it does not
   examine how psychological factors influence conceptualizations of
   ideological labels. This article uses data from two original laboratory
   experiments to test the relative impact of four major policy dimensions
   on participants' evaluations of candidate ideology and to test
   authoritarianism's role in shaping ideological conceptualization. These
   analyses indicate that individuals most often define liberalism and
   conservatism primarily in terms of social policies closely associated
   with religious values, each of which invert traditional ideological
   orientations toward the appropriate size and role of government. The
   causal mechanism shaping this relationship is authoritarianism, because,
   I argue, the religious social policy dimension most clearly evokes the
   deep-seated value conflicts associated with an authoritarian view of
   political conflict.},

Abstract = {This article explores Uganda's decision to send peacekeeping troops to
   Somalia in 2007 as part of the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM)
   and argues that the intervention has as much to do with Uganda's
   relationship with its donors as it has with maintaining regional
   stability - the official justification for intervention. Museveni's
   decision to intervene in Somalia is the most recent example of his
   regime's multi-pronged `image management' strategy in which the
   President has involved Uganda in numerous foreign and domestic
   activities to ensure that donors perceive his government in a particular
   way vis-a-vis their interests: as an economic success story, a guarantor
   of regional stability, or, in relation to Somalia, an ally in the global
   war on terror. In so doing Museveni's strategy, conceptualized here
   within a constructivist framework, has been able largely to avoid
   censure in areas of traditional donor concern such as governance,
   thereby achieving a considerable degree of agency in a seemingly
   asymmetric relationship.},

Abstract = {Why do some countries have constitutional environmental rights while
   others do not? In this paper, I conduct statistical analyses to respond
   to this inquiry. Through studying the impact of intraregional
   constitutional design, I aim to understand why states adopt
   environmental rights. I argue that regional isomorphismi.e., the
   tendency among states within a region to converge on certain policiesmay
   explain the trend toward constitutionalization of environmental rights.
   In this paper I (1) define and provide historical background on
   environmental rights, (2) describe theories which support regional
   isomorphism as a means of explaining the adoption of constitutional
   environmental rights, and (3) conduct statistical tests to determine the
   validity of the regional isomorphism thesis. I find that the enactment
   of constitutional environmental rights within a region does not increase
   the likelihood that another state within the same region will include
   environmental rights within its constitution.},

Abstract = {This article undertakes a micro-level analysis of public opinion towards
   military action in Libya. It examines the effect of sociological factors
   and political attitudes. It finds evidence of a gender gap in support
   for military action. The effects of partisanship are mediated by
   attention to politics. Politically attentive Conservative and Liberal
   Democrat partisans are more supportive of military action. Public
   opinion is also affected by ideological beliefs, economic perceptions
   and pre-existing foreign policy attitudes. The findings contribute to
   research on public opinion and military intervention and to scholarly
   understanding of foreign policy attitudes in Britain.},

Title = {Rehabilitation-Between management and knowledge practices: An historical
   overview of public action in Norwegian welfare reforms},
Journal = {POLICY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {31},
Number = {2},
Pages = {119-129},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This article explores current Norwegian welfare reforms using the
   example of rehabilitation policy. One distinctive trend is the
   development of rehabilitation as part of a management system across
   administrative levels, sectors, as well as at the interface between
   public and private service provision. Another is the emergence of
   rehabilitation as a knowledge practice based on diverse disciplines, in
   addition to the experiences of both service providers and recipients. My
   research question is: in what ways do policy reforms redefine
   rehabilitation as a knowledge practice by using management tools? In
   terms of design, I briefly describe the history of rehabilitation
   services before addressing how today's welfare reforms redefine the
   field. I use document analysis and conduct a critical examination of
   selected political documents. The article concludes that in current
   rehabilitation practices, professionals, managers and clients are more
   interwoven than in the past. (C) 2012 Policy and Society Associates

Abstract = {Past studies on military expenditures in the United States have
   primarily focused on the extent to which guns versus butter trade-offs
   are prevalent without examining this relationship in the context of how
   other fiscal policy tools are used to pay for defense. Using annual data
   from 1947-2007, this study examines the relative importance of defense
   financing policy measures, such as guns versus butter trade-offs, tax
   increases, and deficit spending in paying for defense. The results show
   evidence of guns versus butter trade-off during the Reagan Era, but not
   during other periods. Both federal tax policy and deficit spending have
   played influential roles in funding defense spending during peacetime.
   This modeling strategy points to the importance of analyzing the effects
   of multiple fiscal policy tools when studying the forces that drive
   military spending in the United States since World War II.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the social potential of regional integration
   processes by using the example of European integration. Recent case law
   from the European Court of Justice has led some observers to argue that
   judicial decisions increasingly provide European politics with a
   ``Polanyian{''} drive. We test this claim by distinguishing three
   dimensions to European economic and social integration:
   market-restricting integration, market-enforcing integration, and the
   creation of a European area of nondiscrimination. We also identify two
   forms of integration that have different speeds, scopes, and potentials:
   political integration and judicial integration. The evidence shows that
   the EU has come closer to Hayek's vision of ``inter-state federalism{''}
   than is usually warranted because market-enforcing integration and
   European nondiscrimination policies have asymmetrically profited from
   ``integration through law.{''} The opportunities for international
   courts to push ahead market-enforcing integration increase as the
   participants of regional integration processes become more diverse. In
   such ``Hayekian{''} constellations, individual rights are increasingly
   relocated to the central level, at the cost of subordinating the
   decentralized capacity for solidarity and interpersonal redistribution.},

   the President of the European Council, the High Representative for

   the legal personnality of the EU. The second part of the text tries to
   identify potential strategies for Europe within the current political

Journal = {POLITICAL STUDIES},

Volume = {60},
Number = {2},
Pages = {434-454},

Abstract = {Although China is an outlier in terms of generalized trust, it has
   attracted little scholarly attention so far. Employing survey data from
   Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, this article seeks to address this
   gap. The article makes use of the comparative leverage provided by
   political and socio-cultural variation to investigate two plausible
   reasons for the high levels of measured trust in Mainland China: a
   spillover from high institutional confidence; and problems of
   measurement validity. The study finds a comparatively strong link
   between institutional confidence and trust in Mainland China, which
   suggests that high confidence in institutions contributes to high levels
   of generalized trust in this context. By situating the Chinese case in
   the debate on the institutional foundation of generalized trust, the
   article suggests a heuristic to interpret this finding and points out
   its theoretical implications. The findings on measurement validity are
   mixed. While the results do not suggest that political fear causes a
   significant distortion in measured trust levels, the study finds
   circumstantial evidence for a culturally induced response bias to the
   standard item in Mainland China. This would have crucial implications
   for comparative research on generalized trust beyond the Chinese
   context.},

Abstract = {In the early 21st century globalisation has radically transformed the
   whole world. In the rapidly globalising world the main issue for the EU
   is globalisation-cum-regionalisation, namely to increase policy
   cooperation with its own neighbourhood to strengthen its global position
   and to avoid systemic failure in its partner countries by offering them
   a win-win game through regional organisations. Globalisation has
   unleashed the process of regionalisation at various levels, so
   restructuring the political space around the globe. New territorial
   units have been organised in order to be able to withstand the pressure
   of globalisation, and to be more effective in the global competition
   that has also generated the need for global governance. The basic
   principle in the recent regionalisation efforts by the EU is
   `integrative balancing', empowering unequal external partners through
   meaningful cooperation. In this spirit the EU has recently transformed
   its global policy in both aspects of globalisation-cum-regionalisation.
   It has accelerated common institution building with neighbouring states.
   The EU has also established an active cooperation framework with the
   newly emerging global powers as `strategic partners'. Altogether, the
   European Council concluded in October 2010 that `wider governance reform
   should be delivered' in the EU's global policy.},

Abstract = {Like almost no other sector, energy reflects changing paradigms.
   Following a statist approach in which energy services were subject to
   public provision and administered by state companies, the free market
   paradigm took over in the 1980s and 1990s, making energy subject to
   private provision instead. More recently, the world has witnessed a new
   era of interventionism. Assessing these different phases, this article
   advances three arguments. First, paradigms matter in energy as they
   provide for crucial policy prescriptions. Second, agendas have become
   more complex, adding sustainability and energy poverty to traditional
   supply security. Third, paradigms are inextricably linked to
   rule-setting power, putting the non-OECD world in charge of defining the
   next paradigm. With regards to the latter, it is argued that it will
   likely be one characterised by fragmentation, with elements of state and
   market coexisting.},

Abstract = {The African Union has become increasingly hostile towards the
   International Criminal Court, particularly in the wake of the ICC arrest
   warrant for Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, although the public
   hostility masks deeper divisions among African countries. Indeed,
   evidence of arguments among African states and between Africa and
   Western countries over the proper functioning and scope of the ICC is
   indicative of a number of paradoxes and conflicts which have emerged as
   Africa reorients its identities and interests to embrace international
   human rights norms while also asserting itself on the global stage.},

Title = {Contracting or Public Delivery? The Importance of Service, Market, and
   Management Characteristics},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION RESEARCH AND THEORY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {22},
Number = {2},
Pages = {289-317},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Analysis of local government contracting decisions typically focuses on
   transactions costs related to service characteristics, especially asset
   specificity and difficulty of contract management. This analysis expands
   the focus to include market characteristics (competition), citizen
   characteristics (public interest in the service delivery process), and
   place characteristics (metro status and public management) and finds
   these are the more important factors. A 2007 survey of US city managers'
   rankings of 67 services by transactions costs, competition, and citizen
   interest is combined with a 2007 national survey of city managers'
   sourcing decisions (direct public, intergovernment cooperation,
   for-profit and nonprofit contracting). Multinomial logit models of
   service delivery sourcing choice find that metro status and competition
   are key explanatory variables. Intergovernmental cooperation represents
   an important public market alternative when contract management is
   difficult and competition is low. For profit contracting is less common
   when citizen interest is high and competition is low. Governments with
   professional managers appear more effective in addressing these broader
   transactions costs of citizen interests, political and labor opposition,
   and market management.},

Abstract = {The dominance of liberalism in world politics today is widely
   interpreted as attesting to its universal validity. This claim provides
   the basis for a distinction between legitimate and illegitimate
   criticism - the former operating within a broadly liberal framework and
   the latter questioning the universal validity of that framework. This
   special issue brings together critiques of liberalism in the second
   register. The introduction sets out the two competing notions of
   critical analysis and argues that, far from being `illegitimate', it is
   this second concept of critique that ensures that liberalism does not
   betray its core promise of replacing might with right in a time of
   liberal world order. Journal of International Relations and Development

Abstract = {The social policy literature normally perceives left-wing governments
   and labour unions as pursuing the same policies, namely generous social
   protection. This paper investigates whether or not this is accurate. Due
   to their different criteria of organizational success, it argues that
   unions and left-wing governments prioritize social programmes
   differently. Unions give priority to labour market-related programmes
   like unemployment protection; left-wing governments prioritize family
   services and old-age pensions. The paper thereby adds considerable
   nuance to the literature on labour movements and the welfare state.},

Abstract = {The theme of nihilism offers fertile avenues for exploring the
   antinomies of classical liberalism. In its instantiation as violence,
   nihilism challenges classical liberalism and its recognised political
   settlement, notably received arrangements harnessed to cultivate
   uncontrolled passions or religious fervour. In its affinity to Islam,
   nihilism defies the secular settlement through its appeals to
   transcendence. By seeking legitimacy in the sacred, nihilism disrupts
   established boundaries between the religious and the secular. Nihilism
   exposes the difficulty of forging worlds of transcendence on the modern
   register of immanence. Transcendence affords the possibility of escape,
   immanence closure. The two can be reversed in politics, as the
   experience in several Islamic Cultural Zones (ICZs) suggests. Appeals to
   transcendence seek to reorganise the social world in the name of
   escaping it. Immanence, on the other hand, can rework notions of
   redemption and salvation into secular stories of progress. This paper
   explores how the presumed nihilistic tendency appearing in the ICZs
   destabilises the liberal settlement, not in the conventional sense of
   presenting a religious counterpoint, but in reworking religious themes
   into secularity. Nihilism illustrates both the contra-dictory character
   of modernity and modernity's potential to generate varied societal
   projects, including those informed by the sacred. The recognition that
   modernity can spawn discordant impulses in reconciling religion and
   politics helps rethink post-secular lives under the long shadow of
   disenchantment. Journal of International Relations and Development

Title = {Structural determinants of human rights prosecutions after democratic

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {49},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {Over the last three decades, a growing number of countries have
   experienced a transition from authoritarianism to democracy, and the new
   governments have been increasingly expected to address past human rights
   violations. While the academic literature on the impact of human rights
   prosecution is relatively well developed, the literature on the causes
   of such prosecution is still sparse. Why do states pursue criminal
   prosecutions against former state officials on the charge of human
   rights violations? This article answers this question by testing three
   key theories: the balance of power between old and new elites,
   transnational advocacy networks, and the diffusion theory. I conduct a
   cross-national study of 71 countries that were in a state of democratic
   transitions between 1980 and 2006, using a new dataset on domestic human
   rights prosecutions. I find strong evidence to support the transnational
   advocacy networks and diffusion explanations. First, active domestic and
   international human rights advocacy for individual criminal
   accountability is a key factor guaranteeing persistent and frequent
   human rights prosecutions. My study further shows that domestic advocacy
   plays a crucial role in criminal prosecutions of high-profile state
   officials while international pressure is more effective in promoting
   prosecutions of low-profile officials. Second, the diffusion theory is
   also supported since the occurrence of human rights prosecution in
   neighboring countries is a relevant factor. Interestingly, transitional
   countries are most sensitive to trials occurring in culturally or
   linguistically similar countries and this supports the constructivist
   norm diffusion theory, which focuses on the role of identity and
   communication in the diffusion process. However, I find that the power
   balance explanation, which has been the prevailing explanation, is valid
   only for the immediate use of human rights prosecutions.},

Abstract = {This article attempts to lay out a conceptual framework for evaluating
   the actual military value of China's newly developed weaponry. Its basic
   assumption is that technological military progress is not sufficient to
   increase military strength. Therefore an alternative approach is adopted
   that studies the adaptability of the new technologies to the country's
   strategic situation. To this end, the study assumes that the value of a
   weapon system is measured by its suitability to the country's military,
   economic and technological conditions. The country's ability to meet
   these requirements depends to a large extent on the procurement process.
   Exploring China's recent military procurement approach, the study finds
   that under the prevailing conditions, China's military procurement
   process could reduce the actual military value of the newly developed
   weaponry.},

Abstract = {The earthquake that struck Haiti in January 2010 tipped the country into
   a state of socioeconomic despair from which it will be difficult to
   escape without a fresh start, made not only by its own political and
   economic elites, but also by the international community. Making a fresh
   start will require an honest assessment of Haiti's predicament and a
   bold vision of its future prospects. By this, lessons can usefully be
   drawn from the experiences of countries emerging from a period of
   conflict. From this perspective, Haiti needs to move beyond the
   neoliberal consensus which has dominated policy since the overthrow of
   the Duvalier regime and adopt a more integrated policy approach to
   creating jobs, boosting economic security, diversifying economic
   activity and repairing a dangerously frayed social contract. Such an
   approach critically depends on establishing a developmental state with
   an inclusive national agenda that can move Haiti out of an initial and
   unavoidable state of aid dependence to effective mobilization of
   domestic resources. For the international community, the Marshall Plan
   offers useful lessons in forging a more effective development
   partnership to support such a state-building exercise and the efforts at
   recovery and rebuilding.},

Journal = {BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICS \& INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Pages = {131-152},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This article explores practices of memorialisation in post-conflict
   society, through the case study of the James McCurrie Robert Neill
   Memorial Garden, located in East Belfast, which has been vandalised on a
   number of occasions. It notes the similarities between these attacks and
   Jenny Edkins' theorisation of resistance at the sites of state memory.
   In the context of Northern Ireland, however, such resistance serves only
   to replicate patterns of division, as they seek to re-assert competing
   historical claims obscured by the memorial. The article therefore turns
   to the work of Jacques Derrida in order to employ a deconstructive
   double reading of the memorial, which avoids the trap of treating the
   past as something that can be instrumentally utilised in the present.
   This deconstructive reading is undertaken in order to suggest a form of
   resistance to memorialisation which does more than replicate patterns of
   division through essentialised versions of history.},

Title = {Polish-Ukrainian Relations during World War II The Boryslav Case Study:
   A Polish Perspective},
Journal = {EAST EUROPEAN POLITICS AND SOCIETIES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {26},
Number = {1},
Pages = {213-235},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {After the fall of communism in 1989-1991, Poland and Ukraine could have
   become partners in international, economic, and cultural fields. Yet
   despite many positive achievements, the contemporary Polish-Ukrainian
   cooperation did not fully develop. Among many reasons that slow down the
   Polish-Ukrainian rapprochement, historical memories seem to be
   especially detrimental. The remembrances of World War II are the most
   destructive. Both Poles and Ukrainians understand that the only way to
   change this situation is to study and discuss the common history. A list
   of works on Polish-Ukrainian relations during World War II is long. Yet
   most of these publications offer broad pictures and present
   Polish-Ukrainian relations in general or in particular regions, such as
   Volhynia (Wolyn) or Eastern Galicia. This microstudy, devoted to the
   town of Boryslav (Boryslaw) in the years 1939 to 1945, tries to show how
   the conflicts were born, how they became embedded in human memory, and,
   finally, how they were transformed into historical stereotypes. The text
   concentrates on the crucial moments of World War II in Boryslav and
   describes how Poles and Ukrainians reacted differently to the
   consecutive challenges and how these various reactions shaped their
   relationship. The article ends with a conclusion that the five years of
   the war tore apart the Poles and Ukrainians of Boryslav and the
   post-1945 iron Polish-Soviet border divided the both sides and created a
   situation in which World War II attitudes froze for a long time.},

Abstract = {Although trust aspects have been investigated in e-commerce context, the
   e-government field is still significantly lacking from empirical studies
   that explore trust in e-government from the citizen's perspective. The
   lack of trust in e-government in developing countries is another
   persuasive impetus for conducting this study. The few recent studies
   investigating citizens' trust in e-government are conducted in developed
   countries. This study employed a qualitative approach (focus groups) to
   gain in depth understanding of the citizen's perception of e-government
   adoption. E-government initiative in Saudi Arabia is the main focus of
   this research. Based on the literature review, the key antecedent
   factors that affect citizen trust in e-government are identified, and a
   research model is build. Based on the results of the analysis of three
   focus groups, managerial recommendations are provided.},

Title = {GOVERNANCE WITHOUT GOVERNMENT? THE CASE OF THE FOREST STEWARDSHIP
   COUNCIL},
Journal = {PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {90},
Number = {1},
Pages = {144-159},
Abstract = {The relationship between state and non-state actors has been the subject
   of extensive debate within the governance literature. During this time
   two influential but very different accounts of governance have emerged:
   a society-centred account which talks of governance without government
   and a state-centric perspective which maintains that governance largely
   occurs by and through governments. There are of course alternative and
   more nuanced positions on offer. These two have nevertheless served to
   frame the debate around governance by engendering a zero-sum
   understanding of the relationship between state and non-state actors
   which obscures the way in which the presence of non-state actors can
   enhance the policy capacities of state actors and vice versa. The Forest
   Stewardship Council (FSC) has been lauded as an exemplar of governance
   without government and has indeed, on occasions, had to overcome the
   indifference or even outright hostility of governments. But the
   society-centred account does not do justice to the range of very
   different and sometimes mutually beneficial relationships between the
   FSC and state actors.},

Title = {A Long Way to Tipperary: Time in the Italian Legislative Process
   1987-2008},
Journal = {SOUTH EUROPEAN SOCIETY AND POLITICS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Pages = {23-44},
Abstract = {The Italian legislature does not enjoy widespread trust. At least one of
   the reasons has to be the perception of its inefficiency. Comparatively,
   the Italian law-making process is slow and most policy-makers complain
   about the difficulties experienced in trying to speed up the process. In
   spite of the political relevance of the topic, the issue has not
   attracted much scientific attention. This study tries to cover that
   void, focusing explicitly on the temporal dimension of law-making and
   analysing the duration of more than 3,000 laws approved during the
   period of 1987-2008: 21 years of intense Italian political history. Our
   exploratory analysis finds that successful proposals spend most of their
   time in those stages preceding the discussion in parliament, waiting to
   find room on the agenda. Concentrating on ordinary laws, we realise that
   the factors that expedite a legislative process are its sponsorship, the
   procedure adopted, the policy sector, and the timing of introduction,
   whereas the level of consensus is not associated with the duration of
   the process.},

Abstract = {U. S. democracy promotion programs in Bolivia in the early 2000s
   originally sought to stabilize the neoliberal state through ``soft{''}
   tactics whose origins were rooted in the ``inclusive{''} neoliberal
   project of Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada's first presidency. As left
   indigenous social forces tipped the balance of power away from U. S.
   political allies, these programs were reconfigured to undermine the rise
   of Evo Morales's Movement toward Socialism (MAS) through ``hard{''}
   tactics including support for the right-wing departments of the western
   part of the country, where autonomist forces mobilized to destabilize
   the MAS after Morales won the presidential elections in December 2005.
   U. S. programs also continued to channel support to moderate civil
   society organizations and nongovernmental organizations that sought to
   confine the popular revolt within a liberal-institutional framework.
   Soft and hard tactics combined to promote neoliberal polyarchy.},

Abstract = {This article proposes a systematic scoping review of the structural
   ``root{''} causes of non-suicide terrorism. It aims to synthesize the
   knowledge produced on this very specific issue from 2000 and 2009 and to
   raise questions about unanswered issues and those that deserve more
   in-depth investigation. After presenting our methodology, we offer an
   overview of this subfield of research. We then discuss our main results
   and explain why no substantive argument on the structural ``root{''}
   causes of terrorism emerges. We argue that the main gaps lie in the high
   fragmentation of this subfield, definitional problems, a somehow
   flexible operationalization of concepts, and a high dependence on
   sources of questionable reliability.},

Abstract = {Using a panel of province-level data, we investigate the effects of
   political party affiliations of local chief executives on the financing
   and delivery of devolved health services, where arguably the
   opportunities for and potential gains from inter-local governmental unit
   (LGU) cooperation abound. Despite these potential gains, the proportion
   of mayors that belong to the same party as the governor are found not to
   have any direct, independent and statistically significant effects on
   the local chief executives' ability to secure additional resources from
   the national government and other external sources, mobilize greater
   spending on local health services or improve select health service
   outputs. However, the re-election status of mayors and governors is
   found to have a direct, independent and positive impact on some of these
   indicators. These results support the view that narrow electoral
   objectives more than party platforms remain the dominant influence in
   local fiscal decisions under decentralization.},

Abstract = {This article reassesses the extent to which the British Army has been
   able to adapt to the counter-insurgency campaign in Helmand Province,
   Afghanistan. While adopting Farrell's definition of bottom-up military
   adaptation, this article contends that the task force/brigade level of
   analysis adopted by Farrell and Farrell and Gordon has led them to
   overstate the degree to which innovation arising from processes of
   bottom-up adaptation has actually ensued. Drawing on lower level
   tactical unit interviews and other data, this article demonstrates how
   units have been unable or unwilling to execute non-kinetic
   population-centric operations due to their lack of understanding of the
   principles of counter-insurgency warfare.},

Abstract = {Policing policy in member states of the European Union (EU) increasingly
   overlaps with the latter's laws and policies, but what causes how
   national actors set and `project' their respective positions within EU
   decision-making? Based upon research into the French and British cases
   in this field over the 2000s and sociological public policy theory, our
   analysis reveals that while these states formally share strongly
   centralized systems of co-ordination based on specialized ministries and
   interministerial mediation, considerable differences exist over the type
   of inter-administrative competition within each civil service and the
   linkages to politics this entails. Although national administrations and
   police forces in both countries have reorganized to engage in EU
   negotiations, intra-policy community tensions are much greater in France
   than in Britain. Secondly, the piece shows why British preference
   formation and projection in this sector is more systematically shaped by
   parliamentary, media and interest group scrutiny than its French
   counterpart.},

Abstract = {This article examines the history of Turkish opposition to the then
   European Economic Community (EEC) between 1967 and 1980. It traces how
   and why an overwhelming majority of the Turkish elite during these years
   was opposed to integration with Europe and why this opposition was
   experienced and performed through a national imagination. It argues that
   anti-EEC sentiment was informed by, and in turn formulated, a
   reassertion of nationalist thought that cut across Turkey's extant
   political and ideological spectrum.},

Journal = {CAMBRIDGE REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS},

Pages = {75-95},
Abstract = {Although Justin Rosenberg's academic writings have from the very
   beginning attempted to provide an alternative to neorealism in the form
   of Trotsky's theory of uneven and combined development (U\&CD), his
   attempts at actually replacing it with a general theory of his own have
   been relatively recent. His initial attempts raised much interest and
   several responses. In his latest paper, `Basic problems in the theory of
   uneven and combined development, part II: unevenness and political
   multiplicity' (Cambridge Review of International Affairs, 23: 1, 2010,
   165-189), Rosenberg acknowledges that in actual fact, despite his
   attempts to provide an alternative to neorealism, his own theory
   presupposed political multiplicity, and therefore in his latest article
   he has sought to rectify this by providing an account of the emergence
   of `politically fragmented space' which is explicitly grounded in
   historical materialism (Pozo-Martin, Cambridge Review of International
   Affairs, 20: 4, 2007, 554). As such, it is to be welcomed. However, this
   article argues that if we are to accept Rosenberg's theory of the
   emergence of multiplicity then it must provide a better explanation than
   other competing accounts. By using an alternative explanation of the
   rise of the international, this article demonstrates that Rosenberg's
   paper has failed to do this, and instead argues for the existence of a
   transhistorical anarchic environment arising from social rather than
   political multiplicity. However, U\&CD is then used to explain both the
   intra-and inter-societal stratifications (the latter in terms of
   distributional structure) that arise. Associated with these
   stratifications is the inextricable intertwining of the modes of
   production and modes of inter-state competition. From this combination
   emerges the general tendencies of societal development, which then need
   to be applied to the concrete circumstances of history. In so doing, we
   need to account for the different analytical registers of genesis,
   structure, epoch and conjuncture and the unique concatenation of factors
   that pertain for each of these (Callinicos, International Politics, 6:
   3, 2005, 362).},

   study primarily uses Listening Device and Telephone Intercept
   transcripts to analyze how the cell was structured, operated, and how

Abstract = {The Europeanization of Norway in a Comparative Perspective
   Research on Europeanization clearly shows that membership in the
   European Union over time affects the national political systems of
   member states. Given Norway's extensive integration within the EU, it is
   relevant and important to assess whether and, if so, how the Norwegian
   political system, too, has changed as a result, and how these effects
   compare with the general patterns among EU member states. Exploring the
   Europeanization of Norway in a comparative perspective, the article maps
   the effects of European integration for four central power relationships
   in the Norwegian political system: national-supranational authority,
   executive-legislative-judicial authority, political-administrative
   authority and national-regional authority. It is demonstrated that
   integration within the EU to a large extent has had the same effects in
   Norway as in the member states of the EU, despite Norway's alternative
   form of affiliation: extensive delegation of power to the supranational
   level, strengthening of the government in relation to the parliament, an
   increasingly important role for national courts, expanded power and
   autonomy of the executive administration in relation to the political
   leadership, and some strengthening of the regions vis-a-vis the central
   government.},

   Violence},
Journal = {TERRORISM AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE},

Volume = {24},
Number = {5},
Pages = {743-768},
Abstract = {How does the way in which a group organizes change the lethality of the
   group's attacks? In this article, we argue that groups organized
   vertically as hierarchies are likely to conduct more lethal attacks. We
   build our argument around three advantages inherent to centralized
   structures: functional differentiation, clear command and control
   structures, and accountability. We argue that each of these
   characteristics positively impacts an organization's ability to deliver
   an effective lethal blow. To test our argument, we use a mixed method
   approach, drawing on empirical evidence and support from a time-series
   case study. Our large-N analysis examines the trends in more than 19,000
   attacks. In this test we develop a novel proxy measure for hierarchy
   based on a group's bases of operation and non-violent activities. To
   complement the empirical work, we examine the history of Euskadi Ta
   Askatasuna (ETA), the Basque separatist group. Over several decades of
   violent operations, this group's structure has changed dramatically. We
   analyze how these shifts impacted ETA's ability to maximize the
   effectiveness and damage of their attacks. In both the case study and
   large-N analysis, the more hierarchically organized the group, the more
   easily the group can orchestrate lethal attacks.},

Abstract = {Twenty months in office, the Aquino administration has zealously pursued
   one of its avowed goals-to fight corruption and prepare the ground for
   transparent, accountable and participatory governance. Events in 2011
   manifest the premium put by President Aquino on this goal, specifically
   securing the accountability of former President Arroyo as well as the
   incumbent Chief Justice of the Supreme Court through cases filed versus
   the former and an impeachment case filed against the latter. However,
   the administration has yet to show equal zeal in acting on issues
   involving asset redistribution as well as crucial political reforms, two
   key challenges that are expected to hound the administration during the
   remainder of its six-year term.},

Abstract = {While European converts to Islam represent only a tiny percentage of
   Europe's Muslim population, members of that group have participated in
   major Islamist terrorist plots and attacks on European soil. Although
   the radicalization process has not been the same for all individuals, it
   could be still possible to understand the circumstances under which some
   European converts turned to violence. Therefore, the article focuses on
   a number of mechanisms that may have contributed to the radicalization
   of European jihadi converts, including personal victimization, political
   grievance, the slippery slope effect, the power of love and the
   inspirational preaching.},

   SOUTHEAST EUROPE AND BEYOND},
Booktitle = {PANORAMA OF GLOBAL SECURITY ENVIRONMENT - 2012},
Year = {2012},
Pages = {227+},
Abstract = {In a highly complex geostrategic regional environment, it is essential
   for Turkey to maintain an adaptive and decisive foreign and security
   policy. It remains a state with a relatively stable multiparty political
   system, a growing economy and its influence seems to be steadily
   increasing, even becoming relevant on a much wider scale. Turkish
   `Shuttle Diplomacy' has been pretty effective in solving incidents and
   disputes in the region of Southeast Europe. The country maintained a
   `zero conflict with neighbors' policy, even in the most difficult
   circumstances. Being active on issues related to the Arab Spring,
   especially in the `Friends of Syria' process, provides an additional
   dimension to the aforementioned. Furthermore, Turkey is obviously
   attempting to act on a wider scale and, as a part of that strategy, it
   tries to increase its influence throughout the neighboring Southeast
   Europe by improving relations with numerous countries to which it has
   historical ties. Between Europe and Asia, Turkey is also in the process
   of EU accession negotiations that have so far run into numerous
   difficulties and setbacks, with direct implications for the internal
   policy. It affects the balance of power within the existing political
   system and accordingly the way the country perceives and positions
   itself on the international arena. This article takes into account all
   of the abovementioned elements to analyze the country's foreign and
   security policy and to predict its future trends.},

Abstract = {The Treaty of Maastricht and even more so the sceptical public response
   to the further deepening of European integration triggered a new
   approach to civil society. This contribution explores why the concept of
   civil society became so prominent in Brussels and why such high
   expectations were placed in the democratic strengthening of Europe by
   involving civil society in EU governance and by starting a civil
   dialogue. The main part of the contribution presents the findings of an
   empirical investigation demonstrating and explaining how much
   aspirations differ from reality. At the end of the contribution the
   democratic potential of civil dialogue is compared with expectations
   regarding the European Citizens' Initiative.},

Abstract = {What explains the appeal of sub-state nationalism in developed liberal
   democracies such as Belgium, Spain, the United Kingdom and Canada? This

Abstract = {Triggered by the collapse of the US mortgage market, the global
   financial crisis (GFC) of 200708 hit most of the Western world hard and
   fast, presenting governments and citizens with a set of stark,
   undeniable and immediate realities. This article examines the attempts
   of three prime ministers Gordon Brown in the UK, Brian Cowen in Ireland
   and Kevin Rudd in Australia to meet the key leadership challenge set up
   by the GFC: to publicly assess, explain and account for the GFC and the
   accompanying economic turbulence and uncertainty as financial markets
   went from boom to bust. By focussing on meaning making we examine how
   the leaders responded to the public expectation to explain: How bad is
   the situation? How did it occur? Who or what is to be held responsible?
   What needs to be done to cope with it? Using both qualitative and
   quantitative methods we compare the rhetorical impacts of these leaders.},

Abstract = {Do business contributions to political parties convey different messages
   in different countries, and, if so, why? This article presents a
   pioneering cross-national study of firm behavior in political finance.
   It argues that motivations for contributions to parties are either
   ideological or pragmatic. The author infers motivation by quantitatively
   relating the payments of 960 firms to various political parties in
   Australia, Canada, and Germany over periods of between seven and
   seventeen years. In coordinated market economy Germany, a small number
   of firms made ideological payments; in liberal market economy Australia
   and Canada, large numbers of firms made pragmatic payments. Australia's
   left-right party system creates an awareness of policy risk, which
   motivated ideological payments, but in Canada's unusually nonideological
   party system no ideological bias in business financing of politics was
   found. The statistical analysis is supplemented by a qualitative
   investigation of discrete and reciprocal exchanges between businesses
   and political parties.},

Pages = {83+},
Abstract = {The NATO Summit in Chicago took place in a very interesting period of
   time: just after the presidential elections in Russia and France and in
   the presidential election year in U.S.A. This Summit was underestimated
   by a large group of experts from the beginning at least on the level of
   expectations of what it can realistically deliver. The NATO members had
   set three main tasks for the Summit: First, to determine the way forward
   for the ISAF operation in Afghanistan; second, to prepare the Alliance
   to be able to cope effectively and with appropriate capabilities with
   the future security challenges; and third, to strengthen the Alliance as
   a global actor by developing existing and establishing new partnerships
   with states outside the Alliance. From the Slovak national perspective,
   we can consider outcomes of the Summit to be fully in line with our
   expectations and foreign- and defence policy priorities. Generally, we
   can assess the Chicago Summit as a success. NATO countries have taken
   concrete decisions, even exceeding the expectations of experts. Of
   course, a critical phase will begin with their implementation.},

Pages = {201-213},
Abstract = {A description and test of the Holistic Student Assessment Tool (HSA), an
   assessment tool to measure children's and adolescents' resiliencies in
   relation to externalizing and internalizing problem behaviors. The HSA
   is based on the authors' research-based clinical-developmental Clover
   Leaf Model of resilience and psychopathology, and is one of the first
   attempts at closing the gap between risk and resilience approaches in
   developmental assessment. The HSA was tested in a cross-sectional sample
   of 423 children and adolescents.
   The results lend support to the HSA as a valid measure of children's and
   adolescents' resiliencies. Furthermore, the resilience scales mostly
   exhibited the theoretically expected convergent and divergent
   relationships with the psychopathology scales. In addition, we show how
   the resilience scales predict adolescents' externalizing and
   internalizing symptoms. We contend that evidence-based intervention to
   address youth aggression needs to be based on sound developmental
   assessment.},

Journal = {POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {40},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {Prior research considers the extent to which public assistance
   recipients' charitable activity differs from the habits of the general
   population. Although receiving public assistance is negatively
   associated with donating money, the relationship to volunteering is
   unclear. In response to challenges overcoming selection bias, we
   conducted a multivariate cluster-based subgroup analysis to reduce bias
   in our claims about the ways in which public assistance receipt affects
   charitable activity. This innovative approach to dealing with the
   problem of selection bias has implications and applications across the
   social sciences.},

Volume = {34},

Pages = {75-91},
Abstract = {Since the integration process commenced, there has been debate over
   whether the countries in Central and Eastern Europe have seen a surge or
   decline in democracy after signing accession treaties to join the
   European Union (EU). Drawing upon a sample of 24 Central and Eastern
   European countries, I test whether EU candidates and members have
   experienced an increase in levels of democracy since the onset of
   accession, as opposed to their non-EU neighbours. I also test the
   effects of EU candidacy and membership on state-level civil liberties
   and political rights. These analyses are conducted while controlling for
   relevant factors: gross domestic product per capita, trade openness and
   type of democratic - parliamentary versus presidential - system. All
   countries in Central and Eastern Europe that have complete and
   comparable data available are included in the empirical analysis. In
   conclusion, I find that there is a positive and significant relationship
   between integration and civil liberties.},

Title = {Probing the historical sources of the Mauritian miracle: sugar exporters
   and state building in colonial Mauritius},
Journal = {REVIEW OF AFRICAN POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {39},
Number = {133},
Pages = {465-478},
Abstract = {Scholars increasingly agree that the `Mauritian Miracle' was enabled by
   the country's significant level of state capacity. This article probes
   Mauritius's state-building past to identify the early sources of
   Mauritian state capacity. Specifically, I find that the close
   collaboration between the island's export-oriented sugar planters, known
   as the Franco-Mauritians, and colonial officials accounts for the growth
   of Mauritian state capacity during the nineteenth century. Following the
   island's first major commodity boom, in 1825, sugar planters pressed
   colonial officials to `regulate' the island's labour supply, improve its
   transportation infrastructure, and undertake research and development
   initiatives. These efforts collectively promoted the growth of state
   capacity and laid the groundwork for the country's relatively capable
   state. The influence of Mauritius's export-oriented coalition on state
   building may shed light on the country's comparative success to other
   African countries, where export-oriented coalitions have been rare both
   historically and in the contemporary era.},

Title = {European Member State Elites' Diverging Visions of the European Union:
   Diverging Differently since the Economic Crisis and the Libyan
   Intervention?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {34},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {169-190},
Abstract = {In the midst of the EU's economic crisis and in the heat of the Libyan
   intervention, immediate concerns have seemingly crowded out
   consideration of the long-term issues that have been at the center of
   the major debates, such as the constitutionalization of the EU,
   enlargement to the east, or the EU as a global actor. But although these
   issues appear to be forgotten, the underlying questions about what the
   EU should be and do that nourished the debates remain. Although each
   member state naturally has its own specific answer to these questions,
   the answers have more generally divided into four basic discourses about
   the EU as a free market, a values-based community, a rights-based union,
   and/or a strategic global actor. Leaders' visions of the EU have long
   appeared associated with particular discourses, with these continuing to
   inform and explain their actions. But their responses to the economic
   crisis of the EU as well as to the humanitarian crisis of Libya have
   thrown such discourses, whether understood in terms of path dependence
   or incremental development, into question, since some member state
   leaders' discourses and/or actions marked radical shifts, and others
   greater drifts, from the past, at least in the heat of the moment. The
   question this article therefore poses is whether EU visions are not
   simply continuing to diverge but also whether they are diverging
   differently in the aftermath of the EU's recent crises in economics and
   international action. It will assess this through the lens of European
   political elites' discourses of European integration and international
   relations, with special attention to the three biggest member states,
   Britain, France, and Germany.},

Journal = {WORLD POLITICS},

Volume = {64},
Number = {1},
Pages = {39+},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Terrorist groups repeatedly include operatives of varying commitment and
   often rely on a common set of security-reducing bureaucratic tools to
   manage these individuals. This is puzzling in that covert organizations
   are commonly thought to screen their operatives very carefully and pay a
   particularly heavy price for record keeping. The authors use terrorist
   memoirs and the internal correspondence of one particularly prominent
   group to highlight the organizational challenges terrorist groups face
   and use a game-theoretic model of moral hazard in a finitely sized
   organization to explain why record keeping and bureaucracy emerge in
   these groups. The model provides two novel results. First, in small
   heterogeneous organizations longer institutional memory can enhance
   organizational efficiency. Second, such organizations will use worse
   agents in equilibrium under certain conditions. The core logic is that
   in small organizations the punishment strategies that allow leaders to
   extract greater effort are credible only when operatives can identify
   and react to deviations from the leaders' equilibrium strategy. This
   dynamic creates incentives for record keeping and means that small
   organizations will periodically use problematic agents in equilibrium as
   part of a strategy that optimally motivates their best operatives.},

   assumptions and national identity},
Journal = {CRITICAL POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {6},
Number = {4},
Pages = {363-378},
Abstract = {Policies can be analyzed as stories about who and what is valued within
   society. Immigration policy (and immigration policy narratives) offer
   particularly clear renderings of such stories. This article critically
   adopts the approach of narrative policy analysis to explore the core
   assumptions that are shared by apparently opposed policy narratives of
   immigration policy in contemporary New Zealand. It theorizes these
   shared assumptions as a policy (pre) meta-narrative that is logically
   related to discourses of national identity, and that effects specific
   silences and exclusions. These public silences, it is argued, serve to
   damagingly limit and distort the field of policy debate.},

Abstract = {This analysis of attempts to establish international studies in
   Scandinavia before World War II demonstrates how closely integrated
   these efforts were with similar ongoing work outside Scandinavia. The
   initiatives in Scandinavia were the result of contact between national
   actors and, in particular, the Rockefeller Foundation and the
   International Studies Conference, who played the part of initiators and
   actively pushed the work forward. However, the article stresses that
   there were also national developments rooted in local initiatives.
   Establishment of the Nobel Institute is particularly important. In the
   process leading up to the founding of the institute in 1904,
   well-developed ideas about the scientific study of international
   relations were expressed. Thus, the article supports recent research
   stressing continuities in the history of the discipline from the late
   1800s and into the interwar years.},

   as different in kind from the regular variant that was originally
   theorized during the Cold War. The regular variant emphasizes the role
   of clearly defined and commonly recognized `thresholds' as a means of
   organizing cooperation within conflict. In contrast, the irregular
   variant can reward efforts by weaker terroristic actors to erode the
   moral significance of the combatant/non-combatant threshold, just as it
   can reward efforts by their stronger adversaries to bolster it.},

Pages = {92-108},
Abstract = {The development of a corpus of fundamental rights at the EU level has
   accentuated the constitutional pluralism that existed within many
   national legal systems. Illustrating the dynamic, the adjudication of
   the age discrimination provisions of the 2000 Framework Directive on
   Employment Equality in Germany produced two major outcomes. First,
   interactions between the ECJ and the German labour courts served to
   upgrade rights protections afforded to workers, relative to national
   constitutional standards. Second, the structural position of the German
   Federal Constitutional Court, as a privileged locus of rights
   protection, was weakened, while the authority of the labour courts was
   enhanced. Looking ahead, we are entering a new era of rights-based legal
   integration that will further serve to Europeanize national law, while
   undermining the (supposed) unity and coherence of national legal orders.},

   POLICIES: CONTENT, CONTEXT, AND PERSONALITY CHARACTERISTICS},
Journal = {PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {90},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {The willingness of public professionals to implement policy programmes
   is important for achieving policy performance. However, few scholars
   have developed and tested systematic frameworks to analyze this issue.
   In this study, we address this by building and testing an appropriate
   framework. The aims have been: (1) to build a three-factor model (policy
   content, organizational context, and personality characteristics) for
   explaining willingness to implement policies; and (2) to quantitatively
   test the model through a survey of Dutch professionals. The results show
   that policy content is the most important factor in explaining
   willingness. Nevertheless, organizational context and the personality
   characteristics of implementers also have a significant effect and
   should be considered when studying the attitudes of professionals
   towards policies. This research helps in understanding the willingness
   or resistance of professionals when it comes to implementing policies.},

Volume = {47},

Abstract = {Most existing analyses of counterterrorism cooperation among EU Member
   States have focused on the formal EU agencies and institutions, which
   may be regarded as direct vertical extensions of political and executive
   power in the EU Member States. When it comes to practical cooperation,
   however, it appears that national security agencies in Europe often
   prefer to utilize horizontal non-EU counterterrorism arrangements.
   Because of their flexibility and relative independence from national
   governments, as well as their ability to include a broader range of
   participants on equal footing, it is generally assumed that these
   informal arrangements are more suitable for achieving common goals than
   their more formal and hierarchical EU counterparts. This article argues
   that the informal non-EU arrangements also suffer from a number of
   distinct shortcomings. This, in turn, questions the wisdom of the
   post-9/11 response to terrorism by putting yet more formal EU bodies
   and/or informal arrangements on the already crowded map of security
   bodies in Europe.},

Abstract = {The New Growth Path (NGP) is the symbolic policy document of South
   Africa's newly formed Department of Economic Development. It marks an
   intended break with the growth path of the first two decades of the
   post-apartheid era. But does it do so in principle and is it likely to
   do so in practice? This paper suggests otherwise because of its failure
   to address, let alone remedy, the key determining features of the
   post-apartheid economic landscape. These are the (international)
   financialisation of (domestic) conglomerate capital especially
   associated with (illegal) capital flight, the complicity of a newly
   formed black elite, and the continuing reliance upon how these interact
   with South Africa's longstanding mineralsenergy complex (MEC). Without
   breaking with these features, the NGP in particular, and policy more
   generally, will seek to temper the gains and organisational opposition
   of better-off workers for putative benefits to those deprived of
   employment and basic levels of public provision.},

Abstract = {Maya spirituality serves as a locus of enunciation for the ongoing
   negotiation between local expressive culture and a changing globalized
   society. In recent years the Mayas of Guatemala have subversively used
   the global market provided by tourism to survive economically, recover
   their cultural property, and reclaim their heritage. Lacking voice and
   representation in an environment that has historically threatened their
   way of life, they assert their heritage in order to valorize their
   culture. They employ public knowledge and experience of natural
   disasters to demonstrate not just the accuracy of the 2012 prophecies of
   change at the end of the Maya calendar's long count, but also the value
   of the knowledge systems that produced them.},

Title = {Beyond Macroprudential Regulation: Three Ways of Thinking about
   Financial Crisis, Regulation and Reform},
Journal = {GLOBAL POLICY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {3},
Number = {4},
Pages = {410-420},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This paper considers the debate about the `macroprudential regulation'
   of finance in the context of a broader view of the relation of finance
   to the real economy. Five ideas are central to the argument. The first
   idea is that the two dominant families of ideas about finance and its
   regulation share a failure of institutional imagination. Neoclassical
   economists blame localized market and regulatory failures for the
   troubles of finance. Keynesians invoke the way in which the money
   economy may amplify cycles of despondency and euphoria. Neither current
   of thought recognizes that the institutions of finance in particular,
   and of the market economy in general, can take different forms, with
   different consequences for the organization of production and exchange
   as well as for distribution. The second idea is that, under present
   arrangements, finance readily becomes the master rather than the servant
   of the real economy and lays itself open to recurrent booms and busts.
   The third idea is that present arrangements can be reformed in ways that
   more effectively put finance at the service of the productive agenda of
   society. The fourth idea is that the regulation of finance, including
   what we now call macroprudential regulation, can and should be designed
   as initial moves in such an institutional reshaping. The fifth idea is
   that neoclassical and Keynesian conceptions are inadequate guides to the
   execution of this task. We can find in law and legal thought many of the
   intellectual and practical tools that we need.},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {A comprehensive ideal of global justice is not yet theoretically
   justifiable: nonetheless, it does not deserve the scepticism :(commonly
   expressed by) many statists express towards it. To create a kind of
   continuity between global justice - `Cosmopolis' - and interstate
   justice - `Leviathan' - a third, `Liberal' option is proposed. The
   statist argument is presented through a discussion of Thomas Nagel's
   position on global justice. The cosmopolitan argument is presented
   through a discussion of Amartya Sen's overall vision of justice. The
   liberal view, modeled on Rawls' political philosophy, `'proposes'' that
   the right cannot consist in a mere realization of the good. Liberals
   that respect the `priority of right' believe that morality has to be
   different from politics. By bypassing institutionalism through moralism,
   cosmopolitans contradict the priority of the right. Contrary to
   cosmopolitans, the author maintains that the only moral source of global
   justice compatible with the priority of the right consists in a duty to
   protect life in case of `urgency'. This duty is not purely humanitarian
   - as statists would have it - and captures the ethical appeal of
   cosmopolitanism.},

Abstract = {Scholars have shown that corporate responsibility (CR) initiatives can
   create intangible assets that help MNCs reduce their liability of
   foreignness and even gain competitive advantage over local rivals. But
   scholars have not addressed the ability of MNCs to transfer CR
   initiatives to subsidiaries. This study builds theory about the
   conditions that influence success and failure in the transfer of CR
   practices from headquarters to overseas subsidiaries. We analyze CR
   transfers from the headquarters of an Indian multinational to its
   subsidiaries in China and the U.K. Our findings suggest that CR transfer
   differs in substantial ways from operational practice transfer. In
   particular, the ambiguity of the CR initiative, the social competency of
   the business unit transferring the CR initiative, and the active
   involvement of local stakeholders play significant roles in CR transfer
   success.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the response of the Mexican workers' movement to
   democratization and the various consequences of this process for labor
   policies, providing a contribution to the comparative politics debate on
   the role of labor unionism in democratic change. The system that governs
   the State-worker relationship, a legacy of Mexico's authoritarian past,
   helps to explain the calculations made by labor union leaders and
   government officials regarding the country's democratic transition. This
   document analyzes changes to political representation in labor unions
   and the electoral behavior of unionized workers, together with the
   successive failures experienced by the proposed reform to the Federal
   Working Law since 2000 and the implications for the workers' movement
   and Mexican society.},

Volume = {60},

Abstract = {Questions about the political influence of organised interests are at
   the heart of democratic theory and political science. Yet comparatively
   little is known empirically about the effectiveness of different power
   resources in policy struggles and how organised interests succeed or
   fail to employ these resources to achieve desired political outcomes.
   The main factors behind the empirical neglect of political influence
   include problems of measurement and a scarcity of relevant data. To
   address this problem, a newspaper analysis was conducted to compile a
   data set of 163 policy proposals advanced by UK governments between 2001
   and 2007 and to record the reported policy position of organised
   interests. The data are used to assess frequently voiced expectations in
   the literature about organised interest politics and political influence
   in a new light. The results show that support from interest groups is
   positively related to a proposal becoming policy. The positions of
   business groups are no better reflected in policy outcomes than those of
   non-business groups. Donations to political parties are unrelated to the
   extent to which policy outcomes are in line with a firm's policy
   positions.},

Abstract = {Corporate Responsibility (CR) is today an essential component of
   corporate global strategy. CR can bolster the institutional context for
   market expansion fill institutional voids or facilitate market entry as
   a component of non- market strategy. Yet, in fulfilling these functions,
   CR may need to be highly sensitive to local contexts. How can
   transnational firms organize CR so as to maximize efficiencies from
   globalization and to minimize the fragmentation of corporate
   organizational cultures? provide a framework for analyzing the way that
   corporations coordinate global and local functions. We build on this
   framework in a case study of Novo Nordisk and its approach to
   determining global and local CR policies and procedures with regard to
   its China and US subsidiaries. Our findings suggest that it is important
   for companies to define a common set of organizational norms. In
   addition, CR need to be sensitive to local institutional contexts, but
   learning from subsidiary experience is important and lends itself to
   standardization and replication of initiatives across market contexts.},

Abstract = {THE ORIGINS OF POSITIVE JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE By LISA HILBINK
   A number of comparative judicial scholars have argued that assertions of
   judicial authority are a function of the level of
   fragmentation/competition in the formal political sphere. Accordingly,
   in authoritarian or one-party settings, judges should be deferential to
   power holders, and in places where political power is divided between
   branches and/or parties, one would expect to see greater levels of
   judicial assertiveness. Through a longitudinal, qualitative analysis of
   one most-likely case (Chile) and one least-likely case (Franco-era
   Spain) and drawing on a half-dozen other cases from the comparative
   judicial literature, this article argues that political fragmentation is
   neither sufficient nor necessary for judges to challenge powerful
   actors, instead, it argues that assertive or ``positively
   independent{''} judicial behavior requires ideational support, in the
   form of a role conception/professional ideology that gives judges
   motivation for such behavior. Such professional attitudes are socially
   and institutionally constituted in a dynamic process that itself shapes
   judges' perceptions of the opportunities for and obstacles to judicial
   assertiveness, both within and outside the judiciary.},

Abstract = {This article considers the role of evidence and prospects for collective
   deliberation in shaping policy and practice in straitened times. It
   draws on critical policy sociology to enhance existing perspectives on
   policy transfer. The article explores how `new professionalism' in the
   public services intersects with the `new localism' and current realities
   of public policy management. In recognising the limitations of
   presentism' in policy analysis, attention is afforded to the
   recuperation and selective reinvention of policy discourses deployed in
   previous systemic crises. In contrast to rational linear models of
   problem solving, alternative recursive deliberative approaches are
   suggested.},

Abstract = {This article explores the production of post-apartheid Afrikaner
   identity in South Africa. Centred around the private sphere of the
   braai, the article draws on discursive psychology to investigate the
   participants' dilemmas and struggles over their identity as Afrikaners,
   South Africans, and Africans, and the ways in which these identities are
   being redefined. The `backstage' talk that is usually reserved for
   fellow whites or Afrikaners illustrates a clear difference between
   public and private constructions of Afrikaner identity. While the
   participants rejected many stereotypes of Afrikaner identity, they
   simultaneously recycled key discourses underlying apartheid ideology,
   particularly discourses of black incompetence and whites under threat.
   Participants generally claimed status as `Africans' but strongly
   resisted assimilation with `Africa' or a broader African identity. The
   article concludes that the construction of the Afrikaner community as
   embattled and systematically oppressed might provide powerful support
   for extremism.},

Abstract = {In this article, the impact of diminishing levels of uncertainty on
   labour demand, as a consequence of conflict resolution processes, is
   tested by means of a case study of a European region largely affected by
   political violence. For this purpose, the response of Basque
   manufacturing employment during conflict resolution attempts is used as
   a natural experiment with which to evaluate the effect of reduced
   uncertainty on labour demand. Accordingly, using the
   difference-in-differences technique, which overcomes some of the
   shortcomings of previous studies, the relative performance of Basque
   labour demand during the last two attempts to bring peace to the region
   is quantified. The longest ceasefire episode ever declared in the region
   is shown to have triggered a reactivation in labour demand and,
   therefore, that Basque manufacturing firms responded positively to the
   reduction in uncertainty by significantly raising their average number
   of employees. More precisely, it is found that the average number of
   workers employed by Basque manufacturing firms increased considerably
   when credible peace talks directed towards the end of the conflict were
   undertaken. Thus, when compared with their counterparts in similar
   Spanish provinces, the truce declared in 1998 boosted employment demand
   in Basque companies by more than 4\%, which reflects the economic
   dividend of peace to be reaped in the event of an eventual conflict
   resolution and the establishment of a peaceful environment in the
   region.},

Abstract = {Indigenismo can be found in almost every country in the Americas. Most
   indigenistas attempted to write the Indian into their national pasts and
   adopted similar modernizing projects. Still, what appears to be a common
   history can be deceiving. Examination of one indigenista project in
   three distinct American contexts-the indigenous boarding schools in
   Mexico, Canada, and the United States-indicates considerable differences
   in practice. For one thing, while the boarding schools north of the
   border aimed to separate students from the deleterious influence of
   their communities and bring them into the cultural mainstream, in Mexico
   indigenous communities were essential to development strategies, and the
   internados, as an important element of these strategies, sought to
   cultivate rather than break down ethnic affiliations. These and other
   differences in the politics that emerged from these projects suggest
   that the study of indigenismo may require attention to the ways in which
   particular power arrangements give meaning to indigenous identities.},

   Sovereign Debt Restructuring},
Journal = {GLOBAL POLICY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {3},
Number = {3},
Pages = {362-374},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The global community still lacks a regime for sovereign debt
   restructuring. There is increasing concern that international investment
   agreements may become a `court' for sovereign workouts. Are
   international investment agreements the appropriate place for the global
   community to resolve sovereign debt restructuring in the event of a
   financial crisis? It has been often overlooked that the definition of a
   covered investment within international trade and investment agreements
   often includes sovereign debt. In lieu of this, this article analyses
   the extent to which investment provisions in various treaties may hinder
   the ability of nations and private creditors to comprehensively
   negotiate sovereign debt restructurings when a debtor nation has
   defaulted or is close to default on its government debt. It is found
   that the treatment of sovereign debt varies considerably in terms of
   strength and applicability across the spectrum of now thousands of trade
   and investment treaties in the world economy. It is also found that most
   treaties may restrict the ability to restructure debt in the wake of a
   financial crisis. These findings could undermine the ability of nations
   to recover from financial crises and could thus broaden the impact of
   such crises.},

Abstract = {On a range of structural and ideological issues Russia and Europe are
   increasingly mutually dependent, as in the energy sector, as well as in
   security matters and a number of other issues, but this has not
   generated `interdependence' - the term popular from the 1970s to denote
   a qualitative transformation of the relationship, as described by
   Keohane and Nye and others. The paper asks why this has been the case,
   providing historical and theoretical context, but above all it looks at
   some of the ideas now advanced that could transcend the present impasse.
   An `international regime' is emerging in response to Russian aspirations
   for some sort of `greater European' community, the European Union's
   complex pattern of `external governance', and the need to integrate
   third parties (notably Turkey) into an extended network of relations
   that falls short of full-scale accession but gives form to aspirations
   for pan-European unity. (C) 2012 The Regents of the University of

   extent to which this subculture has influenced and been influenced by
   political developments in the country. The research builds on a wide
   variety of sources in order to explain the complex processes at work
   that have led to this social phenomenon. I intend to show that these
   groups signify a fundamental trend in Russian political culture rather
   than operating on the margins of it, and that they are the result of
   political reformations in the country and the spread of global
   capitalism. (C) 2012 The Regents of the University of California.

Abstract = {Housing has been a persistent problem in Chile. Concertacion governments
   have sought to address the housing problem through a continuation of the
   neoliberal policies established by the dictatorship under Pinochet,
   emphasizing housing as commodity rather than a right. A study of housing
   policies under the Concertacion reveals improvements in the quantitative
   supply with increased spending. Yet these neoliberal housing programs
   stratify residents into categories of poverty in which the poorest
   residents compete against one another to access subsidies and find
   housing. These programs prevent citizens from acting collectively to
   demand policy changes; instead housing is treated as a problem of poor
   families who must seek to resolve their situation on the individual
   level by enrolling in subsidy programs. As a result, the unequal
   distribution of housing in Chile continues, and the poor end up in
   low-quality housing in economically segregated neighborhoods far from
   jobs and services.},

Volume = {60},
Number = {2},
Pages = {419-433},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The need to use green taxes to protect the environment is urgent,
   particularly because of climate change, and can be justified via sound
   deontological and consequence-based arguments. One very influential
   criticism of such taxes, however, claims that they disproportionately
   burden relatively poor individuals who tend to contribute to
   environmental problems far less than wealthier persons. Critics can also
   object that because of the link between economic inequality and
   environmental destruction it is preferable to adopt environmental
   measures that impede rather than accelerate the growth of inequality.
   Defusing these criticisms, the article argues that various types of
   green fiscal reform can both avoid disproportionally burdening those who
   pollute least and reduce the economic inequalities that income taxes
   leave behind, and slow down the collectively self-defeating consumption
   arms race that currently besets so many affluent societies. Global
   progressive environmental taxation is also a possibility, and even
   easier to justify.},

Abstract = {This article explores the obstacles to the development and operation of
   a world state that are rooted in functional differentiation of modern
   societies, the ecological dominance of the broadly capitalist world
   market, and the inherent tendencies of all forms of governance to fail.
   It also highlights the challenges to the temporal as well as territorial
   sovereignty of states, whatever their scale of operation, due to the
   acceleration as well as globalization of social relations. Combining
   insights from Niklas Luhmann and Karl Marx, the article develops some
   novel arguments about multi-spatial metagovernance as an alternative
   approach to the problems posed by a world state as the guarantor of
   global social order.},

   International Studies Association The 20082009 global economic crisis
   has revived debates concerning the decline of American hegemony and the
   rise of China. This article engages with these debates on two levels.
   First, through situating the 20082009 crisis in longer-term development
   trends in the world economy, I suggest that the empirical evidence of
   American decline is more ambiguous and that the crisis itself is not,
   necessarily, an indicator of decline, but rather an organic feature of
   uneven development with more open political consequences. Secondly, I
   offer a revised neo-Gramscian perspective on American hegemony by
   highlighting the contradictions between the structural logic of uneven
   development and the neoliberal historical bloc. Through this I provide
   an alternative overview of the evolution of American hegemony over the
   last 30 years pointing to the likely continuation of American/neoliberal
   global hegemony.},

   Morgenthau on Love and Power. International Studies Review, doi:
   10.1111/j.1468-2486.2012.01109.x International Relations (IR) has seen
   renewed interest in the nuanced insights of Hans Morgenthau which had
   long been obscured by neorealism. This new reflexive realism, however,
   far from exhausts the range of Morgenthaus thinking about politics or
   social theory. In the 1960s, Morgenthau lamented the inability of modern
   thinking to recognize the connections between power and love, which he
   argued was symptomatic of the inability to fully understand either one.
   For Morgenthau, both power and love were rooted in the need to overcome
   the loneliness of the human condition. Through pursuits of both power
   and love, people seek, through others, to avoid the selfs insufficiency.
   Yet, these pursuits are mutually subversive. The frustration of love
   blends into the imposition of power, and the pursuit of power is
   ultimately an extension of the search for love. In exploring these
   issues, this paper argues that Morgenthaus insights have implications
   for at least three core issues of contemporary concern in IR. First,
   they suggest fresh perspectives on recent discussions of human nature in
   IR. Second, Morgenthaus analysis contributes to the burgeoning interest
   in emotions in IR, pointing to the neglect of love in this literature,
   and illustrates his attempt to theorize what may be called the affective
   limits of the self. Third, these insights can be used to enrich recent
   discussions of realist constructivism in IR.},

   Association Do remittances increase corruption in recipient states?
   Previous research suggests that remittances allow governments to
   maintain policies that create corrupt statesociety relations. In
   contrast, this paper argues that remittances mitigate corruption by
   increasing government accountability and providing other incentives to
   reform. Using data from Mexico in 20012007, this study shows that
   corruption trended downward in states receiving larger remittance sums,
   after controlling for political competition, divided government, and
   market openness. The results are robust to instrumental variable
   analysis testing for potential endogeneity between corruption and
   migration. These findings bring attention to remittances as an exogenous
   resource for reform-minded groups and suggest that they may operate as
   the converse of the resource curse.},

Journal = {FORO INTERNACIONAL},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {52},
Number = {2},
Pages = {434+},
Month = {APR-JUN},
Abstract = {Morocco is an example of what is attainable by employing the standard
   package of technical measures recommended by international aid
   institutions to improve governance and reduce corruption in developing
   countries. These measures include monitoring, oversight, transparency
   and accountability, in order to improve the structures, processes and
   institutional capacities with a minimum degree of interference in the
   political system of the country. This paper questions whether this
   technical approach to supporting good governance in Morocco can succeed
   in reducing corruption, when this is symptomatic of more profound
   political problems. The main objective of this paper is to point out the
   existence of a perverse relationship between ``good government{''} and
   the concept of technocratic power that reduces accountability and
   political representation.},

Abstract = {Fences of Ceuta and Melilla are an appropriate model to study to what
   extent governments could harmonize between stated purposes and hidden
   objectives. Although Spanish government has constantly stated that
   fences of the two enclaves aim only to stop irregular migration,
   comprehensive view of various aspects of the issue leads us to conclude
   the existence of other objectives behind this policy. Spain's policy of
   fencing the two enclaves' borders refl ects a contradictory process in
   the region. While Mediterranean sphere has witnessed during the last two
   decades an increasing number of cultural and economic cooperation
   projects, new real and virtual walls have been built in the region to
   achieve `` Fortress Europe{''}. The paper tries, fi rst, to show the
   controversial aspects of Ceuta and Melilla fences as the de facto EU
   southern border. Second, it aims to highlight the changing roles of the
   two enclaves' fences.},

Abstract = {The empirical case studies of this special issue not only provide an
   illuminating insight into the dynamic of political processes within the
   post-Soviet de facto states, they also contribute to the discussion of
   possible links between different strategies of state-building and the
   success or failure of democratization. Summing up the main findings of
   the issue, this article carves out the similarities and the differences
   in the internal political trajectories of the non-recognized but quite
   stable entities under analysis. Despite sometimes contradicting
   empirical evidence, one central outcome is clear: the established
   theoretical assumption that uncontested external sovereignty is a
   necessary precondition for internal democratization needs to be
   reconsidered.},

Abstract = {This article introduces Rosa Luxemburg's work on dialectics and the
   international and argues that its ontological foundations have been
   neglected within critical International Political Economy (IPE). Whereas
   other critical Marxists such as Gramsci have played key roles in
   instigating critical enquiry, Luxemburg's work has largely gone
   neglected. Although this article acknowledges some serious shortcomings
   in some of the `left infantilism' inherent within her work, it
   nevertheless argues that Luxemburg's dialectical ontology significantly
   contrasted with the orthodoxy that was emerging from Marxist circles at
   the time. This article explores some of these and argues that the
   dialectical method that Luxemburg employed to understanding the
   international provides us with a new avenue for critical IPE to pursue.
   In particular, it suggests that Luxemburg's articulation of critique
   provides us with fresh openings that both compliment and add to
   neo-Gramscian and neo-Polanyian accounts, and allows us to understand
   trends and practices within the global political economy in new critical
   ways. International Politics (2012) 49, 136-153. doi:10.1057/ip.2011.44;

Abstract = {This article illuminates the normative basis for international law's
   regulation of public emergencies by arguing that human rights are best
   conceived as norms arising from a fiduciary relationship between states
   (or state-like actors) and persons subject to their power. States bear a
   fiduciary duty to guarantee subjects' secure and equal freedom, a duty
   that flows from their institutional assumption of sovereign powers. The
   fiduciary theory disarms Carl Schmitt's critique of constitutionalism by
   explaining how emergency powers can be reconciled with the rule of law.},

Abstract = {Do human rights international nongovernmental organizations (HROs)
   impact public opinion? This article argues that HROs provide information
   to citizens in repressive regimes about their government's human rights
   practices. Without this information, worsening governmental abuse of
   human rights alone will not lead to fewer people believing their
   government respects human rights. With increased HRO shaming of the
   state, however, a smaller proportion of people come to believe that
   their government respects human rights. These hypotheses are tested
   using an updated dataset on shaming by over 400 HROs, together with
   never-before-examined data from the World Values Survey on the public's
   opinion of human rights within a state. The results largely support the
   article's contention: HROs are powerful conduits through which a
   population becomes informed of domestic human rights issues. Without HRO
   shaming, a bad or worsening human rights condition does not diminish the
   proportion of a population that believes their government respects human
   rights.},

Abstract = {For a vibrant and viable psychology of social change it is necessary to
   examine its place and contribution to the societal processes it seeks to
   understand, explain, and (potentially) affect. In this article, we first
   consider the impact that research and theorizing on social change
   (should) have and related issues of how we communicate about our work
   (and to whom) and dilemmas around researchers being active participants
   in the change process. Second, we consider emerging trends in the field
   and comment on meta-theoretical and meta-methodological issues in going
   forward, including the interaction between individual and society,
   having theoretical models of the person that allow us to account for
   such an interaction, as well as rethinking our methodology and ways of
   doing psychology to better reflect people's experiences of mobilization
   and participation. In line with the proposed rethinking of our theories
   and methods, the final section introduces a new paradigm for
   investigating the nexus of social change and leadership dynamics. The
   overall aim of the article is to reflect on key questions and dilemmas
   facing the field and provide some starting points for debating and
   shaping its future.},

Abstract = {While few would deny that present generations have a moral obligation to
   preserve the environment for future generations, some theorists reject
   the existence of a legal duty in this regard. This article takes the
   opposite view. It argues that ample juridical as well as ethical social
   justice theory contractarian distributive and reciprocity-based theories
   prominent among them establishes that future generations have a legal
   right to a clean and healthy environment. But most helpful in ensuring
   intergenerational ecological justice, the author contends, is a
   respect-based theory of social justice which at its core honors the
   values that underwrite human rights law and policy inclusively conceived

Abstract = {Radicalization is often seen as a first, prerequisite step along the
   road towards terrorism. Yet to be radical is merely to reject the status
   quo, and not necessarily in a problematic or violent way. In Part
   1-{''}Radicals{''}-this article compares the backgrounds, ideologies,
   behaviours, and attitudes of a sample of ``violent radicals{''} with
   both radical and ``mainstream{''} non-violent sample groups. By finding
   both what the violent and non-violent samples share, and also what they
   do not, the article hopes to achieve a more adept discrimination of
   violent and non-violent radicalization. In Part
   2-{''}Radicalization{''}-the article suggests that, in addition to being
   an intellectual, rational, and religious decision, becoming a terrorist
   is also an emotional, social, and status-conscious one.},

Journal = {PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION},

Volume = {90},
Number = {4},
Pages = {922-936},
Abstract = {Although European Union (EU) membership generates similar functional
   pressures for national administrations, member states developed
   institutional arrangements that show marked cross-country variation in
   the coordination of EU policy. This article examines and assesses the
   institutions and mechanisms established in Hungary for formulating
   policy positions on the domestic level. In line with the general
   features of central government, the system is highly centralized and
   hierarchical, and has been characterized by a comprehensive coordination
   ambition from its inception. The case confirms the primary importance of
   national institutional factors for shaping coordination systems, but
   also the relevance of more actor-centered explanations for accounting
   for changes in the top decision-making tier. At the same time, the
   Hungarian experience also draws attention to power relations within
   governing parties and prime ministerial involvement as important
   variables so far relatively neglected in the literature.},

Abstract = {The hundredth anniversary of the end of Baron of Rio Branco's
   administration at the Brazilian Ministry of External Relations matches
   with a politically favorable moment for examining the legacy of the
   patron of the Brazilian Diplomacy, especially concerning the United
   States and the Rio de la Plata, the two main axes of Brazilian foreign
   relations. It examines the content of the relations with the
   hemisphere's hegemonic power and the oscillating nature of the relations
   with Argentina. Using primary and bibliographic sources, the author aims
   to demonstrate that, in addition to accomplishing the process of
   delimiting the country's boundaries, Rio Branco established trends and
   procedures which were incorporated into the Brazilian Diplomatic
   Tradition. For this, the author analyzes the role the Rio de
   Janeiro-Washington alignment plays in the set of the chancellor's
   foreign policy and the pattern of relations with the Argentinean
   government - factors that have influenced Brazil's movements in its
   geographical surroundings. The foreign policy of prestige developed by
   Rio Branco derived from the aspiration to distinguish his country from
   the set of nations in the Southern Hemisphere, which are associated with
   political upheaval and financial insolvency.},

Journal = {POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {33},
Number = {3},
Pages = {263-281},
Abstract = {In England, National Health Service (NHS) organisations have a legal
   duty to ensure public involvement in health service design and delivery,
   and health panels are suggested in the guidance as one method of
   involving the public in this way. The Somerset Health Panels were
   established in 1994 and continue to be used as the main example of
   health panels - a distinct method for gathering the views of the public
   about health services. This article provides an analysis of the changes
   that took place during their development (1994-2003) in terms of their
   design, the management and organisation of the panels, the impact of NHS
   reconfiguration and policy, and changes and relationships within the
   research team and reflects on how they remain a relevant method of
   public involvement. As the public involvement in health agenda continues
   to strengthen in England under the coalition government, lessons learnt
   about the sustainability, adaptability and flexibility of the panels are
   as important today as they were then.},

Year = {2012},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {13-42},
Abstract = {Purpose - This chapter focuses on the role evolution has played in our
   development of politics and public policy and reviews the theoretical
   approaches and studies of the last decade that address biopolitics and
   evolution, such as the ``gene-culture co-evolution theory.''
   Design/methodology/approach - In this chapter some of these theoretical
   developments will be reviewed, including what has been called the
   ``Synergism Hypothesis,'' with particular emphasis on what is relevant
   for understanding the role of politics and public policy in the
   evolutionary process.
   Findings - A new, multileveled paradigm has emerged in evolutionary
   biology during the past decade, one which emphasizes the role of
   cooperative phenomena in the evolution of complexity over time,
   including the evolution of socially organized species such as humankind.
   I refer to it as ``Holistic Darwinism.''
   Practical implications - This study develops an understanding of the
   complicated relationship between human biology and the role of evolution
   in shaping politics and public policy.
   Originality/value - This study addresses several existing biopolitical
   concepts and presents new explanations and terminology for its
   understanding.},

Abstract = {The European Union (EU) and United States (US) are the world's two
   largest and most influential legal jurisdictions for corporate mergers
   and acquisitions (M\&A). The pressures of international economic
   competition have lead to a flurry of M \& A activity in these locales in
   the post-Cold War period. Given the economic impact and, in many cases,
   political sensitivity of some M\&As, it has become critical that
   transatlantic regulators reach similar decisions with regard to M\&A
   approval, denial, or modification. Incongruent decisions lead to
   uncertainty in the marketplace, and the possible loss of global economic
   competitiveness and respect for regulatory processes and outcomes. In
   this paper, we explore the efforts made by the US and EU over the past
   two decades to enhance cooperation in merger policies and processes. We
   argue that, despite a couple of high-profile cases to the contrary, the
   US and EU have made great strides in reducing uncertainty in the M\&A
   regulatory process by institutionalizing a series of formal agreements
   and working groups that have served to provide the foundation for a
   transatlantic merger environment that may serve as a model for
   cross-border regulatory cooperation in the twenty-first century.},

Title = {Implementing regulatory innovations in Europe: the case of impact
   assessment},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {19},
Number = {4},
Pages = {491-511},
Abstract = {Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) has become a major tool on the agenda
   of regulatory reform across Europe. Although the literature on RIA is
   burgeoning, the comparative analysis of implementation has been
   neglected. This article draws on implementation theory to formulate
   expectations about the political costs and benefits of different degrees
   of implementation. Implementation ranges from political endorsement to
   the creation of central units in charge of regulatory quality and the
   production and publication of RIA results and methods. Our findings show
   that economic integration, the characteristics of the political system,
   economic resources, bureaucratic efficiency and pressure group
   activities play different roles in the various stages of implementation.
   We discuss the policy implications of these findings in terms of
   priorities given to different processes of regulatory reform and the
   demands that innovations like RIA pose on administrative capacity and
   stakeholders' participation.},

   COMMISSION AS A LABORATORY},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},

Volume = {19},
Number = {6},
Pages = {939-950},
Abstract = {Classical international organizations are formally governed by ministers
   who have their primary institutional affiliation at the national level.
   The European Commission, on the other hand, represents a notable
   organizational innovation in the way that executive politicians at the
   top, i.e., the commissioners, have their primary institutional
   affiliation at the international level. Thus, the Commission constitutes
   a `laboratory' for experiments in supranational institution-building:
   what is the relative importance of nationality and organizational
   position with regard to explaining actual decision behaviour? This
   article takes stock of the existing literature in the field, and also
   launches a future research agenda. Concerning Commission officials,
   nationality seems to play a minor role. Nationality matters somewhat
   more regarding commissioners' behaviour, but makes up only one of
   several components of their highly compound role, thus making behaviour
   at the top of the Commission qualitatively different from behaviour in,
   for example, the European Council.},

Abstract = {This paper argues that on balance, deregulation and the exposure to
   overseas markets has been beneficial to the South African wine industry,
   resulting in strong growth, increased employment and much improved
   international competitiveness. However, the paper also draws attention
   to the fact that not everybody has benefited in equal measure from the
   process of upgrading, modernisation and internationalisation. Since the
   start of the transition in the mid 1990s, a number of growers have left
   the industry and for many workers employment has become less secure.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the important strides in internal security reform
   that India has undertaken since the November 2008 attack by Pakistani
   terrorists on the financial hub and port city of Mumbai. Despite decades
   of foreign and domestic terrorism and insurgency, India had never
   previously responded with such alacrity. This paper seeks to understand
   why this attack galvanised such reform whereas previous - and more
   deadly - attacks had not. To do so, it describes these important - if
   limited - achievements by putting them in the context of India's past
   insouciance and general approach towards internal security. Important
   factors (e.g. centre-state relations, patronage politics, composition
   and preferences of India's electorate and corruption) that will likely
   render more extensive change exceedingly unlikely if not impossible for
   the policy relevant future are identified. It concludes with a
   discussion of implications for India's internal security over the near
   and mid-term time horizons.},

Abstract = {In post-revolutionary Iran, the Basij militia group has helped the
   leadership of the country maintain political control by recruiting,
   indoctrinating, and organizing Iranians. As a semi-official
   pro-governmental militia, the Basij has controlled Iran's society by (1)
   engaging in local defence, (2) conducting surveillance, (3) policing
   society, and (4) suppressing dissidents. The militia group has also
   participated in national defence operations. Today, Basij members are
   organized into a clustered network of Basij bases, which are spread
   throughout Iran in order to control the society. Through eighteen
   branches, the Basij enrols and organizes the Iranian population in three
   different levels. In this paper, the reasons why the Basij became
   engaged in controlling Iran's population are discussed. In addition, the
   structure of the organization and the methods it uses to control the
   population are explained. Finally, the social and political impacts of
   the organization's efforts are explored.},

Title = {THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVES ON APPROACHES TO POLICY EVALUATION IN THE EU:
   THE CASE OF COHESION POLICY},
Journal = {PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {90},
Number = {3},
Pages = {699-715},
Abstract = {Cohesion Policy accounts for the largest area of expenditure in the EU
   budget. Because of its scope and redistributive nature, evaluation is
   particularly important. Policy analysis tends to overlook the evaluation
   stage. Few empirical studies seek to apply theory to EU policy
   evaluation. This article questions the relevance and usefulness of
   theorizing evaluation practice, exploring positivist, realist, and
   constructivist perspectives upon approaches to evaluating Structural
   Funds Programmes. It illustrates how political science theories can
   provide scholars with useful insights into the way EU policy evaluation
   is carried out. It develops a toolkit for analyzing real-world
   approaches to evaluation and then applies it to three separate Cohesion
   Policy programmes. The analysis shows how, from a theoretical
   perspective and contrary to the mixed methods rhetoric of the European
   Commission positivism remains the dominant approach when evaluating the
   Structural Funds and considers why this is so, identifying the ability
   to demonstrate efficiency and effectiveness, cost, influence, and
   evaluation culture as key characteristics.},

Abstract = {The article provides a theoretical overview and empirical summary of the
   contributions to this collection. The collection makes four
   contributions to the literature on comparative capitalism. First, its
   analysis of institutional change adopts a long-term historical
   perspective that allows us to observe the potentially transformative
   effects of relatively slow and incremental changes. Second, it examines
   the linkages between four levels of institutions that regulate the
   economy - the international, macro (national), meso and micro. Third,
   the national case studies compare change and linkages across six core
   institutional domains. And fourth, the cases show how institutions are
   shaped by different sets of socio-political compromises.},

Abstract = {EU member states desiring deeper integration often call for a multispeed
   approach to pursue ambitious projects without the hinderance of
   laggards. At other times, laggards have desired a multispeed approach to
   avoid policies they find objectionable. Under what circumstances do
   laggards (integrationists) propose (object) to a multispeed Europe? We
   investigate the institutions and member state preferences that lead
   these camps to accept or resist multispeed proposals, paying particular
   attention to how a multispeed approach affects member state bargaining
   power. We present a series of case studies to demonstrate that the
   preference configurations we examine do, in fact, lead states to pursue
   the policies with regard to a multispeed Europe that we expect.},

Title = {What Are Policy Punctuations? Large Changes in the Legislative Agenda of
   the UK Government, 1911-2008},
Journal = {POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {40},
Number = {1},
Pages = {89-107},
Abstract = {In this article, we argue that policy punctuations differ from each
   other in ways that reflect distinct types of political change. We
   identify three main kinds. The first are procedural changes that have
   unique unrelated policies within the same issue area. Within the
   remaining large policy changes, high-salience punctuations are
   associated with increased attention in the media, whereas low-salience
   punctuations do not attract such scrutiny. The analysis applies the
   typology to data from the UK Policy Agendas Project, identifying
   punctuations from the content of Acts of the UK Parliament between 1911
   and 2008. Using evidence from the historical record and the data series,
   the analysis places each observation within the typology. We claim that
   the typology has a more general application and could be replicated in
   other jurisdictions and time periods. We conclude that attention to the
   historical record and qualitative studies of punctuations can complement
   and inform the analysis of aggregate data series.},

Title = {`Free us up so we can be responsible!' The co-evolution of Corporate
   Social Responsibility and neo-liberalism in the UK, 1977-2010},

Abstract = {This article challenges the notion that Corporate Social Responsibility
   (CSR) is incompatible with neo-liberalism. It argues that CSR is not a
   countervailing force that follows neo-liberal market exposure. Instead
   of re-embedding global liberalism, CSR complements liberalization and
   substitutes for institutionalized social solidarity. Evidence from the
   UK, one of the world's leading jurisdictions for responsible business,
   supports these claims. In Britain during the past 30 years,
   neo-liberalism and CSR have co-evolved. CSR has been a quid pro quo for
   lighter regulation; it has compensated for some of the social
   dislocations that result from unfettering markets, thereby legitimating
   business during the `unleashing' of capitalism, and it appeals to moral
   sensibilities, justifying and legitimating business leaders in a way
   that instrumental rationality alone cannot. The paper draws on original
   sources to shed light on the origins and growth of Business in the
   Community, one of the world's leading business-led CSR coalitions, since
   the 1970s.},

Abstract = {Most work studying micro-processes of integration - i.e., how agents
   develop identities and decision-making behaviours within a particular
   institution - offers explanations based on either instrumental
   rationality or socialization. This article proposes a two-dimensional
   framework that allows analysing under which conditions both logics of
   social action co-exist. Our empirical analysis employs a unique dataset
   from a 2011 survey of all 1,098 currently active Seconded National
   Experts (SNEs) in the European Commission. We find that (1) instrumental
   cost-benefit calculation and cognitive role-playing (as semi-reflexive
   socialization) often simultaneously influence SNEs' (perceptions of
   their) behaviour, and (2) this joint presence of both logics of social
   action depends on certain scope conditions (i.e., SNEs' education,
   length of prior embeddedness and noviceness).},

Abstract = {This chapter investigates how the democratic divide has been established
   due to socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, by analyzing the
   data from the Pew Research Center's survey conducted during the campaign
   season of the 2008 U.S. presidential election. The study compares five
   different types of online political activity: communication,
   mobilization, information consumption, information production, and
   involvement in social networking websites. Sociodemographic
   characteristics such as age, gender, race, education, and income
   determine the degree of online political involvement. The conventional
   notion that better-educated and more affluent citizens actively

Journal = {POLICY STUDIES},

Volume = {33},
Number = {5},
Pages = {419-438},
Abstract = {Policy makers in many countries have long insisted that skills are
   critical to economic performance and social cohesion/inclusion. However,
   it is increasingly recognised that if skills are to fully deliver on
   this agenda, they have to be used effectively inside the workplace.
   While such statements can now be observed in the skills strategies of
   England, Scotland and Wales, much less is understood about how to design
   effective interventions in this new and challenging area of policy. Of
   particular interest then are the 12 `action research' projects currently
   being funded by the Scottish Funding Council, which are aimed at testing
   the role that universities and colleges might potentially play in
   improving skills utilisation. Drawing upon interviews with project
   managers, employers and employees involved in three of the projects as
   well as with key Scottish policy makers, the article examines progress
   to date. It finds some initial evidence for establishing proof of
   concept and highlights challenges in terms of capacity building and
   sustainability. Drawing parallels with Scandinavian workplace
   development programmes, the article argues that the programme can
   potentially contribute to a broader approach to business improvement and
   innovation policy in Scotland, with universities and colleges more
   closely engaged as a key strategic partner.},

Abstract = {Nation-states and security planners continue to place a high emphasis on
   threat convergence, such as that which emanates from the links between
   transnational organized crime and international terrorism. The social
   and behavioral sciences are not silent on this topic. This article
   frames the existing literature on crime-terror interaction to
   demonstrate that threat convergence is more complex than policy-makers
   and practitioners often realize. With terror and crime groups evolving
   to resemble one another, convergence is undermining the conventional
   wisdom that limited crime-terror interaction to short-term relationships
   due to divergent motives. The contemporary threat environment is
   promoting longer-term cooperation between organized crime and terrorism,
   in some cases resulting in hybrid organizations that merge elements of
   both. This article concludes by giving suggestions for future
   multidisciplinary research in this field as well as supporting the
   formation of new strategies to combat threat convergence.},

Abstract = {American policy-makers are predisposed towards the idea of a necessary
   war of survival, fought with little room for choice. This reflects a
   dominant memory of World War II that teaches Americans that they live in
   a dangerously small world that imposes conflict. Critics argue that the
   `choice versus necessity' schema is ahistorical and mischievous. This
   article offers supporting fire to those critiques. America's war against
   the Axis (1941-45) is a crucial case through which to test the `small
   world' view. Arguments for war in 1941 pose overblown scenarios of the
   rise of a Eurasian super-threat. In 1941 conflict was discretionary and
   not strictly necessary in the interests of national security. The
   argument for intervention is a closer call that often assumed. This has
   implications for America's choices today.},

Abstract = {`Local ownership' and `participation' have become buzzwords for
   international intervention, whether military, humanitarian or
   developmental, by the UN, World Bank, agencies or non-governmental
   organizations. This has been partly to avoid accusations of intrusion
   and to enhance its legitimacy. Yet, such strategies have often not
   promoted local ownership in any meaningful way. Rather, they have denied
   it, confused which (local), and obscured the wider range of meanings of
   the concept. Internationals claim that they are referring to `national'
   rather than local ownership because their focus is on a viable state
   that should become a member of the international community while also
   providing rights to its citizens. Despite good intentions such
   understandings of ownership do little to enhance a contextual social
   contract even if they do create relationships of conditionality between
   national elites and international donors, though they may indirectly
   enable the voices of a range of local actors, as this article outlines.},

Title = {Supranational governance as economic patriotism? The European Union,
   legitimacy and the reconstruction of state space},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {19},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {324-341},
Abstract = {`Economic patriotism' (EP) and `European integration' might normally be
   regarded as antonyms. The argument is made for reading some actions and
   discourses of the EU in terms of EP. Two assumptions are relaxed: that
   EP is an exclusive property of nation-state space and that is
   necessarily associated with the suspension of economic liberalism. By
   relaxing the first, the article shows how many aspects of EU discourse
   and practice can be thought of as EP-like. The institutionalized
   economic liberal biases of the EU tend to constrain the possibilities
   for supranational EP in its two principal guises, labelled here as `
   Schmittian' and `Listian'. The relaxation of the second assumption
   allows for a third variant of EP to be introduced: `market-making' EP.
   This is shown to be a particular feature of Commission discourse since
   the mid-1980s. The move to market-making EP discourse demonstrates the
   particular quality of legitimacy dilemmas faced by the EU.},

Pages = {613-637},
Abstract = {If all violence is intended to achieve political effects, what is
   distinctive about escalation in irregular war? Indeed, what is irregular
   war? To answer such fundamental questions this analysis employs the
   principles of strategic theory in an attempt to offer a theoretical and
   practical framework that will facilitate an appreciation of the
   subsequent contributions to this special issue. The assessment seeks to
   articulate how the escalation process in conditions of so-called
   irregular war might be conceptualized and, via examples, illustrate how
   certain broad observations may be held to be true. Ultimately, though,
   the argument emphasizes that the process of escalation cannot be
   distinctive or follow predictable patterns given that all wars are
   unique to their time and place and will be affected in their conduct by
   the contingent forces of passion, chance and reason.},

Abstract = {This article presents the key findings of an evaluation of a mentoring
   scheme being implemented for individuals deemed vulnerable to violent
   extremism in the West Midlands region in the United Kingdom. The key
   findings of this study are, firstly, that mentoring around violent
   extremism carries distinctive features, and can be distinguished from
   mentoring in other areas of criminal behavior or in drug/alcohol use.
   Secondly, there is ongoing debate around what the purposes of mentoring
   are; crystallizing around the key question of whether mentoring in the
   area of violent extremism is about changing beliefs or changing
   behavior, or both; therefore, how to measure success? The article
   examines the different theoretical fields in relation to
   de-radicalization, disengagement, desistance, and debiasing in order to
   situate the article's findings in a broader body of work. This article
   also links individual mentoring to the notion of community, for it is
   important to consider the individual who is being mentored in relation
   to the broader set of communities that they belong to or associate with.
   Here, it is stressed that in the United Kingdom there are significant
   tensions between approaches that emphasize community cohesion, and those
   that emphasze liberal freedoms associated with liberal democracy,
   particularly in relation to Al Qaeda-linked extremism.},

Abstract = {Jihadist terrorism has discovered in the Internet a valuable instrument
   to strengthen its activities. However, in using this technology the
   terrorists are exposed to new vulnerabilities. The Internet plays a

   new opportunity to weaken terrorist groups. The present article examines
   the main vulnerabilities of radical groups who have accorded the
   Internet a central role in their strategy, namely, less anonymity and
   security, a loss of content visibility, a major credibility problem, and
   an undermining of the legitimacy of the terrorist discourse as a
   consequence of their use of Web 2.0.},

Year = {2012},
Volume = {35},
Number = {11},
Pages = {760-778},
Abstract = {In law freedom from torture and ill-treatment is ``absolute,{''} meaning
   that a state cannot infringe the right for purposes that would seem
   legitimate such as the protection of national security. However, with
   the growth in international terrorism, particularly suicide violence,
   should the freedom remain without limitation? This article considers
   legitimizing torture by reference to the ``positive{''} legal obligation
   the right imposes on states to prevent harm to individuals by third
   parties such as terrorists. Assuming such a legal argument could be made
   out, it is questioned whether adopting such measures of interrogation
   would in fact outweigh the negative consequences that would inevitably
   follow from reversing accepted international standards for the
   protection of, say, detainees from ill-treatment in state custody.},

Journal = {COMMONWEALTH \& COMPARATIVE POLITICS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {50},
Number = {1},
Pages = {53-74},
Abstract = {Kenya and Malaysia embarked on quite similar development trajectories in
   the 1960s, but economic growth figures started to diverge widely in the
   1980s and 1990s. Governance issues are often suggested as the major
   binding constraint in the Kenyan development trajectory whereas Malaysia
   scores well on governance indicators; but similar governance problems to
   those in Kenya can be found in Malaysia. However, Malaysia has the
   resources to overcome these, whereas access to finance appears to be a
   binding constraint in Kenya. Essential in the Malaysian development
   trajectory appear to be islands of efficiency that are relatively
   isolated from rent-seeking, notably the oil company Petronas. The paper
   therefore contributes to the debate on the role of institutions in the
   literature on the resource curse.},

Volume = {17},

Pages = {195-216},
Abstract = {An apparent case of Greek exceptionalism, the 2010 local government
   election, held six months after the European Union (EU)/International
   Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout in the context of an explicit
   prime-ministerial pledge to call general elections if the outcome was
   deemed unsatisfactory, did not lead to the downfall of the incumbent
   government. Instead the socialists remained first party. Investigating
   this puzzle, the article examines how party strategies were shaped by
   the dynamics of a two-round contest fought at the sub-national level and
   shows that the split around the EU/IMF Memorandum of Understanding did
   not emerge as a new political cleavage. Assessing the results, it
   concludes that the main electoral verdict did not concern the future of
   the bailout but the legitimacy of the political system, which was in a
   state of deepening crisis.},

Abstract = {This chapter presents a flexible framework for measuring efficiency,
   effectiveness, and citizen satisfaction with public sector websites. The
   framework uses research methods that measure the extent to which online
   information advances organizational objectives, reaches its target
   audience, and meets users' expectations for service and quality. By
   gathering and reporting on this information, public sector web-site
   performance can be continuously improved. The framework is presented in
   a format that facilitates its evaluation. The design, implementation,
   and use of the performance measurement framework are described in detail
   by presenting logic models that describe possible activities and
   expected outcomes of each phase.},

Abstract = {Since its creation in 1974 the European Council has turned into the key
   institution in the institutional architecture of the EU polity. The
   Maastricht Treaty on the European Union was a history-making product of
   this body of heads of state or government. For the institutional
   evolution of the European Council itself the Maastricht Treaty confirmed
   and reinforced trends starting with the Hague summit in 1969. This
   article covers the pre-history of the European Council as well as the
   road from the birth of the European Council in Paris, 1974, to the
   Maastricht Treaty and the next steps via two treaty revisions and the
   constitutional convention to the Lisbon Treaty in 2009. This article
   will not only try to satisfy some historical curiosity, but point out
   fundamental factors, explaining why Union executive leaders have
   invested time and energy in the labour-intensive and partly frustrating
   exercise of the making and working of their club: this key institution
   helped them to emerge as powerful multi-level players in a
   multi-institutional architecture.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {34},
Number = {6},
Pages = {623-641},
Abstract = {Prior to the outbreak of the current global economic and financial
   crisis, the sheer number and volume of mergers and acquisitions set
   historically unprecedented records. A vast share of these transactions
   were undertaken by short-term oriented financial market actors,
   including private equity houses, hedge funds and other institutional
   investors. The article explains the adoption and ensuing adaptations of
   the supranational merger control at the level of the European Union (EU)
   on the basis of a critical political economy perspective. It argues that
   ever since its inception, EU merger control regulation primarily served
   to facilitate economic concentration, which was reinforced by a
   permissive stance of the European Commission. Alongside processes of
   financialisation and increased corporate reliance on financial market
   capitalisation, EU merger control underwent a substantive reform and
   additional adaptations, which in important ways sustained financial
   sector induced mergers.},

Abstract = {Given the increasing importance of eHealth as an integral part of

   regarding the introduction of the German electronic health card (eHC). A
   brief introduction highlights the relevance of the subject and the
   differing acceptance rates of patients and service providers, i.e.
   physicians. Based on both the technology acceptance model and the
   relevant literature, important factors influencing the attitude towards
   and the potential use of the eHC are conceptualized and integrated in a
   research model. The empirical examination was conducted throughout
   Germany through an online survey of physicians. Overall, 502 responses
   were collected and included in the analysis, which was carried out with
   structural equation modelling using EQS. The empirical results show that
   the relevant determinants of the acceptance of the eHC in Germany, such
   as efficiency and usability of the system and the costbenefit ratio,
   were properly identified.},

Abstract = {Communication links are a key dimension for implementation of European
   Union (EU) policies in non-member states because EU influence abroad is
   otherwise severely hindered. Exploring project implementation of
   external migration policy in Morocco and Ukraine highlights the role of
   the United Nations High Commission for Refugees and particularly the
   International Organization for Migration for bridging and exploiting
   communication gaps between administrations in Brussels and `the field'.
   Linking the Europeanization literature with insights on implementation,
   organizational sociology and social networks raises attention to the
   `grapevine' of interorganizational communication structures that
   mediates EU influence and reveals manifold actor influence in
   Europeanization processes and on policy output beyond EU control.},

Journal = {GLOBAL POLICY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {3},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {87-95},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {One cannot begin to understand EU foreign policy without taking identity
   politics into account. First, the differential Europeanization of
   national identities explains to a large degree why the current European
   Security and Defense Policy (ESDP) has not been supranationalized.
   Second, the gap between the EU's grandiose rhetoric of being a force for
   good' in the world and its inability to put this foreign policy identity
   at work into practice, largely results from the fact that the EU's
   construction of a distinct foreign policy identity is inward rather than
   outward-oriented. Last, but not least, the EU enlargement discourse,
   particularly about Turkey, has as much to do with contested
   self-descriptions of the EU and what follows for its boundaries than
   with any security or economic considerations. The article starts with
   conceptual remarks on collective identity, followed by three case
   studies focusing on the lack of supranationalization of the ESDP, the
   EU's foreign policy construction as a civilian power, and the
   enlargement discourse, particularly with regard to Turkey. I conclude
   with some policy recommendations. Policy Implications center dot A
   coalition of the willing' should move ahead towards permanent structured
   cooperation in foreign and defense matters, irrespective of British
   objections. center dot The more the EU pursues a coherent foreign policy
   with one voice, the more it will recognize that its foreign policy
   identity and its vision for the world' need to be adjusted. center dot
   It is more important for European identity creation to pursue a coherent
   foreign policy than to embark on an identity discourse that cannot be
   put in practice. center dot We need more rather than less public
   controversies about the boundaries of the EU and how these borders
   reflect European identity.},

Title = {The dynamics of terror during the Peruvian civil war},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {49},
Number = {6},
Pages = {847-862},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The international community has a declared intention to protect
   civilians from deliberate violence in civil conflicts. The optimal type
   of foreign intervention and its optimal timing are likely to depend on
   the combat strategies of the belligerents. Weak belligerents unable to
   provide economic incentives and security guarantees to civilians often
   follow a strategy of intimidation and terror. In this case, foreign
   financial support for one side could affect the strategies of both sides
   in several different ways, and the interaction between the two sides'
   strategies could magnify the resulting impact on civilian casualties.
   Using a new monthly time-series dataset, we explore the factors
   associated with variations in the intensity of civilian abuse by
   participants in the guerrilla war in Peru during the 1980s and 1990s. We
   show that an increase in civilian abuse by one side was strongly
   associated with subsequent increases in abuse by the other. In this type
   of war, foreign intervention could substantially reduce the impact on
   civilians of a sudden rise in conflict intensity, by moderating the
   resulting `cycle of violence'. In practice, foreign interventions had a
   mixed record in Peru: financial support for the Peruvian military raised
   the level of violence against civilians, but counter-narcotics aid and
   development aid reduced it. These effects are consistent with a model in
   which different types of intervention have different effects on
   belligerents' resource capacity and on the opportunity cost of fighting.},

Abstract = {Economic globalization has created the possibility that human rights can
   be infringed abroad. The WTO, an engine of economic globalization, has
   remained surprisingly immune from human rights-related complaints. I
   argue that its non-violation or situation complaint, by invoking
   impediments to the attainment of treaty objectives, could provide for
   redress when WTO members interfere with the right to an adequate
   standard of living and the continuous improvement of living conditions
   abroad through trade in goods. The non-violation and situation
   complaints reflect the shared but differentiated responsibility of WTO
   members for the human right to an adequate standard of living.},

Abstract = {Although decentralization and devolution in some ways increase state
   governments' discretion, they in other ways may limit that discretion.
   The current study tests the thesis that, at least in the early 2000s,
   discretion declined in some states' substance abuse service systems;
   states experiencing a financial shortfall came to adopt the federal
   government's service priorities. These states largely acted because of
   the institutional dominance of the federal government. The thesis is
   supported by analyses of two waves of data from a nationally
   representative sample of providers of outpatient substance abuse
   services. The study considers several uses of the findings:
   supplementing the perspective that argues that states lose discretion
   due to decentralization and devolution-induced economic disincentives,
   understanding the diffusion of federal policies relating to the
   Temporary Assistance to Needy Family program, generally suggesting some
   limits to state discretion, and thus helping to reconceptualize the
   benefits and costs of decentralization and devolution.},

Abstract = {The growth of multinational corporations (MNCs) is often taken as a
   quintessential indicator of oglobalization'. But recent detailed
   empirical analysis has challenged the idea that most MNCs are global in
   terms of their business strategy and arena of operations. This article
   first clarifies the differences between globalization,
   internationalization and supranational-regionalization by examining the
   evidence on trade and investment patterns for Denmark. In particular, it
   presents a detailed analysis of the business strategies of the large
   corporate sector in Denmark. Denmark is an interesting case, as it is a
   small open economy (SOE) that might be thought to be one uniquely
   vulnerable to the forces of globalization. Up until now examination of
   MNCs internationalization strategies has concentrated upon large
   economies. We provide evidence for a SOE. In addition, we expand the
   range of dimensions used to consider internationalization beyond the
   location of turnover (sales) to include measures of company assets,
   employment and physical investment. Furthermore, in the light of the
   analysis of this company sector, we explore the public policy
   implications of our results for the future of SOEs in a rapidly changing
   international business environment.},

Abstract = {Previous research has shown that foreign policy crises can cause a
   `rally `round the flag' effect, boosting citizens' approval of their
   leaders. While scholars agree on the effect's existence, its magnitude
   and nature are less readily apparent. This article considers two factors
   that have been neglected in previous studies: the context in which a
   conflict occurs and the public's level of trust in government. The
   theory presented here suggests that trust is not only an effect of a
   rally, but mediates the magnitude of the rally. It also proposes that
   the nature of the rally will be unaffected by whether the state is
   provoked by its opponent prior to crisis initiation. The resulting
   hypotheses are tested using aggregate US public opinion data around
   international crises, as well as individual-level data from the 1990-92
   ANES panel regarding the Persian Gulf War. The analysis indicates that
   trust in government has a major influence on the size of a rally effect,
   especially at the individual level. However, trust matters more for
   those in the opposition than for those who have supported the government
   in the past. These results suggest implications for understanding public
   attitudes toward foreign policy and for the diversionary theory of war.},

   creation, focusing on the normative and political debates that made
   creating an ASEAN human rights mechanism a long and challenging process.

Title = {Does Generalized (Dis)Trust Travel? Examining the Impact of Cultural
   Heritage and Destination-Country Environment on Trust of Immigrants},
Journal = {POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {33},
Number = {4},
Pages = {495-511},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {At least two contrasting perspectives on the roots of generalized trust
   exist: The cultural perspective emphasizing how trust is a stable trait
   passed on from one generation to the next through parental
   socialization, and the experiential perspective, which stresses that
   trust is subject to change with what we experience in the environment in
   which we live. Analyzing trust of immigrants is an effective way to
   contrast the two perspectives, as the cultural perspective predicts that
   immigrants' level of trust will continue to reflect the level of trust
   of their home country, whereas the experiential perspective predicts
   that trust of immigrants will change according to the environment of the
   destination country. This article examines how first-generation
   immigrants from three low-trust countries of origin (Turkey, Poland, and
   Italy) are affected by migrating to high-trust countries in Northern
   Europe, which hold qualities conducive to trust. In contrast to earlier
   studies examining trust of immigrants, I build on one data set
   containing data on both migrants and nonmigrants from the same country
   of origin as well as on a wide range of relevant covariates of trust.
   Using the method of matching, the results of the analysis lend most
   support to the experiential perspective on trust as the
   destination-country context has a massive impact on trust of immigrants,
   who display significantly higher levels of trust than comparable
   respondents in their country of origin. The results are robust to
   limiting the destination-country context to only one country (Germany)
   and comparing migrants and nonmigrants responding in the same language.},

Abstract = {In this article we analyze an important development of policymaking in
   the European Union (EU) on the Roma, which has evolved in the context of
   the EU's growing concern for human rights and Roma inclusion. The human
   rights focused approach on Roma was initially used by the European Union
   in the context of the EU's enlargement process; since 2007, it has
   informed the EU's internal policies on Roma. In addition, since 2007 the
   EU has made use of more broadly defined strategies of fostering social
   inclusion. Against the backdrop of a case study in the Czech Republic,
   the article explores the possible impact in the field and suggests some
   critical ways forward.},

Volume = {25},

Abstract = {This article explores how patterns of information supply on policy
   problems influence political attention. It advances two central claims.
   First, different policy areas are associated with distinct practices in
   monitoring policy problems: Some produce abundant, ongoing, and reliable
   information, while others yield scarce, sporadic, and/or unreliable
   data. Second, these variations in information supply are likely to
   influence political attention, with information-rich areas associated
   with a more proportionate distribution of attention, and
   information-poor areas yielding punctuated attention. The article tests
   these claims through comparing U.K. political attention to asylum and
   illegal immigration. Asylum is observed on an ongoing basis through
   bureaucratic data, court hearings, and lay observations, producing more
   constant and proportiate political attention. Illegal immigration is
   observed sporadically through focusing events, usually police
   operations, eliciting more punctuated attention. These insights about
   political attention may also help explain why policy responses may be
   punctuated or incremental.},

Title = {The roles states play: a Meadian interactionist approach},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AND DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Pages = {370-392},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Constructivist scholars have largely limited their view of how state
   action is socially constructed to the concepts of norms and identity. As
   for individuals, however, role-playing is also a core aspect of state
   activity. I demonstrate the potential of this concept for
   constructivists on the basis of a reconsideration of the roles states
   play in international politics drawing on symbolic interactionism and in
   particular the thought of G.H. Mead. From a Meadian perspective, roles
   are sets of appropriate behaviours, not bundles of fixed duties; they
   emerge in interaction and give the actor a sense of its structure and
   the scope of possible action. Roles are thus the necessary social
   vehicle for action in its meaning-creating, identity-affirming sense.
   Using the illustration of the Suez Crisis of 1956, I develop a `Meadian
   interactionist' conceptual approach that builds on previous attempts to
   harness the potential of the role concept in International Relations
   (IR) and sharpens constructivist understandings of the links between
   role, identity, norms, and action in IR. Journal of International
   Relations and Development (2012) 15, 370-392. doi:10.1057/jird.2011.26;

Abstract = {`Normative Power Europe', a concept introduced by Ian Manners in 2002 in
   order to describe the international identity of the European Union (EU),
   remains a lasting point of reference for academic as well as political
   debates. However, many contributions to this discussion tend to
   essentialise notions of a collective identity where normative
   self-depictions are uncritically used as an explanation for the EU's
   external actions. The main challenge, thus, is to reconstruct how a self
   is invented in the conduct of foreign and security policies as a
   discourse of locating others and articulating insecurities. These
   discursive processes, I will argue, are highly productive of
   hierarchical relations and justification narratives overlooked by most
   research on the EU's security and defence policies. The results of a
   reconstruction of EU discourse on the European Security and Defence
   Policy missions in the Democratic Republic of Congo lead to the
   preliminary conclusion that the EU might increasingly be imagined as a
   `civilising power', partly re-activating its imperial legacies of the
   19th century. Journal of International Relations and Development (2012)

Abstract = {It is a vast understatement to say that the problem of access to
   medicines in developing countries is complex. Access is limited by a
   range of factors including inability to pay, a lack of infrastructure,
   and corruption in some countries. Surrounding and exacerbating these
   structural and technological problems is the layer of legal rights
   created by patents and their licensing that complicate and render more
   expensive the preparation and delivery of needed medicines, particularly
   those that need to be adapted to the social, health and cultural
   environment of developing countries. This article provides a survey of
   innovative strategies that aim at maximizing the potential of patents to
   facilitate the development and delivery of medicines against diseases,
   the burden of which falls principally on developing country populations.
   To understand the context in which these strategies are being proposed
   and implemented, the article reviews the battles over access to
   medicines beginning in the late 1980s. It then surveys some of the
   principal suggestions put forward to better direct innovation systems in
   addressing the critical health needs of the world's majority including
   advance market commitments, patent buy-outs, prize funds, public-private
   partnerships and patent pools.},

Title = {Personality and Legislative Politics: The Big Five Trait Dimensions
   Among US State Legislators},
Journal = {POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {33},
Number = {2},
Pages = {195-210},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The impact of personality traits on people's attitudes and behaviors is
   widely recognized, yet systematic attention to personality in large-N
   research on elected officials has been rare. Among psychologists,
   five-factor frameworks that focus on openness to experience,
   conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and emotional stability
   have gained tremendous prominence in the past two decades. Applications
   of these frameworks to the study of mass political behavior have been
   highly fruitful, but corresponding applications in the study of
   legislators have been rare. In an effort to assess the utility of a Big
   Five approach in the study of legislative politics, this article
   addresses three questions: whether elected officials will be willing to
   provide personality self-assessments, whether any data they do provide
   will exhibit meaningful variance, and whether the Big Five trait
   dimensions will correspond with patterns in respondents' attitudes and
   behaviors. These questions are addressed using data from members of the
   state legislatures in Arizona, Connecticut, and Maine. Results provide
   considerable grounds for optimism regarding the likely utility of more
   extensive applications of the Big Five in research on elected officials.},

Abstract = {In this article, the authors bring together research on horizontal
   inequality, geographic dispersion of ethnic groups and crosscutting
   cleavages to present a more holistic theory of ethnic structure and
   civil war onset. The authors argue that rebel leaders are thwarted in
   their mobilization efforts in highly crosscutting societies due to a
   lower probability of potential combatants identifying with nationalist
   goals, decreased ability to exert social control, and diminished
   in-group communication. Using cross-national data from over 100
   countries, the authors provide evidence that civil war onset is an
   average of nearly twelve times less probable in societies where
   ethnicity is crosscut by socioeconomic class, geographic region, and
   religion.},

Abstract = {This study tested the effects of multiple ideologies on support for
   restrictive policies against gay and lesbian individuals and
   organizations and if these effects were mediated by sexual prejudice.
   Social dominance orientation (SDO), conservatism, and right-wing
   authoritarianism (RWA) each had significant direct and indirect effects.
   SDO had the most consistent direct effects in addition to its effects
   through sexual prejudice. The direct effects of conservatism were
   smaller and similar in size to its indirect effects through prejudice.
   Although the direct effect of RWA was significant for policy attitudes,
   its effect was entirely mediated through sexual prejudice for
   organization opposition. Results suggest that high-RWA individuals adopt
   their positions largely because of prejudice toward sexual minorities,
   while high-SDO individuals adopt their positions partly out of prejudice
   and partly because these positions perpetuate hierarchies between
   heterosexuals and sexual minorities. Results also diminish the
   principled conservatism argument that conservative positions on these
   policies and organizations are absent of prejudice. As policies continue
   to be enacted that affect the sexual minority community, research is
   needed to identify the underlying motivations for individuals' positions
   toward these policies.},

   Impact on Business Environments in Contemporary Africa},
Journal = {BUSINESS AND POLITICS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Formal institutions such as business chambers have been assumed to be a
   key indicator of the health of state-business relations (SBR). Yet in
   Africa these organizations have seldom risen to the level of access and
   influence enjoyed by some of their counterparts elsewhere in the
   developing world. A number of recent studies of SBR in Africa continue
   to overstate the importance of business associations (BAs). Yet despite
   the widespread marginality of BAs in Africa, the receptiveness of
   African states to leading firms and business interests has increased
   markedly. While this poses certain risks of increased corruption,
   collusion and monopoly, the institutional and political environment for
   doing business has also improved, thereby fostering new opportunities
   for further business-related growth and business sector development
   among bona fide firms. Drawing on evidence from Zambia and elsewhere,
   this paper finds that the benefits provided to individual firms who
   enjoy state access can, paradoxically, contribute to an improved
   environment for other private sector actors whose interests are directly
   represented only in moribund formal associations. Even without strong
   BAs, when aided by the state, individual firms, and/or international
   actors, Africa's improved business environment has a salutary impact on
   growth.},

Abstract = {This paper presents the motives that pushed the Chinese leaders to build
   the Great Firewall and the political functions attached to it. The paper
   argues that the immaterial wall is a way to preserve an authoritarian
   regime with little legitimacy because mainly based on fast economic
   growth. From this perspective, the purpose of the Great Firewall is not
   to ban access to Internet but to prevent certain western ideas to
   spread, so perceived as threatening the regime's stability.},

Title = {Comparing Caveats: Understanding the Sources of National Restrictions

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},

Volume = {56},

Abstract = {The North Atlantic Treaty Organization is the most robust and deeply
   institutionalized alliance in the modern world, yet it has faced
   significant problems in running the International Security Assistance
   Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan. Specifically, the coalition effort has been
   plagued by caveats: restrictions on what coalition militaries can and
   cannot do. Caveats have diminished the alliances overall effectiveness
   and created resentment within the coalition. In this article, we explain
   why ISAF countries have employed a variety of caveats in Afghanistan,
   focusing on the period from 2003 to 2009. Caveats vary predictably
   according to the political institutions in each contributor to ISAF.
   Troops from coalition governments are likely to have caveats. Troops
   from presidential or majoritarian parliamentary governments tend, on
   average, to have fewer caveats, but specific caveats depend on the
   background of key decision makers in those countries. To demonstrate
   these points, we first review key limitations facing military
   contingents in Afghanistan. We then compare the experiences of Canada,
   France, and Germany and find that our institutional model does a better
   job of explaining the observed behavior than do competing explanations
   focusing on public opinion, threat, or strategic culture. We conclude
   with implications for both research and North Atlantic Treaty
   Organizations future.},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This article extends the Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP) by
   presenting new global data on non-state conflict, or armed conflict
   between two groups, neither of which is the state. The dataset includes
   conflicts between rebel groups and other organized militias, and thus
   serves as a complement to existing datasets on armed conflict which have
   either ignored this kind of violence or aggregated it into civil war.
   The dataset also includes cases of fighting between supporters of
   different political parties as well as cases of communal conflict, that
   is, conflict between two social groups, usually identified along ethnic
   or religious lines. This thus extends UCDP's conflict data collection to
   facilitate the study of topics like rebel fractionalization,
   paramilitary involvement in conflict violence, and communal or ethnic
   conflict. In the article, we present a background to the data collection
   and provide descriptive statistics for the period 1989-2008 and then
   illustrate how the data can be used with the case of Somalia. These data
   move beyond state-centric conceptions of collective violence to
   facilitate research into the causes and consequences of group violence
   which occurs without state participation.},

Abstract = {This article suggests that a common feature among democratic innovations
   is the lack of an agenda setting function. First, it argues that a lack
   of control over their own agendas opens democratic innovations to
   manipulation by elites. Second, it argues that democratic innovations
   focused on setting the policy agendas of public authorities can serve to
   democratise the policy process by providing citizens with a tool to
   place issues on the public agenda. The article analyses a series of
   actual and potential institutional designs that divert from the dominant
   direct-democratic nature of agenda setting innovations. It finishes with
   a discussion of the UK Sustainable Communities Act (2007), a process
   designed to allow communities to propose policy to government through
   their councils.},

Title = {The Working of EU Conditionality in the Area of Migration Policy The
   Case of Readmission of Irregular Migrants to Albania},
Journal = {EAST EUROPEAN POLITICS AND SOCIETIES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {26},
Number = {1},
Pages = {115-134},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This article uses the analytical framework of ``Europeanization{''} to
   assess whether and how EU conditionality has led to change in Albania's
   migration policy. The analysis focuses on a specific but crucial aspect
   of migration policy: the readmission of irregular migrants. The
   examination of change in Albanian readmission policy demonstrates that
   the country has not only accepted the legal obligation to take back its
   citizens residing illegally in the EU and nationals of other countries
   who had reached the EU via Albania. It has also created the
   institutional and procedural conditions for implementation of those
   legal obligations, and statistical data demonstrate that Albania is
   accepting all the illegal immigrants returned by the EU member states.
   The article shows that this policy change took place after the EU made
   Albania's progress towards accession conditional on compliance in this
   policy area. In addition to establishing the temporal covariation of EU
   pressure and domestic change, this work will explore the causal
   mechanism linking the two variables by examining the motivation of the
   actors involved in policy change. Thus, the analysis will identify the
   domestic factors that make possible the EU impact. This article
   demonstrates the crucial importance of gate-keeping in ensuring
   compliance. The control by the EU of access to each stage of the
   preaccession process is such a powerful motivating instrument that it
   can outweigh very high domestic costs and lead to developments in the
   aspirant country that are solely in the interest of the EU.},

Journal = {GLOBAL POLICY},

Volume = {3},

Pages = {85-93},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This article suggests that if the humanitarian goals of armed
   interventions are decoupled from coerced regime change and nation
   building, they can be carried out effectively and at rather low costs.
   In addition, the standard for justifying a humanitarian intervention
   must be set at a high level (to be specified below). We shall see that
   this high level is justified by strong normative reasons and not merely
   prudential ones. The thesis for narrowly crafted armed humanitarian
   interventions is supported in the following pages by showing that a
   mixture of idealism and hubris drives the West to assume that it can
   achieve much more, and that its repeated failure to accomplish these
   expansive goals is leading to calls to avoid armed humanitarian
   interventions-including those missions whose normative standing is
   strong and which can be carried out effectively. The observation that
   nations can employ non lethal (normative and economic) means to promote
   human rights and democracy further supports the thesis that the use of
   force should be reserved to large scale saving of life and not to be
   allowed to morph into coerced regime change, not to mention futile
   attempts at nation building.},

Abstract = {This article reviews developments in Scottish local government
   post-devolution. In doing so it outlines some expectations, assumptions
   and realities about local government in Scotland. Three assumptions are
   examined and rejected: 1999 was Year Zero for Scottish local government;
   centrallocal relations are characterised by a cohesive centre versus a
   cohesive locality; centrallocal relations in Scotland are nothing more
   than a fuzzy microcosm of centrallocal relations in England. The article
   argues that Scotland increasingly offers a different story of
   centrallocal government relations with pre-existing differences
   accentuating in the context of minority government, different processes
   of governance and attitudes to the welfare state.},

Abstract = {Many regions that are endowed with scarce natural resources such as
   arable land and water, and which are remote from a central government,
   suffer from violence and ethnic strife. A number of studies have looked
   at the convergence of economic, political and ecological marginality in
   several African countries. However, there is limited empirical study on
   the role of violence in pastoral livelihoods across ecological and
   geographical locations. Yet, case studies focusing on livelihood and
   poverty issues could inform us about violent behaviour as collective
   action or as individual decisions, and to what extent such decisions are
   informed or explained by specific climatic conditions. Several case
   studies point out that violence is indeed an enacted behaviour, rooted
   in culture and an accepted form of interaction. This article critically
   discusses the relevance of geographical and climatic parameters in
   explaining the connection between poverty and violent conflicts in
   Kenya's pastoral areas. These issues are considered vis-A-vis the role
   institutional arrangements play in preventing violent conflict over
   natural resources from occurring or getting out of hand. The article
   uses long-term historical data, archival information and a number of
   fieldwork sources. The results indicate that the context of violence
   does not deny its agency in explanation of conflicts, but the
   institutional set-up may ultimately explain the occurrence of the
   resource curse.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},

Volume = {21},
Number = {3},
Pages = {349-368},
Abstract = {The sociological, ecological, and economic foundations of a
   macroeconomics `beyond growth' are outlined, focusing on the idea of
   degrowth. Degrowth opposes conventional growth economics on the grounds
   that growth in the highly developed nations has become socially
   counterproductive, ecologically unsustainable, and uneconomic.
   Stagnating energy supplies also suggest an imminent `end of growth'. In
   response to growth economics, degrowth scholars call for a
   politico-economic policy of planned economic contraction, an approach
   which has been broadly defined as `an equitable downscaling of
   production and consumption that increases human well-being and enhances
   ecological conditions'. After defining growth economics and outlining
   the emerging case for degrowth, the feasibility of a macroeconomics
   beyond growth is considered and an outline of what such a macroeconomics
   might look like as a politico-economic programme is sketched.},

Abstract = {Despite plentiful scholarship relating to the prospect of terrorists
   utilizing chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear (CBRN) weapons,
   little of this work is both quantitative in nature and global in scope.
   Leveraging open-source data, this study quantitatively explores factors
   influencing the terrorist organizational decision to pursue CBRN
   weapons. The findings suggest that organizations embedded in alliance
   structures and based in authoritarian countries with relatively strong
   connections to a globalized world are more likely to seek to develop or
   acquire CBRN weapons. Contrary to previous qualitative studies, the
   present study failed to find a significant relationship between CBRN
   pursuit and religious ideology.},

Abstract = {The debates surrounding the European Union (EU) energy dependency on
   Russia should take into account the issue of non-acceptance of
   governance norms, defined hereafter by logic of appropriateness. The
   logic of appropriateness demonstrates the importance of values and norms
   in the setting of energy governance. The EU is the world's largest gas
   importer, which has not been able to influence effective governance in
   gas trade with the former Soviet Union (FSU), in spite of its initial
   strategic interest in the region. Three dimensions of EU-driven policies
   have failed to pass a test of the logic of appropriateness:
   international norms promotion, regional and bilateral relations; and the
   export of its domestic market model. Each of the three components
   demonstrates that the EU has, until now, missed achievement of its
   earlier stated objectives of setting an international energy regime in
   its relations with the FSU.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},

Volume = {19},
Number = {5, SI},
Pages = {737-754},
Abstract = {This contribution investigates the factors behind political group
   membership in the European Parliament. In June 2009, more than 150
   national parties, from the 27 member countries, joined one of the seven
   transnational groupings. Two main explanations for group membership are
   advanced. A first, traditional argument is based on the ideological or
   policy compatibility of the member parties. National parties will join
   the political group that best matches their programmatic position. A
   second argument focuses, instead, on the structure of incentives in the
   Parliament, positing that the pragmatic goals of national parties are
   better advanced by joining the largest and most influential groups.
   These arguments are tested by fitting a multinomial logit model for
   political group `choice' based on the 2009 Euromanifestos data. The
   findings suggest that ideological compatibility is the most important
   factor behind transnational affiliation, even if some caution is needed
   for the `new', post-communist members.},

   spending},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {19},
Number = {6},
Pages = {921-938},
Abstract = {This article makes two claims: first, it argues that the impact of
   fiscal austerity varies across different types of public spending. In
   particular, we show that discretionary spending (public investment) is
   hit harder by fiscal austerity than entitlement spending (public
   spending on pensions and unemployment) because of different
   institutional and political constraints. Second, we find that electoral
   institutions affect how governments solve this trade-off. Discretionary
   spending is cut back more severely in countries with an electoral system
   based on proportional representation than in a majoritarian system. Our
   empirical analysis relies on a methodological approach (composite data
   analysis) that takes into account interdependencies between budgetary
   categories. Using data for 21 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
   Development countries from 1979 to 2003, we find strong evidence for the
   varying impact of fiscal stress on the budget shares of discretionary
   and entitlement spending as well as strong interactive effect between
   fiscal austerity and electoral institutions.},

Title = {Can we identify a benevolent hegemon?},
Journal = {CAMBRIDGE REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1},
Pages = {27-38},
Abstract = {Analysts frequently assess the underlying character of the state with
   the largest concentration of material capabilities in the system-the
   hegemon. Scholars typically differentiate a hegemon that is benevolent
   from one that is predatory. In the current era, many have wondered about
   how to best characterise the United States. Scholars became particularly
   interested in this question during the George W Bush administration and
   reached strikingly different answers. This article aims to provide
   greater clarity regarding how we reach a judgment about the underlying
   character of a hegemon, in general, and the United States, in
   particular. The first section analyses the policies that the hegemon
   adopts towards the global economic system. The second section considers
   the hegemon's policies in the security realm, focusing on the key issue
   of how unilateralism should be conceptualised. The final section
   discusses the potential significance the `hegemonic reference
   point'-that is, the comparison that is made between the hegemon and the
   leading alternative leader of the global system.},

   prospects for international order},
Journal = {CAMBRIDGE REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1},
Pages = {39-52},
Abstract = {This intervention argues that Bromley's account of American power
   underplays some of the structural weaknesses in the US-made liberal
   order. These weaknesses are not principally the result of relative
   economic decline, but chiefly the product of a political insistence
   among US ruling classes in getting their own way (that is, for the
   immediate American interests to prevail) regardless of their longer-term
   socioeconomic or political consequences. It is the quest for American
   primacy, not the pursuit of a liberal international order that is the
   chief driver of US external relations. Likewise it is the more volatile
   dynamics of class antagonism and alliances both within and outside the
   USA-not the rational calculation of states as Bromley suggests-that tend
   to determine the success or failure of American primacy. I flesh out
   these claims by looking successively at the ideology of post-war
   American Empire, the contradictions of its actual implementation and the
   forms of socio-economic and political instability it generates.
   Bromley's sanguine view of the future of liberal order, it is argued, is
   only persuasive with a very narrow, inter-statist conception of world
   order and one which therefore underestimates the social origins of
   geopolitical disorder.},

Abstract = {Most cases involving EU law are decided in national courtrooms without a
   preliminary reference. The influence of the Court on these cases is
   often overstated by focusing on headline principles, such as mutual
   recognition and state liability. However, application of these
   principles in specific cases is often mediated by open norms such as
   proportionality, which allow much national court discretion. Whether
   national judges apply these open norms in a pro-integration way
   determines how far the broader principles directly impact on the
   national legal system, and on national regulators: these latter will
   condition their behaviour according to their expectations of the
   national judiciary, since these are the judges to which they are
   directly subject. The Court's role here is important, but limited. It
   enables and encourages pro-integration national judicial choices, but
   its case law does not compel them. Claims of activism need to be partly
   relocated from Luxembourg to national courts.},

Journal = {ETHNOPOLITICS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-23},
Abstract = {This article focuses on framing theory, an approach studying strategic
   communication, and its contribution to conflict studies. The article's
   aims are twofold: to demonstrate how framing bridges the divide between
   instrumental and social-psychological approaches in conflict studies and
   to illustrate how it is accordingly better able to shed light on the
   mobilization of ethnic violence. Drawing on the work of American framing
   theorists, the article shows that framing addresses how actors
   purposefully develop interpretations of an issue, event or change to
   achieve specific goals, but does so by recognizing the very real impacts
   social structures have on framers' ability to frame. As a result,
   framing is better able to shed light on communication aimed at ethnic
   mobilization and conflict. Framing analysts propose a sophisticated
   understanding of the strategies and vocabularies used to stimulate what
   they call consensus mobilization and action mobilization. The paper
   illustrates how a framework built around these framing insights can
   highlight some of the micro-processes behind the mobilization of ethnic
   solidarity and the creation of a will to act in instances of conflict.},

Abstract = {This article investigates emerging governance arrangements at the
   intersection between forest management and climate policy. The authors
   deploy the symposium's three-dimensional framework to describe and
   evaluate developments within two distinct policy sectors
   (forestry/climate change adaptation and mitigation) at several levels of
   governance (bi-national, national, and sub-national) to explore the
   nature and operation of the emerging governance arrangements, and
   assessing and measuring change within these arrangements over time.
   Drawing on four contemporary case studies from the US and Canada, New
   Zealand, British Columbia and Alaska, the authors discern little
   evidence of a generalized, linear trend from government to governance.
   Instead, they conclude, across institutional, political and regulatory
   dimensions of governance, a more variegated and diverse picture emerges.
   Their analysis also lends support for the Trubek and Trubek (2007)
   hypothesis that emerging governance arrangements typically interact with
   extant ones through modalities of rivalry, complementarity and
   transformation.},

Title = {Fighting climate change in the air: lessons from the EU directive on
   global aviation},
Journal = {REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE POLITICA INTERNACIONAL},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {55},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {70-87},
Abstract = {The European Union's (EU) decision to include aviation into the
   Emissions Trade Scheme was heatedly contested. Countries around the
   world, but mainly the Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa
   group (BRICS) and the US, denounced the EU's initiate as illegal and
   unilateral. Following a decade of frustrated negotiations at the
   International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), this paper
   interrogates why such measure, in principle climate-friendly, inspired
   so much global resentment. I argue that concerns with competitiveness
   and risks of legal inconsistency are important, but insufficient
   elements to explain the core of the conflict. The paper suggests that
   the EU was strongly criticized because third countries perceived this
   action as an imposed solution, which fostered an environment of
   distrust. Therefore, I claim that the problem has more to do with a
   normative divide than with a substantive divergence on what should be
   done regarding aviation emissions. My analysis is informed by the
   present literature on the links between trade and climate change, but
   gives particular weight to first-hand information through interviews
   with key stakeholders. The paper is divided in three parts. First, it
   presents the scope of the EU directive in historical perspective.
   Second, it explores the EU's measure through three different angles:
   legal, economical and political. The final part explores some possible
   solutions to overcome these divergences.},

Abstract = {This contribution systematically evaluates patterns of change in
   socio-economic models in Hungary and Slovakia, highlighting the role of
   the state in the process. While the countries share general similarities
   in their type of capitalism, a closer overview of institutional domains
   reveals that important differences exist in the character of change and
   the role of key actors. In terms of the overall reform paths, Slovakia,
   especially since the late 1990s, is more coherent and overwhelmingly in
   a liberal direction, while Hungary appears less radical and encompasses
   a combination of liberal elements and active state involvement. In this
   contribution we focus on industrial policy and find that Hungary adopted
   more comprehensive and vertical industrial support geared towards
   upgrading, foreign-capital openness throughout the economy, and support
   of the domestic small and medium enterprise sector. Slovakia developed
   its industry more through regulation than a direct intervention, opened
   to foreign capital only in late 1990s, and since then eschewed any
   attempt to nurture domestic capital.},

Title = {Menace Without Mandate? Is There Any Sympathy for ``Dissident{''} Irish
   Republicanism in Northern Ireland?},
Journal = {TERRORISM AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {24},
Number = {1},
Pages = {61-78},
Abstract = {Dissident Irish Republicans have increased their violent activities in
   recent years. These ``spoilers{''} reject the 1998 Good Friday Agreement
   power-sharing deal between Unionist and Nationalist traditions in
   Northern Ireland. Instead dissident IRAs vow to maintain an armed
   campaign against Britain's sovereign claim to Northern Ireland and have
   killed British soldiers, police officers, and civilians in recent years.
   These groups have small political organisations with which they are
   associated. The assumption across the political spectrum is that,
   whereas Sinn Fein enjoyed significant electoral backing when linked to
   the now vanished Provisional IRA, contemporary violent Republican ultras
   and their political associates are utterly bereft of sympathy. Drawing
   upon new data from the Economic and Social Research Council 2010
   Northern Ireland election survey, the first academic study to ask the
   electorate its views of dissident Republicans, this article examines
   whether there are any clusters of sympathy for these irreconcilables and
   their modus operandi. The piece assesses whether there are any
   demographic, structural, ideological, religious, or party trends
   indicating Republican dissident sympathies. It also assesses the extent
   to which dissidents are seen as a threat and examines whether this
   perception is shared evenly across Northern Ireland's two main
   communities.},

Abstract = {This paper estimates the level of projection bias in the issue placement
   of the main Spanish political parties. We find a different pattern of
   projection for regional and the main national parties. Whereas
   assimilation is generalised and homogeneous, contrast is exclusive of
   the main national parties. We provide indirect evidence that this
   heterogeneity reflects differences in party acceptability by showing a
   positive correlation between the party-specific level contrast and the
   magnitude of non-declared vote. We discuss the implications of our
   findings for the literature on spatial models and suggest testable
   hypotheses of why contrast levels vary between regional and national
   parties.},

Abstract = {This article critiques the Labour government's conceptualisation of
   forced marriage (FM) as a cultural problem imported by immigrants.
   Contrasting the traditions and values of minority communities with the
   purported liberalism of mainstream British society, has given rise to
   policy initiatives focusing on victims' right to exit and the tightening
   of immigration controls, rather than the possibility of finding
   solutions within minority communities.The gendered nature of the
   problem, and its connections to other forms of violence against women in
   both mainstream society and minority communities, has been largely
   ignored.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT AND VIOLENCE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Pages = {27-40},
Abstract = {Indonesia provides a fruitful case study of differences between
   radicalization processes in liberal and authoritarian regimes. Political
   Science hereby tends to emphasize regime type as the determinant of
   Islamist political strategy (radical, militant or moderate) and
   therefore as the main explanatory factor for radicalization processes.
   Although this is true of the role of Islamists in various Middle Eastern
   countries, where electoral participation has moderated political
   programs and strategies, it is of little relevance to Indonesia. The
   democratic opening in 1998 provided Islamists with new opportunities to
   participate in electoral politics, and even become co-opted by formally
   ``secular{''} forces, but at the same time opened up spaces for
   militant, radical Islamist groups. Whereas radical Islam faced severe
   state repression under Suharto's New Order, we now find a highly
   ambiguous relationship between the state and radical Islamists,
   expressed in operational terms as a parallelism of repression and
   cooptation. This article tries to make sense of the relationship between
   the post-authoritarian state and radical Islam in Indonesia by
   transcending the institution-centered understanding of the role of Islam
   through an examination of the configurations of social forces that have
   determined the shape, scope, and practices of radical Islam within
   Indonesia's new experiment with democracy.},

   change policy},
Journal = {POLICY STUDIES},

Abstract = {Discursive institutionalism is the `newest' of the new
   institutionalisms. The majority of work employing discursive
   institutionalism as a framework has so far focused on how it contributes
   to understanding policy change. Until now, however, little attention has
   been paid to how discursive institutionalism can help to explain the
   equally significant phenomenon of policy stasis. This imbalance is
   addressed here through a discursive institutionalist analysis of two
   cases of policy stasis: Estonian fiscal policy and United States climate
   change policy. It is argued that policy stasis - far from being a
   passive and inactive state - actually involves a large amount of
   discursive activity by multiple actors. This activity creates,
   legitimates and perpetuates policy discourses, which ultimately entrench
   governmental commitments to policy stasis. The article proceeds in three
   parts. First, a theoretical model is advanced which builds on existing
   discursive institutionalist literature to modify the theory towards
   explaining policy stasis. This model is then applied to the two case
   studies and it is shown how, and to what extent, `discourse' operates as
   a causal factor. Finally, it is shown how different institutional
   contexts affect the causal processes whereby the policy discourse
   becomes streamlined or complexified depending on the `simple' or
   `compound' characteristics of the polity. It is concluded that
   discursive institutionalism is a useful theory for understanding policy
   stasis in its various forms in both simple and compound polities, and
   that the role of `discourse' in explaining such situations is deserving
   of greater scholarly attention.},

Abstract = {A case study reviewing the establishment of the evidence-based
   Incredible Years programme in Wales, describing the rationale for
   selecting the programme, the outcomes achieved in Wales, and the
   influence on policy leading to a Wales-wide dissemination strategy. The
   UK context features a growing trend towards evidence-based anti-violence
   services and significant increases in funding for early intervention.
   Factors that contributed to the success of this project included careful
   selection of a programme with evidence, establishing a local evidence
   base for it, ensuring that information was disseminated to government
   and service providers, and the need to build in a sustainability plan.
   The biggest challenge, lack of leader time and resources to deliver the
   programme effectively, is explored and solutions from Wales, including
   leader feedback surveys and manager training days are described.},

Pages = {274-301},
Abstract = {Who and what influences the issues that policymakers attend to is
   central to the question of how power is exercised in politics. This
   study builds upon research by Soroka that proposes an expanded model of
   agenda setting as a means to examine how the media influences issue
   salience for the public and policymakers. It expands on Soroka's model
   by investigating the hypothesis that photographic attention to
   environmental issues in the news media influences issue salience for the
   mass public and governmental decision makers. There is little research
   that substantiates the idea, but it is widely believed that photographs
   have influence on the policy agenda. I use a dynamic, multidirectional
   model to estimate whether the volume of news photographs, in addition to
   news stories, influences issue salience among the mass public and
   policymakers. Data are longitudinal and measures of attention are
   operationalized as the number of congressional committee meetings,
   concern for the environment as a most important problem in public
   opinion polls, environmental news stories in The New York Times, and
   environmental news photographs in Time magazine. Results suggest that
   photographic attention does influence environmental policy agenda
   dynamics in some counterintuitive ways that are distinct from the
   effects of the news stories. While news stories appear to increase
   public attention toward the environment, they have little influence on
   policymaker attention. News photographs, on the other hand, appear to
   drive congressional committee attention but elicit an ambivalent public
   response.},

Abstract = {This article will present the argument that frontline bureaucrats
   fulfilling their duties within an infrastructure bureaucracy can be
   understood as negotiating bureaucrats, policymakers, and cousins to
   street-level bureaucrats. Empirically, the argument is based on data
   from an exploratory case study of a major road construction project in
   Sweden collected through passive participatory observation, interviews,
   and documents; the main source of theoretical inspiration is
   implementation theory and the theory of street-level bureaucracy.
   Working conditions, both similar to and different from street-level
   bureaucrats, are discussed, and patterns of negotiating practices are
   identified and analyzed. The analysis indicates that a fragmented
   implementation structure has effects on when and how negotiating
   practices are applied, and on policy outcomes, bureaucratic legitimacy,
   and political efficacy.},

Pages = {56-74},
Abstract = {This examination of the mobilization-repression nexus in high-capacity
   authoritarian regimes draws on examples from China, Russia, Iran, and
   several Middle Eastern states to develop a framework for analyzing state
   violence and how political oppositions are organized. The study examines
   middle and low levels of state violence, the provincial and municipal
   organization of party and regime, and the police, private militias, and
   thugs as low-level enforcers, and focuses on: (1) the complexity of the
   state's apparatus of repression and control and how different levels
   exercise different forms of violence against activists; (2) the
   creativity of the opposition's actions to voice its demands and avoid
   repression and surveillance; and (3) the recursive relationship between
   the two, a dark dance between state and opposition with high stakes for
   both. Hierarchical analysis at national, provincial, and local levels,
   and lateral analysis across these levels, where elite interests
   frequently diverge, show that intersections and gaps on both axes can
   create lapses in social control and openings the opposition. These free
   spaces of speech and innovative action give rise to novel ways to keep
   oppositional sentiments in the public forum. The article offers several
   propositions for analyzing repression and state violence at various
   levels, and, similarly, the various ways that these free spaces occur.},

Abstract = {This contribution explores the political foundations of judicial
   independence in the European Union and asks to what degree the ECJ is
   insulated against court curbing mechanisms that might threaten judicial
   independence. The contribution reviews the major court curbing
   mechanisms identified in the literature on American law and politics and
   assesses the extent to which these mechanisms might be applied in
   restraining the ECJ. The evidence and analysis suggests that the ECJ is
   remarkably well insulated against each of the major court curbing
   mechanisms identified in the literature.},

Year = {2012},
Volume = {111},
Number = {442},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The February 2010 ruling of the African Commission on Human and Peoples'
   Rights on the Kenyan government's violation of the Endorois people's
   rights is the Commission's most substantive and radical decision to
   date, with important implications for international jurisprudence,
   national politics, and local strategies - as well as potential
   socioeconomic realities and inter-communal relations. The ruling
   combined a liberal interpretation of the African Charter with
   far-reaching recommendations and the request for a government progress
   report. It was the first time that the Commission had decided on and
   extended individual and peoples' rights to indigenous people, and is the
   first time in the world that a specific right to development has been
   adjudicated upon. By accepting the Endorois as an indigenous community
   the decision completes a process of ethnic invention that began in the
   1990s, and has seen Endorois assert ethnic difference from their
   Kalenjin neighbours as a strategy of legal argument. The outcome is a
   victory for Endorois leaders and may help other communities tackle state
   injustice. However, the broad implications for social justice and
   inter-communal relations are contentious given the decision's
   reinforcement of an inherently exclusive sense of ethnic territoriality
   and neglect of gross inequalities in wealth and power. From this
   perspective, the decision reflects a modern obsession with the `politics
   of recognition' to the neglect of a `politics of redistribution'.},

   governance in the country since the early 1990s. It does so by combining
   a review of secondary literature about the nature of state-society
   relations in Cameroon and public opinion surveys and citizens' comments
   in the private press relating to these issues. It concludes that such
   perceptions about taxation illustrate the challenges confronting African
   states if they seek to expand their capacity for domestic resource
   mobilisation through taxation.},

Abstract = {Students of international relations interested in cooperation through
   international regimes and organizations very often devote their
   attention to the role of a few big states rather than the numerous small
   ones. Small states tend to possess fewer administrative and financial
   resources back home as well as smaller and less well-equipped
   delegations at the international negotiation table than big states. This
   can easily translate into difficulties in preparing positions for all
   items on the negotiation agenda and in developing negotiation strategies
   in great detail, which might inhibit small states from successfully
   influencing negotiation outcomes. Yet, since international negotiation
   often rest on a one-state, one-vote principle and since small states can
   adjust priorities and redirect their limited capacities, there is a
   window of opportunity for small states to turn into important
   international actors and achieve significant outcomes in international
   affairs. In order to systematically shed light on the role of small
   states in international negotiations, this article outlines the
   conceptual framework to answer the following question: How, and under
   which conditions, can small states successfully punch above their weight
   in international negotiations?},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},

Volume = {19},
Number = {4},
Pages = {567-584},
Abstract = {The relationship between semi-presidentialism and the coordination or
   leadership of national EU policy has become increasingly relevant. After
   all, currently 11 of the 27 European Union (EU) member states have
   semi-presidential systems of government. This article contributes to the
   literature through a comparative analysis of the `fit' between
   semi-presidentialism and the co-ordination of national EU policy, with
   empirical evidence from Finland used to illustrate the challenges
   involved in combining semi-presidentialism with EU membership. The main
   argument is that semi-presidential regimes where both the government and
   the president have powers in foreign and/or European policy are prone to
   tensions, particularly when considering that domestic foreign policies
   are increasingly co-ordinated at the EU level and that foreign and EU
   policies are difficult to separate from one another.},

Abstract = {This article deals with militant Islamist hymns (anasheed jihadiya; in
   the following simply referred to as nasheeds) as an expression of
   jihadist culture. In this context jihadism is regarded as a militant
   fraction within the Salafi movement, with which it shares goals but not
   means.(1) The jihadist culture as a tool to create a common jihadist
   identity and to mobilize new recruits is probably as important as its
   ideology is. In 2004 Marc Sageman made the following remarks in his book
   Understanding Terror Networks: ``. . . social bonds play a more
   important role in the emergence of the global Salafi jihad than
   ideology.{''}(2) The history of nasheeds will be traced back as well as
   an analysis of its contents and usage will be given.},

Abstract = {This article is framed within the current debate on emerging powers from
   a Latin American perspective. It tries to solve some of the theoretical
   problems of the mainstream rationalist approach in IR theory, proposing
   a model of change rooted in the current realist program. This framework
   is applied to the study of power politics in South America with the goal
   of answering two major questions: why has Brazilian foreign policy been
   so successful in positioning this country as an emerging power? And why
   have not any country in the region reacted accordingly to the challenge
   posed by its mayor regional counterpart rise?},

Pages = {109-127},
Abstract = {A classic question within studies of governance concerns what appears to
   be a paradox of being free and governed at the same time. In this
   chapter, the author addresses this question departing from contemporary
   Western society, a society to which he attaches labels such as digital,
   late modern, and networked. This is a theoretical chapter addressing
   political participation, citizenship practices, and power. How do people
   enter into citizenship through political participation online, and what
   governs these processes? The contribution to the academic discussion is
   to highlight the expressive as an increasingly important rationale for
   political participation in networked and digital late modernity. The
   author arrives at this conclusion departing from the intersections
   between technology, society, and culture. In these intersections,
   expressive processes of identification are keys. Therefore citizenship
   practices also need to be approached from an axis of individualism,
   creating even more intersections when combined with technology, society,
   and culture.},

Pages = {399-416},
Abstract = {Turkey is of paramount importance to the United States and to the
   European Union. The United States is not only the first and foremost
   partner of both the EU and Turkey. It is also amongst the most committed
   supporters of Turkey's European integration. In support of Turkey's EU
   membership bid, Washington has set forth a variety of arguments and has
   attempted to influence EU decisions at different points in time. US
   advocacy throughout the 1990s was key to kick-starting Turkey's
   accession process. By contrast, US influence on Turkey's EU accession
   decreased visibly in the twenty-first century. The style of US advocacy
   goes some way towards explaining why this has been the case. When
   American advocacy has prioritized quiet, behind-closed-doors diplomacy
   it has tended to be more effective. When instead US officials have
   relied on loud public diplomacy, European reactions have been generally
   negative. More importantly however, it is the content of American
   arguments that has affected their relative impact on European
   perceptions of Turkey. Depending on whether the US has spoken to the
   rights-, the interest- or the identity-based logic of enlargement, the
   influence of the United States on Turkey's EU membership prospects has
   varied. On the grounds of this analysis, this article concludes by
   outlining broad policy suggestions regarding how the United States could
   contribute more effectively to Turkey's European integration.},

Abstract = {For some 60years now, various measures have been introduced to bring
   Europeans together as citizens, based on the idea that increased
   cross-border encounters would create familiarity, generate a sense of
   community, facilitate economic activities and ultimately bring about a
   shared identity, however fragile at first. Town twinning and numerous
   exchange and mobility programmes of many kinds are cases in point. These
   programmes typically were anchored in the municipal, educational and
   vocational realms. While these mechanisms functioned well, some seem to
   be losing their innovative capacity; yet all reveal a structural
   middle-class bias. On the whole they systematically exclude those groups
   among which the rise of Euro-scepticism and support for anti-European
   political parties is the strongest, particularly the less well-educated
   and the new precariat. With the fiscal crises reducing the capacity of
   many EU member states to support the European Project financially, what
   mechanisms or policy instruments could, in the sense of social
   engineering, strengthen social bonds across borders and re-energise
   Europe's social space?},

Abstract = {The article constitutes a political economy exercise in trying to
   understand the crisis of the euro area and draw lessons from it. The
   bursting of the biggest bubble in the Western financial system for
   decades has led to a big crisis in a currency union without a state,
   which is the euro area now occupying centre stage in the European
   political system. The culprits are many, but there have also been
   colossal failures in markets and institutions. A new modus vivendi
   between democracies and financial markets needs to be found. Banking and
   sovereign debt crises are closely intertwined and they both cross
   national borders. Yet European solutions have proved difficult to reach
   because of economic divergence and rising populism. The distribution of
   pain is hardly an easy task, while implementation has been rendered more
   difficult in an increasingly intergovernmental EU system. There are deep
   underlying differences over the overall economic strategy. Yet a lively
   debate has developed as manifestation of an emerging European public
   forum. The stakes are high. Will the crisis act as a powerful catalyst
   for further integration in Europe? The alternative would be
   disintegration at a high cost. Crises provide opportunities for change.
   This is arguably the end of an era. The article ends with a rallying cry
   for Europe the broad minded.},

Abstract = {This article shows empirically, theoretically and statistically that
   domestic (or home-grown) terrorism in Western Europe occurs more
   frequently in countries with majoritarian political systems (typically
   first-past-the-post electoral systems and single-party governments) than
   in countries with consensus political systems (typically countries with
   PR electoral systems and coalition governments). Based on a survey of
   all domestic terrorist incidents in Western Europe from 1985 to 2010,
   the article shows strong negative correlations between consensus
   institutions and levels of terrorism; that is, the more disproportional
   the political system is, the higher the levels of terrorism are likely
   to be. Thus domestic terrorism tends to occur when minorities are
   excluded from the decision-making process on matters they find
   important. These findings indicate that constitutional engineering
   provides a more promising model of counterterrorism than the prevailing
   orthodoxy.},

Abstract = {Social-psychological models of voting behaviour systematically downsize
   the relevance of party leader evaluations by conceiving them as mere
   consequences of causally prior partisan attachments. However, the
   validity of this interpretation depends heavily on the effectively
   exogenous status of party identification. Empirical research shows that
   the assumed exogeneity of partisanship is, at best, doubtful. In such a
   context, single-equation models of voting are likely to provide
   seriously biased estimates. By employing the proper econometric
   procedures (instrumental variable estimation) and the most appropriate
   data sources to address causality issues (panel data) this study
   provides strong support in favour of the personalisation hypothesis.},

   Association Adding value to existing aggregate cross-national analyses
   on forced migration, I use subnational-level data to investigate
   circumstances that affect peoples decisions of whether or not to flee
   their homes during civilian conflicts. Building on existing literature,
   I argue that conflict by itself is not the sole factor affecting peoples
   decisions to flee or stay. Apart from a direct physical impact, civil
   war can destroy economic infrastructure and expose people to economic
   hardships, which can contribute to displacement. In addition, flight may
   be impeded or facilitated by such factors as geographical features,
   physical infrastructure, and social conditions under which people live.
   Using count data from the Maoists peoples war in Nepal, a subnational
   analysis of displacement is conducted to provide a more refined test of
   existing large-n studies on the causes of forced migration. The
   empirical results are consistent with the major hypotheses developed in
   the field. With more precise measures of conflict, economic and physical
   conditions, and presence of social networks, I demonstrate the
   importance of a rationalist framework in understanding the choice of
   flight.},

Abstract = {In the early years of independence, Ukraine's crucial accomplishment was
   the establishment a degree of sovereignty and independence that few
   thought possible. Since that time, Ukrainian foreign policy has largely
   stagnated. Despite attempts of various internal leaders to adopt
   decisive policies, and despite significant external pressure, Ukraine
   has done very little. This paper reviews the first 20 years of Ukrainian
   foreign policy and accounts for the inertia that has developed.
   Ukraine's foreign policy passivity results from three uneasy balances:
   an external balance between the pulls of Russia and the West; an
   internal balance between Ukraine's regions, and an internal balance
   between forces of democracy and authoritarianism. These balances mean
   that while few are happy with Ukraine's policy, no one has been able to
   decisively change it. While Ukraine's domestic regional division is
   unlikely to change, change in the balance between domestic political
   forces or that between international forces could reduce the inertia in
   Ukrainian foreign politics, most likely leading to a drift toward
   Russia. (C) 2012 The Regents of the University of California. Published

Abstract = {Linking up with and critically assessing the recent literature on the
   local state in China, this article introduces a new framework to
   understand group behavior and strategic agency in local policy
   processes. Conceptualizing county and township cadres as a `strategic
   group', the framework offers a number of analytical tools for better
   understanding the conditions of effective and ineffective policy
   implementation. Drawing on insights from development sociology,
   Bourdieu's theory of capital formation and the garbage can model from
   organization theory, against a background of extensive fieldwork in
   numerous Chinese counties over the last years conducted by the authors,
   the article intends to theoretically substantiate the current knowledge
   of China scholars on the nexus between actors and their institutional
   environment in the Chinese local state.},

Abstract = {A dynamic model of a terrorist organization is presented with the
   defining feature being that a succession of operatives is recruited at
   different points in time. Consequently, a government's counterterror
   policy must be tailored according to the vintage structure of the
   terrorist group that it faces. This implies that past history of
   counterterror policy and attacks matter for the formulation of current
   and future policy. The authors present the necessary steps to formulate
   and solve a vintage model, and to deal with the delay differential
   equations that naturally arise from the vintage structure. The resulting
   analysis captures the implications of a diverse set of phenomena such as
   Internet recruiting, training delays for logistically complex plots, age
   distribution of operatives, and the sensitivity of government
   impatience/cabinet composition to terrorist events for the inner
   dynamics of terrorist organizations and counterterror policy. Directions
   for future research are also suggested.},

Abstract = {Since Labour lost office in 2010 the spate of memoirs about the New
   Labour era has been uneven in quality, but at their best they provide
   rival insider accounts by the actors themselves of the events in which
   they were involved. A variety of memoirs are considered, in particular
   those focusing on the three chief architects of New LabourBlair, Brown
   and Mandelsonand the complicated political and personal relationships
   between them. The memoirs throw new light upon Gordon Brown's campaign
   to oust Tony Blair as prime minister, and the reasons why Blair did not
   seek to move Brown as chancellor. They provide reflections on the nature
   of political leadership and the different styles and policy priorities
   of Blair and Brown, why the New Labour years ended in such a major
   defeat, and why the New Labour project lasted as long as it did.},

Abstract = {There appears to be a virtual absence of any serious distinctions in the
   programs and rhetoric of the three leading political parties in Ukraine:
   The Party of Regions, Bloc of Yulia Timoshenko, and Our Ukraine. Each
   party is in support of the market economy, democracy, human rights, and
   joining the European Union. The major distinction between these parties
   is in the way they see the country's past. Such an intensive use of the
   past reflects the absence of differences in the way they see the future.
   This article is dedicated to the analysis of how the past has been used
   in Ukrainian politics during the period of active political and regional
   confrontation in 2004-2010. In particular, what specific historical
   stories and topics are in high demand in the political rhetoric and why,
   and how all of these factors may prevent the process of political
   consolidation of the nation. The article concludes that major political
   parties will most likely use the same regional stereotypes of viewing
   the past in mobilizing their electorate during the coming parliamentary
   elections of 2012. The technology of confronting the ``two Ukraines{''}
   will be employed by the competing political camps once again.},

Abstract = {This article offers an account of the peculiar phenomenon of social
   policy learning in China, and illustrates the situations in which local
   policy learning can either facilitate, or constrain,the capacity of the
   central government to monitor social policy development. Based on
   analyses of the urban pension reform and the introduction of the Minimum
   Living Standard Scheme, the article concludes that local activism has
   become an eclectic tool for policy learning and diffusion leading to
   subnationalisation of social protection, which poses a challenge to the
   central government in its efforts of coherent social policy governance.},

Abstract = {Prevailing concepts of feudalism frequently view the patrimonial court
   as an instrument of the coercive power of the feudal lord. Yet from the
   Bled archives we learn that the court served overwhelmingly the lawsuits
   among villagers - who were also the oath-takers - over money, property
   and inheritance matters. Legal rules that the court followed were
   pluralistic in nature. In addition, in the 18th century Carniola
   proceedings were held in vernacular Slovene, enabling the continuing use
   of vernacular legal notions (such as zastava, poratvo) and custom-based

Title = {Conceptualizing sovereignty in Russian foreign policy: Realist and

Abstract = {Russia's approach to sovereignty reflects a close linkage between the
   recentralizing project domestically, and reassertion of Russia's
   position as a great power on the international scene. This article
   assesses the relative utility of constructivist and realist approaches
   in Russian readings of sovereignty. A constructivist approach is found
   to be more useful in treating sovereignty it directs our attention
   toward the problem of developing a new post-Soviet identity, the role of
   culture and historical interpretation in foreign policy, Russian
   concepts of the hostile Other and domestic ideas linked to Russian
   concepts of federalism - all critical factors in understanding Russian
   foreign policy behavior. The major ideological construct of the
   post-communist period - sovereign democracy - insists that both
   sovereignty and democracy are socially and culturally determined, and
   therefore clash with Western interpretations of these concepts. The
   emergence of a new, post-modern and Western-dominated set of global
   norms limiting sovereignty is closely linked to continued tensions
   between Russia and the West. International Politics (2012) 49, 400-417.

Abstract = {We consider the influence of countries' external security environments
   on their military spending. We first estimate the ex ante probability
   that a country will become involved in a fatal militarized interstate
   dispute using a model of dyadic conflict that incorporates key elements
   of liberal and realist theories of international relations. We then
   estimate military spending as a function of the threat of armed
   interstate conflict and other influences: arms races, the defense
   expenditures of friendly countries, actual military conflict, democracy,
   civil war, and national economic output. In a panel of 165 countries,
   1950 to 2000, we find our prospectively generated estimate of the
   external threat to be a powerful variable in explaining military
   spending. A I percentage point increase in the aggregate probability of
   a fatal militarized dispute, as predicted by our liberal-realist model,
   leads to a 3 percent increase in a country's military expenditures.},

Abstract = {Within contemporary legal and political philosophy there is nothing more
   unpopular than defending a world state. It seems food for thought for
   writers like Huxley or Wells, but not a topic that deserves serious
   philosophical reflection. Fortunately, there are exceptions to this
   general rule. Theorists such as Hoffe, Cabrera, Deudney and Yunker
   defend a version of a multilayered minimal world state - a model based
   on the dual principles of federalism and subsidiarity. The focus of this
   article is on the very fragile balance that proponents of this model
   have to keep between a simultaneous need for centralization and
   decentralization. On the basis of a critical analysis of the work of
   these theorists, it is argued in this article that the safeguards these
   authors defend to prevent a bloating of government themselves contain a
   tendency to hierarchical centralization. While some form of world state
   might be necessary to cope with the challenges posed by globalization,
   it is essential to discuss the shape and competences of the world state
   much more critically and in more detail than has been the case in the
   past.},

Abstract = {The `war on terror' has focused exclusively on transnational terrorism
   since the hijackings of 9/11. Based on almost 40 years of data, this
   article argues that domestic terrorism poses a much greater threat to
   the world community. Thus, this focus needs to be reconsidered,
   especially because recent research shows that domestic terrorism spills
   over into transnational terrorism. This article also argues that
   homeland security and the dominance of religious fundamentalist
   terrorists are making the hardest-to-defend targets - private parties -
   the target of choice since 1999. Moreover, terrorists are increasingly
   favoring attacking people over property. Even though terrorism murders
   relatively few people, it poses a supreme collective action problem for
   the world community.},

Abstract = {The Colombian artist Oscar Munoz's Aliento (Breath)-10 steel discs,
   photoserigraph with grease-is an experiment with materials. On the
   surface it is minimalist-art about the surface of art, the stuff art is
   made of. Yet Munoz's surfaces are deceiving, for his images become clear
   only when viewers breathe on them. With a breath, sepia photographs of
   desaparecidos-young Colombian men proclaimed ``disappeared{''} by their
   government-appear and momentarily return viewers' gaze. As the
   condensation fades on the mirror-like metal, so do the images. Here the
   aesthetic disappearance parallels the corporeal-political one. For a
   moment, viewers recognize the ``Other{''} in their own reflections and
   in so doing begin to comprehend how Munoz's piece forces the repetition
   of the moment of encounter and in the process uncovers hidden truths.},

Abstract = {As the institutions charged with preserving and purveying our collective
   history and identity came under close scrutiny in the 1990s, the
   Smithsonian Institution was accused of having ignored Latino culture for
   decades, and it responded with a number of initiatives to right more
   than a century of wrongs. ``Arte Latino,{''} one of a series of
   traveling exhibits launched in 1999, presented a sampling of the Latino
   artworks in the institution's collection. Visits to two installations of
   the exhibit, one with a predominantly Latino audience and one with a
   predominantly non-Latino one, showed how context and reception ascribe
   meaning and how an emphasis on authenticity can reinforce dualities.
   Ethnically organized exhibits run the risk of merely placating
   underrepresented artists and showcasing the exotic. While cultural
   specificity can heighten awareness, instill pride, and redress neglect,
   it can also impede communication, emphasize difference and divisiveness,
   and undermine its own goals.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses the evolution of the intellectual property regime
   (IPR), and more precisely the patent regime, in the USA since the
   nineteenth century. To do so, we consider intellectual property laws
   within the context of wider changes in capitalism, focusing on two main
   historical phases: first, the period covering the formation and
   development of ocorporate capitalism' dominated by large corporations
   and then the new phase, which opened up in the 1980s, marked by the rise
   to power of finance. From a perspective of institutional
   complementarities, we seek to show how the characteristics and
   implications of patent regimes can only be understood in relation to
   changes in the main institutional forms of capitalism: forms of the
   firm, the status of labour (the owage-labour nexus') and market forms.},

Abstract = {Drawing on quasi-experimental data from participants in structured and
   moderated deliberations on sexual minority rights in Poland, this study
   tests the relationship between attitude importance, certainty,
   intensity, and extremity. This study also examines the antecedents of
   these attributes and their consequences for several democratically
   important outcomes (i.e., perceived disagreement, negative affect,
   attitude polarization, self-reported polarization, argument repertoire,
   and political participation). This study further asks whether these
   attributes exert different effects than a composite attitude strength
   index. Although factor analysis suggests that these attributes represent
   one construct, they are differently affected by deliberation and exert
   differential effects. The analyses further reveal that relying on the
   composite index obscures substantial information and inaccurately
   represents strength-related processes and functions. Theoretical,
   methodological, and practical implications are discussed.},

Abstract = {This article argues that in many cases the theoretical resources for a
   revived and enriched `critical International Political Economy' already
   exist, and we would do well to revisit earlier works when seeking to
   intervene in contemporary debates. Through an initial engagement with
   the recent plethora of contributions on `the international', I contend
   that Nicos Poulantzas' later writings deserve a rereading. In
   particular, his work on the historicity of territory and the
   internationalisation of capital constitutes a series of rich and
   suggestive commentaries. The significance of his remarks are later
   illustrated via a consideration of Germany, where I argue that the
   changes wrought by the growing imbrication of the German economy with
   transnational circuits of capital have been taking place through, and
   not necessarily against, the historicity of German capitalism's
   emergence and evolution. International Politics (2012) 49, 177-194.

Abstract = {The US government established contact in Western Europe with
   anti-Communist refugees following World War II and covertly supported a
   variety of groups. Initially in the 1940s cooperation between the
   OSS/CIA and emigre groups provided support for the parachuting of
   couriers to contact underground organizations in ethnic homelands and
   over the next four decades until the late 1980s through support for
   non-violent methods against Soviet power. One of the organisations
   supported by the US government was Prolog Research and Publishing
   Corporation that existed from 1952 to 1992. Prolog was established by
   zpUHVR (external representation of the Ukrainian Supreme Liberation
   Council), the political umbrella of Ukrainian nationalist, anti-Soviet
   partisans who fought a guerrilla war against the Soviet state until the
   early 1950s. US government support facilitated a democratic alternative
   to nationalist emigres who dominated the Ukrainian diaspora as well as a
   different strategy towards the pursuit of the liberation of Ukraine.
   Prolog proved to be more successful in its liberation strategy of
   providing large volumes of technical, publishing and financial support
   to dissidents and opposition currents within the Communist Party of
   Ukraine. The alternative nationalist strategy of building underground
   structures in Soviet Ukraine routinely came under threat from
   infiltration by the KGB. US government support enabled Prolog to publish
   books and journals, including the only Russian-language journal
   published by a Ukrainian emigre organization, across the political
   spectrum and to closely work with opposition movements in
   central-eastern Europe, especially Poland. (C) 2012 The Regents of the

Abstract = {The view of identities as always situated in a relationship with the
   Other underlies contemporary constructivist social theory. Taking a step
   further, and combining constructivist approaches to identity with
   insights from post-colonial studies, this article argues that the Other,
   far from being a mere presence, often plays an active role in identity
   politics. By tracing the historically varying ways in which Turkey and
   Russia have engaged in European identity construction, it demonstrates
   that this is an interactive process of negotiation between the European
   Self and its external Others in which agency of the Other is revealed.
   In particular, Russia and Turkey exercise agency by challenging, each in
   its own manner, the EU's power to define the normative meaning of
   Europe. While Turkey has contributed to a decentring of European
   identity by challenging the self-perception of Europe as a multicultural
   space, Russia's uncompromising stance tends to consolidate the
   EU-centred image of Europe as a political community based on liberal
   democratic values.},

Abstract = {Among his various interventions into the debate between patriotism and
   cosmopolitanism, Jean-Jacques Rousseau's most direct and forceful
   statements expressed a preference for patriotism. As a result, there has
   long been a sense among his interpreters that Rousseau opposed
   cosmopolitanism. This interpretation, I argue in this article, is too
   narrow to accommodate the breadth of Rousseau's writings on patriotism
   and cosmopolitanism. From the Discourses, to Emile, to the Reveries,
   Rousseau's reflections on patriotism and cosmopolitanism were
   ambivalent. Rousseau defended patriotism not on its own merits but on
   the basis of its relative superiority to abstract cosmopolitanism, which
   Rousseau dismissed as powerless to motivate moral action. This leaves
   open the possibility of another kind of cosmopolitanism an authentic,
   heartfelt cosmopolitanism which, if it could be realized, would be
   preferable even to patriotism. In the Reveries, I argue, Rousseau
   discovered just such a heartfelt cosmopolitanism, one that points toward
   an inclusive model of civic affect.},

Abstract = {Over the past decade, public opinion surveys have shown that Croats are
   deeply dissatisfied with their health care system and asses it to be one
   of the most important issues. However, health care hardly makes it into
   any political discourse in Croatia. This study analyzes the results of a
   public opinion survey conducted before the 2007 parliamentary elections
   to find out what the public sentiment on health care performance in
   Croatia is and to analyze the reasons why health care is not addressed
   by political actors. Evidence suggests that while health care is the
   most salient issue today, the public often understands it poorly. Thus,
   in a political environment of competing issues, and given the complexity
   of tacking health care in the policy arena, politicians strategically
   avoid discussing the issue.},

Abstract = {Local autonomy in a subnational jurisdiction is more likely to be
   gained, secured or enhanced where there are palpable movements or
   political parties agitating for independence in these smaller
   territories. A closer look at the fortunes, operations and dynamics of
   independence parties from subnational island jurisdictions can offer
   some interesting insights on the appetite for sovereignty and
   independence, but also the lack thereof, in the twenty-first century.},

   The management of security problems in South Eastern Europe would be
   best assured within the process of European integration. Well
   coordinated activities by key international organizations could help
   South Eastern Europe to become a region of democracy, prosperity and

Abstract = {Global warming is expected to make the climate warmer, wetter, and
   wilder. It is predicted that such climate change will increase the
   severity and frequency of climate-related disasters like flash floods,
   surges, cyclones, and severe storms. This article uses econometric
   methods to study the consequences of climate-induced natural disasters
   on economic growth, and how these disasters are linked to the onset of
   armed civil conflict either directly or via their impact on economic
   growth. The results show that climate-related natural disasters have a
   negative effect on growth and that the impact is considerable. The
   analysis of conflict onset shows that climate-related natural disasters
   do not increase the risk of armed conflict. This is also true when we
   instrument the change in GDP growth by climatic disasters. The result is
   robust to inclusion of country and time fixed effects, different
   estimation techniques, and various operationalization of the disasters
   measure, as well as for conflict incidence and war onset. These findings
   have two major implications: if climate change increases the frequency
   or makes weather-related natural disasters more severe, it is an
   economic concern for countries susceptible to these types of hazards.
   However, our results suggest - based on historical data - that more
   frequent and severe climate-related disasters will not lead to more
   armed conflicts through their effects on GDP growth.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},

Volume = {19},
Number = {4},
Pages = {454-471},
Abstract = {Member states of the European Union (EU) respond differently when they
   get caught for violations of European law and face prosecution. While
   Portugal tends to settle its non-compliance cases quickly and at an
   early stage of the EU's official infringement proceedings, Italy and
   Belgium like to sit them out and do not even comply with rulings of the
   European Court of Justice after being convicted twice - first for
   violating EU law and then for not acting upon the court's original
   judgment. This paper explores the explanatory power of prominent
   compliance theories to address these diverging patterns of persistent
   non-compliance across EU member states and tests a set of hypotheses
   that accounts for the noncompliance dynamics across the different stages
   of the EU's infringement proceedings and over time. We find that both
   differences in capacity and power explain the variation in longitudinal
   non-compliance patterns.},

Abstract = {Euroscepticism at the supranational level has remained largely
   overlooked by scholars. In an attempt to fill in this gap, this article
   focuses on the persistent minority of hard Eurosceptic MEPs. The
   objective is twofold. First, it aims to determine how Eurosceptic MEPs
   conceive and carry out their representative mandate. Second, it analyzes
   the impact of the institutional framework and of the visions of Europe
   on the strategies of these MEPs. Drawing on the insights of role theory
   and the dichotomy of A. Hirschman and using a qualitative methodology,
   the article proposes a typology of three main parliamentary roles (the
   absentee, the pragmatist and the public orator), corresponding to a
   continuum between exit and voice. It also shows that both the visions of
   Europe as well as the institutional context affect the parliamentary
   roles of MEPs.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {4-16},
Abstract = {How does the globalization of law, the emergence of multiple and
   shifting venues of legal accountability, enhance or evade the
   fulfillment of international human rights? The utility of law for the
   fulfillment of human rights can be summarized as a combination of
   normative principles, universal repertoire of definitions and
   boundaries, links to state enforcement, predictable processes for
   conflict resolution, and a doctrine of equal standing (Kinley 2009:
   215). The intersection between the globalization of law and the
   globalization of rights is a question of global governance: In what ways
   and to what extent can and should law across borders regulate and
   enforce the protection of individuals from abuse of both global and
   local authority? What does existing literature tell us about where we
   stand in our understanding of the extent and meaning of these
   intersecting forms of globalization? There is a rough spectrum from
   pessimistic structural theories through more optimistic cosmopolitan
   reformist theories of norm change, with a middle position of a
   sociological and indeterminate dialectical struggle over the terms and
   impact of global governance. While we see clear evidence in the
   international human rights regime of the globalization of norms,
   definitions, and processes, it is unclear how much the globalization of
   law has enhanced enforcement or even standing for the fulfillment of
   core rights of the person.},

Pages = {462-486},
Abstract = {President Obama came to office promising to make abolition of nuclear
   weapons a central policy goal. Conventional explanations for the
   arguably poor progress made here (explanations which focus on political
   and bureaucratic processes) fail to capture an important part of the
   story. This is that the president comes from a political tradition
   marked by exceptionalist assumptions. This tradition encompasses a
   distinctly American attempt to converge idealism and realism; it seeks
   change, but also constrains aspirations within conservative limits. His
   conception of exceptionalism is based on a presumption of American moral
   leadership integrated with a requirement for continued American
   strategic primacy. As a result, his view of abolition requires global
   acceptance of American conventional military superiority, reinforcing
   doubts about the vision's prospects.},
