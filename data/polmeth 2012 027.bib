Abstract = {What is the source of human rights resonance and does that legitimize
   working on human rights transnationally? This article responds both to
   human rights critics (among them relativists, poststructuralists, and
   some Queer theorists) and supporters (legal, philosophical, and
   historical universalists) who assume human rights source is in some sort
   of singular foundation. This is a shared misconception. Human rights
   global resonance does not come from one foundation but rather flows out
   of human rights mutually dependent groundings in law, politics,
   institutions, and norms. A key element to the intersections among these
   groundings is the impact of transnational conversations in which local
   actors have had a substantial stake and which have contributed to human
   rights continuing rearticulations. The vitality of the intersections
   between human rights and bottom-up social movements is what gives the
   lie both to overly top-down conceptualizations of human rights as well
   as to overly structuralist dismissals of human rights. Each
   de-emphasizes the essential role of human agency, the saliency of
   transnational normative networks, and the ways in which individual and
   collective action anchor human rights in contemporary politics. This
   will be illustrated by reference to movements for rights regarding
   sexual orientation and gender identity, even (or especially) in the
   controversial context of the Arab world. If this argument has merit,
   then we can move beyond the question of whether or not human rights in
   the abstract are inherently legitimate or illegitimate. Instead, the
   question becomes the degree to which specific human rights and specific
   human rights claims have flowed out of everyday local struggles. It is
   the answers to that question that will indicate the legitimacy and
   resonance (or lack thereof) of specific human rights.},

Abstract = {Relational contracting or collaborative governance has come to the
   forefront of scholarly studies of government privatization efforts. The
   concept of trust (between contracting governments and their vendors) is
   rising in importance as one of the central tenets of this type of
   governance. What is largely understudied in the midst of this increasing
   attention to the topic is identifying how and under what conditions
   trust is formed and sustained. Borrowing from economic, organizational,
   sociological, and management theories, we develop competing hypotheses
   to examine what determines the extent of trust contracting governments
   display toward their service providers. Our findings suggest that local
   governments tend to place more confidence in their vendors' faithfulness
   and honesty when their contracting partners are from the same sector
   (i.e., other governmental units), had known reputations prior to the
   relationship, have strong community ties, and perform their tasks well.
   Interestingly, several economic theory-based explanations-rational
   choice and game theory, social exchange theory, and transaction cost
   economics-find only limited support.},

Abstract = {This article identifies and explains two very different pathways to a
   knowledge economy, based on investment in training in Denmark and
   research in Finland. The fact that these ostensibly similar countries
   have pursued such divergent strategies cannot be explained using the
   established literature on employer organization, labor power resources,
   and small states. This article develops and resolves this puzzle by
   focusing on the interaction among organized actors. It argues that
   nineteenth-century economic and geopolitical challenges generated two
   distinctive and enduring collective responses based on industry-labor
   cooperation in Denmark and state-industry cooperation in Finland. Those
   coalitions continue to shape the twenty-first-century experimentation,
   supporting investment in continuing education in Denmark and
   technological innovation in Finland. In explaining these differences,
   this article not only identifies an enduring and constructive role for
   strategic cooperation but also explains how it varies among ostensibly
   similar coordinated economies.},

Abstract = {Since the 1970s many firms expanded their operations across national
   borders and were restructured to fit the changing economic conditions
   during these times of economic globalization. Using a sociological
   approach to transnational firms, in this article the authors research
   the consequences of these developments for the responsibility of two
   transnational firms towards their employees in the Netherlands. These
   firms experienced a shift in their dual embeddedness in national and
   transnational economic fields, with the latter gaining importance. In
   response, they adjusted their corporate policies and structure to fit
   the competitive conditions of these fields, causing a centralization of
   their corporate labor policy on the transnational level, the
   polarization of this policy and the instrumentalization of labor and
   labor policy. This also meant that their responsibility for their
   employees was restructured and reduced.},

Abstract = {This article presents a call for political scientists to look seriously
   at videogames. Beginning with a demonstration of their growing
   importance, the article then sets out the existing game-related
   literature which demonstrates their persuasive potential. The importance
   of games for political studies is illustrated through an in-depth
   discussion of the link between videogames and the militarisation of
   politics and society: exploration of the role of the
   militaryentertainment complex, felt in particular through the
   militarisation of the content of games, suggests that this complex is
   influencing the militarisation of society. Finally, the article explores
   some of the ways in which such militarisation is being challenged
   through the use of games for political activism, centred on protests
   within game spaces and the development of critical games. While the
   article as a whole concludes that the forces that serve to legitimate
   the militaryentertainment complex are considerably greater than those
   which challenge it, and that the potential of games for activism is at
   present relatively limited, this does not mean that they are not worthy
   of study. Games retain considerable scope for both learning (with games
   offering vital potential to embed real social critique in players) and
   as potential sources for political activism, which is only likely to
   grow in the future.},

Journal = {REVIEW OF POLICY RESEARCH},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {29},
Number = {5},

Abstract = {This paper examines policy outputs associated with the 2004 Bhutan
   antitobacco law, including 2009 amendments, to determine if the law is
   congruent with punctuated equilibrium or social policy realism theories
   of policy change. There was no direct and sudden tobacco policy output
   change in Bhutan due to a shock to the policy system contrary to what
   punctuated equilibrium theory would predict. Rather, policy change was
   sweeping but nonpunctuated. This paper reconfirms prior findings of
   social policy realism theory that various and complex policy output
   patterns occur due to a mixture of contingent and complex factors. Under
   social policy realism, a complex interplay of factors drive policy with
   the state, corporate actors, and interest groups, and the market often
   playing a primary role. These complex policy outputs have a direct
   impact on society and the natural environment reflected in government
   policy output actions or inactions.},

Volume = {14},

Abstract = {In a seminal article published in 2004, John Street argued that
   celebrity politics has provided a greater expression for the enhancement
   of democratic behaviour. Consequently, this analysis builds on Street's
   thesis to consider the worth of celebrity politics in an era of late
   modernity. To this end, it employs Henrik Bang's and John Keane's
   constructs of Everyday Makers and Monitory Democracy, which have
   emphasised the importance of involvement, voice and output in terms of
   representation, to provide an ideological framework to capture the value
   of celebrity politics. Subsequently, it may be argued that Barack Obama
   utilised a form of liquid celebrity in his 2008 US presidential campaign
   to reconnect with a disenfranchised electorate. However, this article
   will critically assess these types of celebrity politics to contend that
   aggregated forms of input drawn from celebrity activism may more truly
   affect political outcomes.},

Abstract = {Studies of national identity distinguish between ethnic and civic
   nations and have sought to identify these alternative conceptions of
   national identity in public opinion. The standard measurement technique
   is to assess the normative content of American national identity by
   asking survey respondents to rate the importance of particular traits
   for making someone a true American. We argue that such measures are
   problematic, chiefly because of the impact of nonrandom measurement
   error. We explore the influence of using ranking measures instead of
   ratings, using a survey experiment conducted on a nationally
   representative sample of Americans in 2008. The ranking method is
   superior for distinguishing between ethnic and civic conceptions of
   nationhood and, therefore, for predicting preferences on issues such as
   immigration policy. We develop a new statistical method that effectively
   converts ratings into scores that approximate rankings, resulting in the
   creation of more valid measures of both ethnic and civic national
   identities.},

Abstract = {The notoriety that income inequality has achieved in the Chilean
   political debate since the presidential election of 2006 can be
   explained as a response discursively produced by Chilean political
   elites to a sense of frustration of people's expectations as a
   consequence of the unsatisfactory results reached after 21 years of the
   application of failed inequality-reducing policies. The discursive
   stratagems ranged from a recalling of the ``authoritarian enclaves{''}
   inherited from Pinochet's regime to the thesis that inequality can only
   be resolved by improving the quality of education. This latter stratagem
   became a technocratic mantra for the struggle against income inequality
   among Chilean political elites during the Bachelet administration and
   gave rise to the ideological exclusion of any political proposal that
   defended a more redistribution-oriented approach to the problem, an
   exclusion deeply rooted in the traumatic memory of those elites.},

Abstract = {National economies are embedded in complex networks such as trade,
   capital flows, and intergovernmental organizations (IGOS). These
   globalization forces impose differential impacts on national economies
   depending on a country's network positions. This article addresses the
   policy convergence-divergence debate by focusing on how networks at the
   international level affect domestic fiscal, monetary, and regulatory
   policies. The author presents two hypotheses: first, similarity in
   network positions induces convergence in domestic economic policies as a
   result of peer competitive pressure. Second, proximity in network
   positions facilitates policy learning and emulation, which result in
   policy convergence. The empirical analysis applies a latent-space model
   for relational/dyadic data and indicates that position similarity in the
   network of exports induces convergence in fiscal and regulatory
   policies; position similarity in the network of transnational portfolio
   investments induces convergence in fiscal policies; and position
   proximity in IGO networks is consistently associated with policy
   convergence in fiscal, monetary, and regulatory policies.},

Abstract = {Studies of environmental policy employ various empirical strategies for
   measuring state environmental effort. The majority of these strategies
   can be divided into four categories: indices of state programmatic
   indicators, government expenditures, pollution abatement costs, and
   regulatory enforcement actions. In this article, we argue that these
   measures are empirically distinct, capture different attributes of state
   environmental policy, and are correlated with different intrastate
   factors. Thus, the choice among environmental policy measures is
   substantively important for researchers to consider, and we conclude by
   providing advice to scholars concerning choosing among these measures.},

Abstract = {Chile's impressive record of economic growth over the past 20 years has
   come with significant impacts on the environment. Though Chile's
   postdictatorship governments have embraced a discourse of sustainable
   development and created new institutions to address environmental
   issues, ecological degradation has largely continued unchecked. The
   government of Michelle Bachelet promised a series of institutional and
   regulatory changes that would substantially renew and advance the
   state's commitment to greening Chile's development model. As did her
   predecessors, however, Bachelet governed in a milieu in which the
   ideology of neoliberal modernization and elite power resisted
   interference in the cycle of capital investment and accumulation. Two
   case studies, one concerning the salmon farming industry and the other
   hydroelectricity, reveal the ways in which apparently ``green{''}
   intentions were transformed into institutional support for the continued
   unsustainable exploitation of Chile's social and ecological capital.},

Title = {Democracy and Participatory Budgeting in Latin America. Mutation of
   Participatory Budgeting Outside of Brazil},
Journal = {REVISTA DEL CLAD REFORMA Y DEMOCRACIA},
Year = {2012},
Number = {53},
Pages = {61+},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The theoretical focus of participatory budgeting in Latin America has
   placed sufficient attention in the description and characterization of
   its dynamics of participation, and more recently on the relation with
   representative democracy. However, there has been insufficient
   comparative studies on the hypothesis that participatory budgeting,
   especially those which have developed in countries outside of Brazil,
   are consolidating as a neighborhood participatory institution, without
   reaching a strategic incidence in the definition of the public policies
   of city (community or municipality).
   The principal aim of this article is to study the participatory
   budgeting in three countries of Latin America, where it has developed
   for more than 10 years and analyze its conditions, and to offer a set of
   explanatory dimensions of this process. This aim will be realized
   through the preliminary analysis of the information obtained of the case
   studies of participatory budgeting of Uruguay, Chile and the Dominican
   Republic. Of these countries, the approximation was obtained indirectly,
   by means of a methodology of documentary review on the participatory
   budgeting in Latin America and in a complementary way direct sources
   were used (interviews with experts and key informants) to know the
   results of the process in the mentioned countries.
   From the description of the trend of the participatory budgeting in the
   three cases of interest, it is possible to deduce the presence of some
   conditions that are determining the development of this mechanism, even
   in contexts where different game rules prevail, such as, for example, a
   law that regulates its functioning. Definitively, in these cases the
   participatory budgeting is characterizes by not discussing in the
   process, the municipal budget nor other items, neither the strategic
   policies that are implemented at the municipal scale. It is not observed
   an intention for addressing major resources to the sectors most
   unprotected or affected by the predominant economic model; in the
   practice, the distribution is rather egalitarian using the criterion
   ``one inhabitant, one dollar{''}.
   Political will is determinant at the moment of implementing successfully
   the participatory budgeting, even when exists a modern legislation as
   that of the Dominican Republic and an institutional context
   pro-decentralization and participation as that of Uruguay; the mayors'
   political will ends up being a determinant for this mechanism of
   participative democracy. The principal risk of this trend is that
   participatory budgeting can be transformed into participative mechanisms
   co-opted by the representative actors, especially when civil society
   does not manage the processes, and the political will of their leaders
   is excessive, making the process mutate from the delegation of power to
   the renovation of concentration strategies of power and allowing
   clientary relations to be co-opted in participatory budgeting.},

Abstract = {The European Union (EU) is one of the world's most important policy
   promoters for gender equality. This article examines the benefits and
   limitations of EU gender equality policy making in two Western Balkan
   countries, Croatia and FYR Macedonia. Besides analyzing specific gender
   policy developments that can be attributed to the EU, particular focus
   is put on the women's movement activists' perceptions of the impact that
   accession may have on women and gender equality. The study demonstrates
   that while the Croatian and Macedonian EU accession processes have been
   beneficial to the introduction of new gender legislation and
   institutional mechanisms for the advancement of gender equality, the EU
   gender strategy has also shown serious limitations. Among these-and
   perhaps the most fundamental-is the strong contrast between stated goals
   and their actual implementation. I argue that unless profound
   institutional changes as well as changes in political culture take place
   in Croatia and Macedonia, the poor compliance with EU gender equality
   norms and policies will be hard to overcome.},

Abstract = {This paper takes a look at the foreign policy of President. Bashar
   al-Assad since the rebellion was launched in March 2011. In a
   potentially explosive social and economic context, the stability of the
   authoritarian regime is threatened by both external factors (regional
   power rivalries, the intervention of Western powers, processes of
   economic liberalization and regionalization) and internal problems. The
   economic weaknesses of the State and the fractures in national unity
   have blunted the relative autonomy that the Ba'ath leadership boasted in
   foreign policy. They also increase the possible threat that Syria will
   once again become a country of regional and international conflicts.},

   Outreach: A Methodological Note},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHINESE POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Pages = {77-88},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This methodological note is to introduce new social network analysis
   (SNA) data sets that can be used to visualize and analyze the global
   linkages of the World Uyghur Congress (WUC). The results show that first
   of all, the WUC and Rebiya Kadeer play central roles in mobilizing
   political activity around the globe. Second, human rights NGOs and other
   organizations from the Uyghur diaspora pervade the networks of the WUC,
   and are spearheading the coordination of events and the exchange of
   information. Third, the WUC is keen on connecting with government
   representatives and journalists. Fourth, a growing number of links exist
   between the WUC and news organizations. Such links are most obvious
   among news organizations situated within the same country, when a
   Uyghur-related event occurs. A quintessential example is observed in the
   SNA map, where Japanese press and media showed interest in reporting
   Uyghur news when WUC Secretary General Dolkun Isa visited Japan to
   promote the Uyghur issue in 2006. A case study of Uyghur linkages in
   Australia further demonstrates WUC influence over Uyghur activism in
   various corners of the world. The purpose of this paper is not only to
   provide the first visualization and empirical test in regard to WUC
   networks that China's government and various China observers have
   believed to exist. With this document, I also demonstrate how a network
   approach can provide alternate ways for researchers to conduct their
   respective studies on diasporic networks of Tibetans, Taiwanese, or
   Chinese.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH},

Pages = {289-304},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Case study evidence suggests that inequality between regions in
   federations affects the risk of secessionist conflict. However, the
   conventional quantitative literature on civil war has found little
   support for a link between economic inequality and civil war. We argue
   that this seeming discrepancy in part stems from differences in the
   conceptualization of inequality and its operationalization, which has
   focused on individual-level wealth differences. In contrast, we
   investigate regional-level inequality, which is more readily applicable
   to understanding possible incentives for internal conflict. We adopt a
   spatial approach, based on new geo-coded data on administrative units in
   31 federal states between 1991 and 2005, economic wealth, and ethnic
   settlements, and demonstrate strong evidence that regional inequality
   affects the risk of secessionist conflict. The results indicate that in
   highly unequal federations, both relatively developed and underdeveloped
   regions are indeed more likely to be involved in secessionist conflict
   than regions close to the country average. In addition, we provide
   evidence that exclusion from central state power as well as ethnic
   groups' access to regional institutions are associated with an increased
   risk for secessionist conflict. The findings on inequality remain robust
   even when controlling for other confounding factors such as country GDP,
   population and war history.},

Abstract = {De facto states are often dismissed as `failing states'. However, in
   Freedom House rankings of political rights and civil liberties, they
   sometimes perform better than their parent states - as has been the case
   with Nagorno-Karabakh. This article examines the development of
   democracy in Nagorno-Karabakh against a checklist of factors assumed to
   be relevant: cultural homogeneity, size, existential threats, role of
   the diaspora, and the consequences of continued non-recognition. Drawing
   on fieldwork and interviews with central actors, the authors conclude
   that, contrary to what might be expected, non-recognition has played a
   main role in the democratization process. (C) 2012 The Regents of the

Abstract = {Can states usher in more peaceful relations with their neighbors by
   signing agreements that delineate their territorial boundaries? Theory
   suggests such a possibility, but the empirical evidence to date remains
   limited by research design and variable measurement decisions. After
   assembling a new data set on international boundary agreements, the
   current study conducts the first thorough test of this question during
   the period 18162001. The findings indicate that once neighboring states
   settle their borders, they are less likely to go to war or experience
   militarized interstate disputes with one another. These pacific effects
   persist across numerous time periods even after controlling for joint
   democracy, a characteristic that both theory and this analysis show to
   be positively related to settled borders. Through these findings, the
   study suggests that signing international boundary agreements can bring
   neighbors a more peaceful relationship with one another, regardless of
   the characteristics of their respective governmental regimes.},

Abstract = {International cooperation often requires costly policy adjustments.
   States may worry, however, that such adjustments weaken their outside
   options, and thus reduce their bargaining power. How does uncertainty
   about the effects of policy adjustments on outside options influence the
   depth of cooperation that states can achieve? My game-theoretic analysis
   shows that uncertainty about outside options is an obstacle to deep
   cooperation. If states agree on deep cooperation, they have to
   compensate vulnerable states with weak outside options for their losses.
   Under uncertainty, states that are not vulnerable have an incentive to
   falsely claim that they are vulnerable (i) to avoid a side payment or
   (ii) to obtain compensation for being vulnerable. The result holds even
   if the added value of deep cooperation would be large enough to fully
   compensate the losers. In equilibrium, the more vulnerable state
   sometimes offers a side payment to the less vulnerable one. More
   broadly, the analysis reveals a new international cooperation problem
   and provides a new rationale for costly signaling mechanisms and
   delegation to international organizations.},

Abstract = {Thomas Christiano argues that the link between justice and democracy

   democratic procedures as the best, if not the only, acceptable way to

   that the link between justice and democracy lies in equally respecting

Abstract = {This article explores the normative dimensions of a growing political
   focus upon the grievances of the white working class. It asks whether
   these can be considered as forms of recognition claim, rather than
   framed simply as expressions of resentment. I assess the character of
   three different forms of recognition that are invoked in the rhetoric
   which this group has attractedrecognition as (i) liberal-egalitarian
   restitution; (ii) political inclusion; and (iii) cultural politics. And
   I observe the difficulties and dangers of pursuing the third of these
   strategies, while pointing to the potential significance for liberals of
   the first two. I conclude by alluding to the difficulties that the
   political theory of recognition faces from the proliferation of claims
   to recognition among groups in contemporary democratic society.},

Abstract = {This article defines status-differentiated rights and identifies
   examples from international principles, declarations, and conventions.
   Drawing on the work of Peter Jones and Will Kymlicka,
   status-differentiated rights are compared and contrasted to group and
   group-differentiated rights. Using JackDonnelly's three-tiered scheme of
   substance-interpretation-implementation, the article also demonstrates
   how status-differentiated rights complicate the equal-special rights
   binary; this is because some rights are status undifferentiated at one
   level, yet status differentiated at another. This article concludes that
   addressing the diverse harms faced by (members of) vulnerable status
   groups requires both ``ordinary{''} human rights and
   status-differentiated rights.},

Title = {Climate change and international water conflict in Central Asia},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {49},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {227-239},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {We engage in a critical assessment of the neo-malthusian claim that
   climatic changes can be an important source of international tensions,
   in the extreme even militarized interstate disputes. The most likely
   scenario is conflict over water allocation in international catchments
   shared by poorer, less democratic, and politically less stable
   countries, governed by weak international water management institutions,
   and exposed to severe climatic changes. The Syr Darya corresponds quite
   well to all these characteristics. If the neo-malthusian specter of
   conflict over water is empirically relevant, we should see signs of this
   in the Syr Darya. The riparian countries of the Aral Sea basin have
   experienced international disputes over water allocation ever since the
   USSR collapsed and, with it, existing water management institutions and
   funding. The worst such dispute concerns the Syr Darya, one of the two
   largest rivers in Central Asia. Based on hydrological data and other
   information we find that the only existing international water
   management institution in the Syr Darya has failed. Based on a coupled
   climate, land-ice and rainfall-runoff model for the Syr Darya, we then
   examine whether, in the absence of an effective international water
   allocation mechanism, climate change is likely to make existing
   international tensions over water allocation worse. We find that climate
   change-induced shifts in river runoff, to which the Uzbek part of the
   Syr Darya catchment is particularly vulnerable, and which could
   contribute to a deterioration of already strained Kyrgyz-Uzbek
   relations, are likely to set in only in the medium to long term. This
   leaves some time for the riparian countries to set up an effective
   international framework for water allocation and prevention of
   climate-induced geohazards. By implication, our findings suggest that a
   climate change-induced militarized interstate dispute over water
   resources in Central Asia is unlikely.},

Abstract = {This article examines how scholarly templates shape what is studied
   about women in the far-right, using data about women in the 1920s Ku
   Klux Klan and contemporary organized racism. First, it presents two
   templates that historically made women and gender issues invisible to
   scholars of the US right: the template of the rightist as male and the
   template of Nazi Germany as the prototype of far-right. Second, it
   considers three templates that exist in current scholarship: the
   template of historical continuity, the template of belief-driven
   activism, and the template of gender as a category of analysis. These
   latter templates have not precluded the study of women and gender on the
   right, but they have led to problems of focus and interpretation. It
   concludes by posing four questions that are likely to be particularly
   productive in the next stages of studies of gender in rightist movements
   in the US as well as for studies of extreme right and fascist movements
   more broadly across the globe.},

Title = {Are Suicide Bombers Suicidal?},
Journal = {STUDIES IN CONFLICT \& TERRORISM},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {35},
Number = {6},
Pages = {432-443},
Abstract = {Recent work by Ariel Merari argues that, while certain contextual
   factors increase the probability of suicide attacks, they do not explain
   why particular individuals become suicide bombers. Merari seeks to
   demonstrate that suicide bombers are motivated by an unusually high
   prevalence of depression and suicidal tendencies. This article questions
   the representativeness of Merari's sample. It raises the possibility
   that interviewer and contextual effects contaminated his findings.
   Finally, it presents evidence that challenges Merari's conclusions. This
   evidence is drawn from interviews with immediate family members and
   close friends of a 25 percent random sample of Palestinian suicide
   bombers who conducted attacks between 2000 and 2005. Based on their
   analysis, the authors question the value of a psychological approach to
   the study of suicide bombers and assert the importance of focusing on
   the political and social roots of the phenomenon.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICS},

Volume = {49},
Number = {1},
Pages = {59-77},

Abstract = {Recent work has identified new hierarchical relationships within
   international society. However, few scholars have provided a
   satisfactory account of what informs their formation, reproduction or
   constitutional effects for international society. We argue that
   underpinning the emergence of a more hierarchical international society
   is a new social logic of risk, which constructs illiberal and/or fragile
   states as potentially dangerous sites of instability and disorder that
   pose particular security risks for Western states. We proceed to argue
   that such risk-based hierarchies are transformative of both inter-state
   and intrastate relations, by stripping equal political agency from
   `risky' actors within and without the state. We demonstrate these claims
   by drawing on examples of international state building in Southeast Asia
   and the Southwest Pacific. International Politics (2012) 49, 59-77.

   GOVERNANCE AND PROCEDURAL FAIRNESS MATTER},
Journal = {PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {90},
Number = {2},
Pages = {313-334},
Abstract = {The article examines the implementation by the Italian Ministry of
   Health of performance-based funding to allocate resources for research
   to IRCCS (Istituti di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico)
   hospitals. The analysis provides evidence that ten years from its
   introduction the performance-based funding system has persisted, but it
   has been implemented rather differently from what had been imagined by
   its proponents. By drawing on the theoretical frameworks of policy
   implementation, agency, and relational contracting, the study
   establishes that the overall design of the system has contributed to
   this final outcome only to a limited extent. Rather, the lack of
   procedural fairness, as well as of political leadership in linking the
   system to national research priorities, has undermined the basis for
   trust between hospitals and the Ministry of Health. The article

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION},

Pages = {549-565},
Abstract = {The September 2008 collapse of American investment bank Lehman Brothers
   triggered a global financial crisis whose effects were quickly felt in
   European banking. The scale of the crisis and the speed with which it
   propagated through the sector prompted governments to take aggressive
   action. In the months following the onset of the crisis, EU governments
   approved guarantee schemes, recapitalizations, and asset relief measures
   worth over sic4.5 trillion. Such vast amounts of aid, necessary though
   it may have been, threatened to distort competitive conditions in the
   sector. To forestall this, the European Commission issued four `crisis
   communications' in which authorities set out how member states could
   best support financial institutions whilst respecting EU competition
   rules and thus avoiding undue distortions of competition. We argue that
   these guidance documents, though only non-binding soft law, not only
   helped preserve competition in the banking sector but also provided a
   policy resource that Commission authorities have used to restructure the
   banking sector.},

Abstract = {Presidential primaries in 2012 were more focused on domestic issues than
   on foreign and security policy of the United States. Democratic party
   had only one presidential candidate the incumbent president Barack Obama
   and therefore it lacked any primary debates. Republican candidates were
   not educated on the US foreign affairs and were more focused on debating
   internal issues of the country. However, the United States faces a
   handfull of international security challenges; whether it is Iranian
   nuclear program, current situation in Afghanistan or partnership with
   Russia or China. Although the United States still remains the only
   superpower, its role as a leader in the global environment is recently
   questioned. The following article compares and examines future foreign
   and security policy of the United States as well as topics which should
   have been covered during the presidential debates.},

Abstract = {The article contributes to the growing theoretical scholarship on NATO
   by developing a theoretical framework that demonstrates the complex
   relationship between doing and being, identity and action, and knowledge
   and practice. The article addresses the puzzle that NATO in the past
   decade has been busier than ever, yet has not managed to construct a
   strong narrative and maintain ontological security. The article presents
   a framework, which assumes that ontological security is influenced by
   identity and narrative construction processes, which are themselves
   reinforced or undermined by practical action, conceptualized as
   `functional action' and `rhetorical action'. By analyzing NATO's current
   and past narratives, practices, and action patterns, the article shows
   that NATO's recent crisis is not just a deeper and more serious crisis
   because Afghanistan is a difficult mission, but that the depth of the
   crisis is the result of changes in NATO's established practices and new
   fundamentally different patterns of action. International Polities

Abstract = {This study explores how a scientist's location in science-based policy
   networks can affect her policy-oriented behaviors. In particular, we
   hypothesize that those scientists who fill structural holes in their
   networks will be more likely than others to engage in policy-oriented
   behaviors. The network data are defined by scientists' coauthorship on
   policy documents regarding climate change in the Great Lakes. We employ
   a two-mode network analysis to identify clusters of scientists who
   coauthored similar documents, and relative to those clusters, we
   identify those who fill structural holes by bridging between clusters.
   We find that those scientists who bridged between clusters were more
   likely to engage in policy-oriented behaviors of policy advocacy and
   advising than were others in the network. This is an example of a link
   between network location and policy-oriented behavior indicative of the
   broader phenomenon of how individuals exert agency, given structural
   constraints.},

   maritime groups in the country have traditionally been the product of
   the actions and decisions of individual actors, although the current
   wave of activity is more the result of the weakening of political
   institutions. In all cases syndicates are driven by profit
   considerations and have largely shunned connections with political
   entities-although this latter factor appears to have changed since the
   end of 2010.},

Abstract = {Not all parliaments are subject to Freedom of Information (FOI), and no

   This article evaluates the impact of FOI on the UK Parliament by
   reference to its main objectives. It finds that FOI has made Westminster
   slightly more open and accountable; but it has not increased public
   understanding, participation, or trust. Westminster was already very
   open and other initiatives have helped increase participation. Trust was
   badly damaged by the MPs' expenses scandal, triggered by FOI requests.
   The House of Commons' hesitant response to those requests revealed
   problems of corporate governance.},

Abstract = {Much of the debate over the security implications of climate change
   revolves around whether changing weather patterns will lead to future
   conflict. This article addresses whether deviations from normal rainfall
   patterns affect the propensity for individuals and groups to engage in
   disruptive activities such as demonstrations, riots, strikes, communal
   conflict, and anti-government violence. In contrast to much of the
   environmental security literature, it uses a much broader definition of
   conflict that includes, but is not limited to, organized rebellion.
   Using a new database of over 6,000 instances of social conflict over 20
   years - the Social Conflict in Africa Database (SCAD) - it examines the
   effect of deviations from normal rainfall patterns on various types of
   conflict. The results indicate that rainfall variability has a
   significant effect on both large-scale and smaller-scale instances of
   political conflict. Rainfall correlates with civil war and insurgency,
   although wetter years are more likely to suffer from violent events.
   Extreme deviations in rainfall - particularly dry and wet years - are
   associated positively with all types of political conflict, though the
   relationship is strongest with respect to violent events, which are more
   responsive to abundant than scarce rainfall. By looking at a broader
   spectrum of social conflict, rather than limiting the analysis to civil
   war, we demonstrate a robust relationship between environmental shocks
   and unrest.},

Abstract = {Differentiated integration has been the subject of political discussion
   and academic thought for a long time. It has also become an important
   feature of European integration since the 1990s. By contrast, it is
   astonishing how poor our research and knowledge about the phenomenon is.
   Whereas there is an abundance of conceptual work and some normative
   analysis, positive theories on the causes or effects of differentiated
   integration are rare. Empirical analysis has concentrated on a few
   important cases of treaty law (such as EMU and Schengen) while there is
   no systematic knowledge about differentiated integration in secondary
   law. The aim of this article is therefore twofold: to review the
   existing typological and theory-oriented research and to outline a
   research agenda striving for systematic empirical and explanatory
   knowledge.},

Journal = {ETHNOPOLITICS},

Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Pages = {141-158},
Abstract = {While several studies have examined the relationship between various
   aspects of environmental degradation and civil conflict, there has been
   surprisingly little attention paid to the relationship between
   environmental degradation and instances of genocide and politicide.
   Although mentioned in the popular press as a key cause for instances of
   state-sponsored mass killings in Rwanda and Darfur, there is little in
   the way of quantitative empirical work that investigates the linkage
   between environmental degradation and genocide. In this paper, the
   relationship between freshwater and land degradation and the incidence
   of a genocidal and/or politicidal acts is examined. More specifically,
   it is examined whether environmental factors helped `trigger' genocidal
   and/or politicidal acts in 61 conflict-prone countries from 1958 to
   2007. It was found that land pressures contribute to the likelihood of
   the incidence of genocides and politicides more so than declines in
   freshwater availability, but civil war incidence and regime type remain
   powerful explanatory factors for state-sponsored mass murder.},

Abstract = {In this introduction to the Policy Study Journal's special issue on
   punctuated equilibrium, we provide an overview of the approach, how it
   evolved, some of the major critiques directed at it, and some of the
   major developments it has spawned. We argue that the most important
   aspect of a theory or framework is not whether it is right or wrong, but
   the extent to which it is fruitful; that is, the extent to which it
   stimulated further research. Finally, we review the articles in this
   issue and put them in context.},

Abstract = {Historically, the vast majority of policies to support renewable energy
   have been focused on the electricity sector, although interest is
   increasing in policies to advance renewables in the transportation and
   heating/cooling sectors. A wide range of renewable resources and
   technologies are available for generating electricity, and government
   policies need to account for the large variety that they represent with
   regard to stages of maturity, scales of deployment and generation,
   potential uses, and circumstances. Most policies directed toward this
   sector have focused on grid-connected generation, from very small
   photovoltaic (PV) systems to large-scale wind or hydropower projects.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses the current challenges of the multilateral trade
   system, which are reflected in the WTO Doha Round deadlock. The main
   patterns of trade have changed due to the rise of global value chains
   and the globalization of the world economy, characterized by an
   increasing dispersion and fragmentation of industrial production. The
   article discusses the way these changes are challenging traditional
   assumptions of the multilateral trade system and the WTO Doha Round
   negotiations. Taking Brazil as an example, the paper argues that the
   mismatch between the negotiating agenda and the new world trade
   realities dwells in the very WTO member countries, which, at a great
   extent, have not yet aligned its trade policies to the new dynamics of
   the international trade. Finally, we argue that during the last ten
   years Brazil's trade policy has not properly considered the important
   changes in the international trade patterns brought about by global
   value chains and economic globalization.},

Abstract = {This article applies a processual approach to the explanation of
   administrative reform in Italy over fifteen years. By carrying out a
   comparison between better regulation and digitalization policies it
   shows that the oscillation in the level of implementation over time and
   across policies can be explained by the intensity and direction of
   spillover and certification mechanisms and that in turn these mechanisms
   are activated by design features and contextual factors at different
   levels of analysis.},

Abstract = {`Why structural adjustment is necessary and why it doesn't work'
   published by Gavin Williams in ROAPE in 1994, highlighted the
   paradoxical nature of structural adjustment policies. Drawing on
   Williams's insights, this article examines the adoption and outcome of
   privatisation policies in South Africa from 1994 to 2010. The paper
   makes two claims that reinforce Williams's earlier arguments. First,
   privatisation was central to the effort by the post-apartheid government
   to secure a marriage between the state and capital through the expansion
   of black ownership. Yet, second, concerns over employment equity,
   preferential procurement, and unemployment forced the state to depend on
   parastatals after the turn of the century and in doing so, to abandon
   the privatisation of state assets. State-owned enterprises have now
   become an integral component of the state's developmental project in
   South Africa.},

Abstract = {This paper contributes to the academic literature on rebel group
   transitions, using the case of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF)
   in Mindanao, Philippines to analyze the use of religion and ideology as
   legitimizing strategies by rebel groups for enhancing civilian support.
   Drawing on empirical field research conducted with Maranao and
   Maguindanao communities during 2008-2010, the findings suggest that
   religion and ideology as legitimization strategies are of diminishing
   significance in the Moro conflict. This result is due to the following
   factors. First, due to shifts in the MILF's base structures, civilian
   proximity to MILF camps that defined intensity and overtness of support
   has waned; second, growing Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP)
   presence on the ground and infiltration of its security agents into
   communities has enhanced civilian fears about overt loyalty towards
   MILF. Finally, conflict related impacts of displacement have also
   negatively influenced levels of civilian support for the Bangsamoro
   struggle.},

Abstract = {Part of the state's job is to promote wealth creation that also provides
   public goods to enhance the broader population's life-chances. These
   systems for organizing economic life in a national political economy
   generally have to conform with widely held conceptions of how the
   economy should work to be legitimate and sustained. Support for the
   institutions that underpin citizens' welfare can be understood as a form
   of `economic patriotism' - where there is a consistent preference for
   economic activity to be channelled through particular institutions that
   serve a defined population. This article traces the role and development
   of mortgage institutions in Denmark and the US. I examine the challenges
   to these institutions from the recent financial crisis, including calls
   for their abolition or reform. I suggest that economic patriotism and
   everyday politics explains both the origins of these institutions and
   also why they will persist through current domestic, regional and
   international politico-economic troubles.},

Pages = {734-752},
Abstract = {Norwegian climate policy has been marked by several shifts with regard
   to adopted targets and measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.
   Three knowledge-based discourses - respectively a tax discourse, a quota
   discourse and a technology discourse - have been influential throughout.
   By tracing the development of Norwegian climate policy from 1989 until
   2008, it is shown, however, that while significant in early phases of
   policymaking, the discourses lose influence in the phase when policy
   solutions are designed and implemented. Those ideas and ambitions that
   characterise the ruling discourses in Norwegian climate policy are not
   necessarily materialised in actual policy.},

Journal = {CRITICAL POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {6},
Number = {3},
Pages = {304-323},
Abstract = {This article examines the use and interpretation of international
   comparisons in national policymaking in Finland and Portugal. By
   analyzing policy programs from a discourse-theoretically informed
   perspective the article addresses the question of how comparative
   discourses of international govermental organizations frame and shape
   the identity formation of their member states in the domain of public
   health policy. In the analyzed data the comparative information is
   mostly used to position the country at a disadvantage compared to
   others. Future objectives are set in order to overcome the disadvantage.
   However, the negative use of comparisons and assigned pejorative
   positions are also explicitly doubted. These doubts have opened the way
   for different self-identifications celebrating national originality. In
   temporal terms the detailed reading of policy documents covering four
   decades indicates that there has been a substantial change in the use of
   comparisons from averages towards best performers in the turn of the
   century.},

Abstract = {This article explores the recent regionalisation of Swedish governance -
   both policy and structure - in order to explore some of the aspects of
   research on Europeanisation that scholars in the field have recently
   signalled as especially problematic. We pay particular attention to the
   role of political cleavages, conflict and contestation, and to the
   construction and use of policy discourses surrounding European
   integration as a means of affecting domestic political change. Using the
   concept of `usages of Europe' from French political sociology, we trace
   the development of a network of actors which eventually succeeded in
   constructing EU membership as a tipping point in what had long been
   intractable domestic debates around regionalisation in Sweden, and argue
   that an understanding of the discursive uses of EU membership is vital
   if scholars are to appreciate how the EU can `hit home' even in the
   absence of strong formal powers.},

Title = {The Determinants of Policy Introduction and Bill Adoption: Examining
   Minimum Wage Increases in the American States, 1997-2006},
Journal = {POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {40},

Abstract = {Faced with long intervals between federal minimum wage increases in
   recent years, state legislatures are increasingly likely to take action.
   Motivated by the relative dearth of empirical work on minimum wages in
   the American states, this article considered various explanations to
   determine which factors are associated with legislative efforts to pass
   wage increases. Taking seriously the view that disagreements over the
   effects of minimum wage increases enhances the influence of political
   factors, we drew on the policy adoption and diffusion literature to
   examine how internal determinants (political and economic variables) and
   regional diffusion pressures relate to both the introduction and
   adoption of minimum wage legislation in the American states in the years
   between the last two federal minimum wage increases (19972006).
   Employing negative binomial regression to analyze annual bill
   introductions, we found that a number of political variables are related
   to the consideration of minimum wage increases. However, using event
   history analysis to examine annual adoptions of minimum wage increases,
   we found few of the same variables matter. We concluded with a
   discussion of the empirical results within the context of the broader
   policy literature and cautioned future scholars to consider seriously
   whether political factors exert distinct influences at different stages
   of the policy process.},

Abstract = {Since policies that address environmental concerns through ecological
   modernisation are thought to require regulation to achieve their aim,
   the form that regulation takes becomes crucial. Some suggest softer
   forms of regulatory governance are effective at inducing
   eco-innovations, while others support direct regulation. We endorse the
   view that both are needed, as firms respond to different approaches.
   Excessive faith in one approach is misplaced and may hinder ecological
   modernisation. To encourage ecological modernisation we need more
   individualised approaches, so that they accord with how firms behave
   when confronted with particular forms of regulation.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses the relationship between regulation and contracts
   in infrastructure industries and the role of regulation, particularly
   the role of regulatory agencies in the review, revision, and
   renegotiation of contracts. The paper starts with a short survey of
   relevant economic and legal issues. Examples are presented of how and
   why infrastructure contracts, including concession contracts, have been
   combined with monitoring and enforcement by external regulatory
   agencies. The examples discussed include historical UK experience,
   recent French experience, and developing country experience. The paper
   concludes with a discussion of the role that regulatory entities can
   play to reinforce trust and sustain contracts by enabling simpler
   contracts, resolving contract misunderstandings, and providing processes
   for ordered renegotiations.},

Abstract = {Immigrants' age at arrival matters for schooling outcomes in a way that
   is predicted by child development theory: the chances of being a high
   school dropout increase significantly each year for children who arrive
   in a host country after the age of eight. The authors document this
   process for immigrants in the United States from a number of regions
   relative to appropriate comparison regions. Using instrumental
   variables, the authors find that the variation in education outcomes
   associated with variation in age at arrival influences adult outcomes
   that are important in the American mainstream, notably English-language
   proficiency and intermarriage. The authors conclude that children
   experience migration differently from adults depending on the timing of
   migration and show that migration during the early years of child
   development influences educational outcomes. The authors also find that
   variation in education outcomes induced by the interaction of migration
   and age at arrival changes the capacity of children to become fully
   integrated into the American mainstream as adults.},

   constitutionalism have been widely accepted and institutionalized.
   Experimentalist governance is part and parcel of the world of liberal
   democratic constitutionalism. Second, it is not only governance in
   Europe that can be described in experimentalist terms. The concept is
   also useful to describe the dynamics of European constitutionalism.},

Abstract = {This article explores a fundamental shift in threats to property rights
   in Russia. Whereas extortion rackets and other forms of physical
   intimidation once posed the gravest threat to property rights, state
   actors are now the primary aggressors. Based on in-depth interviews and
   an original survey of Russian firms, the article demonstrates a dramatic
   decline in threats related to private coercion, due partly to firms'
   increased reliance on formal legal institutions. By contrast, state
   threats to property rights have increased sharply. Key threats include
   seizing firms' assets, illegal corporate raiding, extortion, illicit
   fines, and unlawful arrests of businesspeople.},

Abstract = {The European Union (EU) is seeking to generate stronger integration in
   the wider Europe without further enlargement by involving its immediate
   neighbours in various regional partnerships. What are the effects of
   such co-operation across the eastern borders of the EU and what are the
   prospects for bringing this region's countries closer to the EU without
   offering them the possibility of formal EU membership? Using the tools
   of social network analysis and regression methods, this article
   investigates the effect of the EU's external governance on the
   previously neglected societal level by focusing on cross-border
   inter-firm networks. The findings show that the diffusion of
   organizational practices is occurring within these networks which have
   emerged as the result of EU governance efforts abroad. The article
   explores the causal mechanisms of this diffusion, and also identifies
   factors that impede or catalyze the transfer of organizational
   practices. It also points to the relevance of neofunctionalism in
   explaining integration between the EU and its eastern neighbours.},

Title = {When risk-based regulation aims low: A strategic framework},
Journal = {REGULATION \& GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {6},
Number = {2},
Pages = {131-148},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This article develops a strategic framework for regulators to employ
   when choosing intervention strategies for dealing with low risks and
   reviewing performance, building on the analysis by the same authors in
   the previous edition of this journal. The framework occupies the
   operational middle ground between risk analysis and formal enforcement
   action. At its core is a matrix, the Good Regulatory Intervention Design
   (GRID), which provides a framework to categorize sites or activities on
   the basis of two factors: the nature of the risk and the nature of the
   regulatee. Using GRID, regulators can select which intervention tools to
   use, and determine the overall level of regulatory intensity that should
   apply. GRID is accompanied by the Good Regulatory Assessment Framework
   (GRAF) for agencies to use in reviewing their performance and provides a
   step-by-step process for enabling double loop learning. The article also
   argues that the process of developing such a framework highlighted the
   extent to which low risk and high risk regulation are distinct. Low risk
   means low priority. Justifying why certain risks should not receive much
   regulatory attention requires a particular type of engagement, and has a
   bearing on the regulatory strategies that are adopted.},

Abstract = {International Relations scholarship has begun to focus a great deal of
   attention on social networks and their influence on political outcomes.
   In this paper, we contribute to this effort by examining the network
   relationships of international non-governmental organizations (INGOs)
   across four issues areas: the environment, health, human rights, and
   development. Using originally coded data on over 4000 INGOs, we find
   that the characteristics of network relations across the four areas are
   in fact quite different. Further, we find that these differences are
   driven in part by the characteristics of the INGOs, including whether
   they are located in the global North or South and their ties to
   intergovernmental organizations. Finally, we highlight the crucial
   ``bridge{''} role of organizations that focus on a ``hybrid{''} of
   multiple issue-areas within the overall network.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE},

Volume = {6},

Pages = {60-82},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In 2005, the government of Indonesia and representatives of the Free
   Aceh Movement (GAM) signed a Memorandum of Understanding bringing almost
   30 years of violent conflict in Aceh to an end. At the centre of the
   agreement was the provision of an amnesty for GAM combatants that has
   been widely cited as one of the key reasons for the success of the Aceh
   peace process. This article assesses the price paid for that peace and
   its impact on democracy, rule of law and human rights in postconflict
   Aceh. It demonstrates that although the development of a human rights
   culture has not eventuated in the five years since the Acehnese war
   ended, general predictions about the negative impact of amnesties have
   not materialized in this case. Rather than leaving a significant debt,
   in this case peace has purchased democratic elections and marked
   improvements in the material respect for human rights.},

Title = {NGO monitoring and the legitimacy of international cooperation: A
   strategic analysis},
Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS},

Volume = {7},

Pages = {1-32},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {States often invite NGOs to monitor international cooperation. Under
   what circumstances are states likely to take this step? We argue that
   NGO monitoring allows states to provide domestic publics with credible
   evidence regarding successful cooperation, but that this credibility
   carries a cost: if states fail to cooperate, a participating NGO will
   expose this failure and thus delegitimize the cooperation effort. Our
   formal analysis indicates that states obtain a dual benefit from NGO
   participation: in addition to enhanced legitimacy, NGO scrutiny helps
   states credibly commit to high cooperation levels vis-a-vis each other.
   The increased costs of failure, however, may deter state use of NGO
   monitoring. Surprisingly, we find that NGO monitoring is the most useful
   for states when the cooperation cost is relatively low. We explore the
   empirical relevance of our theoretical argument in NGO monitoring of
   World Bank development projects and compliance with the Kyoto Protocol.
   We also explain why NGO monitoring has been disallowed in the Global
   Environment Facility. Our analysis provides a firm strategic foundation
   for the idea that NGO participation sometimes confers benefits to
   states, and our theory has several empirically falsifiable implications.},

Abstract = {Intelligence studies has traditionally talked in terms of `threats'
   though the idea of `risk' has now entered its language, as it has so
   many other areas of policy. The key distinction remains the notion of
   threat of intentional action to cause harm: this is the central
   preoccupation of intelligence agencies that would not normally consider
   risks that might arise from, say, the unintended outcomes of accidents
   or interrupted supplies of resources. Another distinction is that
   intelligence is normally preoccupied with increasing knowledge in
   conditions of ignorance or uncertainty, while risk analysis is more
   likely to be quantifiable. The perception of a ` new terrorism' has led
   to the importation of the ` precautionary principle' to intelligence
   with potentially dangerous consequences for democracy. This requires
   enhanced thinking and practice with respect to the oversight of
   intelligence activities, especially in developing security networks.},

Abstract = {This article summarizes literatures on power, status, and influence in
   sociology's group processes tradition and applies them to issues of
   diversity in organizations. Power-defined as the ability to impose one's
   will even against resistance from others-results primarily from position
   in a social structure. Influence-defined as compelling behavior change
   without threat of punishment or promise of reward-results largely from
   the respect and esteem in which one is held by others. Research
   identifies status as a foundation of influence differences in groups and
   indicates that members of disadvantaged status groups, such as women and
   minorities, will have decreased influence and face challenges in
   acquiring and using power. The literature also suggests solutions to
   these challenges, including self-presentation strategies of group
   motivation and institutional arrangements that support women and
   minority group members in powerful leadership positions.},

Abstract = {This article builds on lessons from Denmark and the Nordic area to offer
   a novel and comprehensive logic of action within the emerging political
   economy that may be used to assess the possible new roles that unions
   can take on. The authors argue that unions are capable of

   becoming responsible for pushing for a governance regime in a new and

Abstract = {This article presents an ethnographic study of life in an impoverished
   black urban neighborhood through the experiences and perspectives of a
   single mother of four. Her survival strategies shed light on the
   disproportionate effects of recent social policies on poor racial-ethnic
   minority groups. Having trouble paying bills is nothing new. As Carol
   Stack has shown, extended kinship networks offer crucial resources that
   can enable single-parent families to survive. Over the past decade and a
   half, however, welfare reform, increases in the rates of arrest and
   incarceration for poor black men, and a spate of evictions are putting
   serious pressure on networks that were already overextended and now have
   too few solvent members. Poor families are left in a precarious
   situation. The in-depth story of one woman illuminates the issues that
   many people in this precarious position face in everyday life.},

Abstract = {The scope and structure of international transitional justice (TJ)
   advocacy have changed significantly in two principal ways over the past
   two decades. First, international TJ advocacy has greatly expanded its
   purpose. While it used to be aimed primarily at discretionary mechanisms
   for societies to deal with past violence, it is now increasingly
   legalized and directed at broader issues, such as postconflict peace
   accords, and even longer-term goals, such as instituting democracy, rule
   of law and a culture of human rights. This legalization of TJ advocacy
   has had a profound impact on the acceptance of TJ as a norm or standard
   practice for state behavior after conflict. Second, international TJ
   advocacy has become much more professionalized and specialized. The
   professionalization trend has led to increasing calls for tangible
   indicators of the effectiveness of TJ projects, which, in turn, have led
   to increasing templatization of `best practices' around which most
   professional international TJ nongovernmental organizations (NGOs)
   converge. After presenting evidence of this important transformation,
   the article discusses its consequences for the future development of the
   TJ field.},

Abstract = {European Union Member States have committed themselves, individually and
   collectively, to the fight against impunity for serious international
   crimes. The record is, however, ambiguous: support for the current
   investigations of the International Criminal Court is uneven and Member
   States are reluctant to exercise universal jurisdiction and develop
   binding common policies under the third pillar. This article assesses
   the extent of the discrepancy between stated normative preferences and
   flexible practices. It argues that this discrepancy results from the
   clash of accountability with other prevailing norms and interests, on
   the one hand, and from the lack of effective drivers pushing Member
   States towards increased commitment to combat impunity through a set of
   social mechanisms such as rhetorical action and socialization, on the
   other.},

   offering a typology of interactions surrounding the exchange and
   interpretation of information through (i) shared databases, (ii) liaison
   officers, (iii) training programmes and (iv) transfer of threat images.
   This allows sketching a more nuanced picture of the field of EUUK

Journal = {EUROPE-ASIA STUDIES},

Volume = {64},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {597-620},
Abstract = {Muslim integration in Russia is traditionally treated as a distinct
   field of research due to the diverse nature of Muslim communities and
   particular state approaches to ethnic and religious tolerance. The essay
   discusses Russia's historic engagement with Islam and suggests that some
   of its contemporary developments should be examined through a comparison
   of similar and different attempts to institutionalise Islam in Britain
   and France. The value of such a comparison lies in better understanding
   similar challenges to promoting moderate forms of Islam and engaging
   with Muslim representative institutions within different national
   contexts. Although the three countries developed different policies for
   integrating Muslim citizens, there is a degree of convergence in state
   determination to impose tighter security measures while using more
   integrationist rhetoric. Russia's engagement with Muslim communities
   provides an interesting hybrid which is partly reminiscent of Britain's
   multicultural aspirations and partly of France's drive for regulatory
   efficiency.},

Abstract = {Analysts should expect neither too much from European Union identity and
   its causal role in driving the integration process, nor too little, by
   underestimating the stabilizing force of implicit identification with
   the EU. Daily transactions in an EU institutional context embed an
   acceptance of the EU as a legitimate political authority and underpin
   passive consent to the continued functioning of the EU. The emergence of
   explicit EU identification is contingent upon the value (real and
   symbolic) attached to transactions, the extent to which valued goods are
   perceived to be under threat and whether competing political authorities
   are viewed as legitimate.},

Journal = {EUROPE-ASIA STUDIES},

Volume = {64},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1101-1126},
Abstract = {In this article we investigate the potential for and limitations of land
   consolidation as a tool for rural development in transitional
   environments, focusing on the Khorezm region in Uzbekistan, Central
   Asia. We frame our analysis in a broader evaluation of land
   consolidation as a tool for economic development based on European
   experiences. It is argued that both the European tradition and the Uzbek
   case indicate that land consolidation as an isolated measure may trigger
   many unfavourable side-effects, and that in a transitional environment
   it requires even more careful tailoring of measures and embedding in
   various institutional settings.},

Title = {The Competing Kings of Cotton: (Re)framing the WTO African Cotton
   Initiative},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {17},
Number = {3},
Pages = {313-337},
Abstract = {Since 2003, the West and Central African (WCA) cotton initiative in the
   World Trade Organization has stood as an ambitious case of Africa's
   desire to be integrated into the trading system and yet also receive
   reparations for past injuries. This article seeks to explore how and why
   the initiative debuted through close attention to the interdependence
   between power and language in diplomatic practice. It takes the concept
   of cognitive framing to explore the relationship between political
   legitimacy and mobilisation capacities. The genesis of cotton as `an
   issue' is critically examined, focusing on how the WCA countries
   constructed a novel `competitive victim' frame to define themselves and
   the problem. While this opening move was effective, it also featured
   tensions that were exploited by Northern actors who were threatened by
   the campaign. I argue that what followed was the introduction of a
   politically driven `counterframe', which divided the problem into a
   `trade-related' component and a `development-related' component. It is
   important to understand why and how this distinction was constructed and
   monitored. By scrutinising the relationship between framing and
   institutional power, I suggest that the counterframe won over the
   original frame, leading to a re-positioning of the demanders and a
   re-calibration of their expectations.},

Abstract = {In this research note, I introduce a new concept for examining women's
   political representation. This concept deals with women's representation
   both in parliaments and governments. I name the new concept ``women's
   representation in national politics.{''} The empirical results of this
   study demonstrate that the independent variable region is the variable
   with the greatest explanatory power of the independent variables used in
   this study. The results show that Scandinavia has extraordinarily high
   levels of female representation in national politics. The results also
   show that three countries in Oceania-Nauru, Palau, and Tuvalu-do not
   have any female representation in national politics.},

Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {17},
Number = {3},
Pages = {293-312},
Abstract = {How has industrial restructuring and technological upgrading in South
   Korea undertaken in the post-crisis era impacted on the state's capacity
   to guide strategic industry development? The latest reincarnation of the
   `end of the developmental state' thesis proposes that industry policies
   are losing their strategic long-term oriented character due to the
   state's lack of legitimacy to play a guiding role after the economic
   recovery. I test this view in light of the Korean state's role, since
   the early 2000s, in the promotion of a new mobile communications
   software standard known as the Wireless Internet Platform for
   Interoperability (WIPI). I argue that the Korean state retains a
   strategic long-term approach to techno-industrial governance. The
   argument is developed through examining how bureaucratic actors gained
   the legitimacy to challenge Qualcomm, the strategy involved in promoting
   WIPI, and how the bureaucracy supported domestic firms under an
   increasingly open international trading environment. The findings reveal
   the state's ability to renew its legitimacy to play a developmental role
   through re-articulating policy goals from catching-up to nurturing
   innovation. Furthermore, the state has experimented with new forms of
   cooperation between government and business to nurture the growth of new
   infant technological growth sectors such as telecommunications.},

Journal = {INTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY},

Pages = {241-260},
Abstract = {The article presents an intelligence case gone bad during the Second
   World War, when the United States decided to drop a three-man OSS group
   into Hungary. Hungary, a close ally of Germany, after seeing that the
   war was not going to end with an Axis victory, wished to seek contact
   with the Western Allies in order to try to find a way out of its
   precarious situation. The study, based mainly on archival research,
   shows the evolution of the Sparrow Mission, whose goals are still
   unclear today. Both the preparations and the timing of the mission seem
   to indicate that the plan had some influence on the German decision of
   occupying Hungary in March 1944, and such a German move helped the
   Normandy landing of the Allies a few months later.},

Abstract = {This essay shows how the various Islamic communities or jamaats that
   emerged in the Muslim republics of the Russian North Caucasus during the
   early 1990s have evolved since then. Originally conceived as peaceful
   religious organisations embracing strict Islamic Salafi principles, many
   of these communities have transformed themselves into fighting units
   sharing many of the traits of jihadist Islamic movements worldwide. By
   analysing the radical Islamic discourse and the strategies of leading
   jihadist fighters in the Russian North Caucasus, this essay also
   illustrates how their views, ideas and tactics have become similar, if
   not identical, to the beliefs that are being held and the practices that
   are being conducted by fighters of global and regional jihadist
   movements worldwide.},

   conflicts, many of the everyday realities these young soldiers
   experienced still remain unclear and continue to be under-researched.
   Through the use of biographical interviews, this essay retrospectively
   explores the ways in which war in Nagorno-Karabakh impinged on male
   teenagers' identities. A biographical approach not only reveals these
   former young soldiers' experiences which may have otherwise never been
   told but also allows them to reflect on their war experiences more than
   ten years later. In this way, we aim to complement existing research on
   the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict with new insights.},

Abstract = {In this article, shortcomings with US domestic counter-terrorism
   intelligence and associated efforts since 2000 are analysed. Potential
   suggestions for the extended development of the Federal Bureau of
   Investigation (FBI) are then discussed. Some of these propositions touch
   on developments involving the domestic intelligence and security
   services of other countries, and explore their use concerning the future
   optimization of the FBI in the area of domestic counter-terrorism
   intelligence. Within the overall culture and operational approach of the
   FBI, today greater sustained emphasis still needs to be accorded to the
   `intelligence methodology' of `wait and watch'. Simultaneously, the FBI
   needs to keep moving more from mainly a post facto emphasis to more of
   an a priori one in its investigations. Thereby, the FBI can continue to
   move towards improved delivery and better meet its role as a guarantor
   of US national security in a timely manner as the twenty-first century
   progresses.},

Abstract = {Data from the 1998 to 2005 waves of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics
   are used to assess the particularistic mobility thesis, which maintains
   that among women there is a racialized continuum in the determinants of
   and timing to mobility into two ``upper-tier{''} occupational
   categories. Findings support this theory, though racial gaps along the
   continuum are greater for professional/technical than for
   managerial/administrative positions. Specifically, the route to mobility
   for African Americans is relatively narrow and structured by traditional
   stratification causal factors, including human capital, background
   status, and job/labor market characteristics. In contrast, the route to
   mobility for whites is relatively broad and unstructured by the
   stratification-based causal factors, and they experience mobility the
   quickest. Along both dimensions, Latinas occupy an intermediate position
   between African Americans and whites. Implications of the findings for
   understanding racial inequality among managers, executives, and
   professionals are discussed.},

Abstract = {While neoliberal institutionalists argue that treaties facilitate
   collective action, many North-South regulatory treaties focus on largely
   national problems in developing countries. As such, these treaties
   present a puzzle: why a global treaty to address national regulatory
   problems? We argue that while activists in industrialized countries
   often promote regulatory treaties, these treaties garner political
   support among developing countries because they allow governments to
   enhance their national regulatory capacity. Developing countries are
   often not interested in banning practices such as trade in hazardous
   waste. Instead, developing countries want to increase their ability to
   control them. We test the argument against data on the global regime for
   hazardous waste trade. Contravening the conventional wisdom, we find
   that weak regulatory capacity is a powerful predictor of ratification of
   the Basel Convention, a treaty that does not ban hazardous waste trade
   but allows regulatory enhancement. By contrast, other treaties in the
   regime that do aim at banning hazardous waste trade receive little
   support among developing countries.},

Abstract = {The Lisbon Treaty represented a rare opportunity to redesign
   parliamentary control of the European Commission's delegated powers. The
   new Treaty distinguishes between delegated and implementing acts and
   specifies that comitology rules must be decided by a co-decision
   regulation. This necessitated a reform of the comitology system, which
   was decided in December 2010 after protracted inter-institutional
   negotiations. This article asks why the new control system took its
   final form. The negotiations as a game of control positions are analyzed
   and the course of the negotiations is traced through documents and
   interviews. Support is found for the article's hypotheses, but it is
   also the case that events in some respects went further than expected.},

Abstract = {This article explores the process of Disarmament, Demobilization and
   Reintegration (DDR) in Northern Ireland. In particular, it examines the
   role and experiences of former combatants who were incarcerated during
   the Troubles. It is shown that upon release from prison, many of these
   former combatants have played key roles in the development of
   community-based initiatives, which have not only facilitated the
   reintegration of former prisoners but also contributed to a broader
   process of postconflict regeneration and social development. The author
   considers the notion of expanding the `R' phase of DDR, and contends
   that additional attention needs to be paid both to the specific needs of
   former combatants/former prisoners and to their involvement in the
   overall process of reintegration and peacebuilding.},

Abstract = {This article examines the framing of the European Union in British media
   debates surrounding the negotiation of the Lisbon Treaty. As such, it
   analyzes the discursive context in which both citizens' attitudes and
   government policies towards the EU are formed. It identifies a
   predominant, Eurosceptic discourse that dictates the terrain on which
   wider debates about the EU are conducted. This discourse views the EU
   through the lens of the nation-state and frames the relationship between
   the United Kingdom and the EU in terms of separation and threat. The
   United Kingdom is excluded from the EU mainstream, which works to
   undermine its interests.},

Abstract = {This article examines the ongoing work of the Canadian Truth and
   Reconciliation Commission (TRC), which is charged with addressing that
   country's past policy of attempting forcibly to assimilate indigenous
   children in residential schools. It examines the TRC's mandate and its
   activities while assessing the Commission's conceptions of truth and
   reconciliation by placing these ideas in their societal context and
   explaining how they appear to have been produced. As the article shows,
   these conceptions reflect the prior struggles of victims against
   particular Canadian forms of indifference and denial, struggles that
   have led the TRC to take what recent literature calls a `victim-centred'
   and, following Mikhail Bakhtin and Teresa Phelps, `carnivalesque'
   approach. Despite the TRC's impressive strengths, the author argues that
   its approach unfortunately fosters the absence of a more detailed and
   accountability-promoting examination of the agents and institutions
   responsible for the injustices. Ultimately, this article is about the
   underlying sociology of knowledge production that shapes the Canadian
   TRC.},

Abstract = {In the early years of HIV, when fear and panic took a lead in the
   absence of scientific evidence, countries imposed restrictions for
   foreigners with HIV. However, evidence made it clear in HIV's first
   decade that border restrictions for international travellers living with
   HIV were an ineffective, costly, and impractical public health strategy.
   Thanks to efforts from different corners, the number of countries with
   such restrictions has come down remarkably. Advocacy efforts led by the
   Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS ( UNAIDS) are ongoing with
   countries where foreigners still face HIV-related restrictions for
   entry, stay or residence.
   The issue has been reportedly settled in India and South Korea in 2010.
   Both these countries are thus considered to be in the `solved' category
   of countries. However, this policy and practice note unearths some gaps
   that exist in translating this policy-level change into practice.
   Governments in India and South Korea, other national governments, civil
   society at large, and international human rights organizations have
   their roles to play in bridging these gaps. The note further explains
   the importance of tying up these loose ends in human rights protection
   urgently, and suggests ways to accomplish it.},

Abstract = {As a direct result of the 1995 welfare reform legislation, some
   metropolitan areas relocated women on their welfare rolls through a
   process called ``Greyhound therapy.{''} Many of these women ended up in
   rural areas that were not only unprepared to meet their specific needs
   but also not receptive to their presence. This article tells the story
   of these women, who were moved almost two hundred miles from a large
   Pennsylvania city to a small town in a rural region.},

Abstract = {A great deal has been written about the Korean War, but most of it has
   dealt with high-level decision-making or the experiences of combat units
   and soldiers. This article takes a different approach, looking at the
   reactions of Chinese citizens to the war and the way their perceptions
   were molded in part by the Communist regime and in part by memories of
   the brutal Japanese occupation in the 1930s and 1940s. Formerly
   classified Chinese documents shed valuable light on the way popular
   attitudes affected the Communist authorities and vice versa. The regime,
   led by Mao Zedong, exercised harsh rule in China, but ordinary citizens'
   observations and judgments were not necessarily the product of Communist
   Party programs. The regime also had to be constantly mindful of popular
   morale. The ``Resisting America and Assisting Korea{''} campaign was
   devised and controlled by the Communist Party but was also shaped in
   part from below.},

Abstract = {This project studied the effect of immigrant in-mobility on the
   trajectory of socioeconomic change in neighborhoods. The authors suggest
   that immigrant inflows may impact neighborhoods due to the consequences
   of residential mobility and the extent to which these new residents
   differ from the current residents. The authors use Southern California
   over a nearly 50-year period (1960 to 2007) as a case study to explore
   the short- and long- term impact of these changes. The authors find no
   evidence that immigrant inflow has negative consequences for home
   values, unemployment, or vacancies over this long period of time.
   Instead, the authors find that a novel measure they develop-a general
   measure of social distance-is much better at explaining the change in
   the economic conditions of these neighborhoods. Tracts with higher
   levels of social distance experienced a larger increase in the vacancy
   rate over the decade. The effect of social distance on home values
   changed over the study period: whereas social distance decreased home
   values during the 1960s, this completely reversed into a positive effect
   by the 2000s.},

Abstract = {This article examines the `SWIFT affair', whereby United States security
   authorities acquired access to financial data of European citizens, and
   argues that it is a powerful lens through which to understand current
   shifts in European security governing. The affair demonstrates the
   institutional challenges produced by the deployment of private,
   commercial data for security, and analyzes the ad hoc innovations
   produced in European Union (EU) governing as a result. Furthermore, the
   SWIFT affair has allowed the EU to position itself in the global
   security landscape as a normative power that promotes the values of
   privacy and data protection. However, the development of a European
   Terrorism Financing Tracking System, coupled with the way in which the
   EU itself is keenly implementing risk-based and data-led internal
   security measures, means that critical attention to the EU's own
   security practices remains urgent.},

Abstract = {Research on regulation has crossed paths with the literature on policy
   instruments, showing that regulatory policy instruments contain
   cognitive and normative beliefs about policy. Thus, their usage stacks
   the deck in favor of one type of actor or one type of regulatory
   solution. In this article, we challenge the assumption that there is a
   predetermined relationship between ideas, regulatory policy instruments,
   and outcomes. We argue that different combinations of conditions lead to
   different outcomes, depending on how actors use the instrument.
   Empirically, we analyze 31 EU and UK case studies of regulatory impact
   assessment (RIA) a regulatory policy instrument that has been pivotal in
   the so-called better regulation movement. We distinguish four main
   usages of RIA, that is, political, instrumental, communicative, and
   perfunctory. We find that in our sample instrumental usage is not so
   rare and that the contrast between communicative and political usages is
   less stark than is commonly thought. In terms of policy recommendations,
   our analysis suggests that there may be different paths to desirable
   outcomes. Policymakers should therefore explore different combinations
   of conditions leading to the usages they deem desirable rather than
   arguing for a fixed menu of variables.},

Abstract = {This article explains how institutional rules change after they have
   been established in two important areas of European decision-making:
   co-decision and comitology. It shows how legislation under co-decision
   was transformed into fast-track legislation and why the Parliament
   gradually between treaty reforms gained more institutional power in
   comitology. The rational choice institutionalist explanation applied
   here focuses on the efficiency increasing/transaction cost saving
   aspects of interstitial institutional change, but also on the question
   of who gains and who loses in power under specific rules and how power
   may subsequently be shifted. The hypotheses derived from the theoretical
   considerations are subject to empirical (dis)confirmation on the basis
   of quantitative and qualitative empirical data collected on co-decision
   and delegation over time. The conclusion summarizes the argument and
   explores the applicability of the explanations to two other polities of
   regional integration: North Atlantic Free Trade Association (Nafta) and
   Mercosur (the Common Southern Market).},

Abstract = {Liberal capitalist polities are being held up as the ultimate
   civilizational achievement precisely at a point in time when the
   energy-demanding built environments and growth imperatives of these
   societies are threatened by global climate change and the coming end of
   cheap and abundant carbon energy. Throughout the twentieth century, this
   pattern of energy-intensive social reproduction was largely shaped by
   the oil and gas sector creating what I call a petro-market civilization.
   However, given the challenges presented by peak oil and global warming,
   transitioning to a low-carbon or green energy future has gathered
   increasing attention and investment. In this paper, I use a power theory
   of value approach to offer a preliminary assessment of whether this
   transition is likely given the entrenched power of the oil and gas
   sector in the economy. Although the twenty-first century may bear
   witness to a renewable and sustainable energy paradigm, current evidence
   suggests that investors are continuing to capitalize an unsustainable
   future premised upon non-renewable fossil fuels.},

Abstract = {This article speaks to the emerging literature by critical scholars of
   race and gender focused on Private Militarized Security Companies
   (PMSCs) working in conflict and post-conflict settings. As one aspect of
   a wider project to illuminate concerns of security and the masculinized
   world of the private security contractor, I develop the concept of
   fratriarchy to bring into sharp relief the potential consequence of
   contractors' relative operational freedom within the context of close,
   yet sometimes competitive brotherly relations. Here, I go on to consider
   the means by which a small group of US Embassy guards in Kabul created
   dense intra-masculine bonds within a wider hierarchy of men through
   norm-bound, homoerotic practices. From the view of those involved, these
   practices may well have neutralized the threat of homosexuality through
   cementing heteronormative relations among the hegemonic members. In
   discussing three images depicting sexualized activities drawn from the
   2009 Kabul Hazing, I argue that intimate forms of embodiment intersect
   with processes of racialization in politically important ways. In
   conclusion, it is tentatively argued that the Kabul Hazing and wider
   discussions of the industry conceived of through the lens of fratriarchy
   provide the emerging feminist security studies literature with a closely
   focused resource with which to augment claims located at higher levels
   of abstraction around the process of (re)masculinization argued to be
   underway in this exemplary sphere.},

Abstract = {This essay presents a micro-level analysis of ethnic identity
   construction among ethnic Germans resident in Ul'yanovsk. The essay
   explores the local and trans-local situation of this group within a
   historical framework which informs the group's understanding of how to `
   be German'. It shows respondents' participation in ` return'-based,
   family-orientated diaspora networks. Analysis of the divergent
   discourses that emerge around the theme and experiences of mutual visits
   and travel to the Federal Republic of Germany and the differing identity
   outcomes which result are discussed. This reveals the ways in which
   transnational links can be utilised by non-movers both to problematise
   and to augment their local identities. This, in turn, uncovers the
   continuing relevance of issues around postSoviet ` returns' for
   contemporary identity-construction and highlights the potential for
   analysis of non-movers as participants in migration networks.},

Booktitle = {CHINESE PERSPECTIVES ON GLOBALIZATION AND AUTONOMY},

Abstract = {Neo-internationalism is a product of the times mainly espousing the
   cause of peace and development. It is constituted of the following basic
   ideas: joining international system and international institutions,
   pursuing cooperation and win-win situation, participating in regional
   community building. China's current diplomacy conveys many more elements
   of the neo-internationalism, which has already facilitated the economic
   and social development in China, and also strengthened the legitimacy of
   Chinese political system. As a rapid developing country, China needs to
   combine both patriotism and internationalism, to abandon narrow-defined
   nationalism, to bear our necessary responsibility as an international
   member state.
   In recent years, some new development trends of nationalism have emerged
   in the country as our comprehensive national strength kept rising.
   Nationalism is essential during the course of nation-state building, and
   it is an important aspect of the interaction between the state and
   society, containing an element of patriotism. But nationalism also
   contains some extreme elements. Ultranationalism often defines national
   interests narrowly, urging pursuit of national interests with extreme
   means. It looks like patriotism in form but seriously hurts the
   interests of nation-state in essence.
   Since the beginning of the 20th century, nationalism has become a key
   factor influencing China's development. Meanwhile, during the course of
   people's liberation and socialist construction led by the Communist
   Party of China (CPC), internationalism had been running through with its
   meanings continued to evolve as the characteristics of the times
   changed. Today, times have changed and China's diplomacy also enters
   into a critical period. Today China not only needs to promote China
   needs patriotism but simultaneously should abandon irrational
   ultranationalism; China also needs internationalism that is
   neo-internationalism in the times of peace and development.},

Journal = {INTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {27},
Number = {2},
Pages = {172-186},
Abstract = {Since the events of 9/11 the terms `threat' and `risk'have entered the
   daily lexicon to a greater extent than ever before. News media report on
   changes to national threat assessments, commenting when the threat level
   rises from ` Moderate'to ` Substantial', in the case of the United
   Kingdom. The British government recently released a document that
   provided details of the issues that pose the highest risk to the
   national infrastructure. All of these are based, so we are told, on the
   work of the national intelligence agencies. But what are these
   indicators actually telling us and what is the relationship between
   threat assessments and risk assessments? These are both important
   questions because important decisions aremade as a result of changes in
   these assessments. National defence and security planning is based upon
   perceived threats and risks. An entire risk management industry has
   grown up in the business world that covers everything from health and
   safety to financial risk. It is not only governments and businesses that
   base decisions on these indicators, but individuals as well. Tourists
   planning holidays in Europe were alarmed when the British, French and
   German governments increased their threat levels in response to
   intelligence that suggested that an attack against tourist sites in
   their respective capitals was imminent. Some will have changed their
   plans and travelled elsewhere, to the detriment of the tourist industry,
   while otherswill have chosen to defy the terrorists and travel anyway -
   potentially placing themselves in harm's way. With so much at stake,
   both nationally and individually, it is therefore important that we
   understand the difference between a ` threat'and a ` risk'and, as
   scholars of intelligence, the role that intelligence plays in assessing
   them.},

Journal = {EUROPE-ASIA STUDIES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {64},
Number = {4},
Pages = {673-693},
Abstract = {Slovenian employment policy was subject to `soft' Europeanisation
   despite the lack of normative resonance between entrenched policy ideas
   and new policy ideas embedded in the European Union's Employment
   Strategy. The key mechanisms at work are shown to be voluntary policy
   transfer and diffusion, rather than strategic use of Europe by key
   domestic actors to bring about policy change. This article argues that
   normative resonance is not a necessary condition for `soft'
   Europeanisation and highlights the importance of other domestic factors,
   such as norms of consensus-seeking and relative independence from
   international financial capital as mediating factors that can explain
   policy impact.},

Abstract = {Identifying the emerging trends in contemporary politics as life
   politics, this article revisits the notion of issue publics (an
   auxiliary concept developed to explain variability in attitudes and
   behavior within the public) and extends its theoretical concept in the
   context of life politics (a term relating to the choices people make
   every day and the politics of personal interests). It argues that
   publics consist of pluralistic groups of people who consider particular
   issues personally important based on self-interest, collective identity,
   and values. This article pays particular attention to how the new media
   environment, characterized by the development of digital media and the
   adoption of entertainment-oriented, personalized media in politics,
   contributes to the facilitation of issue publics in life politics.},

Abstract = {The establishment of European Regulatory Networks (ERNs) has been
   presented as a way to promote the uniform implementation of EU law in a
   range of issue areas. This article argues that the level of
   co-ordination achieved in ERNs crucially depends on the level of
   interdependence between Member State authorities in a given issue area.
   Drawing on a survey among national representatives in two ERNs and a set
   of in-depth interviews, it shows that both the uniformity of
   implementation and the use of common purpose as a way to reach
   co-ordination are strongly associated with the perceived level of
   interdependence.},

Abstract = {Export control of dual-use goods and technologies is a crucial element
   of the security policies of countries that are exporters of technology,
   aimed at avoiding the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. One
   of the main features of the EU regime of export control is that it poses
   challenges in terms of the EU competence that refers to the common
   commercial policy and to the security policy. Indeed, this article
   analyzes the developments concerning the EU competence in this field and
   how the different nature of the competences has influenced the EU export
   control regime. Moving from the origins of the Community regime for
   export control, mainly in the context of the completion of the internal
   market in the early 1990s, particular attention will be devoted to the
   limits of Regulation 1334/2000 setting up a Community regime for the
   export control, and of subsequent Regulation 428/2009.},

   trade, level of development and degree of democracy all contribute to
   increasing participation. Moreover, variation in national economic and

   agricultural sector. Three aspects of WTO rules that will affect Russian
   agriculture are examined: (1) financial support from the Russian
   government, (2) market access for foreign imports, and (3) market access
   for Russia's food exports. Addressing the question of positive and
   negative impacts on Russia's agricultural sector, the article asks if a
   pessimistic view that sees primarily negative consequences as a result
   of accession is justified. Claims made by skeptics who are dismissive of
   the impact WTO entry will have on Russian agriculture are also
   considered.},

Abstract = {The crisis of 2007-09 was prefigured by bubbles in the housing and
   mortgage credit markets of major Organisation for Economic Co-operation
   and Development (OECD) countries. A comparison of the United States, the
   United Kingdom, and France reveals that, contrary to popular perception,
   the two European countries had a bigger housing price bubble, more
   volatility, and a more short-termist mortgage market. Yet, the fallout
   of the crisis-in terms of overindebtedness of mortgage holders,
   foreclosures of homes, and the extent to which the ``nest-eggs{''} of
   households were devalued-has been worse in the United States. This
   article explores which differences in the use of credit markets for the
   social policy of promoting homeownership can account for this puzzling
   finding.},

Abstract = {We analyze the recent Flynn Report and assess its implications for the
   future of military intelligence in Afghanistan. In particular, we argue
   that the report seeks to expand the substantive tasks of the military
   intelligence practitioner, while collapsing nontrivial aspects of
   existing organizational hierarchies. We argue that implementation of the
   Flynn Report's proposals would match poorly with the traditional nature
   of military intelligence and the realities of human resources
   constraints in the military. Further, the resulting scale of unfiltered
   data such a system would produce might serve to overwhelm rather than
   assist decision- makers. Finally, we conclude that the problems
   expressed in the Flynn Report should not be traced to the military
   intelligence apparatus per se, but rather to the inability of US
   political leadership to map out a clear vision for current operations
   both in Afghanistan, and in the counterinsurgency environment in
   general.},

   Representation in Organizational Leadership: The Case of Partners in

Year = {2012},
Volume = {639},

Abstract = {Explanations of minority underrepresentation among organizational
   managers have focused primarily on either employee deficits in human and
   social capital or employer discrimination. To date, research has paid
   little attention to the role of developmental practices and related
   cultural values within organizations. Using data on large U.S. law
   firms, the authors investigate the role of formal developmental
   practices and cultural values in the representation of three minority
   groups among firm partners: African Americans, Latinos, and Asian
   Americans. The authors find that formal practices and cultural values
   intended to aid employee growth and development do not ``level the
   playing field{''} for minorities. Formal training and mentoring programs
   do not increase minority presence, while a longer time period to
   promotion, a cultural commitment to professional development, and a
   cultural norm of early responsibility are all negatively associated with
   minority representation. Although the pattern is broadly similar across
   all three groups, some effects vary in interesting ways.},

   HALF OF GENDER - MEN'S ISSUES IN DEVELOPMENT},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL FEMINIST JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {14},
Number = {2},
Pages = {247-266},
Abstract = {This article critically examines the World Bank's report entitled The
   Other Half of Gender: Men's Issues in Development published in 2006. The
   Bank publication covers a range of topics on men and masculinities, and
   ultimately argues for `men-streaming' development. Using an
   intersectional analysis, this article expands upon recent feminist
   scholarship in the field of Men and Development in order to take a
   closer look at race, culture and representation. In this article, I
   demonstrate how the World Bank's focus on the social construction of
   masculinities in the `men-streaming' report places Third World men into
   a specific realm of visibility that renders them culpable for a wide
   range of development issues. In representing African men as homogenous,
   culturally inferior and individually culpable for the HIV/AIDS pandemic,
   in particular, the Bank's promotes `gender-adjustments', which obscures
   the Bank's complicity in a variety of development disasters.},

   ludic environment of Allods Online as an ideological space. I call for a
   renegotiation of the Russian mediascape in its post-broadcast phase for

Abstract = {The article investigates the political and diplomatic factors
   influencing the prospects of North Korea's post-2002 experiment with
   market-oriented economic reforms. Comparing the North Korean situation
   with the experiences of Yugoslavia, China and Vietnam, it concludes that
   a certain degree of political liberalisation, the successful
   normalisation of P'yongyang's relations with the US, South Korea and
   Japan, and the decoupling of foreign economic assistance from military
   negotiations are essential preconditions of a successful reform process
   in North Korea. In the absence of these preconditions, economic crises
   alone are insufficient to stimulate a comprehensive reform programme,
   although they might inspire certain superficial corrective measures.},

Title = {Assessing Cultural and Regime-Based Explanations of Russia's Foreign
   Policy. `Authoritarian at Heart and Expansionist by Habit'?},
Journal = {EUROPE-ASIA STUDIES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {64},
Number = {4},
Pages = {695-713},
Abstract = {Scholars disagree on how to interpret Russia's assertive foreign policy.
   According to some observers, Russia's authoritarian culture and
   political system have historically required the Kremlin to depend on the
   Western threat image at home and to engage in revisionist behaviour
   abroad. These observers recommend that Western nations abstain from
   engaging Russia as an equal contributor to shaping the global system.
   This article assesses the validity of the authoritarian expansionism
   theory by comparing it to other prominent perspectives on foreign
   policy, realism and constructivism. The article argues that, by
   perceiving Russia's historical and institutional distinctness as
   fundamentally threatening to the West, the theory overlooks important
   sources of foreign policy contestation at home and potentially varying
   directions abroad. The article selects the historically important cases
   of the Crimean War, the Cold War and the Russia-Georgia War to
   demonstrate the theory's flaws and to highlight the role of factors
   other than Russia's authoritarianism in the nation's foreign policy.},

Abstract = {How to generate legitimate forms of governance beyond the nation state
   is often considered a central question in contemporary world politics.
   To proceed in theory-building, scholars need to systematically assign
   the theory-driven assumptions on legitimate forms of governance beyond
   the nation state with the various, already observable, forms of global
   governance. This article aims to conduct a comparative appraisal of the
   legitimatory quality of different patterns of governance by applying a
   framework of indicators for their assessment. The indicators are
   selected from the scholarly debate within International Relations on the
   legitimacy of global governance arrangements and structured by a
   multidimensional concept of legitimacy (input, throughput, and output
   dimensions). This framework is then applied to international,
   transnational, and private forms of global governance in the field of
   Internet regulation in order to show how each of them tries to produce
   and maintain legitimacy, which strategies it applies, and in how it
   interacts with its stakeholders.},

Abstract = {The authors examine the intersection of gender and generation for the
   field of cultural consumption in the United States, considering their
   interplay in the social positioning of taste. The authors' prior work
   found that while cultural capital in the United States largely parallels
   the field structure observed in 1960s France, the form of cultural
   capital in the United States discriminates between nurturance and
   community, on one side, and aggressiveness and individualism, on the
   other. To investigate this seemingly gendered and ideological
   positioning of taste, the authors locate individuals as ``occupants{''}
   of this social field, distinguishing them by gender and age, and find
   that gender no longer structures a preference for a particular form of
   cultural capital among younger citizens. This blending of gendered
   identities in younger Americans suggests a realignment of the notions of
   gentility and community as defining femininity and coarseness and
   individualism as defining masculinity. The gendered patterns of cultural
   consumption that defined older generations do not define younger ones.},

Abstract = {Child overweight is a growing problem in wealthy countries. There is
   also evidence that child overweight varies by race/ethnicity and
   socioeconomic status. In this article, the authors use data from two
   recent birth cohort studies in the United States and England to address
   four questions: (1) Are race/ethnic and immigrant status associated with
   child overweight? (2) Is the association between socioeconomic status
   and child overweight similar across race/ethnic and nativity subgroups?
   (3) Does the age of immigrant mothers at migration moderate the
   association between immigrant status and child overweight? and (4) Does
   maternal obesity mediate the association between race/ethnicity and
   nativity and child overweight? Findings indicate that (1) race/ethnicity
   and immigrant status are risk factors for child overweight in both
   countries, (2) the influence of socioeconomic status differs by
   subgroup, (3) mother's age at migration does not moderate the
   association, and (4) mother's obesity mediates some of the race/ethnic
   disparities in child overweight.},

Abstract = {While often considered a purely financial institution, the IMF has
   throughout its history performed non-financial services for its
   membership. The latest example is the Policy Support Instrument (PSI), a
   certification mechanism established in 2005 for which only poor members
   are eligible. Based on a formal game-theoretic model, I argue that it is
   unlikely that the PSI will serve well the intention of facilitating
   capital market access for members requesting the service. Their low
   income, the lack of significant consequences for markets, the IMF's
   traditional reluctance to criticize members, as well as the need to
   promote the use of the new arrangement indicate that the Fund could
   emphasize participants' welfare over the interests of private lenders.
   The continued importance of foreign aid in eligible countries also puts
   the IMF in the role of gatekeeping such flows, which might conflict with
   sending clear signals to commercial actors. All these reasons imply that
   in many cases its seal of approval will be of little use to
   third-parties, despite the high standards to which PSI-countries are
   supposed to adhere. The best argument in favor of the PSI being a useful
   addition to the Fund's tool kit for low-income members is the fact that
   several countries have already signed a second one.},

Abstract = {There is much literature on the diffusion and translation of regulatory
   agencies from the perspective of formal political models. Ethnographic
   research of regulation process is, however, much less common. This is
   even more evident with regards to the study of regulatory agencies
   established outside the West. This article analyzes the translation
   process of the Turkish tobacco regulatory agency, which was established
   in 2002, under commitments made to the International Monetary Fund and
   the World Bank. Based on an ethnographic analysis of two controversial
   cases, the study shows that tobacco regulation was being shaped and
   pursued in an environment of ambivalence and uncertainty. The study
   concludes that the decision-making process of the agency is
   context-specific and constructed within the perpetual struggles and
   interactions among the actors involved in this process.},

Abstract = {My paper proposes the concept of relational work to explain economic
   activity. In all economic action, I argue, people engage in the process
   of differentiating meaningful social relations. For each distinct
   category of social relations, people erect a boundary, mark the boundary
   by means of names and practices, establish a set of distinctive
   understandings that operate within that boundary, designate certain
   sorts of economic transactions as appropriate for the relation, bar
   other transactions as inappropriate, and adopt certain media for
   reckoning and facilitating economic transactions within the relation. I
   call that process relational work. After identifying specific elements
   of a relational work approach, the paper focuses on the case of monetary
   differentiation. It compares a relational work theory of earmarking
   money with behavioral economics' individually based mental accounting
   approach.},

Abstract = {After a prolonged period during which studies of immigration and crime
   virtually disappeared from the literature, the topic has reemerged as a
   central theme of contemporary criminology. However, unlike the classic
   immigration studies that appeared in the first half of the twentieth
   century, most modern studies combine the various countries of origin
   into broad pan-ethnic groupings (such as Hispanic/Latino or Asian) that
   implicitly assume that criminological dynamics are relatively
   homogeneous within these aggregations despite the important social,
   cultural, and historical differences that are subsumed. This article
   utilizes data from the Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Study to
   illustrate the systematic within-category variation that such approaches
   can mask.},

Abstract = {This article relies on local area variation in immigration policies,
   specifically the local implementation of the 287(g) program, and
   economic conditions to estimate their impact on changes in the size of
   local Mexican immigrant populations between 2007 and 2009. The author
   also investigates the impact of the 287(g) program on the employment
   prospects of low-skilled native black and white workers. The study finds
   that outside of four influential outliers (Dallas, Los Angeles,
   Riverside, and Phoenix), there is no evidence that the 287(g) program
   impacted the size of the Mexican immigrant population. In addition,
   there is no evidence that immigration enforcement policies mitigated the
   negative impact of the economic recession on the native population, even
   in the four outliers where the program was strongly enforced. The author
   highlights the limited efficacy of immigration enforcement as a way to
   resolve the issue of the undocumented immigrant population and for
   altering the employment opportunities of native workers.},

Abstract = {Although scholars and practitioners have long argued that greater
   political coherence will make the European Union a more effective
   international actor, the relationship between coherence and
   effectiveness has not been well defined or tested. This article defines
   the two concepts, proposes three hypotheses regarding the relationship
   between them, and examines the extent and consequences of EU coherence
   on an issue that the EU has highlighted as essential to its foreign
   policy mission: the good functioning of the International Criminal Court
   (ICC). It finds that the EU exhibited considerable coherence in its
   response to the United States' campaign for ICC `nonsurrender
   agreements', yet failed in its effort to shape the behaviour of other
   states. Coherence may be necessary for the EU to exert its influence
   abroad, but it is not sufficient in a multi-centric world order where
   many others do not share the EU's collective policy preferences and are
   ready to deploy vast resources in pursuit of their goals. The article
   also considers the implications of this study for future research on EU
   foreign policy actorness, coherence and effectiveness.},

Abstract = {This article adds to the body of knowledge about city managers and
   council-manager form cities by determining why so few women are found in
   the ranks of city managers. Using graduates of the University of Kansas
   master of public administration (MPA) program as our sample, we find
   that women interested in city management careers face a paradox: Married
   women have a greater probability of becoming city managers. But if they
   marry and have children they face issues of relocation, child rearing,
   and parental care-all of which make it more difficult to get a city
   management job, not to mention doing that job with its typically higher
   time demands.},

Abstract = {It was widely anticipated before European Union enlargement that the
   accession states would have a negative impact on EU environmental
   governance. By extension, the European Parliament's (EP) reputation as
   an environmental champion might be threatened by the influx of MEPs from
   accession states. An analysis of all EP amendments to environmental
   legislation between 1999 and 2009 reveals that post-enlargement the EP
   was more successful at securing the adoption of its amendments into law
   but that these amendments were less radical. These changes arise from
   the institutional adaptation prompted by enlargement and a broad
   ideological shift to the right within the EP.},

Journal = {EUROPE-ASIA STUDIES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {64},
Number = {1},
Pages = {35-67},
Abstract = {After enjoying a period of sustained economic growth that saw the region
   converge with EU per capita income levels, the global economic crisis
   caused post-socialist Europe to suffer a larger decline in output during
   2008-2009 than any other region in the world. While there was
   considerable variation in individual countries' experience of the
   crisis, this article argues that the severity of the crisis can be
   explained by three key macro-financial variables. The analysis suggests
   that alternative explanations focusing on other macroeconomic
   vulnerabilities, institutional weaknesses or trade vulnerabilities are
   of little explanatory utility.},

Abstract = {After the Cold War economic globalization has mended its pace.
   Globalization is a development process and trend as a whole. Its
   political dimension follows its economic leg. Globalization, both
   economic and political, has posed multiple and long-lasting challenges
   to state power, especially sovereignty. National rise and fall count on
   whether nation-states can come up with appropriate proposals to deal
   with the impacts of globalization. This article analyzes the impacts of
   economic and political globalization on state authority and works out
   proposals for China.
   In the post second World War era, globalization has progressed to a new
   stage. In the past several decades, especially since the 1990s when the
   Cold War came to an end, market economy has expanded to every nook and
   corner of the world. The world market has been unified. Scientific
   advances have led to reduction in the costs of transportation and
   communication-time and distance are no long a big problem. Production,
   trade, investment, finance and consumption are increasingly getting
   internationalized. The flows of information and values have speedened
   up. Globalization as we perceive and experience today, has acquired new
   dimensions and it's not an exaggeration to say that it has stealthily
   arrived at our doorstep. Globalization is a development process and
   trend as a whole. The political dimension follows the economic leg.
   Today, political power and relations know no national borders and have
   expanded to such a point that assorted, complicated global and regional
   governance networks have been established. Globalization, both economic
   and political, has posed multiple, long lasting challenges to
   nation-state power in general and state sovereignty in particular.
   National rise and fall count on whether nation-states can come up with
   proposals to deal with the impacts of globalization.},

Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {17},
Number = {5},
Pages = {667-675},
Abstract = {The governance advice that is offered to Africa usually identifies a
   list of `good governance' goals like stable property rights, a rule of
   law, low corruption and government accountability as preconditions for
   development. These goals are difficult to implement not only because
   they are expensive public goods but in addition their enforcement is
   typically at variance with powerful interests in the political
   settlements of developing countries. The historical evidence and much
   institutional theory suggests that during their social transformations
   successful developing countries had a different set of `developmental'
   or `growth-enhancing' governance capabilities that enabled their states
   to support critical property rights transformations and assist firms in
   acquiring and learning to use new technology. The institutions and
   policies they used differed because their political and institutional
   starting points were different. There are therefore no blueprints for
   Africa or anywhere else, but certainly the good governance menu is
   unrealistic. Rather African countries have to experiment and develop
   institutional and policy solutions that work in their context and which
   are appropriate for transforming property rights and accelerating
   technology adoption.},

Abstract = {The German parliament's Law on the Stasi Records, passed in 1991,
   extended the principle of freedom of information to the records of a
   Communist security service. By so doing, it has given historians, former
   targets of Stasi intelligence collection and others an unprecedented
   insight into the operations of such a service. Enough records of the
   Stasi's trials department have been made available to reconstruct a
   picture of the work of British intelligence agencies in the years
   1945-61, and above all the work of the Secret Intelligence Service
   (SIS). They show that SIS was a very skilful service which obtained the
   high-grade intelligence it sought. However, SIS's work in East Germany
   was undone in the late 1950s by the treason of the KGB's penetration
   agent in it, George Blake.},

   Mitigation},

Abstract = {Politicians hope that technological innovation will mitigate the threat
   of climate change and expect that capitalism will most efficiently
   deliver the necessary technologies. Yet capitalism is not monolithic.
   The Varieties of Capitalism approach suggests that capitalist states
   fall within a spectrum between liberal market economies (LMEs) and
   coordinated market economies (CMEs). How do the relative styles of
   technological innovation in LMEs versus CMEs affect their ability to
   reduce carbon emissions? This article addresses this question by
   investigating the relative technological styles and strengths of LMEs
   and CMEs, and comparing them to the technological development needed to
   combat climate change. While technological change in CMEs tends to be
   more incremental, LMEs, with their greater orientation to competitive
   markets, are said to better support radical technological change. This
   article finds that the US's LME variety of capitalism hampers its
   ability to address climate change by comparison to CMEs such as Germany
   and Japan, and therefore suggests that the US's lack of leadership on
   climate change is as much a consequence of its variety of capitalism as
   an absence of political will.},

Abstract = {Russian citizenship policy has evolved in puzzling ways from the 1990s,
   when all former Soviet citizens were entitled to simplified access to
   Russian citizenship, to the 2002 citizenship law, which put an abrupt
   end to this policy, giving few but those born on the territory of Russia
   the right to citizenship. Since 2002, the right to Russian citizenship
   has been extended to some additional categories of former Soviet
   citizens, but without a return to the expansive policy of the 1990s.
   Drawing on legal and governmental sources and the scholarly literature,
   this article looks at elite debates over citizenship rules to analyze
   Russian citizenship politics and policies, focusing on citizenship rules
   affecting former Soviet citizens. These are examined to uncover the
   causes of legislative zigzags and ascertain the applicability of
   existing citizenship theories to Russian realities.},

Pages = {69-90},
Abstract = {This article analyses the violent practices of youth territorial groups
   in Moscow. These groups exist on the city periphery and mainly involve
   young people ( most of them male), who are not well integrated into
   society through the schooling system. Rather than simply depending on
   violence as a survival tool within the dangerous and uncertain space of
   the streets, or as an instrument for crime, the members of these groups
   use their collective mastery of it as proof of elite status, in
   accordance with cultural prescriptions drawn from deep historical
   traditions.},

Pages = {639-662},
Abstract = {While the end of the Bretton Woods system led to deregulation and
   increased international capital flows, the trend over the past two
   decades has been toward increased international financial supervision.
   Aspects for an emerging structure of global governance are congealing
   into a form of `financial governmentality' as a means to secure society
   and to isolate criminal and terrorist money. Efforts to defend society
   from organised crime and transnational terrorism extend into financial
   services and introduce increased levels of surveillance over all forms
   of financial exchange. The paper begins with an explication for the
   power relations between international organisations (created by select
   states to manage and direct the global economy) and the non-member
   jurisdictions that are, in turn, subjected to their guidance. The
   experience of the Philippines with the international campaign against
   money laundering directed by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is
   presented as a case study for the governmentality present in global
   financial governance. Initially the Philippine government sought to
   retain a measure of autonomous action while satisfying the FATF's
   demands for legislative change. The initial failure to meet the
   expectations of international standards impacted international financial
   flows to the Philippines, including migrant remittances. It was with
   this specific experience in mind that the government of the Philippines
   crafted new regulations to cover emerging technologies that facilitate
   money transfer via mobile phone, positioning the Philippines as the
   leader for this form of governance to prevent money laundering and
   terrorist financing. At the same time, this case represents an emerging
   practice for self-discipline by states seeking to demonstrate compliance
   with internationally produced standards and best practices for banking
   and finance.},

   1946-1947 in relation to the food problems experienced by the USSR in
   World War II and to the impact of the weather conditions from 1941. It
   is argued that the timing and nature of the extreme food problems
   experienced in this famine conform to a general pattern of Soviet
   famines in which urban food supply problems over a number of years give
   rise to increasing pressure on the peasantry and a general reduction of
   stocks, which when complicated by drought and harvest failure produces a
   rural famine.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the nature of policy path dependence through
   analysis of climate policy formation in the United States. In 2008 the
   US Congress attempted to pass the LiebermanWarner bill, a comprehensive
   climate and energy package that would have capped greenhouse emissions
   and established a nationwide cap and trade program. In the same year,
   California successfully enacted the Global Warming Solutions Act. This
   article explores the circumstances of both cases and raises the question
   of why legislation at the state level was successful and took such a
   divergent form from legislation at the federal level. The divergence of
   these cases is used to highlight the nature of coalition formation and
   policy path dependence in the legislative process. Explanations of
   policy tend to gravitate toward either the generalizability of game
   theoretic approaches or the empirical depth of case studies. This
   article suggests a combined approach that uses case studies to analyze
   the positions and motivations of actors and to then model policy
   development over time. The approach examines policy through the
   formation and negotiation of policy coalitions. Drawing on the Advocacy
   Coalition Framework and omnibus analysis, the approach expands these
   coalition theories first by analysing legislative development at the
   interface of legislators and constituent interest groups, and second by
   adding temporal dimension to the analysis. The findings suggest that
   policy is path dependent in that it is negotiated between coalitions
   that in turn create stability in the policy process and insulate policy
   fields from external shocks. Policy path dependence suggests that theory
   alone is insufficient to predict policy outcomes; policy results depend
   strongly on prior policy efforts, historically and socially contingent
   coalitions, and the resulting framing of policy possibilities.},

Year = {2012},
Volume = {6},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {502-524},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Silence is a form of communication as multifaceted as speech and as such
   conveys a broad range of contextually situated social meanings. Often
   silence is understood as a form of denial and inherently detrimental to
   processes of reconciliation, but it may help create a sense of
   `normality' and facilitate encounters between former foes. This article
   enquires into the role and meanings of silence as tacit forms of
   communication in postwar social processes and everyday life among people
   of different ethnic groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina, particularly as
   used by the displaced and returnees. It argues that in these contentious
   settings, everyday social interaction employs silence in ways that
   empower by communicating respect and even trust, thus forming and
   sustaining relations important to viable local life. Silence can be used
   to affirm family continuity and protect close relationships. Silent
   claims may also `speak' from a marginalized position in relation to
   hegemonic narratives and make moral claims. Silence may thus be
   understood as a pragmatic and at times successful strategy for
   coexistence even when reflecting continued division in the larger
   society.},

   liberalization sparked many of the processes associated in the political

   of regime transformation, including some initial regime transition
   pact-making. This pact-making and the maturity that both regime and

Abstract = {Nativity differences in birth outcomes in the United States are well
   documented, with more favorable outcomes among children of foreign-born
   parents than those of native-born parents. Using longitudinal data on
   mothers from the United States Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing
   Study (N similar to 4,000) and the United Kingdom Millennium Cohort
   Study (N similar to 15,000), the authors provide a comparative and
   longitudinal perspective on nativity differences in mothers' health
   behaviors. First, the authors ask whether healthier behaviors observed
   among Hispanic immigrants in the United States extend to foreign-born
   mothers in the United Kingdom, including South Asian, black African and
   Caribbean, and East Asian immigrants. Second, the authors consider the
   persistence of differences throughout early childhood. The findings
   demonstrate healthier behaviors among foreign-born mothers in both the
   United States and the United Kingdom, including both socioeconomically
   disadvantaged and advantaged mothers. These differences are stable over
   early childhood, suggesting a ``universality{''} of healthier behaviors
   among foreign-born mothers, spanning racial/ethnic and socioeconomic
   groups, time, and two different policy contexts.},

Abstract = {The European Union's policies towards autocratic regimes have come under
   renewed scrutiny following the popular uprisings in the Middle East and
   North Africa (MENA) in the spring of 2011, and the pressure on the EU to
   revise its approach towards the region has been growing. Over decades,
   the EU had pursued a policy of pragmatic engagement with autocratic
   regimes for stability in the region, to the detriment of democracy
   promotion. This article examines the EU's policy towards Belarus, often
   labelled the `last dictatorship' in Europe, and demonstrates that the EU
   has not just pursued pragmatic politics in the MENA - it has also
   gradually moved from democracy promotion towards interest-based
   functional co-operation in its relations with the most `reluctant
   democratizer' in eastern Europe. It is argued here that the case of
   Belarus and other states with autocratic leanings in eastern Europe are
   examples of an increasingly institutionalized pragmatic approach of the
   EU towards autocratic regimes, which is likely to dominate its policies
   in years to come - notwithstanding the recent events in the MENA.},

   normative conception of the European Union is unconvincing. I respond to
   his objections by correcting a number of misunderstandings of my
   original argument. I also use a more principled standard for providing
   evidence that the EU is indeed structurally unfit for democracy and
   emphasize the argument that the supranational layer of the EU is in need
   of a normative standard that is independent from the idea of democracy.

   Emerging Evidence from African Immigrants in Boston and Dublin},

Abstract = {Residential integration with the dominant native-born population is
   believed to be a crucial stage in immigrants' overall assimilation
   process. It is argued that without residential integration it would be
   difficult, if not impossible, for immigrants to achieve full
   incorporation into the host society. This article compares the
   sociospatial experiences of African immigrants in the United States and
   Ireland. Results show that African immigrants in Ireland have achieved
   spatial integration with Irish nationals, while their counterparts in
   the United States remain spatially separated from white Americans. The
   extent to which African immigrants' integration in Ireland can produce
   other forms of assimilation is questionable, however. Likewise, despite
   being segregated from whites, African immigrants in the United States
   have made some modest spatial gains that may facilitate their
   integration. The cross-national comparison draws into question the
   generally accepted notion that residential integration is an important
   intermediary substage in the assimilation process.},

Abstract = {Since the 1990s, immigrant settlement has expanded beyond gateway cities
   and transformed the social fabric of a growing number of American
   cities. In the process, it has raised new questions for urban and
   migration scholars. This article argues that immigration to new
   destinations provides an opportunity to sharpen understandings of the
   relationship between immigration and the urban by exploring it under new
   conditions. Through a discussion of immigrant settlement in Nashville,
   Tennessee, it identifies an overlooked precursor to immigrant
   incorporation-how cities see, or do not see, immigrants within the
   structure of local government. If immigrants are not institutionally
   visible to government or nongovernmental organizations, immigrant
   abilities to make claims to or on the city as urban residents are
   diminished. Through the combination of trends toward neighborhood-based
   urban governance and neoliberal streamlining across American cities,
   immigrants can become institutionally hard to find and, thus, plan for
   in the city.},

Abstract = {The reasoned action approach that Martin Fishbein pioneered has emerged
   as the dominant conceptual framework for predicting, explaining, and
   changing human social behavior. The most popular model in this
   tradition, the theory of planned behavior, has generated a great deal of
   empirical research supporting the premises of this approach. It has been
   shown that behavioral, normative, and control beliefs provide the basis,
   respectively, for attitudes toward the behavior, subjective norms, and
   perceived behavioral control; that these three factors jointly account
   for a great deal of variance in behavioral intentions; and that
   intentions and perceived control can be used to predict actual behavior.
   Based on these insights, investigators have been able to design
   effective behavior change interventions.},

Abstract = {Following the failure of the Constitutional Treaty, executives of
   European Union (EU) Member States and the European Commission tried to
   take European integration as a political issue as much off the agenda as
   possible and limit involvement of citizens in EU decision-making. This
   article assesses the viability of this attempt to combat politicization
   of European integration and comes to the conclusion that it is unlikely
   to succeed in the long run. Politicization, it is argued, is a direct
   consequence of the increasing authority of the EU. The executive
   response to reverse this trend, however, does not address its cause, but
   rather the intermediating factors in the form of political opportunity
   structure. Since the cause of politicization remains intact and
   intermediating factors are unlikely to be controlled by executives, this
   attempt to reverse politicization is not viable.},

Abstract = {This article provides an in-depth regional analysis of the rural nonfarm
   economy in Kyrgyzstan based on three household budget surveys for 2003,
   2005 and 2006. Regression analysis reveals that the share of time spent
   in the commercial rural nonfarm economy was larger in districts with low
   agricultural potential, indicating that the rural poor are pushed into
   accessible but not necessarily very profitable nonfarm activities. This
   `push' scenario is probably strengthened by the low commercialisation
   and unfinished institutional reforms in the agricultural sector. Only in
   a few land-rich districts and in a district with a famous resort was
   labour `pulled' into a profitable rural nonfarm economy stimulated by
   agricultural development and other local `motors' of growth.},

   markets over the past decade. Encouraged by market developments and
   deregulation in the United States, these investments represented a
   ``financialization{''} of agriculture that was blamed for contributing
   for global food price volatility. In their push for tighter regulation,
   US domestic groups were able to boost their influence by allying with
   other domestic actors concerned about volatile energy prices and by
   linking their cause to the broader politics of financial reform in the
   wake of the 2008 financial crisis. This episode has important lessons
   for the literatures analyzing the IPE of both food and finance.},

Abstract = {The article explores imperial human capital affects on current human
   capital and democracy variations in Russia's regions based on
   author-constructed datasets with imperial and post-communist statistics.
   Pre-communist education is a significant predictor of modernisation,
   which in studies of Russian regions explains a large share of regional
   democratic variation. Pre-communist education also apparently positively
   affects post-communist democracy. The communists did not build on a
   clean slate; nor did they overwrite pre-communist human capital stocks
   in the regions. The spatially uneven structural conditions related to
   frontier settlement and population movements after the emancipation of
   the serfs may also have a bearing on human capital variations.},

Year = {2012},
Volume = {17},
Number = {5},

Abstract = {Is the liberty to pursue individual self-interest in the capitalist
   market all that remains of the grand Enlightenment promise of human
   emancipation? The article addresses this question by returning to
   eighteenth century scholarship on the relationship between English
   common law and commercial law. Specifically, I explore the fundamental
   challenge posed to common law by the regulation, through commercial law,
   of enslaved Africans as labouring `things'. I show how key British
   scholars in the eighteenth century traditions of jurisprudence, moral
   philosophy and political economy struggled to address the radical
   unfreedom of the enslaved and the meaning of her/his radical
   emancipation. I explore how this Atlantic challenge was `indigenised' to
   speak to the threat posed by enclosures in Britain, in particular, the
   possible destruction of the qualified unfreedoms and freedoms extant in
   the paternal social order upheld by common law. I explore how political
   economy traditions pre and post abolition and emancipation sought to
   deal with this challenge. And I conjecture on the significance of
   remembering the most radical process of commodifying labour - in Aime
   Cesaire's terms, thingification - for present day interpretations of the
   relationship between capitalism and freedom.},

Abstract = {This article examines women's movements as agents of change in
   postcommunist Croatia and Slovenia: whether, and in what ways, they may
   have succeeded in politicizing and institutionalizing the issue of
   domestic violence in the two countries. Theoretically, this article aims
   to contribute to the ongoing discussion of the effectiveness of
   different forms of women's policy agency. Using a policy process
   analysis, the study demonstrates the key role women's movements have
   played in putting the issue of domestic violence on the political agenda
   and pressuring governments to enact new legislation. The findings
   challenge the common assumption that Central and Eastern European
   women's movements have remained weak, antifeminist, and apolitical,
   exerting only marginal influence on the gender policy processes in the
   region.},

Abstract = {In the past five years, the Chinese state has made great effort to
   implement its `going-out' strategy, i.e., the geographical expansion of
   Chinese capital and labor overseas. This paper explores how the Chinese
   state rescales to implement this going-out strategy and produce new
   spaces of development. Particularly, this paper examines how the Chinese
   state reconfigures its institutional ensemble to integrate landlocked
   Yunnan Province into the transnational economy embodied in the Greater
   Mekong Subregion (GMS). The paper finds that the Chinese state deploys
   two spatial strategies - upward coordination with international
   organizations and GMS national governments, and downward implementation
   throughout Yunnan Province - to establish an interscalar regulatory
   regime. Through this regime the Chinese state aims to assemble capital,
   labor, and political clout to expand Chinese capital and labor in the
   GMS, and to develop Yunnan's economy to ease uneven domestic
   geographical development. This paper contributes to the booming
   literature on the political-economic restructuring of national states
   and to the limited scholarship on the institutional arrangement for
   cross-border regions in a non-Western context. It also sheds light on
   how the rescaling of the Chinese state potentially shapes the
   international political economy.},

Abstract = {Ethnic violence in Gujarat in 2002 killed at least a thousand Muslims.
   Compiling data from the Times of India, we investigate variation across
   216 towns and rural areas. Analysis reveals the political logic of
   violence. Killing was less likely where the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya
   Janata Party (BJP) was weakest, but was even less likely where the BJP
   was strong; it was most likely where the party faced the greatest
   electoral competition. Underemployment and Muslim in-migration also
   increased violence. The political logic is confirmed by analysis of the
   subsequent election: the BJP's vote increased most in districts with the
   worst violence. Police chiefs in districts where violence was severe
   were more likely to be promoted.},

   Evaluating divergent theories of scientization},
Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {19},
Number = {5},
Pages = {895-917},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Science has been institutionalized as a legitimate basis for
   decision-making at the World Trade Organization (WTO). This raises a
   critical question: how does the scientization of decision-making shape
   the construction of new governance arrangements? Using the case of
   negotiations between the Chinese state and the US state over the
   harmonization of cotton quality classification, I consider three
   approaches to scientization in world politics: the world polity
   approach, the world-systems approach and the political sociology of
   science. Evidence from the case demonstrates the need to largely reject
   the world polity approach while integrating the world-systems approach
   with the finer-grained analyses of the political sociology of science.
   This analysis yields two key arguments regarding the implications of
   science-based decision-making as an institutionalized global norm.
   First, scientization can formalize existing power inequalities given the
   uneven historical terrain of research legacies. Second, as scientization
   channels politics through science, powerful actors are better situated
   to legitimate their own interests in scientific terms and to define what
   makes science legitimate.},

Abstract = {Political consumerism has become one of the most promising research
   fields in social movement and political participation studies. However,
   most research has focused mainly on the more personalized and less
   collective version of such forms of action, leaving largely unexplored
   the nature and dynamic of some new local grassroots organizations (such
   as the so-called Gruppi di Acquisto Solidale, or Solidarity Purchasing
   Groups {[}SPGs] in Italy). The influence of such forms of political
   participation in contemporary democracies has been scarcely
   investigated. The aim of this article is to provide an in-depth
   exploratory case study of SPGs in Italy, which more specifically focuses
   on the main definitional, organizational, and sociodemographic features
   of SPG participation. The article shows that the Italian SPGs are
   locally based hybrid pressure movements that go beyond conventional
   forms of political consumerism by adopting innovative organizational and
   participatory tools.},

Abstract = {The demonstrations following the December 2011 legislative election and
   the poorer performance of United Russia in that election suggest a
   potential crisis in the Russian electoral authoritarian regime. Assuming
   the Russian leadership wishes to stabilize electoral authoritarian rule,
   how should it go about doing this? Increasing electoral competition and
   decreasing control potentially can lead to democratization, and
   therefore regime change. A safer course for the regime may be reform of
   United Russia. This article analyzes United Russia's performance, asking
   if it has been carrying out the tasks of a dominant party, and considers
   the party's best chances for long-term stabilization of electoral
   authoritarianism.},

Title = {Party Responsiveness on European Union Integration in Transition

Abstract = {Some argue that the direct representative relationship between voters
   and party elites is difficult to establish in transition democracies. In
   part, the difficulty stems from the fact that parties may have a hard
   time discerning the preferences of their respective voter coalitions. In
   the case of EU integration, parties may have additional incentives to
   disregard the interests of the public in the hope of securing benefits
   associated with their country's membership of the EU. In this article we
   investigate the extent of party responsiveness on EU integration issues
   in early transition years in central and eastern European countries. We
   find that while mainstream parties do consistently show more support for
   EU integration, we find no evidence that parties, in fact, track their
   voters. The lack of responsiveness cannot, however, be explained by the
   general instability of public and party positions, nor can this absence
   of a relationship be satisfactorily captured by low salience of the EU
   in the transition years.},

Abstract = {This article draws on two years of observation to analyze the ways in
   which a group of black men promoted, ritualized, enforced, and enacted
   brotherhood on a predominantly white campus. These men utilized the
   concept of brotherhood to unite those who shared a marginalized status.
   The notion of brotherhood enabled the men to express their emotions,
   violating some of the dominant cultural tenets of manhood. Although
   black men face many obstacles in white-dominated middle-class social
   worlds, these men did not passively accept those troubles; they came
   together and collectively created a brotherhood to help them survive and
   succeed.},

Abstract = {This practice note aims to summarize the proven success of a holistic
   strategy for the prevention of torture developed by Advocacy Forum-Nepal
   (AF). Through systematic visits to government detention facilities to
   monitor the status of detainees, giving detainees (especially those from
   poor, marginalized backgrounds) access to a lawyer and protecting their
   rights in detention centres, AF aimed to reduce the widespread torture
   and other ill-treatment in pretrial detention facilities and increase
   access to justice for all detainees. Detailed statistical analysis of
   findings during detention visits were shared with stakeholders of the
   criminal justice system in intra-and inter-sectoral consultation
   meetings to discuss and address problems existing in detention centres
   and end the practice of torture in detention. The findings were reported
   to national and international human rights organizations and expert
   bodies who issued urgent appeals addressed to the government of Nepal to
   prevent torture. In addition, detailed reviews of laws and policies were
   conducted, which in turn fed into advocacy at international, national
   and local levels. This model has had measurable impact; and is set out
   here in the hope it will assist other non-governmental organizations
   (NGOs) and human rights practitioners around the world to devise their
   own effective torture prevention strategy.},

Abstract = {This paper attempts to clarify the concept of relational work for
   understanding economic life as proposed by Viviana Zelizer. To do so, it
   first compares the concept to similar notions used in other disciplinary
   fields. Second, it reinterprets some exemplary economic sociology
   studies by using the relational work lens to clarify the concept's
   utility for empirical analysis. Third, it speculates about the place of
   relational work in the theoretical toolkit of economic sociologists, in
   particular its relation to embeddedness. The paper concludes by arguing
   for the utility of the concept to integrate structural, cultural, and
   power-focused analyses of economic life, to highlight the
   often-overlooked role of emotions in economic exchange, and to ground an
   alternative to rational action theory in economic sociology.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes how the concept of
   `representativeness/representativity' has been used by the European
   Union institutions to structure interest intermediation. It examines how
   the concept emerged and has been defined, and identifies its scope of
   application. `Representativeness' is mostly used to refer to
   organizational features of the interest groups (organizational
   representativeness), but is occasionally used in relation to
   representative aspects of the overall system of interest representation
   (system representativeness). The focus is primarily on aspects of
   `descriptive representativeness' - in particular, territorial and
   thematic representativeness - rather than on `procedural
   representativeness' that guarantees authorization and accountability.
   Originally applied to the social partners only, the White Paper on
   European Governance proposed to extend the use of representativeness to
   the wider category of civil society organizations. It will be shown that
   the application of the concept to these organizations proves more
   problematic than it does to the social partners. The European
   Transparency Initiative subsequently abandons representativeness, but it
   is argued that it contains the seeds for its re-emergence.},

Abstract = {In the last decade the European Union (EU) has been negotiating with the
   African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) group of countries to establish
   Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs). In this article, EPAs are
   located within the context of the wider shift in EU trade policy towards
   bilateralism. This is done with reference to recent work in
   International Political Economy (IPE) emphasizing the
   `domestic-societal' and `systemic' drivers of preferential
   liberalization. Although these pressures are not necessarily sufficient
   to explain the EPAs, they do account for why they have gone beyond the
   original remit of `World Trade Organization (WTO) compatibility' and why
   aspects of the agreements bear close similarity to the EU's supposedly
   more commercially oriented bilateral agreements.},

Abstract = {By building on theoretical insights from poststructuralist feminism and
   Roland Barthes' mythology framework, this article is offering a nuanced
   understanding of female agency in political violence by engaging with
   the visual and the cultural, by using a broader definition of agency in
   political violence and by analysing what gendered representations of war
   mean at the domestic level. In the first part of the article, the Myth
   of Motherhood is conceptualized as a meta-discourse disciplining
   representations of female agency in political violence. The article then
   focuses on two specific discourses within the meta-discourse, the Vacant
   Womb and the Deviant Womb, that inform understandings of gender, agency
   and political violence in one particular cultural artefact: the British
   television drama, Britz. The main argument is that motherhood is
   `everywhere' in representations of female agency in political violence
   and that it is useful to think about motherhood as a myth. Only this way
   can we confront underlying norms, values and ideas believed to be common
   sense and think differently about gender, agency and political violence.},

Abstract = {This article examines the role of environmental change in conducting
   intelligence assessments, and the important role in integrating
   scientific data with background assumptions behind military and security
   planning. Tracing the development of environmental security concepts,
   recent military and intelligence interest in climate and environmental
   changes are based on practical concerns over critical vulnerabilities of
   infrastructure, energy supplies, and systemstability. Examples from
   Central Asia illustrate the cascading nature of environmental security
   risks, particularly with water and energy systems. The discussion
   follows with how scenarios and risk assessments can be integrated with
   concepts from environmental net assessments, and why traditional
   assumptions of probabilities, uncertainties and secrecy may be
   misleading. It is essential to understand not only how extreme future
   changes might be, but what capabilities we and allies posses to adapt to
   environmental-related hazards.},

Journal = {EUROPE-ASIA STUDIES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {64},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {543-560},
Abstract = {This essay argues that, although it is tempting to view Russian policies
   through a revived Cold War paradigm, this is a problematic and
   ultimately misguided approach. Such an approach ignores the significant
   sources of discontinuity and rupture between the Soviet Union and
   post-Soviet Russia. The essay presents an alternative framework for
   understanding and conceptualising Russia's engagement with the Middle
   East. This has three dimensions and takes an `inside-out' approach.
   First, there are the domestic drivers for Russian engagement which is
   linked to the perceived need to counter the threat of secessionism in
   the North Caucasus and the potential broader radicalisation of Russia's
   Muslim population. Second, there are the more strictly economic
   interests in the Middle East, which include increasingly important
   trading relations with moderate pro-Western states in the region. And,
   third, there are the geopolitical considerations which certainly include
   potential competition with the West but also incorporate Russian
   ambitions to promote its credentials as a responsible great power
   supporting international norms, such as the principle of
   non-proliferation and a settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict. The
   tension and conflict between these two strands of Russian policy making
   have been notably present in Moscow's responses to the Arab Spring.},

Abstract = {Anti-globalization movement is an inevitable product of the development
   of globalization. It mainly consists of two basic forms: the street
   demonstrations against globalization and World Social Forum with
   anti-globalization as its leading target. Essentially, the
   anti-globalization movement is not against the process of globalization
   itself, but against the great influences and various negative results of
   neoliberal globalization. By bringing great challenges and pressures
   upon the elites in different countries and international economic
   institutions that promote globalization, anti-globalization movement is
   playing a positive restricting role on the present world globalization
   and its further development, and is helpful to make globalization
   humanistic, just, equal and sustainable.
   Anti-globalization movement is an inevitable product of the development
   of globalization. Since the mid-1990s, especially ``the Seattle
   Battle{''}(1) at the end of 20th century, anti-globalization movement
   has emerged and become popular in the world very quickly. In fact, the
   rise and development of the anti-globalization movement which aims at
   globalization are increasingly affecting and changing the present
   globalization process. Here, on the basis of a brief retrospection of
   the anti-globalization movement, the paper will analyze its restrictions
   on globalization from the essence of the movement so as to help the
   reader understand the anti-globalization movement.},

Abstract = {This article claims that the territorial structure of government results
   from a tension between scale and community. The benefits of scale arise
   from the nature of public goods, and include economic exchange,
   political power and protection against external shocks. Communities are
   double-edged in that they are characterized by parochial altruism.
   Altruism and social solidarity facilitate government within communities,
   but parochial attachments constrain government among communities. Scale
   and community, as theorized here, provide a setting for strategic
   choice. Both are in flux as patterns of human interaction change, and
   government itself shapes those patterns. Evidence is drawn from the five
   largest polities in the history of western Europe: the Roman Empire, the
   Frankish Empire, Napoleonic France, the Third Reich and the European
   Union.},

Abstract = {It has recently been suggested that philosophy -in particular,
   epistemology has a contribution to make to the analysis of criminal and
   military intelligence. The present article pursues this suggestion,
   taking three phenomena that have recently been studied by philosophers,
   and showing that they have important implications for the gathering and
   sharing of intelligence, and for the use of intelligence in the
   determining of strategy. The phenomena discussed are: (1) Simpson's
   Paradox, (2) the distinction between resiliency and reliability of data,
   and (3) the Causal Markov Condition.},

Abstract = {A large body of research has examined the organizational factors that
   promote women's access to positions of workplace authority. Fewer
   studies explore how women's access to these positions influences gender
   inequality among subordinates. Utilizing a 2005 national sample of South
   Korean organizations, this article examines whether having women in
   managerial and supervisory roles is associated with lower levels of
   workplace sex segregation. In other words, do female leaders function as
   ``agents of change,{''} or are they merely ``cogs in the machine{''}?
   The findings indicate that women's representation in managerial
   positions is associated with lower levels of sex segregation. Women's
   representation among supervisory positions, however, is associated with
   higher levels of sex segregation. The results, in general, suggest that
   women in higher levels of organizational power may be important
   catalysts for change, while women in supervisory positions may be a
   manifestation of institutionalized inequality. The authors conclude with
   implications for theory and future research.},

Volume = {3},

Abstract = {Nationalism has been used in cliched and hegemonic discourses of the
   West to describe China's national feeling. In this paper, the author
   first analyzes the epistemological, political and globalization origins
   of the myth of Chinese nationalism, which are embodied in political
   nationalism, ethnic nationalism, and cultural nationalism. He argues
   that to shape a new Chinese national identity through modifying the
   so-called ``new nationalism{''} is merely to continue the myth of
   Chinese nationalism in the new era. The author then puts forward a new
   analysis of the frameworks of ``of the nation, by the nation, for the
   nation{''} and ``nationalization stage-modernization
   stage-internationalization stage.{''} He points out that the future
   Chinese national identity should include three aspects: an open and
   inclusive national spirit, a harmonious national character, and a
   moderate sense of national pride. As the largest developing country in
   the world and a rising world power, China has to achieve modernization
   and internationalization at the same time and to unite the motherland
   and realize nationalization, accomplishing the whole task at one stroke
   and binding together the trinity of historical traditions, international
   trends, and world identity. In the course of building a harmonious world
   of lasting peace and common prosperity, China is seeking her new
   identity as a responsible country. Finally, the author concludes that
   China's peaceful development is shaping China's new identity and will
   naturally destroy all kinds of myths about Chinese nationalism.},

Journal = {EUROPE-ASIA STUDIES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {64},
Number = {8, SI},
Pages = {1395-1414},
Abstract = {This essay examines the development of one regional blogosphere, the
   Central Asian `Stanosphere', through a focus on the neweurasia blog
   project. The neweurasia project began in 2005 as an English-language
   volunteer-run blog project about the former Soviet republics of Central
   Asia and the Caucasus, rapidly becoming one of the most visited blogs
   about the region. Following this auspicious start, over the next five
   years neweurasia developed into a multi-language locally driven project
   with more than 80,000 unique page views on average per month. Despite
   its indisputable successes, the project was often a steep learning curve
   for all involved. In this essay, we examine neweurasia's evolution from
   `blogging Central Asia' towards a citizen media project, and reflect on
   some of the issues and challenges encountered. On the basis of our
   discussion, we reflect upon how neweurasia, and citizen media in
   general, can maximise its impact on the nascent Stanosphere, in the
   process helping to give Central Asia a voice in the global blogosphere.},

Abstract = {This essay investigates the blog of Dmitrii Medvedev whose presidency
   marked the move of the Russian political field towards online
   communication. The case is an example of a hybrid model of blogging
   positioned between the official press service and informality of
   participatory media. I use the concept of symbolic power to explore the
   blog's search for public consent. The study also draws on a theoretical
   distinction between broadcast and post-broadcast forms of communication.
   In a generally hostile environment of the Russian blogosphere, the blog
   succeeds due to its discourse of effectiveness and connections with
   media networks both traditional and online.},

Abstract = {As a consequence of the ontological and epistemological traditions
   dominating the private military and security company literature to date,
   the embodied dimensions of the industry have been overlooked. The
   current article addresses this lacuna through a phenomenological focus
   on the links between military corporeal conditioning, possibilities for
   the industry's emergence, and the impact of contractors on security. I
   develop the concept of geocorporeality to make explicit the geopolitical
   relevance of security contractors' military trained bodies. The article
   concludes by drawing out the implications of this embodied line of
   enquiry for questions of contractor accountability and agent
   intentionality.},

Abstract = {When people fail to locate a personal belonging, it often evokes
   disturbing reflections of self that they will seek to overcome. While
   ethnomethodology once manufactured breaches in the taken-for-granted
   order to reveal the implicit rules of social life, this article explores
   how people try to recover from such breaches occurring naturally in
   their material environment. Drawing on a database of about five hundred
   cases of naturally occurring losses collected through several
   ethnographic techniques, this article demonstrates how people get back
   to life as usual through four unique paths. Through each, individuals
   resolve or avoid the disturbances caused when their taken-for-granted
   sense of what objects are immediately available to them breaks down.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {6},
Number = {2},
Pages = {344-354},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The 1986 short novel, Adios, Ayacucho (Farewell, Ayacucho), by Peruvian
   writer Julio Ortega, can be read as a set of aspirational claims
   regarding the, at the time, nascent transitional justice discourse.
   Analyzed against the findings of the Peruvian Truth and Reconciliation
   Commission about the same events it portrays, Ortega's novel opens a
   productive discussion about the way memory - or, rather, memories -
   should be constructed in the wake of the armed conflict. As the
   disjointed narration of a fragmented body's failed quest for
   whole(some)ness, the text advocates for a decentralized process of
   memory building. If transitional justice is to attain its fundamental
   aim of reinstating and enhancing citizenship in the wake of massive
   human rights violations, the novel seems to argue, it should engulf not
   only centralized institutional attempts at memory building but also
   alternative narratives that recognize the plurality of perspectives and
   voices that plague an inevitably fragmented social body.},

Abstract = {Mixed delivery of public services is gaining increasing attention as a
   way for public managers to avoid deciding between a purely public and
   purely private delivery system. The unusual coexistence of public and
   private operators in the urban bus market in Barcelona provides an
   interesting context in which to analyze the challenges and opportunities
   posed by this system. Competition for concessions among private
   operators and the regulation of concessionaires generate incentives to
   improve efficiency and quality. Furthermore, partial privatization
   increases the efficiency and feasibility of public operators. In fact,
   competitive bidding is effective in disciplining private operators and
   increasing the regulators' bargaining power over both public and private
   firms. The reform implemented in Barcelona offers an interesting insight
   into all metropolitan areas that are in a position to create a number of
   separate concessions large enough to benefit from economies of density.},

Abstract = {In assessing the various forms of welfare capitalism, normative
   political philosophy typically draws on two major philosophical
   traditions - republicanism and liberalism, invoking either equality and
   the public good or, alternatively, individual autonomy as normative
   criteria for evaluation. Drawing, instead, on Critical Theory as a
   tradition of social philosophy, I advance a proposal for assessment of
   the types of welfare capitalism conducted as `immanent critique' of the
   key structural dynamics of contemporary capitalism. Normative criteria
   thus emerge within a diachronic dimension of social transformation,
   which in turn grounds the comparison among synchronic types of
   capitalism. This ultimately enables a research agenda for the
   operationalisation of a normative analysis of capitalism within which
   social justice is gauged by the degree of voluntary employment
   flexibility - a key factor in the distribution of life-chances in the
   early twenty-first century.},

Abstract = {This essay examines the new forms of civic and political engagement that
   the increasing accessibility of internet-based media has precipitated in
   the Bulgarian context. It discusses the results of three case studies
   which focus respectively on online forum discussions of a significant
   political event; a campaign of eco-protests; and the activism emerging
   from a website and forum dedicated to motherhood. The essay argues that
   new media have brought civic and political issues and the possibility to
   deliberate and act on them into the everyday lives of Bulgarians. As a
   result, the voice of Bulgarian civil society has grown stronger and has
   been able to penetrate the sphere of formal politics, sometimes with
   important consequences.},

Journal = {INTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY},

Volume = {27},
Number = {3},
Pages = {349-370},
Abstract = {In general, so it is argued in this article, the intelligence community
   would benefit from an agenda of greater and more conscious reflexivity.
   This increased self-awareness should as a minimum be applied to the
   areas of collection, analysis and communication, and it should bring
   members of the intelligence community to habitually reassess both
   procedures and standards of their work. Such a process promises to
   improve analysis, reduce misunderstandings in communication and increase
   public trust in the intelligence community. It will, in short, help the
   intelligence community prepare for a turbulent future.},

Abstract = {Iran's Islamic Revolution and the takeover of the United States embassy
   in Tehran in November 1979 was America's and the West's first encounter
   with contemporary radical Islam. It prompted substantial intelligence
   cooperation amongst Western countries. Their liaison included not only
   the collection of human intelligence (Humint) but also an effort to
   protect six Americans who had escaped becoming hostages, and then a
   successful covert exfiltration operation to secure their escape from
   Iran. Canadian embassy staff, assisted by CIA experts, mounted this
   operation in late January 1980. We use the Iranian Revolution and
   occupation of the American embassy in Tehran both to flesh out the
   nature of contemporary Western Humint cooperation and to highlight the
   intelligence activities, including international intelligence liaison,
   of Western foreign ministries.},

Title = {Muscular Interventionism GENDER, POWER AND LIBERAL PEACEBUILDING
   IN POST-CONFLICT BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL FEMINIST JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {14},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {529-548},
Abstract = {This article highlights the centrality of gender to the liberal
   peacebuilding agenda in Bosnia-Herzegovina. It examines the discourses
   and practices of liberal interventionism, focusing on the Office of the
   High Representative (OHR) as a crucial site for the constitution of
   gendered subjects and agents in this post-conflict zone. Drawing on
   poststructural theories and representations of Balkan identity, it
   explores the gendered articulations of Paddy Ashdown, first during his
   wartime visits to Bosnia-Herzegovina, and second, during his tenure as
   High Representative. A discourse-theoretical analysis highlights how
   Ashdown rationalized his involvement in wartime Bosnia-Herzegovina
   through a powerful self-identification with an interventionist model of
   masculinity which equates manliness with a responsibility to protect a
   vulnerable/backward/feminized Balkan other from violence and harm.
   Moreover, gendered discourses helped to conceptualize and legitimate the
   peace implementation role of the OHR, allowing the organization to
   position coercive strategies and policies as appropriate and necessary
   for creating sustainable peace. Overall, this article highlights how
   gender is mobilized to promote and impose liberal policies and norms,
   with significant implications for the quality of peace being
   (re)constructed.},

Abstract = {Today, the idea of risk is ubiquitous, a presence in debates across a
   range of fields, from investment banking to politics, from anthropology
   and sociology to health, environmental and cultural studies. While this
   ubiquity attests to the importance of the concept it is at the same time
   a potential weakness in that it injects the term into a wide range of
   debates in each of which its meaning can be subject to different
   emphases and meanings. The notion of risk is of obvious importance to
   security intelligence, but here too its ubiquity has had an impact on
   specificity of meaning. While the term is widely used in both the
   profession and study of intelligence, its usage can carry different
   meanings and it can be used interchangeably with linked terms. Given the
   importance of the idea of risk to intelligence, clarity of meaning is
   essential. This article sets out to consider the meaning of, and
   relationship between, uncertainty and risk in a security intelligence
   context, propose a framework on which a common understanding can be
   built, and illustrate how this can help in thinking about the nature and
   role of security intelligence.},

Abstract = {Recent releases from the National Security Agency reveal details of
   TICOM, the mysterious 1945 operation targeting Germany's cryptologic
   secrets. Often mentioned by such authors as Kahn, Bamford, Parrish and
   Aldrich, for the first time the public has access to this information.
   This article provides a review in greater depth than has been previously
   covered in the open literature of the history of the TICOM operation,
   and its resulting intelligence, including the Germans' efforts against
   Soviet communications. In addition, some comments are provided on why
   TICOM has remained classified long after other similar information from
   World War II was declassified, and why locating TICOM documents is still
   difficult.},

Volume = {3},
Pages = {309-327},
Abstract = {The inner logic of the historical process of globalization seems very
   puzzling as a result of the non-existence of a consensus on this subject
   over the past years. The author begins with the internal relations among
   developments in globalization-related areas, stressing that the
   extension and deepening of the market economy is the most lasting and
   stable aspect as well as the basic driving force in the process of
   globalization. Seen both from the theoretical and macro levels, in
   combination with the development of world history and the
   characteristics of contemporary international relations, the author
   points out that it is the globalization of the market economy, not the
   economic relationship, that is redrawing the global economic picture,
   changing the balance of power, continually differentiating the nature
   and content of international relations, and strongly promoting the
   current overall transformation of the world.
   Accelerated development of globalization is the most eye-catching
   phenomenon after the Cold War and has caused wide concern and
   discussions for a long period. After the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the
   Afghanistan War, the Iraqi War, SARS and Bird Flu, the world paid more
   attention to challenges in the security field and discussed less about
   globalization-related problems. But all the phenomena globalization
   discussions involved are still there and have developed, and the world
   is undergoing transformation at multiple layers. The situation has
   driven us to study the relations between them from a macro and
   comprehensive perspective. After all, the social political structure and
   it character stems from social economic conditions and the scope of
   people's interaction.},

   and monetary union (EMU) to the test and exposed gaps in its initial
   policy architecture. Collective rules of fiscal discipline have proven
   difficult fully to enforce and excessive public indebtedness has been
   confirmed as a potential source of systemic instability. Broader
   economic and financial imbalances have also been shown to carry
   important risks for individual Member States' and area-wide stability.
   Recent governance reforms have sought to address these shortcomings. In
   particular, the so-called Six-Pack has brought changes strengthening the
   ability to prevent and correct economic and fiscal imbalances in the
   future. With the crisis not terminated, however, the debate over optimal
   policy arrangements continues and additional governance reforms have
   been put forward. This article reviews some lessons drawn from the
   crisis episode for the economic and budgetary framework of EMU and
   describes the governance reforms that have been undertaken as part of
   the comprehensive solution needed to underpin the single currency.},

Title = {Evaluating the Impact of Human Rights Work: The Office of the United
   Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Reduction of
   Extrajudicial Executions in Colombia},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS PRACTICE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {4},
Number = {3},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Many important stakeholders who participated in the fight against
   extrajudicial executions in Colombia have repeatedly mentioned that the
   presence and the interventions of the Office of the United Nations High
   Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) were crucial to their reduction.
   Hence, the question the present study will try to answer is: What role
   did OHCHR play in the reduction of extrajudicial executions and what was
   its impact? For the purpose of this study, `impact' was defined as a
   plausible attribution to the work of OHCHR in Colombia of certain
   outcomes within the fight against extrajudicial executions. The study
   tries to establish these `plausible attributions' based on an analysis
   of OHCHR's relations with the government and references to the influence
   of other actors.
   Important sources for this study are 22 interviews with key stakeholders
   who participated in the fight against extrajudicial executions since
   2002. The interviewees were direct witnesses, close observers, or
   decisive actors. Thus, the words of these insiders are fundamental for
   the endeavor to establish OHCHR's role and impact in the process.},

Title = {Does Changing a Light Bulb Lead to Changing the World? Political Action
   and the Conscious Consumer},
Journal = {ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {644},
Pages = {160-190},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {As the prevalence of ``conscious{''} consumption has grown, questions
   have arisen about its relationship to political action. An influential
   argument holds that political consumption individualizes responsibility
   for environmental degradation and ``crowds out{''} genuine forms of
   activism. While European and Canadian empirical research contradicts
   this perspective, finding that conscious consumption and political
   engagement are positively connected, no studies of this relationship
   have been conducted for the United States. This article presents
   ordinary least squares (OLS) regression models for two datasets, the
   2004 General Social Survey and a detailed survey of approximately 2,200
   conscious consumers conducted by the authors, to assess the nature of
   the relationship between conscious consumption and political activism.
   The authors find that measures of conscious consumption are
   significantly and positively related to political action, even when
   controlling for political involvement in the past. The results suggest
   that greater levels of political consumption are positively related to a
   range of political actions.},

Volume = {6},
Number = {3},
Pages = {394-400},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This article critically engages with Sabel and Zeitlin's important
   notion of experimentalist governance (EG). It is cast as a recursive
   process of provisional goal-setting and revision based on learning from
   the comparison of alternative approaches to advancing them in different
   contexts. This is a useful heuristic device to capture policymaking and
   implementation in complex, dynamic, and highly diverse political
   entities. This article discusses the micro-foundations underpinning EG,
   how it relates to hierarchical modes of governing, and how well it
   captures the distinctive traits of the EU. It also discusses EG from a
   democratic perspective. In democratic terms EG is understood as a form
   of direct deliberative polyarchy. This article notes that the question
   of EG's contribution to democratization cannot, however, be adequately
   addressed unless we pay more systematic attention to representation and
   representative democracy.},

Abstract = {The article examines the claims of the small states literature on the
   importance of alliance formation. It applies it to the case of Ireland
   and Iceland and asks whether membership of the EU and euro in Ireland
   and the absence of these in Iceland had a say in their reduction of risk
   before the financial crisis, assistance in absorbing the shock of their
   crash and help in recovering after it. The article argues that the
   notion of shelter needs to take more account of domestic arrangements
   and the shelter's costs though the cases confirm the importance of
   alliance formation.},

Abstract = {In the minds of many Americans, the ghetto is where ``the black people
   live,{''} symbolizing an impoverished, crime-prone, drug-infested, and
   violent area of the city. Aided by the mass media and popular culture,
   this image of the ghetto has achieved an iconic status, and serves as a
   powerful source of stereotype, prejudice, and discrimination. The
   history of racism in America, along with the ascription of ``ghetto{''}
   to anonymous blacks, has burdened blacks with a negative presumption
   they must disprove before they can establish mutually trusting
   relationships with others. The poorest blacks occupy a caste-like
   status, and for the black middle class, contradictions and dilemmas of
   status are common, underscoring the racial divide and exacerbating
   racial tensions.},

Pages = {25-42},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {With the racial progress the nation has made over the past half century,
   including the growth of the black middle class and the election of a
   black president, many are now prepared to proclaim the United States a
   postracial society, where egalitarian values most often prevail; race is
   no longer a significant barrier to power, privilege, and prestige; and
   racial prejudice is mostly a thing of the past. When observed
   ethnographically, the lived experience of race relations suggests a
   different view and conceptual framework. As the legacy of racial caste,
   the color line persists in social interaction and is evident in racially
   determined perspectives and local working conceptions that order race
   relations and contribute to persistent racial inequality. Indeed, the
   claim of a postracial society is an ideological discourse that denies
   continuing patterns of race relations.},

Abstract = {Conducting ethnographic fieldwork in varied spaces, with different
   actors, enriches our understanding. A researcher may find paradoxes in
   practices and ideas and ask for clarification, or recognize that social
   dynamics and behavior are peculiar to group members present in a
   specific setting. This article highlights the usefulness of intentional
   variability and flexibility in the field. Researchers should plan to do
   multi-site analysis (MSA) to look for negative cases and opportunities
   to challenge commonsense notions. Additionally, this article emphasizes
   that the relationships built during fieldwork shape the data that are
   captured. Therefore, researchers need to consider the bases for their
   relationships, including what the subjects get out of them, and how
   subjects' positionality affects what comes to be known. This perspective
   de-emphasizes false norms of objectivity and renders a more complete
   account of the social worlds we study.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {6},
Number = {2},
Pages = {205-228},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This article contributes to an ongoing conversation among feminist
   scholars about what constitutes feminist positioning with regard to the
   central issues that define transitions from conflict or repression
   towards more liberal polities. The analysis suggests that the feminist
   presence in transitional justice is complex, multilayered and still in
   the process of full engagement. Concentrating on the genealogy of this
   presence, the article reflects on what are commonly invoked scholarly
   and policy reference points, showing how little gender analysis and
   women's issues entered into the discursive fray in the public and
   political arenas where the terminology of accountability emerged. The
   challenge in assessing feminist positioning is that an uncritical and
   narrowly liberal conception of gender equality directs our gaze away

Abstract = {California is the global hub for assisted reproductive technology
   practices, including egg donation. The rise of egg donation in the
   United States is surprising given the cultural context linking genetics
   and motherhood and rejecting the commodification of reproduction.
   Scholars in the hostile worlds camp have grappled with the relationship
   between intimacy and economics, yet employing this theory to explain the
   increase in egg donation is unsatisfactory. The concept of relational
   work, developed by Viviana Zelizer, provides scholars with a robust
   analytical tool to account for the rise in egg donation. This paper
   analyzes the relational work of egg donors and fertility center staff. I
   argue that donors and staff construct an understanding of egg donation
   that avoids directly challenging the cultural context mentioned above.
   Analyzing egg donation as a case of relational work demonstrates the
   need to move beyond the reciprocity/market dichotomy upheld by the
   hostile worlds framework.},

Abstract = {This article reviews the evolution of subsidiarity as a constitutional
   principle within the case law of the European Court of Justice. It
   argues that, to date, discussion of subsidiarity as a judicial principle
   remains narrowly focused on its impact as a restraint on the Union
   legislature. In an effort to steer debate in another direction, this
   article revisits and supports arguments in favour of applying
   subsidiarity as a brake on the Court's own interpretative functions.
   Thereafter, it isolates the Court's interpretation of the Treaty free
   movement provisions as an empirical example to test this underdeveloped
   dimension of subsidiarity.},

Abstract = {In 2010, the city of Philadelphia launched a media campaign to reduce
   the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) in homes with
   children as a strategy to combat obesity. Using the integrative model
   (IM) of behavioral change and prediction, a theory-based pre-campaign
   survey of Philadelphia parents was conducted to determine the most
   effective message content. Results indicated that intention to eliminate
   SSB consumption is attitudinally driven and suggested that effective
   messages should highlight feelings of nurturing and concern about child
   weight gain. Focus group testing led to the selection of a television
   ad, transit/print ad, and a radio spot that incorporated aspects of the
   theory-based results from the baseline survey. An online message testing
   experiment found that exposure to campaign messages increased intention
   to reduce SSBs and supported the underlying beliefs in the correct
   direction. These results illustrate how the IM can be applied to the
   development of a public health intervention.},

Title = {From failure to failure: The politics of international banking
   regulation},
Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {19},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {609-638},
Abstract = {It is now clear that Basel III, a much discussed set of proposals to
   govern the international banking system drawn up by the Basel Committee
   on Banking Supervision, has fallen far short of its creators' aims. Even
   more puzzlingly, this is not without precedent. Eleven years ago, partly
   in response to the Asian financial crisis of 1997, the Basel Committee
   attempted to overhaul global banking rules in order to enhance the
   stability of the global financial system. The culmination of its
   five-year efforts, the Basel II Accord, was abandoned by regulators
   before ever being fully implemented. In this paper, I ask why Basel II
   failed to meet the Basel Committee's original objectives and why Basel
   III has met a similar fate. Drawing on recent work on the politics of
   global regulation, I present a theoretical framework which emphasizes
   the importance of timing and sequencing in determining the outcome of
   rule-making in global finance. The success of this framework in
   explaining the failure of Basel II and Basel III is an invitation to
   scholars in the field of International Relations to take `time'
   seriously as an analytical variable.},

Pages = {1505-1523},
Abstract = {This essay looks at the role of the Eurovision Song Contest-an annual
   regularised European media event-in fostering the reconceptualisation of
   national selves of participating states. It draws attention to the
   representations of `new' post-Soviet national brands at Eurovision in
   their interspatial (national, international and transnational) and
   inter-temporal (Soviet and post-Soviet) dimensions using the case of
   Ukraine. The essay argues that, through the manipulation of gendered,
   sexual and ethnic stereotypes, and by exploiting a kitsch idiom, the
   Ukrainian entry by Verka Serduchka in 2007, as well as the online
   responses to the show, aimed to articulate a vision of European
   nationhood, which simultaneously staked a position among other states of
   the former Soviet Union and reconfigured relationships with the shared
   Soviet past.},

Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {489-507},
Abstract = {This article moves beyond stereotypical portrayals of the connections
   between hyper-masculinity and violence in militarized contexts and
   identifies expressions of insurgent masculinities different from the
   imagery of heroic guerrilla fighter. Based on conversations with fifty
   female and male former insurgent militants in Peru, Colombia and El
   Salvador, this comparative analysis explores patterns within gender
   regimes created in insurgent movements. This contribution shows that
   gender is not merely a side contradiction, but that guerrilla movements
   invest considerable efforts in creating and managing gender relations.
   The construction of insurgent masculinities is not based on the
   rejection or devaluation of women in general, but requires diluting
   gendered dichotomies, enabling not only alternative role models
   functional for armed struggle, but also femalemale bonding, prioritizing
   comrade identity over gender-binary consciousness.},

Title = {Money, Benefits, and Power: A Test of the Glass Ceiling and Glass

Abstract = {This article explores the manner in which race, ethnicity, and gender
   intersect to produce inequality in wages and employer benefits among
   ``workers{''} (employees with no job authority), ``supervisors{''}
   (employees with broad supervisory responsibilities), and ``managers{''}
   (employees who can hire/fire and set the pay of others). Using data
   uniquely suited to examine these relationships, the author finds that,
   contrary to the glass ceiling hypothesis, the white male advantage over
   women and minorities in wages and retirement benefits generally does not
   increase with movement up the authority hierarchy net of controls.
   Instead, relative inequality remains constant at higher and lower levels
   of authority. However, in nontraditional work settings where white men
   report to minority and female supervisors, there is evidence that a
   glass ceiling stifles women and minorities while a glass escalator helps
   white men. Instead of representing mutually exclusive processes and
   outcomes, glass ceilings and glass escalators may actually overlap in
   certain employment contexts. The implications of these results for
   future analyses of workplace inequality are discussed.},

Abstract = {This essay investigates the conflict between two different ways of
   writing in Bulgarian on the web: using the standard Cyrillic alphabet
   and using the Latin script. Initially, the reason for using the Latin
   script was purely technical: the absence of appropriate software for
   decoding Cyrillic fonts. However, the Latin script remained popular even
   after the encoding problems were solved, acquiring new ideological
   meanings and provoking political controversies. This essay discusses the
   subcultural, cultural and political consequences of these developments.},

Volume = {3},
Pages = {181-201},
Abstract = {Globalization has placed states in a totally new situation, as national
   borders weaken, local power increases, and the historical alliance of
   the free economy, the welfare state and democracy further collapses.
   This new situation expands the theory of the state beyond state-market
   relations focused solely on the relations between state and society and
   governance. In a changing situation, states must seek new ways of
   developing partnership between public and private sectors and
   self-reliance through cooperation while carrying out social welfares
   reforms. They must actively create new forms of national sovereignty and
   autonomy in a framework of multi-level governance, and reinforce
   cooperation mechanisms for cross-border coordination and control.
   Balance must be found between global and local governance for mutual
   complementarity, without denying diversity. When co-existence and
   interaction are built up at all levels, there will be a fully developed
   system of governance.
   The relation between globalization and state has been highlighted as the
   core theoretical problem during the course of globalization.
   Globalization has put state in a totally new situation as borders
   weaken, local power increases, and the historical alliance of the free
   economy, the welfare state and democracy further collapses. The state's
   new situation expands the research scope of the theory of the state. The
   need to rethink the state will inevitably combine the concern of
   realistic experience with the transformation of the state theory.
   British scholar Mark J. Smith said, ``On the most fundamental level,
   understanding of the state depends on how to treat the relation between
   reality and ideal.{''}(1) The state theory revived under the new
   situation has not given up the traditional understanding of state, but
   the discussion about state is no longer limited to the relation between
   state and market but always focused on the relation between state and
   society and governance. If the state theory in 1960s and 1970s is viewed
   as a response to the success of state interventionism, the revival of
   the state theory under the new situation is the rethinking of ``the
   revival of sociability{''} and the destruction of nation-states'
   material basis and the challenge to sovereignty. New topics about state
   include: the historical changeability of the form of state; the relative
   strength and competitiveness that state has in international relations;
   the future of nation-state in the era of globalization; the partnership
   and cooperative relations developed between various governance
   organizations and state and so on. 2 All these topics are not abstract
   theoretical discussions such as the interest roused by Marxism in the
   mid 1960s to explain state in theory and the holistic concern over the
   form and functions of capitalist states in West Europe and North America
   since later 1970s which aimed to ``bring state back into the focus of
   attention{''} and contained many institutionalism elements. Instead,
   they are of greater empirical significance and discussions about state
   are even not ``state-centered{''}. These breakthroughs on the study of
   state and state power(3) has laid an important foundation for our
   consideration of state's political philosophy and ``tactic{''} governing
   capacity and advanced the question: what a role do the state play in the
   new situation and how can it effectively accomplish traditional and new
   tasks?},

Abstract = {Corporations have increasingly turned to voluntary, multi-stakeholder
   governance programs to monitor workers' rights and standards in global
   supply chains. This article argues that the emphasis of these programs
   varies significantly depending on stakeholder involvement and issue
   areas under examination. Corporate-influenced programs are more likely
   to emphasize detection of violations of minimal standards in the areas
   of wages, hours, and occupational safety and health because focusing on
   these issues provides corporations with legitimacy and reduces the risks
   of uncertainty created by activist campaigns. In contrast, these
   programs are less likely to emphasize workers' rights to form democratic
   and independent unions, bargain, and strike because these rights are
   perceived as lessening managerial control without providing firms with
   significant reputational value. This argument is explored by coding 805
   factory audits of the Fair Labor Association between 2002 and 2010,
   followed by case studies of Russell Athletic in Honduras, Apple in
   China, and worker rights monitoring in Vietnam.},

Abstract = {A large literature in international political economy views individuals
   trade policy preferences as a function of the income effects of economic
   openness. We argue that the expected environmental consequences of free
   trade play a noteworthy role for protectionist attitudes that has not
   been noted so far. We use unique Swiss survey data that contain measures
   of individuals environmental concerns and different aspects of trade
   policy preferences to examine whether those who are more concerned about
   the environment also hold more protectionist trade policy preferences.
   Our results support this expectation. Individuals who are more concerned
   about the environment tend to think that globalization has more negative
   than positive effects, more strongly support jobs-related protectionism,
   and place more emphasis on aspects that go beyond price and quality when
   evaluating foreign products. Our results suggest that also the expected
   environmental consequences of free trade matter for trade policy
   preferences and not just the potential effects on the domestic wage
   distribution.},

Abstract = {International criminal trials are believed to contribute to the notion
   of justice through producing a record of the causes of conflicts, the
   responsible actors and parties, as well as the events; this includes
   investigating incidents involving the death of victims and the events
   that preceded their deaths. The novelty of the forensic operations into
   mass graves under the auspices of the International Criminal Tribunal
   for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) led to what has been described as
   `deployment chaos' adversely affecting forensic missions. This article
   examines the interaction among legal, investigative and forensic
   practitioners involved during such missions. Relying on qualitative
   research, the article examines the possible tensions that can arise
   between the various professions engaged in investigations for
   international criminal proceedings. Key recommendations that follow from
   the analysis include the need to recognize ethical concerns amongst the
   professions involved; understand the legal framework and evidentiary
   requirements; invest in planning, training, recruitment and contracts;
   and ensure continuity in staffing, protocols and decision-making. The
   article concludes by synthesizing the findings into a model designed to
   rectify past problems and to prepare for future investigations of mass
   graves.},

Abstract = {An apparent lack of similar cases has shaped how observers compare
   integration in Europe with other regions. The growing field of
   comparative regionalism, however, has overlooked three decades of
   sustained economic integration between Australia and New Zealand. This
   article introduces trans-Tasman integration as a new empirical case of
   regional economic integration. It compares trans-Tasman integration with
   European experience with reference to deepening economic integration and
   supranational institutional arrangements, and explores similarities and
   differences with other regional arrangements. Adding this second case of
   deep integration to the comparative field enhances the understanding of
   regional integration in different contexts.},

Abstract = {This article introduces the concept of citizenship vocabularies and
   argues that these vocabularies serve as resources for civic and
   political action. Drawing on interviews with young adults, the author
   presents a conceptual mapping of citizenship vocabularies. Examples show
   how citizenship vocabularies play a role in constraining or enabling
   emerging repertoires of participation such as political consumption. The
   article concludes by briefly outlining an agenda for exploring the
   connections among political socialization, citizenship vocabularies, and
   political participation.},

Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},
Number = {3},
Pages = {247-266},

Abstract = {The conflicts of interest that prevailed between the great powers in the
   wake of the First World War eviscerated their ability to respond
   collectively to the advent of the Great Depression. Instead, each turned
   to discriminatory trade barriers and trade blocs to try to revive
   domestic output. Persuaded that trade discrimination exacerbated the
   political tensions that erupted in World War II, policy makers
   constructed a postwar economic order that institutionalized
   nondiscrimination. Thus, Article 1 of the charter of the General
   Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) mandates most-favored nation (MFN)
   treatment. We argue here that the MFN clause itself encouraged the
   adoption of practices and policies that actually recreated
   discrimination. In particular, we argue, developing countries, long
   regarded as victims of discrimination, institutionalized it in their
   negotiations with each other. We examine two developing country PTAs
   that included about 80 percent of all developing-country GATT members by
   output (the Global System of Trade Preferences and the Protocol Relating
   to Trade Negotiations). We show that as in the GATT writ large, their
   patterns of tariff cuts and trade expansion were highly skewed toward a
   small number of their largest members. In trying to avoid
   discrimination, policy makers actually encouraged its de facto adoption.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The concept of a regime complex has proved fruitful to a burgeoning
   literature in international relations, but it has also opened up new
   questions about how and why they develop over time. This article
   describes the history of the energy regime complex as it has changed
   over the past 40 years, and interprets this history in light of an
   interpretive framework of the sources of institutional change. One of
   its principal contributions is to highlight what Stephen Krasner
   referred to as a pattern of ``punctuated equilibrium{''} reflecting both
   periods of stasis and periods of innovation, as opposed to a gradual
   process of change. We show that the timing of innovation depends on
   dissatisfaction and shocks and that the nature of innovation-that is,
   whether it is path-dependent or -depends on interest homogeneity among
   major actors. This paper is the first to demonstrate the empirical
   applicability of the punctuated equilibrium concept to international
   regime complexes, and contributes to the eventual development of a
   dynamic theory of change in regime complexes.},

Abstract = {Using the MahoneyThelen causal model one would expect layering to be the
   dominant kind of institutional change affecting Swiss banking secrecy.
   Our research into governance in Swiss banking shows that it does not fit
   this theoretical model. Applying deviant case analysis we have refined
   our understanding of institutional change. We argue that the removal of
   rules and the momentum of pressure should be acknowledged when
   explaining variations of institutional change and we suggest that the
   processes of shrinkage should not be ignored.},

Abstract = {This article aims to explain the broader evolution of British merger
   control. To this end it outlines a novel critical political economy
   perspective on regulation and regulatory change which differs from
   established political economy approaches, such as the regulatory
   capitalism/state perspectives, in three main ways: it places regulatory
   ideas at the heart of the analysis, it differentiates between different
   degrees of regulatory change, and it links regulatory change in
   delineated issue areas with changing power balances between fractions of
   capital and labor. The application of this perspective to the analysis
   of the evolution of British merger control provides some important new
   insights, most notably that the content, form, and scope of merger
   control in Britain have been deeply transformed in accordance with
   neoliberal ideas since the 1980s and that this process, which was part
   of a broader regulatory and ideational shift, was premised on the
   ascendancy of transnational capital.},

Abstract = {This study addresses the question of whether and how legal authorities
   ought to intervene in work organizations in order to most effectively
   regulate the behavior of employees. This question is examined
   empirically, by exploring whether the association between the level of
   fairness employees experience in procedures regarding pay and benefits,
   and their adherence to workplace rules, differs depending upon whether
   those procedures are enacted by companies voluntarily or mandated by
   law. This question was addressed using both a survey of a representative
   sample of employees in Israel, as well as their reactions to an
   experimental vignette. The results generally suggest that evaluations of
   the procedural justice of performance appraisal hearings more strongly
   influenced judgments of overall workplace fairness, perceptions of
   management legitimacy, and employee rule-adherence behavior when
   employees believed fairer workplace procedures were required by law.},

Abstract = {The reasoned action model (RAM) of Fishbein and Ajzen has been highly
   influential in the social and health sciences. This article describes
   three areas for future research that should expand its explanatory
   power. One area of research focuses on an idiographic RAM that
   encourages researchers to pursue the estimation of RAM parameters on a
   per-individual level rather than through traditional nomothetic
   modeling. The second area encourages scientists to develop a
   split-second RAM, that is, a RAM that can provide perspectives on the
   split-second decisions people make in everyday life. Integration of the
   RAM with models of working (short-term) memory is stressed. The third
   area for research encourages scientists to develop a multioption RAM
   that incorporates and is responsive to the choices that people make when
   confronted with multiple alternatives. This perspective stresses the
   need to apply the RAM to the full range of behavioral options that are
   available to people as they contemplate performing one behavior versus
   another. Perspectives for theoretical advancement in each area are
   developed.},

Abstract = {This article addresses the relationship between presidentialism and
   democracy by examining the role of parties in legislative bargaining in
   the 2000-2003 Russian Duma. Using a novel methodological approach, I
   empirically identify legislative voting coalitions to investigate
   whether the president's preference for party-based legislative
   bargaining prevailed. I find that in contrast to the 1996-1999 Duma,
   legislative voting coalitions closely followed party lines and that
   factions representing narrow interests were less relevant. The results
   demonstrate that presidential politics dominates electoral incentives in
   this political system and, more broadly, that political parties could be
   indispensable for regimes in transition to authoritarianism.},

Abstract = {After three years of recurrent crisis, what is the future of the euro?
   For some skeptical observers, mounting tensions in the euro zone are
   fast approaching a breaking point. Europe's daring monetary experiment,
   we are told, is doomed to end in spectacular failure. For others, by
   contrast, the outcome ultimately will be not less union but ``more
   Europe{''} - an even tighter merger of national economic sovereignty.
   Tested by adversity, the euro will emerge more successful than ever. Who
   is right? The correct answer is: Neither. Skeptics are wrong because
   they underestimate Europe's deep political commitment to the euro's
   survival, in some form or other. Euro-enthusiasts are wrong because they
   overestimate the amount of ``give{''} in Europe's domestic politics. The
   euro will neither fail nor succeed. Defective but defended, it will
   simply endure.},

Title = {The Patrimonial Logic of the Police in Eastern Europe},
Journal = {EUROPE-ASIA STUDIES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {64},
Number = {5},
Pages = {811-833},
Abstract = {The police in Eastern Europe are often regarded as politicised, poorly
   trained and corrupt. This article argues that the police follow a
   patrimonial logic. Neo-patrimonialism is mostly understood as an
   authoritarian regime with a personal ruler at the top. By contrast, here
   a concept will be suggested which reformulates patrimonialism as the
   practice of the acquisition of offices and material resources. Based on
   this, two case studies analyse the police administration in Albania and
   Georgia. The findings suggest that patrimonial practices play a central
   role in the recruiting and financing of law enforcement officers. The
   result is a hybrid administration, which is significantly subject to
   special interests.},

Abstract = {This essay explores the experiences of recently married young women
   living in rural Russia in the village of Karsun in the Ul'yanovsk
   Oblast'. It analyses the connections between women in rural communities
   looking at social networks and the power relations inherent within them.
   The ways in which forms of power among and between women (as well as
   between women and men) impact on young women's agency are critically
   appraised through an analysis of what this essay terms forms of `women's
   power'. The essay also shows how women's discussions of their
   experiences reflect the problems that the perceived physical and
   emotional absences of men present for younger married women and their
   attempts to develop forms of autonomy.},

Title = {Solving the Mystery of African Governance},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {17},
Number = {5},
Pages = {659-666},
Abstract = {The dominant view of good governance as a pre-condition for economic
   success is theoretically compelling but empirically difficult to
   establish. Historical analyses tend to indicate a very strong
   correlation between institutional development and economic growth.
   Today's high-income and good-governance countries generally had
   bad-governance environments at low levels of income. Moreover, some of
   today's most successful economies still exhibit sub-optimal governance
   indicators. By focusing on the search for the determinants of some
   global governance standards that often reflect particular political,
   ideological and philosophical conceptions of power, the traditional
   literature on governance has so far failed to offer a set of actionable
   policies that poor countries could implement to foster inclusive growth
   in a pragmatic and incentives-compatible way. This article acknowledges
   that governance problems are indeed major impediments to economic
   growth. But contrary to conventional wisdom, it argues that the
   well-known governance problems in African countries are mainly the
   reflection of their low level of development, and the results of failed
   state interventions and distortions originating from erroneous economic
   development strategies. Instead of posing `good' governance as the main
   prescription and a prerequisite for sustained growth, development
   economists should design policy frameworks that offer the maximum
   likelihood of success because they are consistent with comparative
   advantage while providing minimum opportunities for rent-seeking and
   state capture.},

Journal = {EUROPE-ASIA STUDIES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {64},
Number = {8, SI},

Abstract = {This essay examines regimes of internet use, and the significance of the
   internet for everyday lives, in the Russian margins. The field site, a
   small provincial town in European Russia, was visited in 2009 and 2010.
   Informants were mainly families dependent on a single non-professional
   wage. Research materials-semi-structured interviews and participant
   observation-comprising an ethnography of internet use, are supplemented
   by survey data. Qualitative social research on new media use has
   critically examined technologically determinist assumptions about social
   effects of the internet, including the so-called `digital divide'. The
   present research also seeks a contextualised understanding of new media
   use by considering how it is embedded in established everyday social
   settings and practices. The ethnographic materials and survey data
   collected indicate that Woolgar's rules of virtuality hold true in the
   Russian margins: use of new media depends on the local social context
   and supplements, rather than replaces real activities. Most users in the
   group surveyed are highly instrumentalist and have little interest in
   the communicative and non-grounded aspects of the media. At the same
   time the impetus for initial access to the internet is closely related
   to issues of esteem and peer recognition within a social network rather
   than actual need.},

Abstract = {This article offers a comprehensive analysis of the different effects of
   the economic crisis from 2008, across all transition economies with a
   testable framework, that relates vulnerability to specific forms of
   development since 1989. The key to the framework is the identification
   of forms of integration into the international economy, with
   distinctions between different export structures and dependence on other
   sources of foreign-currency earnings. These created channels for
   transmission of the crisis which differed between countries. The
   analysis draws on a three-level research design, combining a
   variable-oriented regression analysis with case-oriented comparisons
   among similar cases, and within-case analysis of individual countries.},

Abstract = {In governance arrangements on the local, state, regional and
   international levels, lobbying as a strategy to gain influence on policy
   outcomes via informal channels takes place. While most studies focus on
   how individuals, companies, interest groups or non-governmental
   organizations try to exert influence via state actors, we know much less
   about whether and how frequently states themselves engage in lobbying.
   How effectively do state actors seek to further their own preferences
   informally in lobbying institutional key actors in governance
   arrangements beyond the nation-state? To shed light on these blind
   spots, this article draws on the example of the European Union and
   analyses the conditions under which states are especially inclined to
   use this informal influence strategy as well as the conditions for
   lobbying success. Is shows that states use lobbying strategies more
   often, the more capacities they possess, the lower the transaction costs
   of lobbying and also the stronger their incentives of getting active are
   for particular policies. Additionally, it is not only a high frequency
   of lobbying that increases the chances of informally influencing
   policies, but also the type of reasoning applied, its quality and its
   fit to the nature of the issue at stake.},

Journal = {INTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {27},
Number = {1},
Pages = {133-153},
Abstract = {The impact of individual technological innovations on intelligence
   operations is often discussed, but the influence of technological change
   per se on intelligence systems remains less well understood. The
   historical literature on this topic is uneven - filled with detailed
   narratives on certain aspects, but also with surprisingly little
   attention to larger trends and their meaning. This is significant for
   two reasons. First, it means we have an incomplete understanding of what
   happened in the past, particularly for the `analog revolution' in
   intelligence in the twentieth century. Second, it leaves us with few
   clues for understanding another wave of technological change washing
   over the intelligence profession at this time (a `digital revolution').
   Looking at the second revolution in the light of the first can give us
   important clues to what to watch for in coming years.},

Abstract = {European authorities and scholars published proposals on which
   indicators of macroeconomic imbalances might be used to uncover risks
   for the sustainability of public debt in the European Union. In this
   article the ability of four proposed sets of indicators to send early
   warnings of debt crises is tested using a signals approach for the study
   of indicators and the construction of composite indicators. It is found
   that a broad composite indicator has the highest predictive power. This
   fact still holds true if equal weights are used for the construction of
   the composite indicator in order to reflect the uncertainty about the
   origin of future crises.},

Abstract = {Edward Said's praise of comics journalist Joe Sacco as a kind of Marlow
   (from Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness) is an analogy that reminds us
   of the contextualization of current affairs graphic novels in other
   media. While scholars and laypeople alike have praised serious comics
   and animated works for their capacity to get readers interested in the
   horror, the horror (iconic words of Heart of Darkness), the failure of
   such works to translate across diverse reading publics attests to the
   imperfections of conveying traumatic stories with drawings and words.
   Said's own earlier writing on Heart of Darkness helps to qualify his
   appraisal of Marlow-like narrations of the forgotten peoples of the
   world. In Culture and Imperialism (1993), Said explains that author
   Conrad (through Marlow) ingeniously accomplishes the tragic exposition
   of European imperialism in two visions. First, Conrad acknowledges that
   his readers (Marlow's listeners) are located in a particular time and in
   a specific place, and second, Conrad permits Marlow to use arabesque
   meditations of ideas, and alternating blunt and evasive language, to
   capture the unrelenting journey of European imperial mastery (Said
   1993:23).},

Journal = {REGULATION \& GOVERNANCE},

Volume = {6},

Abstract = {While benefitcost analysis (BCA) is now a permanent part of the
   regulatory process in the United States, and many other countries around
   the world as well as the European Union have adopted it or are moving
   toward it, there have been few empirical attempts to assess either
   whether its use improves regulations or how BCA interacts with the
   political environment. We use a unique US database of the costs and
   benefits of 109 economically significant regulations issued between 2000
   and 2009 to examine whether the amount of information provided in the
   BCA or political factors surrounding the regulation better correlate
   with the net benefits of the regulation. We find that there is little
   correlation between the information provided by the analysis and the net
   benefits. However, we find that regulations that receive few public
   comments and are not issued at the end of an administration, have the
   highest net benefits. These are the regulations that are the least
   politically salient. This interaction between the political environment
   and the economic performance of a regulation has been under-examined and
   deserves further study.},

Title = {Using the institutional grammar tool to understand regulatory
   compliance: The case of Colorado aquaculture},
Journal = {REGULATION \& GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {6},
Number = {2},
Pages = {167-188},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {What is the relationship between the design of regulations and levels of
   individual compliance? To answer this question, Crawford and Ostrom's
   institutional grammar tool is used to deconstruct regulations governing
   the aquaculture industry in Colorado, USA. Compliance with the
   deconstructed regulatory components is then assessed based on the
   perceptions of the appropriateness of the regulations, involvement in
   designing the regulations, and intrinsic and extrinsic motivations. The
   findings suggest that levels of compliance with regulations vary across
   and within individuals regarding various aspects of the regulatory
   components. As expected, the level of compliance is affected by the
   perceived appropriateness of regulations, participation in designing the
   regulations, and feelings of guilt and fear of social disapproval.
   Furthermore, there is a strong degree of interdependence among the
   written components, as identified by the institutional grammar tool, in
   affecting compliance levels. The paper contributes to the regulation and
   compliance literature by illustrating the utility of the institutional
   grammar tool in understanding regulatory content, applying a new Q-Sort
   technique for measuring individual levels of compliance, and providing a
   rare exploration into feelings of guilt and fear outside of the
   laboratory setting.},

Abstract = {Attempting to explain falling support for United Russia in the December
   2011 parliamentary elections and the subsequent anti-regime protests,
   commentators stressed the global financial crisis's triggering effect.
   This article reassesses the political effects of the financial crisis.
   An original set of 2009 survey data is used to examine the financial
   crisis's impact on support for Russia's rulers; popular assessments of
   government efficacy during the crisis; and popular evaluations of
   Russian democracy. The influence of the 2008-2009 economic turmoil on
   political unrest in 2011 is considered. The question of whether the
   financial crisis politicized individuals from different employment
   sectors and social classes in distinctive ways is also considered.},

   which political youth organizations voice their criticism of and support

   sources, including blogs and YouTube videos, as well as the scholarly
   literature are used to look at political youth group actions and
   rhetoric on both sides of the Kremlin. The focus is on how gender is
   used by political youth groups as an organizing principle for exhibiting
   or withholding support for state leaders and opposition leaders.},

Abstract = {There is confusion regarding reason and rational thought as a
   precondition for interventions designed using a reasoned action
   approach. To test their feasibility, two interventions were developed
   for use with persons with mental illnesses, using the reasoned action
   model. Preventing AIDS through Health (PATH) was delivered one-on-one by
   case managers to persons with mental illnesses who were HIV
   sero-negative, and another (PATH PLUS) was delivered by nurses to
   persons with mental illness who were sero-positive. Using these data,
   this article examines the utility of a reasoned action approach to HIV
   prevention among persons with a variety of serious mental illnesses. It
   appears that a reasoned action approach is useful for persons with
   severe mental illnesses and may be a useful strategy for changing
   intentions and behavior among this population. This has implications for
   further research on the role of nonnormative belief systems in
   predicting behavior.},

Abstract = {The article examines patterns of generalised and institutional trust
   among elites in East Central Europe, South East Europe and the West
   Balkans. It enquires into the extent to which such trust can predict
   elite perceptions and behaviour concerning informal practice. The
   article builds on surveys of elite representatives in seven
   post-socialist states. Survey findings are complemented with and
   illustrated by findings from qualitative in-depth interviews. It emerges
   that neither institutional nor generalised trust can serve as strong
   predictors of informal behaviour or of informal practice. The linkages
   between trust and informal practice are then discussed with reference to
   elites' own experiences with the past legacy and post-socialist society.},

Abstract = {This article examines the dynamics of regional integration and economic
   convergence in the post-Soviet world during the period 19992008, both
   considered as a whole and on the level of individual country groups.
   While the trade integration experienced a negative trend, at the same
   time one can observe an unprecedented expansion of labour migration thus
   suggesting that integration of factor flows can outperform integration
   of markets for goods and services, at least in this specific case.
   Clustering processes of the post-Soviet states for economic convergence
   and for economic integration seem to be unaffected by each other.},

Abstract = {Scholars differ on whether the increase in minority managers represents
   real or vacuous progress toward the elimination of racial bias in the
   labor market. This study uses the National Study of the Changing
   Workforce to examine racial differences in work outcomes across the
   authority divide. On balance, this study finds more support for the
   pessimistic view of the minority presence in management, in that racial
   wage inequality is as large among supervisors as among nonsupervisors,
   and minority supervisors get less challenging job assignments and are
   more vulnerable to layoffs than white supervisors. Among subordinates,
   this study finds support for ``bottom-up ascription{''} processes, in
   that minority workers who report to a minority boss earn less despite
   being more committed workers. The article concludes with a brief
   discussion of the implications of these findings and the need for
   further research on minorities in management.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF WOMEN POLITICS \& POLICY},

Number = {3},
Pages = {239-262},
Abstract = {How responsive are political lawmakers to an abortion issue that is
   potentially less salient to the public or in the media? Targeted
   Regulation of Abortion Providers (or TRAP) laws impose physical plant
   and personnel regulations and requirements on abortion providers that
   exceed those imposed on other comparable health care providers or
   outpatient medical facilities. Using event history analysis, this
   article examines the determinants of the enactment by states of a TRAP
   law over the period 1974 to 2008. The empirical results find that the
   polarized ideological positions of the Republican Party and the
   Democratic Party on the issue of abortion, in conjunction with
   institutional control of state government, has a statistically
   significant impact on the enactment of a TRAP law in the expected
   direction.},

Abstract = {A stark contrast exists between the popular image of the World Trade
   Organisation (WTO) as a uniquely powerful international organisation
   (IO) and its actual capacity to monitor national policies and to enforce
   compliance with WTO rules among its member states. Rather than
   overseeing policy implementation itself like the International Monetary
   Fund or the World Bank, the WTO relies much more heavily than other
   high-profile IOs on a legalist method of surveillance. This article
   suggests that the notion of a `member-driven legalism' is central to how
   the WTO `sees' the world. In particular, the WTO's processes reflect a
   strong institutional belief that neo-liberal policies can be implemented
   by a consensus- and member-driven legalistic WTO system. To illustrate
   the importance of understanding how the ways in which the WTO `sees' the
   world of trade both enable and constrain its influence over trade
   relations, the article examines how the WTO constructs and classifies
   the world economy into enforceable trade issues, despite political
   impasse in the Doha Round. Examining the cases of trade in biofuels and
   trade in electronic `cultural products', the article puts forward the
   argument that the WTO exercises cognitive authority in the world economy
   via the organisation's distinctive classification and framing
   activities.},

Abstract = {This research examines the regulatory response of the European Union to
   the global financial crisis, addressing the questions of whether, how
   and why the global financial crisis has changed the `old' politics of
   financial services regulation in the EU and resulted in the emergence of
   a `new' politics. It is argued that, with a good dose of political
   opportunism and `anti-free market' rhetoric, a continental advocacy
   coalition sponsoring a `market-shaping' regulatory approach has
   capitalised on the crisis, tipping the balance of regulatory power in
   the EU in its favour, as compared to the pre-crisis situation.},

Abstract = {This article explores the issue of post-accession adherence to EU
   conditions, looking at the case of the Roma. It asks why policies,
   institutions and programmes put in place by new member states in order
   to meet EU membership requirements and expectations remain in place
   after enlargement. It finds that EU conditions have had enduring effects
   because the key precipitating factors during the accession period almost
   all remain in some form after accession. These factors include EU
   attention and expectations, EU funding and capacity building, EU law,
   NGO advocacy and monitoring, other international programmes and
   commitments and pressures related to Roma migrants.},

Journal = {EUROPE-ASIA STUDIES},

Volume = {64},
Number = {10, SI},
Pages = {1847-1869},
Abstract = {This essay provides insights into studies on citizens' engagement with
   human rights in Russia through its focus on a relatively
   under-researched area, namely, the ways in which women perceive the role
   of human rights in daily life contexts. This essay argues for the
   importance of analysing how women's perceptions of human rights are
   formed in situ in order to understand the ways in which location and
   gender create particular constraints for women in terms of their
   perceived and actual access to rights protection and ability to use
   rights to resolve their problems. Drawing on data generated during
   in-depth interviews conducted with women living in the provincial
   Russian city of Ul'yanovsk in 2005, this essay reveals women's complex
   engagements with the meaning and role of human rights in their daily
   lives. In particular, this analysis shows how women's perceptions of
   their positionalities in a post-Soviet provincial city informs how they
   think about where, when and why human rights apply to women.},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This paper examines the role of international institutions in preventing
   the rise of protectionism. We analyze states' choices in trade policy
   during the current global economic crisis, a situation likely to
   exacerbate uncertainty in the conduct of commercial relations and to
   push countries toward ``beggar-thy-neighbor{''} trade policies. The main
   argument of the paper is that the numerous international institutions
   present in the international system during the current economic crisis
   serve as conveyors of information and mechanisms of commitment and
   socialization. They mitigate the uncertainty problem that prevails in
   prisoner's dilemma settings such as trade. Economic international
   organizations increase the flow of information about the preferences and
   behaviors of its members. Non-economic organizations also have a role to
   play as social environments that encourage cooperation. Specialized
   international institutions devoted to trade, such as the WTO and
   preferential trade agreements (PTAs), not only provide monitoring and
   enforcement functions but also lock in commitments to liberal trade
   through legal obligations that make defections costly. We test our
   argument using a dataset of trade policies during the current economic
   crisis and of membership in international organizations. The paper finds
   strong support for the role of international institutions as commitment
   and socialization mechanisms in preventing the rise of protectionism.},

Abstract = {How does program sponsorship influence the design of voluntary programs?
   Why and how do voluntary programs on climate change sponsored by the
   state and federal governments in the United States vary in their
   institutional design? Scholars emphasize the signaling role of voluntary
   programs to outside stakeholders, and the excludable benefits that
   induce firms to take on non-trivial costs of joining voluntary programs.
   Scholars have noted several types of benefits, particularly reputational
   benefits programs provide, but have not systematically studied why
   different programs emphasize different types of benefits. We suggest
   that excludable benefits are likely to take different forms depending on
   the institutional context in which program sponsors function. We
   hypothesize that federal programs are likely to emphasize less tangible
   reputational benefits while state programs are likely to emphasize more
   tangible benefits, such as access to technical knowledge and capital.
   Statistical analyses show the odds of a voluntary program emphasizing
   tangible benefits increases by several folds when the program is
   sponsored by the state as opposed to federal government.},

Abstract = {Young citizens are increasingly seeking fulfillment in expressive modes
   of political participation, and scholars have begun to examine the
   implications of this trend for engagement in formal politics. While some
   argue that expressive practices are ``crowding out{''} participation in
   more conventional civic activities, others more optimistically contend
   that they have expanded the political repertoires of young citizens,
   affording them with more opportunities to be engaged. The authors add
   clarity to this debate by specifying the conditions under which
   engagement in one particular form of expressive politics, political
   consumerism, is associated with conventional participation. An analysis
   of survey data shows that identification with other political consumers
   significantly enhances the relationship between political consumerism
   and traditional political engagement, particularly among younger
   generations of Americans. The authors argue that engaging in political
   consumerism alongside others provides an important opportunity for young
   citizens to develop the civic competencies necessary for engagement in
   the formal political sphere.},

Year = {2012},
Volume = {644},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The year 2011 was defined by the intersection of politics and economics:
   the Wisconsin protests, the Occupy Movement, anti-austerity
   demonstrations, the Buffett Rule, and so on. These events drew attention
   to the role of politics in the erosion of labor power, the rise of
   inequality, and the excesses of overconsumption. Moving beyond periodic
   and dutiful action directed at an increasingly unresponsive government,
   citizens tested the boundaries of what we consider civic engagement by
   embracing personalized forms of ``life-style politics{''} enacted in
   everyday life and often directed at the market. These issues are the
   focus of this volume, which we divide into four sections. The first
   section attempts both to situate consumption in politics as a
   contemporary phenomenon and to view it through a wider historical lens.
   The second section advances the notion of sustainable citizenship at the
   individual/group level and the societal/institutional level, and
   understands consumption as socially situated and structured. Extending
   this thinking, the third section explores various forms of conscious
   consumption and relates them to emerging modes of activism and
   engagement. The fourth section questions assumptions about the
   effectiveness of the citizen-consumer and the underlying value of
   political consumerism and conscious consumption. We conclude by
   distilling six core themes from this collection for future work.},

Title = {Regulatory mobilization and service delivery at the edge of the
   regulatory state},
Journal = {REGULATION \& GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {6},
Number = {3},
Pages = {344-361},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Where there is weak state capacity to carry out regulatory,
   redistributional, and developmental functions characterizing much of the
   developing world, the role of governance and service delivery is also
   performed by a myriad of private actors. Institutional reform in the
   utility sector in developing countries has often failed to distinguish
   between social and economic regulation. I show how private actors like
   NGOs and local community groups undertake what I term regulatory
   mobilization to influence the new rules of the service delivery game, as
   well as to deliver much-needed basic services to urban poor communities.
   Based on extensive fieldwork carried out in the Philippines, this
   article reveals and explains the politics of the informal sector at the
   edge of the regulatory state. More than a decade since the privatization
   of the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System in Metro Manila in
   1997, water access for the urban poor remained limited as privatized
   water utilities faced difficulties in extending service provision. In
   the context of an unpredictable regulatory landscape and an oligarchic
   patrimonial state, unexpected collective action by organized urban poor
   communities and NGOs has taken place around water as a subsistence
   right. Combining hybrid mobilizations to obtain water as well as
   influencing the rules governing their provision, these forms of
   regulatory mobilization appear to be peripheral and episodic. However,
   depending on how local and sectoral politics are conflated, such
   regulatory mobilization may sometimes not only result in obtaining
   subsistence goods, but may also occasionally project countervailing
   power in the policy sector, and influence formal regulatory frameworks
   in surprising ways.},

Title = {How Do Children of Mixed Partnerships Fare in the United Kingdom?
   Understanding the Implications for Children of Parental Ethnic Homogamy
   and Heterogamy},
Journal = {ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE},

Abstract = {Many claims are made about the significance of interethnic partnerships
   for individuals and for society. Such partnerships continue to be seen
   as a ``barometer{''} of the openness of society and have spawned
   extensive analysis investigating their patterns, trends, and
   determinants. But we know little about the experience of children
   growing up in families of mixed parentage. In the United Kingdom, the
   increase in the self-defined ``mixed{''} population is often celebrated.
   But there has been little quantitative sociological analysis that has
   investigated the circumstances of the children of mixed ethnicity
   partnerships. Using two large-scale UK datasets that cover a similar
   period, this article evaluates the extent to which mixed parentage
   families are associated with circumstances (both economic and in terms
   of family structure) that tend to be positive or negative for children's
   future life chances and how these compare to those of children with
   parents from the same ethnic group. It shows that there is substantial
   variation according to the outcome considered but also according to
   ethnic group. Overall, children in mixed parentage families do not
   unequivocally experience the equality of outcomes with majority group
   children that the assimilation hypothesis implies.},
