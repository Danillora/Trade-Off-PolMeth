Abstract = {Many theorists contend that for the European Union to become a viable
   democratic polity its citizens must develop an overarching communal
   identity. I take issue with this claim, arguing that the norms,
   motivations and perceptions that make supranational democracy possible
   can also emerge through processes that do not presuppose shared communal
   identifications. These include the gradual externalization of domestic
   democratic norms and practices to the EU level, the incorporation of the
   resulting supranational democratic attachments back into existing
   national identifications and the build-up of transnational political
   trust propelled by the practice of supranational democracy itself. Such
   an outcome is not inevitable, but it is conceivable in that it is
   theoretically coherent and has limited empirical analogies and
   precedents. The range of options for the EU's further democratic
   development is therefore broader and the chances of its success greater
   than many analysts assume.},

Abstract = {This study is an ethnographic investigation of a gram sabha (village
   assembly), the cornerstone of local democracy, in Soonaghalli, in the
   Mandya district of Southern Karnataka, India. Observation of the meeting
   and informal, open-ended conversations with the key actors illuminated
   how democratic policies that are conceived at the global level are
   practiced and experienced by local community members. The article speaks
   to the significance of moving beyond the prevailing
   politico-institutional framework of democracy that is dominated by
   concerns about formal regime shifts and focusing on informal practices
   that contribute to the making and unmaking of democratic governance. The
   findings shed light on the varied forms that deliberative processes take
   and on multiple meanings of deliberative cultures, emphasizing the need
   for a comparative sociological inquiry into democratic practices for a
   richer formulation of democratic theory.},

   work{''} that managers do as they negotiate circumstances where either

   of the role that relational work plays in those relationships story
   militates for-and extends, improves upon, and arguably completes-a
   particular understanding of what economic sociologists should mean when
   they talk about the ``embedding{''} of the economic in social relations.
   The article hence shows the utility of jointly using otherwise disparate
   perspectives in the analysis of interorganizational relationships, and
   thus contributes to the development of a more unified paradigm in
   economic sociology.},

Abstract = {Prior to 1995, when the World Trade Organization (WTO) superseded the
   General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), a number of states took
   advantage of GATT Article XXVI:5(c), which allowed them-as former
   colonies or component territories of existing GATT members-to quickly
   and simply join the multilateral trade regime. The speed with which
   these post-colonial accessions took place, however, varied widely: some
   states joined immediately upon independence, while others joined much
   later. Still other post-colonial states passed on this opportunity, only
   to subsequently begin the longer, more onerous accession process
   required of other GATT/WTO applicants. Our paper seeks to explain this
   variation in the timing of post-colonial states' accession to the
   GATT/WTO. We argue that three key variables explain the timing of
   accession decisions: 1) a country's trade ties with existing
   member-states; 2) its existing preferential trade agreement (PTA)
   commitments; and 3) its domestic political institutions-specifically,
   the country's level of democracy. Furthermore, we argue that the effects
   of these variables are conditional upon each other: post-colonial
   countries with more extensive trade ties to existing member-states were
   more likely to accede rapidly under Article XXVI:5(c), but only under
   specific conditions-namely, when they had not already locked in ties
   with key trading partners through bilateral or regional PTAs, and when
   they were governed by a more democratic regime. We test this argument
   empirically using an original dataset of 61 post-colonial states from
   1951 to 2004. Our results strongly support this explanation of GATT/WTO
   accession and help to clarify the pattern of participation in the
   multilateral trading system that we have observed over the last
   half-century.},

Abstract = {The concept of subsidiarity was a notable addition to the Maastricht
   Treaty when it was first introduced. It continues to be of political and
   legal significance in the post-Lisbon world. This article considers
   subsidiarity from a political and legal perspective. It analyses the
   diverse rationales behind its inclusion in the Treaty, and the reasons
   why it has proven difficult to realize the objectives of subsidiarity.
   The focus then shifts to the legal dimension and considers the role
   played by the EU courts in monitoring subsidiarity and suggestions that
   the EU courts should review subsidiarity through a form of
   competence-proportionality control.},

Abstract = {This note discusses the inadequate attention given to armed groups in
   international human rights advocacy efforts. Although the human rights
   violations committed by armed groups are denounced and reported on,
   there is too little further effort taken to actually bring about a
   change in the behaviour of armed groups. The first part of this note
   develops further the point that the response has been inadequate, and
   the second part suggests some of the underlying reasons preventing a
   more robust engagement by human rights advocates with the problem of
   human rights violations by armed group. A third section suggests a
   number of techniques that may help human rights organizations approach
   the problem of armed groups.},

Abstract = {This article problematizes the deployment of the concept of agency in
   contemporary international relations scholarship. It examines the
   problems of relying on a foundationalist conception of agency as a tool
   to achieve meaningful political action by exploring the case of
   scholarship on the topic of women and terrorism. I argue that scholars
   on the topic of women and terrorism inscribe agency into women's
   subjectivities, that is, they place agency as the goal of feminist
   political action. By tracing the way that scholars write agency into
   women's subjectivities through an examination of the literature on the
   topic, I am able to demonstrate how reliance on agency as a foundational
   concept hinders the goals of feminists.},

Abstract = {This article explores two rival understandings of production and what it
   means to be a rational productive subject. Against `technicist' models
   of productive reason, it defends a `phronetic' model on both normative
   and pragmatic grounds. The discussion begins with a description of the
   general principles underpinning technicist theories of workplace
   organisation, principles which continue to inform work design approaches
   to this day. The technicist model is thereafter criticised on three
   counts: that it represents a specific managerial agenda which privileges
   sectional interests; that it is suspect morally for a number of reasons;
   and that despite its aspiration of arriving at `one best method', it
   represents but one way of organising work processes. The phronetic model
   is then set out using the notion of `practices' as a guide. This notion
   is important in providing a view of production in which technical reason
   is subsumed under a broader practical reason incorporating individual
   experience and judgement. Against the charge that this view is merely an
   instance of nostalgic craft romanticism having little relevance to
   present industrial realities, there are recognisable contemporary
   instances of phronetic production, one of the most interesting being
   Volvo's innovations in automotive assembly systems.},

Abstract = {Based on media discourse analysis, this article addresses the
   construction of Russian-speaking identity in Latvia from a
   discourse-theoretical approach. Through a focus on the discursive
   elements of identity formation it will be argued that public projections
   of Russian-speaking identity are both a counter-reaction to, and a
   synthesis with, constructed `Latvian', `Russian' and `European'
   identities and discourses. It will be shown that although Latvia's
   Russian-speaking identity is often constructed negatively, in opposition
   to the Latvian state and the Latvian `Other', it is now increasingly
   premised upon an acceptance of various Latvian narratives and discourses
   which are enabling the emergence of a more positive Latvian-Russian
   identity.},

Journal = {INTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {27},
Number = {5},

Abstract = {This article explores a number of debates that have dominated
   intelligence studies since the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001.
   It examines a number of inherent tensions, involving individuals and
   institutions, which threaten the long-term compatibility of the national
   security state with liberal democracy. The notion as to whether or not
   the use of extreme coercive measures (such as torture) can ever be
   justified is examined, as is the question as to whether such measures
   are self-defeating. The piece examines how liberal democracies seek to
   protect themselves in the light of rapid changes via a globalised media,
   the Information Revolution, and the proliferation of advanced technology
   and weapons of mass destruction amongst state and non-state actors.
   These issues are discussed with particular reference to the use of
   intelligence in Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, North Korea and other global
   trouble spots. Finally, the article speculates on the future of the
   increasingly enmeshed relationship between policy-makers, intelligence
   agencies and the media. It is concluded that, without a clear agenda for
   the modification of the mechanisms for accountability and oversight,
   this triangular relationship will, despite its interdependence, be
   fraught with increasing difficulties.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the dynamics of memory politics in post-Soviet
   Estonia from the 1990s to the present day. It focuses on speeches by
   Estonian presidents, which are treated as a specific type of
   commemorative activity and studied in relation to other social memories.
   The analysis seeks to link the meaning conveyed in the speeches to the
   presidents' personal experiences during the Soviet period. The article
   shows that in these speeches, the primary discourse used with regard to
   Soviet times was that of `rupture' as well as the related discourse of
   `resistance'.},

Journal = {INTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {27},
Number = {5},

Abstract = {The UK government has accepted the case for strengthening the oversight
   of the security and intelligence agencies in its 2011 Green Paper on
   Justice and Security and in the draft Justice and Security Bill 2012.
   While welcome these proposals are, however, seriously deficient in
   neglecting the potential contribution of oversight to the protection of
   human rights. This article argues that democratic oversight should play
   a significant role in strengthening the protection of human rights by
   way of audit of policies and review of operations of the agencies, with
   regard to international intelligence cooperation and where the storage
   and use of personal data by the services is concerned.},

Title = {Neoliberalism and the new international financial architecture},
Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {19},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {536-561},
Abstract = {This paper theorizes about the new international financial architecture
   as a manifestation of the `second face of neoliberalism' - financial
   market reregulation through technocratic obfuscation and insularity from
   democratic political pressure. Using a more expansive definition of the
   new international financial architecture, one that includes the
   institutional nexus of international monetary management along with the
   rules and regulatory bodies governing capital, this argument is
   developed through an analysis of the origins and functions of two
   institutions comprising the new international financial architecture -
   the Basel Capital Accord and the diffusion of inflation targeting
   regimes across central banks. This paper excavates the neoliberal logic
   inscribed in these institutions and further shows how these new forms of
   institutional logic contributed to the financial crisis of 2008 by
   putting in place a set of opportunities and constraints that led to
   rapid growth in the market for asset-backed securities. The implications
   of this analysis for the future of regulatory reform are discussed, with
   particular attention paid to the question of what role central banks
   should play in this process.},

Abstract = {We introduce the latest member of the intelligence family. Joining
   IMINT, HUMINT, SIGINT and others is `SOCMINT' - social media
   intelligence. In an age of ubiquitous social media it is the
   responsibility of the security community to admit SOCMINT into the
   national intelligence framework, but only when two important tests are
   passed. First, that it rests on solid methodological bedrock of
   collection, evidence, verification, understanding and application.
   Second, that the moral hazard it entails can be legitimately managed.
   This article offers a framework for how this can be done.},

Abstract = {Using post-Soviet Kazakhstan as a conceptual point of departure, this
   article considers the role that proactive framing and persuasion play in
   ensuring regime survival in soft authoritarian contexts. Drawing on
   interviews, opinion polls, news media, and the scholarly literature, the
   authors use three examples-Kazakhstan's OSCE bid, the global financial
   crisis, and ``Rakhatgate{''}-that highlight the regime's varying
   proportions of persuasive and coercive efforts. The ways a soft
   authoritarian leader responds to potentially threatening events are
   examined. Non-material sources of regime durability are analyzed as
   essentials for understanding authoritarian regime dynamics and, by
   implication, for developing a full theory of regime change.},

Abstract = {The `cyber' issue is not new, but rather has taken a half-century to
   develop. Indeed, it was already decades old before the general public
   and many senior leaders recognized its salience in the mid-1990s. It
   developed, moreover, along a logical path, which can be depicted as the
   successive dawning (for American policymakers, officials, and
   intelligence officers) of four insights, each of which was glimpsed in
   theory at least shortly before empirical evidence verified that it was
   indeed a reality to consider in setting policies, standards, and
   doctrine. Thus the official responses to the emergence of the cyber
   issue in the late-1990s were shaped by the outcomes of those earlier
   debates; the options available to policy-makers in the White House,
   Congress, the Pentagon, and the various agencies were already
   conditioned and even determined by previous arguments.},

Title = {Legitimising discourses in the framework of European integration: The
   politics of Euro adoption in the Czech Republic and Slovakia},
Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {19},
Number = {5},

Abstract = {Despite their common history, the countries of the former Czechoslovakia
   appear to have adopted markedly different policies towards Eurozone
   accession. Whereas Slovakia joined the common currency in January 2009
   the Czech Republic has adopted a more sceptical attitude with the
   question of Euro adoption postponed indefinitely. Given the relative
   similarities of the two states' institutional apparatuses and economic
   structures it is unsurprising that standard accounts of monetary
   policymaking struggle to explain the divergence in attitudes towards the
   EMU. This article presents a constructivist understanding of the
   politics of Eurozone accession strategies by focusing on the role of
   legitimising discourses in the political process. These are
   conceptualised as the historically-informed sum total of
   inter-subjectively held beliefs held by elites and masses within a
   particular political system. By focusing on the ideational aspects of
   Euro adoption we are able to understand how each country's early
   experience with EU accession fed into differing perceptions of national
   purpose and the relative importance of European integration. Whereas the
   Czech Republic increasingly favoured greater national assertion and
   policy independence, Slovakia came to understand Eurozone membership as
   an important tool in reversing the feelings of isolationism experienced
   during the Meciar period. A focus on these competing discourses helps us
   to understand the divergence in Euro-adoption strategies and in turn
   serves to enrich the debate on EU economic and monetary integration by
   highlighting the limitations of rationalist analyses.},

Abstract = {How can we explain an international agreement that appears to run
   counter to the declared objectives of one of the key players? This
   article examines the USEU Open Skies agreement signed in 2007 and asks
   why Europeans accepted the agreement after having rejected a comparable
   version three years earlier. Theoretical approaches that explain time
   inconsistency in international negotiations tend to focus on reasons why
   states can be constrained to accept suboptimal solutions. In multi-level
   bargaining, principalagent and bureaucratization theories focus on loss
   of control and constructivists suggest that governments can become
   trapped in rhetoric. This article shows that paradoxical agreements can
   be voluntary and explains them by showing the rationale behind
   multi-games that include ambiguity about the future. In particular,
   increasing the flexibility of the agreement allowed negotiators to
   escape present-day constituent pressures by remaining ambiguous and
   betting on shifting coalitions.},

Abstract = {This article proposes a framework for understanding large-scale
   individualized collective action that is often coordinated through
   digital media technologies. Social fragmentation and the decline of
   group loyalties have given rise to an era of personalized politics in
   which individually expressive personal action frames displace collective
   action frames in many protest causes. This trend can be spotted in the
   rise of large-scale, rapidly forming political participation aimed at a
   variety of targets, ranging from parties and candidates, to
   corporations, brands, and transnational organizations. The group-based
   ``identity politics{''} of the ``new social movements{''} that arose
   after the 1960s still exist, but the recent period has seen more diverse
   mobilizations in which individuals are mobilized around personal
   lifestyle values to engage with multiple causes such as economic justice
   (fair trade, inequality, and development policies), environmental
   protection, and worker and human rights.},

Journal = {ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {644},

Abstract = {The authors investigate brand advertising as an instrument of class
   politics, used to shape perceptions of and beliefs about social groups,
   specifically the working class. These images are consistent with the
   prescriptions of capitalist realism. The authors content-analyze
   representations of the working class drawn from a random sample of ads
   from 1950 to 2010. Quantitative results are compared to a variety of
   secondary data sources, including the General Social Survey and public
   opinion polling. The authors find that representations of the working
   class do not closely follow social, political, or economic changes. If
   anything, increasingly nostalgic images contradict the disappearance of
   blue-collar jobs. The authors examine the ads in more depth to explain
   why the content does not align with objective reality, identifying a
   variety of tableaus commonly used in representations of the working
   class that are consistent with capitalist realism and myths of the
   American class structure.},

Abstract = {Although the Colombian armed conflict has had the most impact in the
   countryside, rural communities have had only a marginal role in the
   development of state policies designed to address the effects of
   violence. Seeking to overcome such marginalization, peasant women
   victims of the armed conflict from Granada came together to address this
   imbalance and preserve the memory of their dead and missing relatives.
   They formed the Asociacion de Victimas de Granada and launched the
   project, Salon del Nunca Mas (Hall of Never Again). This Notes from the
   Field piece explores the association's strategies to conserve memory and
   offers some preliminary observations on the outcomes of the self-healing
   process within this community.},

Abstract = {State terror in Argentina in the late 1970s was aimed at dismantling
   social relationships of mutual commitment and solidarity and imposing in
   their stead practices of fear, isolation and mistrust. A permeating
   network of clandestine detention centers and illegal burial sites played
   a key role in spreading localized state terror to the whole of society.
   After describing the broader context of the dictatorship's urban space
   restructuring policy, this article explores various practices currently
   taking place in former clandestine detention centers `recovered' by
   civilians. The author suggests that the opening of these centers allows
   the emergence of narratives and everyday practices that can counteract
   the ones that prevailed under the dictatorship, fostering the opposite
   effect - active citizenship, counternarratives of terror and restored
   social networks. This approach highlights potential uses of memorial
   sites that have not received enough attention to date. Moreover, it can
   act as a bridge between the paradigm of transitional justice and the
   developments and aims of spatial justice.},

Title = {Global governance behind closed doors: The IMF boardroom, the Enhanced
   Structural Adjustment Facility, and the intersection of material power

Abstract = {Up on the 12th floor of its 19th Street Headquarters, the IMF Board sits
   in active session for an average of 7 hours per week. Although key
   matters of policy are decided on in the venue, the rules governing
   Boardroom interactions remain opaque, resting on an uneasy combination
   of consensual decision-making and weighted voting. Through a detailed
   analysis of IMF Board discussions surrounding the Enhanced Structural
   Adjustment Facility (ESAF), this article sheds light on the mechanics of
   power in this often overlooked venue of global economic governance. By
   exploring the key issues of default liability and loan conditionality, I
   demonstrate that whilst the Boardroom is a more active site of
   contestation than has hitherto been recognized, material power is a
   prime determinant of both Executive Directors' preferences and outcomes
   reached from discussions. And as the decisions reached form the backbone
   of the `instruction sheet' used by Fund staff to guide their everyday
   operational decisions, these outcomes-and the processes through which
   they were reached-were factors of primary importance in stabilizing the
   operational norms at the heart of a controversial phase in the
   contemporary history of IMF concessional lending.},

Journal = {REGULATION \& GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {6},
Number = {3},
Pages = {362-370},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The basic rationale of the regulatory state is to insulate certain kinds
   of decisionmaking from political actors. The main purpose of this
   commentary is to assess the ways that members of civil society, in fact,
   often shadow and contest the central actors of the regulatory state,
   even though they are ostensibly well outside it. I offer three
   distinctions to help broaden and sharpen analysis of the roles and
   impact of civil society actors: whether civil society actors have
   special expertise or not; whether the regulatory state is being put in
   place or already exists; and whether civil society actions are broadly
   complementary to, or substitutive of, state action. In discussing each
   of these, I also explore the consequences of the transfer of the
   regulatory state to the global South, and the way that change in
   location shapes both the role and impact of civil society and the
   regulatory state itself.},

Abstract = {The article disc usses the projection of European Union (EU) power under
   conditions of contested statehood in its `near abroad'. Using the EU's
   mission in Kosovo (EULEX) as a case study, the article unpacks the
   various levers of external EU influence and explores the conditions
   under which European policy-makers become entangled in the `existential
   discourse' of highly polarized societies with competing statehood
   claims. The contestation of these claims (both domestically and
   internationally) produces significant challenges for EU actorness,
   affecting both self-ascribed (internal to the EU) and external (amongst
   the EU's interlocutors) aspects of EU presence, which, in turn, shapes
   the EU's ability to deploy and co-ordinate its capabilities on the
   ground. It is by reference to this `presence-capabilities' nexus that
   this article seeks to conceptualize the limitations of the planning and
   early deployment of EULEX in Kosovo.},

Abstract = {Our central claim in this rejoinder is that experimentalist forms of
   organization in making regulatory rules, organizing social services, and
   articulating constitutional norms arise and diffuse as the problem that
   the actors and the state face shifts from ignorance to uncertainty. We
   argue that this has consequences for forms of accountability and for the
   conception and organization of democracy and constitutionalism. The EU,
   founded by diverse states in a period of continuing uncertainty,
   intensified by growing interdependence, proves to be a natural
   laboratory for observing urgent efforts to adjust to this new situation,
   and the symposium focuses on developments there. The symposium has
   brought us to see that there is more common ground in these debates than
   prior exchanges may have suggested. We therefore emphasize convergence
   on large points, while underscoring and, we hope, clarifying persistent
   differences, with the aim of encouraging the joint exploration of them
   already underway, in part explicitly, in part implicitly.},

Title = {The Human Rights Implications of Contemporary Patterns of Social Control},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS PRACTICE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {4},
Number = {2},
Pages = {187-212},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This article, based on a project of the International Council on Human
   Rights Policy (ICHRP), explores the human rights implications of
   contemporary patterns of social control: how laws and policies construct
   and respond to people, behaviour or status defined as `undesirable',
   `dangerous', criminal or socially problematic. It draws on research
   across five policy areas: infectious diseases, urban spaces and the
   poor, policing, migration, and punishment and incarceration, as well as
   a case study of the Roma in Europe. It points to human rights challenges
   and ways forward with respect to ideas of crime and criminality, penal
   sanctions, non-criminal sanctions and `soft' controls, segregation and
   exclusion, protection and victims' rights, privatization, surveillance,
   and policy transfer regimes. At the heart of such a response is the need
   for a dialogue between human rights advocates, critical social science
   and social policy analysts, and policy makers.
   Beginning with an introduction to the `social control perspective' and
   its relevance to human rights, the article explores the dominant modes
   and patterns of social control (and the related challenges and
   possibilities for human rights advocacy and policy), divided into three
   broad categories: criminalization and sanctions, segregation, and
   surveillance. An analysis of underlying forces and contexts, including
   political economy and global policy transfer regimes is followed by a
   conclusion that discusses the relevance of human rights principles in
   monitoring social control, outlining ways forward for human rights
   advocacy, including on the specific issue of penalization of people in
   poverty.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {6},
Number = {2},
Pages = {229-252},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This article examines the discourses of the prosecution and the defence
   in the case of Charles Taylor before the Special Court for Sierra Leone.
   It contributes to current debates about the legitimacy and utility of
   international criminal justice, which have tended to neglect the
   examination of actual trials, and particularly the role of the defence.
   We draw on the legal doctrine of `expressivism' to theorize the
   connection between normative legitimacy, actual support and the utility
   of international criminal justice as dynamic and partly determined in
   court. We conclude that the Taylor trial demonstrates three interrelated
   obstacles to the fulfilment of the expressivist promise: that a tension
   between criminal proceedings against a single person and truth telling
   about mass violence necessarily exists; that discourses do not appeal to
   all audiences equally, and that those which appeal to western audiences
   are likely to be privileged; and that these weaknesses will usually be
   exposed and exploited by the defence, weakening the legitimacy of case
   and court. In order to develop expressivism as an empirical theory, the
   elements of the actors, the audiences and the stage in the posited
   `courtroom drama' require further research.},

Abstract = {This paper introduces the concept of performance circuits as a means for
   understanding economic transactions. The concept of the performance
   circuits emphasizes the script-like sequences and the existing cultural
   narratives that enable the believable performances of those scripts. The
   concept of performance circuits allows for Zelizer's concept of
   relational work to be applied in ethnographic studies of economic life,
   decomposing the constituent parts that enable the accomplishment of
   value in the marketplace. The paper opens with a dramaturgical
   performance at the United States Federal Reserve and then turns to
   microstudies of handicraft production, modern art markets, and
   neighborhood branding to demonstrate how one can study market dramas
   unfolding, sometimes unremarkably, emotions being generated, and
   background representations making loosely scripted actions
   understandable.},

Abstract = {In view of the decreasing levels of public support for successive
   European Union enlargements, this article examines how political elites
   attempt to bridge this growing gap. Drawing insights from discursive
   institutionalism, the article undertakes a systematic analysis of an
   aspect that has been widely neglected in the existing literature on
   enlargement: the relation between the discursive interaction among
   policy-makers at the EU level (co-ordinative discourse) and direct
   political communication at the national level (communicative discourse).
   Focusing on the case of Germany, the article argues that debates on
   enlargement at the EU and national levels have been growing apart since
   the 1970s, and discusses the implications of this discursive gap for the
   public legitimization of past and future enlargements.},

Abstract = {While a growing number of studies have been conducted on European
   identification, very few of them have examined how children form their
   sense of European identity. This article investigates the impact of
   individual- and school-level characteristics on children's formation of
   a European identity. Multi-level analyses of data from 2,845 pupils
   (aged 10-14) in 68 Belgian primary schools revealed that family
   socio-economic status (SES), ethnicity, gender and the school's SES
   make-up influence the extent to which children identify as European;
   age, religion and school sector do not. The study clarifies the
   importance of examining how children form their European identity.},

Abstract = {While ex-combatant and disarmament, demobilization and reintegration
   issues have generated rich literatures, transitionary armed opposition
   movements - actors central to transitional justice processes - have been
   neglected. This article addresses part of this research gap, focusing on
   the agency of armed movements with respect to three key transitional
   justice themes: transition, law and truth processes in the law-based
   rechtsstaat. Drawing on examples from South Africa, Namibia,
   Israel/Palestine and the Basque country, the article offers a framework
   for analyzing this agency by exploring the political opportunity
   structures presented by truth processes, as well as their implications
   for the movements' mobilizing structures and framing processes. This
   analytical framework is grounded in original Northern Ireland data drawn
   from interviews with former Irish Republican Army (IRA) activists, IRA
   public statements and Sinn Fein election manifestos. The data suggests
   that transitionary armed opposition movements see transitional justice
   as a site for continuing their political projects and potentially
   inflicting political damage to their opponents, as well as of attrition,
   given the victim-perpetrator character of such movements. The truths
   emerging from transitional processes may reflect the degrees of agency,
   entrepreneurship (including deliberate silences) and resources deployed
   by both state and nonstate actors.},

Abstract = {Although message tailoring has been shown to produce experimental
   effects in previous studies, the cognitive mechanisms through which
   tailoring works have not been sufficiently studied. Using the
   integrative model to predict intentions to use the nicotine replacement
   patch among adult smokers, this study examines how tailoring theoretical
   elements of the integrative model is effective in changing the
   theoretical mediators. Participants were randomized into one of two
   conditions. In the experimental condition, participants received
   messages tailored to some or all of the underlying behavioral,
   injunctive normative, or self-efficacy beliefs with the expectation that
   changing the underlying beliefs would result in experimental differences
   in the integrative model's direct measures. This expectation was
   confirmed. The integrative model also worked well in predicting
   intentions to perform the target behavior; attitude, perceived normative
   pressure, and perceived behavioral control accounted for 53 percent of
   the variance in intentions. Attitude and normative pressure were the
   strongest predictors of intention. These results provide support for
   tailoring messages using a reasoned action approach and provide insight
   into the mechanism through which message tailoring operates.},

Abstract = {The debate about the democratic deficit of the European Union has
   preoccupied scholars for decades. This article examines democracy in the
   Union from the perspective of citizens by asking what determines
   satisfaction with EU democracy? Two key models of regime support are
   applied to the European Union: the output-oriented performance model and
   the input-oriented procedural model. Contrary to previous work, it is
   argued here that there is a positive spillover effect from confidence in
   national institutions to the European level. These propositions are
   tested using survey data from 27 EU Member States. Using multi-level
   modelling, it is found that both performance and procedural factors
   matter, and that confidence in EU institutions matters more to citizens
   who are knowledgeable about the EU.},

Abstract = {Building on recent work on contemporary forms of bias in meritocratic
   personnel systems, the author assesses sources of racial disadvantage in
   an output-based pay-for-performance system for compensating financial
   advisers in a large financial services firm. Using data from expert
   reports submitted in racial discrimination litigation, the author shows
   how racial differences in access to white wealth, limits on African
   Americans' full participation in broker teams, racialized approaches to
   multicultural marketing, and diffuse lines of authority for diversity
   and nondiscrimination created racial barriers that were sustained and
   amplified by a cumulative advantage system for allocating
   productivity-enhancing resources. The author concludes with a discussion
   of management strategies for minimizing minority vulnerability in
   privileged professions and the challenges faced when the sources of bias
   are neither unconscious nor unintended but are instead located at least
   in part in racially segregated social relations and power differences
   among professionals who hold formally equivalent positions in a
   company's job structure.},

   miracle},
Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1},
Pages = {87-113},
Abstract = {This paper advances an argument about the need to take into account two
   components of state-industry relations if we are to fully understand
   economic development and policy trajectory, as well as industry-state
   co-evolution. The first component, the specific structure of the
   bureaucracy and state-industry relations, has been the focus of intense
   research. However, the second, the particular industrial economic
   ideology defining the correct role of the state in industry and industry
   in a state, is at least as important, if under-researched. In order to
   do empirically advance the argument the paper merges a cognitive-based
   constructivist argument with a neo-developmental state structuralist
   one, to present a new understanding of the role of the state in the
   Irish miracle that explains not only its success and failures but its
   internal dissonances, such as the continuous discrimination of the
   local, Irish-owned, industry in favor of foreign-owned MNCs. The paper
   illustrates how a particular industrial economic ideology has been
   formed and crystallized in Ireland. Focusing on the IT industry and
   using a multimethod research strategy, it traces the influence and
   evolution of this ideology at five critical decision points over a
   fifty-year period.},

Abstract = {Conflicts in the Caucasus began as a result of the weakening of the
   institutions of the Soviet Union. Since then there have been some major
   transformations. Initially, there were `triangular conflicts' with the
   centre (Moscow) on the one side and two competing national projects on
   the other side (a Union Republic and a minority group with an autonomous
   status within this republic). After the collapse of the Soviet Union,
   these conflicts evolved into bilateral ones between two
   popular-nationalist movements with competing territorial claims: newly
   independent nation states, on the one hand, and minority groups with
   autonomous status, on the other.},

Journal = {INTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {27},
Number = {1},
Pages = {75-92},
Abstract = {During the Soviet war scare of the 1980s, British intelligence shared
   vital information from KGB officer Oleg Gordievsky with its American
   partners. The US intelligence community, however, was suspicious of the
   message and the messenger, dismissing Soviet `war talk' as
   disinformation. Some officials even believed that the British had
   tweaked their reports to influence US policy. President Ronald Reagan,
   however, on the advice of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, listened to
   Gordievsky rather than his intelligence advisors. The war scare had a
   profound influence on Reagan's thinking about nuclear war, Kremlin
   fears, and Soviet-American relations that led him to seek a new detente
   with Moscow and the end of the Cold War through diplomacy rather than
   confrontation.
   Subsequent events and post-Cold War revelations vindicated Gordievsky.
   Reagan sought his advice on the eve of his first summit meeting with
   Mikhail Gorbachev and later expressed his gratitude during a private
   meeting in the Oval Office.},

Pages = {59-86},
Abstract = {In the IPE literature, neoliberalism and nationalism have generally been
   portrayed as anti-thetical to one another. More recently, scholars have
   sought to challenge this binary view by examining how nationalists have
   employed neoliberal policies for nationalist reasons. However, while
   showing how neoliberal policies can be compatible with nationalist
   values, these approaches have not examined whether the reverse might
   also be true, whether certain nationalist policies (and discourses)
   might be genuinely compatible with neoliberal values. To address this
   gap in the literature, this paper makes two arguments. The first is that
   certain nationalist policies are not only compatible with neoliberal
   values, but that these values may actually be dependent on certain
   nationalist policies. The second argument made is that neoliberal
   nationalism may be on the rise due to a shift among social democratic
   forces from a broad strategy of economic nationalism to one of social
   democratic multilateralism. To demonstrate these points, the paper
   challenges the equation of neoliberalism with internationalism as well
   as showing why neoliberal nationalism is distinct from the nationalism
   of both populist and neoconservatives.},

Abstract = {State interests are defined by both internal and external factors These
   include given and unchanging items-which determine a country's basic
   orientation for development and diplomacy, and constantly changing
   items-which in turn may be divided into endogenous variables and
   exogenous variables. The former comprises broadly the country's mode of
   social production and its polity, whereas the latter refers to relevant
   elements in its external environment. State interests can be thought of
   as a weighted composite index. Since China will be a state with greater
   responsibilities in the future, all factors must be taken into account
   at a time when China is rethinking its state interests. It should define
   them and seek the best means of fulfilling its goals in
   multi-dimensional perspectives.},

Abstract = {To achieve social development in the globalization process, we must both
   protect the sovereignty and develop independently. China's development
   should go independently and coordinate the relations between the state
   and the society, the state and the party, the central government and the
   local government, the state and the international system. The most
   important thing currently is to reform the state itself in order to
   speed up reform in others aspects and to strengthen autonomy and state
   capacity.
   Since China adopted reform and opening-up policies, to adjust and bring
   into effective play state autonomy has been crucial to China's social,
   economic and political development. By adjusting its relations with the
   international system, the society and the market, the state has obtained
   autonomy at home and abroad; by reforming the state's governance
   structure, the state has improved its capacity of autonomous action and
   thus translated its autonomous status into realistic power to realize
   benign interaction between and mutual-enhancement of the internal and
   external dimensions of sovereignty, enrich the practical meaning of
   sovereignty and explore a development path with Chinese characteristics
   during the globalization process.},

Abstract = {The field of security is largely controlled by elites who, by virtue of
   their authority, are able to create an image of an enemy which is
   largely independent of the objective significance of a threat. However,
   a narrow focus on speech acts and discourse analysis to study such
   processes of securitization is inherently inadequate. This article
   provides a panoramic account of Greek migration politics during the
   1990s. It shows that securitization can be discursive or nondiscursive,
   pre-mediated or subconscious, and beneficial or detrimental for
   securitizing actors. Elite interviews and an in-depth analysis of
   contextual factors help make sense of these dynamics.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the globalization process of German core export
   metalworking industries, to show how the globalization of national
   corporations has different effects on domestic economies. Contrary to
   the prevalent views on the globalization of production, this paper holds
   that the outcomes and patterns of globalization vary, due mainly to the
   politics of the main actors inside and outside corporations. This paper
   compares Germany's negotiated globalization with U.S. employer
   unilateralism. In most U.S. corporations, employers decide how to
   globalize based on the short-term perspective of shareholder value. By
   contrast, in Germany, main industrial actors-including employers, works
   councils, and trade unions-collectively negotiate how to globalize. In
   this conflict-laden process of collective negotiation, German actors
   have created a political compromise that combines the upgrading of
   domestic production with globalizing overseas, whereas Americans have
   failed to do so. Furthermore, this paper emphasizes that divergent
   patterns of globalization are not predetermined by national
   institutions. To the contrary, the successful outcomes in German
   globalization come mainly from actors' proactive readjustments in their
   traditional model of industrial relations, creating new practices, such
   as active union involvement in company-level bargaining, and the
   democratic bottom-up process instead of the traditional top-down process
   of negotiation.},

Abstract = {The article will suggest a bottom-up approach to analyzing the impact of
   European Union (EU) conditionality on candidate countries. If requiring
   comprehensive reforms, EU accession negotiations offer domestic actors a
   legitimacy standard, external constraints and a focal point for
   electoral coalitions as resources in the domestic political arena. The
   Turkish case serves as a hypothesis-generating case study suggesting
   that domestic actors who are disadvantaged in domestic resources in
   these dimensions embrace EU accession, whereas domestic actors who feel
   threatened in their domestic resources adopt an opposite strategy. It
   will be demonstrated that the two major Turkish political parties
   adopted a costbenefit calculus in their position towards EU accession.
   The Turkish case is particularly intriguing because the positions
   adopted by the Justice and Development Party (AKP) and the Republican
   People's Party (CHP), respectively, have been counter-intuitive, and in
   fact both parties have drastically reversed earlier positions towards EU
   accession and done so in disregard of the preferences of their core
   electorate.},

Abstract = {The world has been struck by a mutating systemic financial crisis that
   is unprecedented in terms of financial losses and fiscal costs,
   geographic reach, and speed and synchronization. The crisis from August
   2007 to date can be divided into three main phases: the financial
   turmoil from August 2007 to the collapse of Lehman Brothers; the global
   financial crisis from September 2008 until spring 2010; and the eurozone
   sovereign debt crisis from spring 2010 to the current period. While each
   phase has brought significant challenges, the current sovereign debt
   crisis has been the most critical stage for the eurozone. It has brought
   unprecedented challenges for the monetary union and triggered
   extraordinary adjustments in both monetary policy and institutional
   arrangements at the eurozone level. The purpose of this article is to
   outline the features of each crisis phase, to describe the actions taken
   by the European Central Bank (ECB) during each phase and to explain the
   rationale for such measures. It also discusses the need to strengthen
   further the economic union in order to guarantee the sustainability of
   the monetary union of the eurozone. In this respect, it is argued that
   the recent institutional adjustments made at the European Union level
   would have been necessary independently of the financial crisis.},

Abstract = {Why have some post-Cold War autocrats consistently been able to sideline
   opposition and avoid debilitating elite defections while others have
   faced repeated challenges? Drawing on interviews, the media, and the
   academic literature, this article focuses on two sets of factors
   affecting the extent of incumbent control over opposition: the degree of
   state economic control and the extent of divisions in national identity.
   Two sets of most similar cases are compared: Belarus and Ukraine, and
   Kenya and Tanzania. These comparisons are used to highlight the
   importance of distinguishing between the causes of democracy and those
   of authoritarian breakdown.},

Abstract = {The authors use 2009 Programme for International Student Assessment
   (PISA) data to link institutional arrangements in OECD countries' to
   disparities in reading, math, and science test scores for migrant and
   native-born students. The authors find that achievement gaps are larger
   for migrant youths who arrive at older ages and for those who do not
   speak the language of the PISA test at home. Institutional arrangements
   often serve to mitigate the achievement gaps of some migrant students
   while leaving unaffected or exacerbating those of others. For example,
   earlier school starting ages help migrant youths in some cases but by no
   means in all. Limited tracking of students by ability appears to be
   beneficial for migrants' relative achievement, while complete tracking
   and the presence of a large private school sector appear to be
   detrimental. Migrant students' achievement, relative to their
   native-born peers, suffers as educational spending and teachers'
   salaries increase, but it improves when teacher evaluation includes an
   examination component.},

Journal = {ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {642},
Pages = {72-85},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The highly contextual nature of ethnographic inquiry allows a researcher
   to develop and adjust data collection and analysis to specific social
   situations. This methodological flexibility also makes it possible to
   choose for analytic attention specific instances of human activity and
   experience that show potential to illuminate conceptual issues or alter
   our theoretical understandings. Theoretically interesting social
   activity can be identified using Peircean abduction. In the field, the
   researcher embraces serendipity and intuition. Data analysis begins
   neither with inductive nor deductive reasoning. By initially
   disassociating the data from their context, specific theoretical
   debates, and the experience of data collection in the field, the
   ethnographer is able to play with the data freely and let this process
   generate a surprising discovery. This discovery is then articulated
   through a dialog among insight, contextualized empirical evidence, and
   theoretical knowledge. Leaving open the possibilities of insight and
   discovery, abductive ethnography is a strategy of unforeclosed
   possibilities.},

Volume = {642},
Pages = {186-199},

Abstract = {This article, based on five years of ethnographic fieldwork, describes
   the strategies for the presentation of the Self employed by Eastern
   European immigrant women in the Italian northeast. These middle-aged
   women migrated alone, are employed as live-in care workers, and often
   lack legal status. For them, migration is a deeply felt trauma, which
   they narrate as being forced upon them by the collapse of the USSR and
   the failures of the transition to a market economy. They perceive their
   life in Italy as degrading, their work is stressful and undignified,
   they miss their children, and they are often seen as poor mothers with
   questionable morals. Consequently, they seek to dilute the social
   stigma, presenting positive images of their selves and claiming respect
   from a variety of audiences. The women continuously endeavor to define
   their current condition as accidental and temporary and to assert their
   right to a better future.},

Journal = {ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {642},
Pages = {96-108},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This article explores the way social actors organize their engagements
   in real time. The term ``narrative{''} points to the subjectively
   understood practical projects that people structure with beginnings,
   middles, and ends. All projects may be interrupted, and if social actors
   are to continue the narrative engagement they must treat the stoppage as
   a mere suspension. The work of suspending a game of informal pick-up
   basketball is examined in three phases: interrupting the game, treating
   the game as suspended, and resuming play. In each phase, players
   collectively resist the possibility of abandonment as an alternative to
   game resumption. While narrative structuring is a powerful locus of
   meaning across diverse social contexts, informal basketball games offer
   a particularly good setting for the study of narrative organization in
   social life.},

   embodies the widely shared norm of corporate responsibility. While both
   international intergovernmental organization (IGO) and international
   non-governmental organization (INGO) networks support this norm, they
   differ on the adequacy of the Compact's program design. We explore how
   this tension affects the diffusion of the Compact across countries,
   which vary in their levels of embeddedness in IGO and INGO networks. Our
   findings suggest that embeddedness in IGO networks encourages adoption,
   while embeddedness in INGO networks discourages it. Our analysis
   provides important lessons for sponsors of voluntary governance
   mechanisms. Widespread support for a norm does not automatically ensure
   support for a program that claims to embody it.},

Abstract = {This article discusses how images and perceptions shaped by the Cold War
   led to misunderstandings on both sides of U.S.-Soviet biomedical
   exchanges. The article explores these misunderstandings and shows that
   their origins are to be found in the Cold War interactions between the
   two superpowers. The Cold War was more than just a structural constraint
   on the two sides' interactions. Political tensions between the
   superpowers interfered in the process of scientific cooperation, and the
   geopolitics of the period imbued science with political significance,
   but the crucial thing was the way the Cold War framed cooperation in the
   sphere of biomedicine. When exchange participants were interpreting and
   responding to interactions with their foreign colleagues, the analytical
   framework they used was the Cold War. Their adoption of this framework
   posed a barrier to achieving mutual understanding not only of the other
   side's motives or intentions but of the science itself. The exchange
   participants came away with a distorted picture of the structure and
   function of each other's research enterprise.},

Title = {Unexpected Winners: The Significance of an Open-List System on Women's
   Representation in Poland},
Journal = {POLITICS \& GENDER},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {8},
Number = {2},
Pages = {153-177},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Scholars have debated the impact of open-list systems on women's
   representation. While some argue that open lists provide a unique
   opportunity for voters to overcome parties' bias against women, others
   argue that they create additional barriers. I examine several mechanisms
   that impact women's representation within Poland's open-list system.
   Results suggest that 1) voters shift women's original list placements
   positively across all parties over three elections; 2) these shifts are
   more pronounced when women's overall presence on the list and list
   placement are lower, regardless of party; and 3) positive shifts often
   result in the election of substantially more women than would have been
   expected. These findings add to our understanding of open-list systems
   by documenting variability in the effects of preferential voting across
   time and party in a postcommunist context. In addition, the unexpected
   positive effects of preferential voting in Poland add to a growing body
   of evidence that voters and parties on the center and right support
   female candidates at rates approaching or similar to parties on the
   left.},

Abstract = {In the often polarized discussions over immigration, the point is
   sometimes missed that immigration often brings immediate and tangible
   benefits. Nowhere is this truer than in the hollowing-out parts of
   America. Many nonmetropolitan counties in America have seen net
   out-migration for decades. While young people have always left small
   towns, the loss of this group comes at a time when opportunities for
   those who stay have been severely reduced. One trend that runs counter
   to the decline of many nonmetro areas is the influx of immigrants, the
   majority of Hispanic origin, during the 1990s and 2000s. The authors
   argue that if immigration is ``done right,{''} it can provide a lifeline
   to many places that are hollowing out. In this article, the authors
   outline the complex nature of immigration in rural America and offer two
   case studies of small towns, one where immigration became a lightning
   rod for controversy and division and one where the process has occurred
   with little divisiveness and a great deal of success. The authors
   conclude with some policy suggestions as to how to better accommodate
   immigration in rural America.},

Abstract = {Women are at the epicentre of the HIV epidemic in Malawi. Drawing upon
   original data from forty-four key-informant interviews, this article
   examines how the gendered construction of women's bodies places them at
   particular risk. Although the gender dimensions of HIV are recognized,
   the gendered structures of power that underscore the particular risk to
   women of infection are not fully understood, and the response fails to
   engage effectively with the gender context. This research contributes to
   the literature because the body is typically located within the private
   sphere, beyond the realms of intervention and analysis. Taboos
   surrounding the body, particularly the female body, act as a barrier to
   understanding and addressing women's embodied experiences that place
   them at risk. The body is the site of risk of HIV infection, and it is
   the site of where power is exercised and becomes real. Where HIV spreads
   along the gender fault lines of society, the analysis sheds light on how
   women's embodied experiences of power heighten their risk and provide
   the space to challenge them. Rather than imposing responses from the top
   down based on `best practice', policy must be responsive to specific
   gender contexts.},

Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {19},
Number = {3},
Pages = {448-476},
Abstract = {In less developed countries, the higher individuals' labor skills are,
   the more they support free trade. This recurrent statistical finding is
   problematic for extant analytical models used to explain and interpret
   people's positions on free trade. This article proposes an analytical
   framework that challenges the dominant full-information factor-endowment
   approach to public opinion on free trade. The dominant approach assumes
   informed individuals who relate expectations about how free trade will
   affect them to their work skills. We propose that most individuals lack
   information and that their positions reflect the influence of
   information, frames, economic vulnerability, and political endorsements.
   We test this alternative approach with a Spanish survey conducted in May
   2009 and the ISSP survey conducted in 2003 in a large number of less
   developed and more developed countries. The Spanish data demonstrate
   that the population is largely uninformed and that their ideas about the
   consequences of free trade do not explain contrasts among different
   socio-demographic groups. Meanwhile, the ISSP data contradict important
   aspects of the traditional approach and are consistent our alternative
   approach.},

Abstract = {In 1946 veteran British intelligence officer Kenneth Strong undertook
   the Directorship of a new intelligence organization, the Joint
   Intelligence Bureau (JIB). The JIB absorbed the responsibilities of
   several wartime intelligence organs, and was responsible for economic,
   topographic, and aspects of scientific intelligence on an interservice
   basis. Its responsibilities grew over the following 18 years; most
   notably, it absorbed atomic intelligence in 1957. When the Defence
   Intelligence Staff was created in 1964, absorbing the JIB and the
   individual Service agencies, JIB was at its heart and Kenneth Strong its
   first Director. The organization conducted key work in the early Cold
   War, was at the centre of an international network of Joint Intelligence
   Bureaux, and was an important stepping stone in the movement to
   centralize military and military-relevant intelligence in Britain - but
   the historiography pays it surprisingly little attention. This paper
   introduces the JIB and various aspects of its work, and demonstrates
   that its low profile in the historiography is unjustified.},

Journal = {INTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {27},
Number = {6},
Pages = {824-847},
Abstract = {This article addresses the challenge of managing uncertainty when
   producing estimative intelligence. Much of the theory and practice of
   estimative intelligence aims to eliminate or reduce uncertainty, but
   this is often impossible or infeasible. This article instead argues that
   the goal of estimative intelligence should be to assess uncertainty. By
   drawing on a body of nearly 400 declassified National Intelligence
   Estimates as well as prominent texts on analytic tradecraft, this
   article argues that current tradecraft methods attempt to eliminate
   uncertainty in ways that can impede the accuracy, clarity, and utility
   of estimative intelligence. By contrast, a focus on assessing
   uncertainty suggests solutions to these problems and provides a
   promising analytic framework for thinking about estimative intelligence
   in general.},

Pages = {879-901},
Abstract = {Heritage is becoming a significant element of the urban landscape of the
   post-socialist city. The emerging contested landscapes reflect new
   political identities and competition between different political actors
   for influence. In the 1990s, state-sovereignty movements in Russia's
   ethnic republics gave rise to urban projects aimed at expressing the
   ideas of nation building, ethnic and religious awareness and new
   interpretations of the past. The article explores the role of the state
   in creating heritage discourses and practices by using as a case study
   the `resurrection' of the Kul-Sharif Mosque in the Kazan Kremlin in the
   period 1995-2005.},

Abstract = {This article uses records, recently made available, to shed new light on
   the way Israeli intelligence evaluated and interpreted the political and
   military implications of the Czech-Egyptian arms deal (1955). The
   evidence suggests that the intelligence services did not have the
   capabilities to cope with such an event. For the first two months
   following public exposure of the deal, intelligence was not able to
   present a coherent and evidence-based description regarding the extent
   of the deal and its implications. Subsequently, their assessment of the
   deal's implications evolved from gloomy and anxious to calm and
   reassuring. Causes of the intelligence service's difficulties in
   evaluating the situation's effects and the role of their assessment in
   shaping Israeli policy are discussed.},

   the central bank in Israel},
Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {19},
Number = {2},
Pages = {317-340},
Abstract = {The strengthening of central banks is frequently considered as a direct
   consequence of globalization. This paper offers an alternative
   explanation which considers this process as the result of political
   processes taking place first and foremost within local political fields.
   Yet we consider globalization as an important component in the politics
   of institutional reforms, by serving as a resource mobilized by
   political actors striving to improve their position in the local
   political field. We show how the central bank in Israel appealed to the
   normative power of worldwide accepted institutional models, to the
   authority of international financial organizations, and to the
   disciplinary power of global financial markets, claiming that the
   adoption of central bank independence is imposed by the imperatives of
   globalization. We claim that the ability of central banks to conduct a
   credible politics of inevitability is based on their privileged location

   in Global Finance},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {97-116},
Abstract = {How does the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) `see' global
   financial supervision? This article finds that the BIS's approach to
   bank supervision relies on private banks to be self-regulating entities
   and favours the interests of the largest global banks and financial
   centres. The BIS's private, club-like design and culture insulate
   private-sector participation in global financial policy-making from
   governmental control and oversight, blur the line between the public and
   private spheres of policy-making and allow private norms to shape public
   norms in global financial governance. Moreover, the BIS's normative
   framework concerning financial-market governance, in general, and bank
   supervision, in particular, is shaped by the bank's long-standing belief
   that state intervention into financial markets in the form of
   regulations and controls produces suboptimal economic outcomes. Rather
   than resulting from external factors such as great power dominance,
   regulatory capture or the search for `best practices', the BIS's bias
   towards the policy preferences and market interests of the largest banks
   and financial centres is explained through a detailed examination of its
   institutional design and history as a bank founded by and for the
   world's largest banks - central as well as private.},

Abstract = {Scott's account of state-making is premised on the `legibility' of
   society, facilitating administration by replacing idiosyncratic and
   particularistic local arrangements with a uniform bureaucratic grid.
   Along with conscription, extracting tax was the primary motivation
   behind this transformation. With the growth in cross-border economic
   relations, the current challenge for tax collectors is to make finance
   and banking legible at the global scale, moving from idiosyncratic and
   particularistic national arrangements towards a world-wide uniform
   bureaucratic grid. This is believed to be necessary to defeat would-be
   tax evaders looking to profit from the gaps and incompatibilities
   between different national tax systems. The Organisation for Economic
   Co-operation and Development (OECD) is the main agent in homogenising
   tax data and procedures, and facilitating the exchange of tax
   information between states. As such, `seeing like a state' on tax gives
   way to `seeing like the OECD'.},

Abstract = {This article argues for a pluralist, integrative, `post-Washington
   Consensus' view of an East Asian financial architecture in the
   post-global crisis world. What are the key architectural problems and
   how might such problems be resolved? The article aims to address these
   general questions and to develop a policy-applicable theory about a
   post-crisis regional financial architecture by focusing on the case of
   East Asia. The generic problems identified in the study include
   sovereignty, power struggles, structural diversity, collective action
   problems and weak regional identity and norms. Herein, I present a
   conceptual model of logically possible solutions to such problems, which
   comprises principled minimalism and host regulation, decomposition and
   issue linkage, and informal intermediaries. The proposed solutions
   reflect and reinforce the normative fragmentation and decentralization
   of global financial governance in the twenty-first century.},

Title = {How Russians View Electoral Fairness: A Qualitative Analysis},
Journal = {EUROPE-ASIA STUDIES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {64},
Number = {1},
Pages = {145-168},
Abstract = {There is a broad consensus that the Duma and presidential elections held
   in Russia in 2007-2008 failed to meet internationally recognised
   democratic standards. Post-election public opinion surveys, however,
   show that most Russians thought that the elections were mainly fair.
   This discrepancy between the views of international observers and of
   Russians themselves has not been adequately explained. The main aim of
   this article, utilising data from a series of focus groups, is to
   identify potential explanations for why so many Russians assessed these
   elections as fair, when there was so much evidence to the contrary. Why
   did so many Russians view egregiously unfair elections as fair? What,
   furthermore, can this tell us about Russians' political values and what
   are the possible implications of this for Russia's political
   development?},

Abstract = {In this article, the role of credit rating agencies (CRAs) during the
   201011 EU sovereign debt crisis is assessed. It is concluded that rating
   agencies lag behind markets, that their business model is flawed, and
   that the lack of competition renders the big three CRAs with too strong
   a market position. The reliance on CRAs should be reduced by attaching
   less importance to them in prudential regulation and accounting
   standards. At the same time, more competition and transparency is needed
   to increase the quality of ratings. Finally, several policy options to
   change the ratings industry are discussed, including the creation of a
   network of small CRAs, delegation of sovereign debt ratings to the
   European Central Bank or the creation of a European rating agency.},

Abstract = {Colombia has been undergoing a massive disarmament, demobilization and
   reintegration (DDR) process accompanied by various transitional justice
   measures in which victims of the conflict and demobilized combatants
   have become key political actors. While there is much talk about
   reconciliation, little is known about local interaction between victims,
   ex-combatants and their surrounding communities or about the connections
   between these micro-level realities and macro-level transitional justice
   and peacebuilding processes. This article presents the findings from a
   2010 field study conducted in four neighborhoods of the cities of
   Bogota, Medellin and Valledupar. It argues that everyday experiences of
   coexistence in these areas are mainly conditioned by local factors, such
   as poverty and insecurity, and by the past experiences of individual
   victims, ex-combatants and other citizens in the midst of Colombia's
   ongoing, nonethnic conflict. The connections between these coexistence
   situations and macro-level transitional justice and DDR programs,
   however, are much less clear.},

Volume = {40},

Abstract = {Firms may find competitive adjustment difficult because they are
   hamstrung by rigid labor market rules. However, such difficulties may
   also be caused by conflicts between strategic choices in the management
   of human capital and the opportunities and limitations created by a
   given regulatory framework. This latter possibility has been almost
   totally ignored in the debate regarding the urgency and content of labor
   market reforms in countries whose labor market institutions have been
   labeled as ``rigid{''} by international experts. This article uses the
   results of qualitative interviews with Spanish employers to suggest that
   strategic choices may be far more important in determining the
   consequences of labor market institutions than is generally recognized.
   I show that these choices are often the result of beliefs about how
   labor market institutions should work. These findings suggest that
   supposedly ``neutral{''} calls for greater efficiency in labor market
   institutions are really arguments about the relative appropriateness of
   different expectations regarding how firms should pursue adjustment,
   expectations that are directly related both to the relative balance of
   power between employers and workers and to the structure of their
   relationship. In other words, the phrase ``politics of labor market
   reform{''} should be understood to refer not only to the political
   consequences of reforms but also to the inherently political nature of
   the reforms themselves.},

Abstract = {After Egypt's January 2011 revolution ousted former President Hosni
   Mubarak, a conversation began amongst a number of international and
   Egyptian human rights groups regarding the need to promote international
   transitional justice precedents within the Egyptian context and to raise
   public awareness of them. This note argues that, in many ways, the
   Egyptian revolution surpassed the bounds of reformist transitional
   justice agendas. It begins by identifying two specific limitations in
   their scope: regarding the accountability of external actors and
   regarding the guarantee of economic and social rights. The article then
   describes the more far-reaching conceptions for change that were
   communicated in the key demands and subsequent campaigns of the 2011
   revolution. Finally, it argues that Egypt's transition itself has
   stalled, as the ruling military council lacks the political will to
   propel transitional justice, rendering such discussions premature. It
   recommends that international practitioners take their cues from
   Egyptian actors negotiating these challenges, rather than proceeding
   without sufficiently questioning the context.},

   International Political Sociology, doi: 10.1111/j.1749-5687.2012.00157.x
   (C) 2012 International Studies Association During the last decade, the
   framing of climate change has been significantly transformed. It has
   turned from a gradually intensifying, long-term challenge into a highly
   nonlinear danger that threatens national security. This article explores
   the reasons, and points to the consequences, of this change. Drawing
   from actor-network theory, it argues that practices and materials have
   become entangled across professional and disciplinary contexts. The
   growing association of chaotic climate change encompasses
   climatologists, who challenge the mainstream ontology of climate;
   economists, who started to revisit their economic models; and strategic
   communities, which began to pick up nonlinear climate changes
   foregrounding national security. Methodologically, the principle of
   symmetry that underlies this research aims, as far as is possible, to
   transcend the dualistic notions of science and politics, and society and
   nature. The article thereby attempts to open up a debate about the
   usefulness of a symmetrical approach to enhance research both on global
   environmental governance in particular, and global politics in general.},

Abstract = {Frustrated by federal inaction on immigration reform, several U.S.
   states in recent years have proposed or enacted laws designed to stem
   the flow of illegal immigrants into the United States and to facilitate
   their removal. An underappreciated implication of these laws is the
   potential alienation of immigrant communities-even law-abiding,
   cooperative individuals-from the criminal justice system. The ability of
   the criminal justice system to detect and sanction criminal behavior is
   dependent upon the cooperation of the general public, including acts
   such as the reporting of crime and identifying suspects. Cooperation is
   enhanced when local residents believe that laws are enforced fairly. In
   contrast, research reveals that cynicism of the police and the legal
   system undermines individuals' willingness to cooperate with the police
   and engage in the collective actions necessary to socially control
   crime. By implication, recent trends toward strict local enforcement of
   immigration laws may actually undercut public safety by creating a
   cynicism of the law in immigrant communities. Using data from a 2002
   survey of New York City residents, this study explores the implications
   of perceived injustices perpetrated by the criminal justice system for
   resident willingness to cooperate with the police in immigrant
   communities.},

Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Pages = {33-58},

Abstract = {Conditional lending by the IMF is predicated, in part, on the belief
   that IMF programs are associated with increased capital inflows to
   participating countries. This belief is generally consistent with
   theoretical arguments in the academic literature (e.g., Bird and
   Rowlands 1997; Bordo et al. 2004) but the empirical literature often
   finds otherwise (e.g., Jensen 2004). This paper argues that the effect
   of IMF agreements on a country's access to foreign direct investment
   (FDI) depends on its domestic institutions. Access to FDI depends on a
   country's ability to credibly commit to implementation, and this ability
   varies systematically across regime type. The theory is empirically
   tested using a treatment effects model with a Markov transition in the
   treatment equation in a dataset covering 142 countries from 1976 to
   2006. We find that in democracies IMF program participation has a strong
   positive effect on FDI inflows and in autocracies participation has a
   weak negative effect.},

Abstract = {This article serves as a guide for conducting statistical analyses in a
   reasoned action context. Using structural equation modeling concepts,
   the authors identify two elements of reasoned action data: the
   structural component relating theoretical variables to one another and a
   measurement component defining the theoretical constructs. The authors
   then describe a three-step analytic approach: analyzing the proximal
   determinants of intention to perform a behavior, analyzing the
   underlying beliefs, and performing a segmentation analysis for
   intervention design purposes. In each step, when appropriate, the
   authors discuss the role of background/precursor variables. The authors
   conclude by addressing several common analytic issues that may arise
   when conducting a reasoned action analysis, such as the role of past
   behavior and testing for moderation.},

Abstract = {Early theorists of European integration speculated that economic
   integration would lead to political integration and a European identity.
   A European identity has not displaced national identities in the EU,
   but, for a significant share of EU citizens, a European identity exists
   alongside a national identity. At the same time, political parties
   asserting more traditional nationalist identities and policies have
   directed their dissatisfaction against immigrants, foreigners and,
   sometimes, the EU. Those who participate in Europe are more likely to
   develop a European identity, while those whose economic and social
   horizons are essentially local are more likely to assert nationalist
   identities. It is argued in this article that the issue of European and
   national identity plays a heightened role in European politics,
   particularly in the economic crisis of 200711. The resolution of that
   crisis, which may result in increased European political co-operation,
   will have to take into account highly salient national identities that
   have so far resisted such co-operation.},

Abstract = {Quantitative researchers distinguish between causal and effect
   indicators. What are the analytic problems when both types of measures
   are present in a quantitative reasoned action analysis? To answer this
   question, the authors use data from a longitudinal study to estimate the
   association between two constructs central to reasoned action theory:
   behavioral beliefs and attitudes toward the behavior. The belief items
   are causal indicators that define a latent variable index while the
   attitude items are effect indicators that reflect the operation of a
   latent variable scale. The authors identify the issues when effect and
   causal indicators are present in a single analysis and conclude that
   both types of indicators can be incorporated into analyses of data based
   on the reasoned action approach.},

Abstract = {Well-founded fears that `refugee warriors' will use refugee camps as a
   base for military operations, exploit a wider refugee population, or
   misuse international aid have led to the development of policies
   intended to ensure the separation of combatants and civilian refugee
   populations. However, a dogmatic approach to that policy goal may miss
   the true complexity of both refugee protection and the relationships
   between a refugee population and a military group. This article examines
   an alternative possibility, that a non-state armed group may be a
   potential partner in refugee protection and welfare promotion. It draws
   on the experiences of refugees from Burma living in camps in Thailand,
   where there has been a long-standing connection between camp governance
   structures and a political/military organization movement, the Karen
   National Union/Karen National Liberation Army. While camp governance
   activities have been flawed, they have also displayed a high level of
   integrity. It is argued that in such a situation, where there is a
   proven record of working to improve civilian welfare, international
   organizations might usefully explore possibilities of engagement with
   non-state armed groups as partners in refugee protection, with the
   specific goal of encouraging a more representative, accountable, and
   democratic approach to governance.},

Title = {Engaging Armed Non-State Actors to Protect Children from the Effects of
   Armed Conflict: When the Stick Doesn't Cut the Mustard},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS PRACTICE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {4},
Number = {1},
Pages = {106-127},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This policy and practice note describes the methodology of the
   non-governmental organization (NGO) Geneva Call to engage armed
   non-state actors (ANSAs) in protecting children from the effects of
   armed conflict. ANSAs cannot take part in the development of, or become
   party to, international treaties, so Geneva Call has developed an
   innovative mechanism, the `Deed of Commitment', by which ANSAs subscribe
   to specific norms. The approach starts from the premise that ANSAs
   should not just be considered part of the humanitarian problem, but also
   part of the solution. Efforts to engage ANSAs on protection of children
   built on Geneva Call's earlier experience and the trust built up with
   ANSAs in developing and implementing a Deed of Commitment banning the
   use of anti-personnel (AP) mines. The Deed of Commitment on children and
   armed conflict, however, is more complex, having to take account of the
   agency of children, a more convoluted legal framework, and the existing
   United Nations (UN) Monitoring and Reporting Mechanism on children and
   armed conflict (MRM). In drafting the Deed of Commitment, Geneva Call
   consulted ANSAs and convened an expert group of legal and policy experts
   on children and armed conflict. These consultations made clear that the
   use and recruitment problem is not black and white, as, for example, in
   many cases ANSAs are intertwined with supportive communities, and often
   ANSAs take on protective roles - or at least perceive themselves to do
   so - due to lack of security and absence of assistance. Consequently,
   the problem needs to be addressed within a comprehensive approach to
   child protection and ensuring children's rights.
   The Deed of Commitment on children and armed conflict - similar to its
   predecessor banning AP mines - includes provisions on implementation and
   verification by both external monitoring and self-monitoring. Challenges
   to monitoring and verification include those posed by states which deny
   or obstruct access to ANSAs or territories where they operate.
   Complex problems such as protecting children from the effects of armed
   conflict require a range of responses. While the MRM - a political and
   process-driven mechanism based on an essentially punitive approach -
   will continue to be a key mechanism, it is important to have
   complementary approaches to engage ANSAs in committing to and complying
   with norms for child protection in armed conflict. The text of the Deed
   of Commitment is included as an appendix.},

Abstract = {A growing interest in the history of intelligence might be a way to
   learn more about not only the past, but also the dynamics shaping the
   future of intelligence. Intelligence is an evolving activity and the
   twentieth-century experience must be regarded as a phase in an ongoing
   transformation of its institutions, methods and roles. At least six
   fundamental processes can be identified as relevant to this re-shaping
   of intelligence in long perspective; the decreasing hegemony of national
   intelligence, the rise of new fields of knowledge with intelligence
   relevance, the diminishing relative importance of exclusive sources and
   methods, the rise of new actors producing and providing intelligence,
   the loss of an intellectual monopoly in a competitive knowledge
   environment and finally an increasing demand for reliable assessments
   and verification in a fragmented world of information.},

   persisted. The masculinization and militarization of this environment is
   addressed within a gender-focused analysis that emphasizes the
   normalization of violence. This approach reveals the political potential
   of acknowledging conflict dynamics hitherto obfuscated by hegemonic
   conceptualizations of `the conflict'.},

Abstract = {Even a decade into the twenty-first century, women remain severely
   underrepresented in state legislatures. Much research has focused on the
   factors that help or hinder women's representation as a group, a focus
   that has masked the striking difference in women's progress within the
   two parties. The representation of Democratic women in state
   legislatures has continued to increase, while the number of Republican
   women has actually decreased. This article employs state-level data to
   explore why women legislators have such different levels of
   representation within the two parties. The central argument is that, as
   of the twenty-first century, the parties have distinctive cultures that
   hold consequences for their respective abilities to produce, recruit,
   and support women elected officials. Processes at both the elite and
   mass level work together to foster the representation of Democratic
   women and inhibit the representation of Republican women.},

   Western involvement within what it perceives to be its zone of
   `privileged interest', focusing on military aspects of its policy
   towards Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and the implications for security

   Conceptual Reorientation of `Normative Power'},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {17},
Number = {3},
Pages = {243-270},
Abstract = {`Normative power' is an increasingly popularised concept in the study of
   EU external relations in fields including military policy, human rights,
   and international trade. Defined by Manners, it acknowledges the
   normative foundations of the European project, examines how Europe acts
   to (re)shape internationally accepted norms, and makes the claim that
   Europe ought to influence external partners' conception of `normal'
   behaviour in pursuit of a just global order. This article, however,
   argues that a moral economy perspective is central to a critical
   reorientation of the concept of normative power towards appraisal of
   discrepancies between nominal EU norms and material EU policy outcomes.
   Examining Europe's `normative power' in its relations with the African,
   Caribbean, and Pacific (ACP) countries, it demonstrates how amoral
   economy of ACP-EU ties has been instituted in negotiation with European
   ethical norms as to solidarity with `the poor'. Nevertheless, the moral
   economy of ACP-EU ties is seen not to be `moral' in terms of outcomes
   for vulnerable citizens in ACP countries. Rather the embedding of moral
   norms concerning pro-poor `development' has rationalised asymmetric
   economic ties. `Normative power' is understood as the EU's utilisation
   of moral norms in the public legitimisation and self-rationalisation of
   geopolitical interest and commercial gain in its relations with external
   `partners'.},

Abstract = {The international climate in the aftermath of the 2008-2009 financial
   crisis offers Russia an opportunity to undertake an ambitious program of
   modernization through innovation and institutional change initially
   articulated by Putin's Strategy-2020, elaborated 2006-2008, and then
   Medvedev's 2009 ``Russia, Forward!{''} manifesto. This article examines
   the complexities of Russia's choice of carrying on with state projects
   and monitoring from above or opening to private initiative and
   competition from abroad by looking at efforts to consolidate the
   corporate state, rhetorical, legal, and policy changes, and
   implementation of an economic reform agenda. The article asks if the
   pace of political reform is sufficient for the potential for these
   proposed economic changes to emerge.},

Abstract = {Focusing on diverse state approaches to nationalism provides a more
   nuanced view than that of Russian domestic and foreign policies driven
   directly by revanchist nationalism. The Russian authorities' `official
   nationality' is moderate in aspiration. However, the effect is less
   benign because the Kremlin both mobilises extreme nationalism for regime
   goals and suppresses it when it becomes destabilising. This approach
   prevents nationalism either of extreme or moderate orientation becoming
   an influential, independent force in Russian politics. Such conflicting
   imperatives make Russia a more unpredictable international partner than
   if its policies were founded on a consistent ideological nationalism.},

Title = {Seeing Like the IMF on Capital Account Liberalisation},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {59-76},
Abstract = {This article explores the ideational dynamics that shaped the
   International Monetary Fund's (IMF) campaign to establish capital
   mobility as a formal obligation of IMF membership during the 1990s.
   First, the article examines how the IMF made the issue of capital
   account liberalisation `legible' through constructing a particular
   `legibility map' on capital mobility, which was rigorously promoted
   across its membership. Second, the article explores the processes
   through which the IMF's legibility map on capital mobility was accepted
   by the organisation's member states. The article traces debates within
   the IMF Executive Board relating to the decision to amend the IMF's
   Articles of Agreement to give the organisation a formal mandate and
   jurisdiction over capital account liberalisation to complement its
   existing mandate and jurisdiction over current account transactions. By
   tracing the negotiations on this amendment proposal, the article
   illustrates how the IMF used the ambiguities inherent within its
   cognitive map on capital account liberalisation to persuade member
   countries of the need to amend its Articles of Agreement. In the wake of
   the Asian crisis, however, the persuasiveness of the IMF's policy
   preferences on capital mobility quickly declined in tandem with a
   broader deterioration in the organisation's cognitive authority in the
   world economy.},

Abstract = {This research note asks whether the gender of a landowner matters when
   it comes to endangered species conservation. Based on interviews with
   landowners in Ohio and Utah who share their property with endangered
   snakes or tortoises, it is argued that effective policy must confront
   existing gender differences. Women and men care equally about the
   tortoise in Utah while women care significantly less about the snake in
   Ohio. Moreover, women appear to extend an ethic of care to tortoises but
   not snakes. Thus, there is reason to believe that gender can matter and,
   when it does, policy needs to address this difference.},

Title = {Global Injustice Memories: The 1994 Rwanda Genocide},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SOCIOLOGY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {6},
Number = {4},
Pages = {373-389},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Within a relatively short span of time, and culminating with the tenth
   anniversary of the genocide in 2004, the 1994 Rwanda genocide has become
   a key global injustice memory. At the core of this process is a
   double-sided conception of injustice: on the one hand, the genocide in
   itself clearly constitutes a major injustice; on the other hand,
   injustice claims have been expanded to encompass actors outside of
   Rwanda who observed the horrors without instigating sufficient action to
   halt, or at least mitigate the effects of, the unfolding genocide. It is
   the fact that moral and political responsibility for the genocide has
   been so powerfully expanded to third parties in a spectatorship position
   that most vividly testifies to the global character of the Rwanda
   injustice memory. The article identifies and analyzes four areas in
   which the transformation of the Rwanda genocide from national event to
   global injustice memory has occurred: institutionalization, expressions
   of regret, analogical bridging, and cultural products. The article
   argues that the transformation of non-Western events into global
   injustice memories has so far been insufficiently explored within
   International Relations and global political sociology.},

Abstract = {Transitional justice mechanisms designed to deal with the past can
   collide with or be amplified by localized `everyday' memory work in
   divided societies. This article argues that transitional justice actors
   need to take more account of the rich, dense and pervasive forms of
   memory in divided societies, which can provide insight into postconflict
   narratives and how they impact on transitional processes, how memory
   entrepreneurs can advance claims and how zones of engagement between
   communities in conflict may function, or fail to function. A series of
   `vignette' case studies of everyday political memory in Northern Ireland
   is used to interrogate localized memory making and the corresponding
   need to obtain a better empirical and analytical purchase on ambiguous
   transitional environments.},

Abstract = {This article proposes an agenda for research on the relation of
   structural inequality to the study of politics and consumption in the
   field of communication. The authors review evidence for increasing
   inequality in the United States and argue that (1) consumption choices
   and desires are strongly constrained by structural location; (2)
   political beliefs and attitudes are shaped by location in the income or
   class structure; and (3) consumption as a form of political
   self-expression or civic identity, for example, boycotting or
   ``buycotting,{''} is also constrained by economic structural location.
   Given these propositions, it becomes critical to analytically situate
   notions of personalization of politics within the context of increasing
   economic inequality.},

Title = {Implementing independent regulatory agencies in Brazil: The contrasting
   experiences in the electricity and telecommunications sectors},
Journal = {REGULATION \& GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {6},
Number = {3},
Pages = {300-326},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This paper explores hypotheses that could explain both the creation of
   independent regulatory agencies (IRAs) in Brazil, and the differences in
   the design of the Brazilian IRAs in the telecommunications and
   electricity sectors. To formulate specific hypotheses that make sense of
   the Brazilian case, the paper critically interrogates the weak state
   hypothesis and the political bias hypothesis. The first argues that
   countries with flawed governance structures, such as Latin American
   countries, are less likely to establish independent regulators than
   European countries. The second argues that political bias is a
   determinant factor in predicting the implementation of IRAs in Latin
   America. The first part of the paper uses these two general hypotheses
   as a basis to formulate specific hypotheses to explain the creation of
   IRAs in Brazil. The second part of the paper formulates specific
   hypotheses that could explain why institutional guarantees of IRA
   independence are stronger in the telecommunications sector, than in the
   electricity sector. In particular, the paper argues in support of a
   revised version of the political bias hypothesis to explain sectoral
   divergence, suggesting that bureaucratic resistance to reform may be the
   cause for the variations observed in Brazil between regulatory reform in
   electricity and in telecommunications.},

Abstract = {This article draws on one citizen's efforts to document daily life in
   his neighborhood. The authors describe the potential benefits of
   third-party video-videos that people who are not social scientists have
   recorded and preserved-to social science research. Excerpts from a
   collection of police-citizen interactions illustrate key points likely
   to confront researchers who use third-party video. The authors address
   two important questions: How might the presence of a video camera affect
   the unfolding of interactions that are recorded in third-party videos?
   and How might the perspective of the videographer influence the
   production and preservation of these records and, in turn, what
   influence might this standpoint have on our analysis of the data? The
   authors argue that, given the ubiquity of handheld video recording
   devices, social scientists should develop systematic approaches to using
   video created by others as both a cultural record and as data.},

Title = {Naming and Shaming: Human Rights Accountability in Security Council
   Resolution 1960 (2010) on Women, Peace and Security},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS PRACTICE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {4},
Number = {1},
Pages = {82-105},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This paper provides a critical analysis of the United Nations (UN)
   Security Council's `naming and shaming' provision in operative paragraph
   3 of Security Council resolution 1960 (2010), arguing this is a
   counterproductive development in the contemporary collective security
   approach to women, peace and security. Resolution 1960, the fifth
   Security Council resolution on women, peace and security, significantly
   extends the Council's approach to challenging sexual violence in armed
   conflict through the development of global indicators and accountability
   mechanisms. This article offers an explanation of the terminology and
   context of resolution 1960 with a particular focus on operative
   paragraph 3. The article then shifts to review the value of the
   operative paragraph 3 naming and shaming provision. I argue against
   feminist activism that seeks to develop accountability mechanisms for
   non-state actors in isolation from strategies to prevent violence and
   suggest the need to promote, instead, strategies that increase women's
   participation in the delivery of justice mechanisms locally and
   globally. Additionally, the effectiveness of any list produced in the
   context of such naming and shaming will be undermined by the combination
   of a potential conflict of interests for humanitarian workers and the
   potential for mislabelling non-state actors, particularly members of
   armed groups, as responsible for sexual violence in armed conflict
   without paying appropriate attention to established due process and the
   rule of law. As such, the Security Council's current shift towards
   global indicators and accountability mechanisms will be unable to end
   sexual violence and gender-based human rights abuses by non-state actors
   in situations on the Council's agenda. I conclude that the impact of
   resolution 1960 operative paragraph 3 will be minimal: promoting neither
   women's rights nor peace nor security and with the potential to reduce
   incentives for armed groups to be active participants in the creation of
   peace.},

Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {17},
Number = {3},
Pages = {271-291},
Abstract = {This paper offers a critique of the increasingly prevalent argument that
   the late twentieth century saw a `financialisation' of capitalism
   anchored in the USA, the UK, and other leading Western economies. The
   objective of the paper is not to claim that there has been no such
   structural mutation, but that the studies which allegedly demonstrate
   this mutation are compromised by the anaemic geographies that structure
   and animate them. Such studies, the paper argues, fetishise the national
   scale and, in doing so, offer a restricted and potentially misleading
   reading of trends such as, most notably, historic growth in the share of
   corporate profits accruing to `finance' within individual countries.
   Examining empirical data for the UK, but explicitly incorporating the
   international perspective typically missing from existing studies of
   financialisation, the paper points to the vital role of international
   expansion by UK financial institutions in growing the financial sector's
   share of profits. Whether so-called `financialisation' has also
   contributed to this growth remains, the paper submits, open to question.},

Title = {What can Okun teach Polanyi? Efficiency, regulation and equality in the
   OECD},
Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},

Abstract = {Arthur Okun famously argued that ``effciency is bought at the cost of
   inequalities in income and wealth{''}. Okun's trade-off represents the
   antithesis to Karl Polanyi's view of the relationship that the more
   embedded markets are in society, the better the social and economic
   outcomes they produce. This paper refines both these views. We argue
   that not all forms of market embeddedness are created equal, and that
   the relationship between equality and efficiency can be both positive
   and negative. We show this by examining how different ways of embedding
   economic activity in society through market regulation produce different
   combinations of efficiency and equality. We identify empirically three
   broad patterns: market liberal regulatory frameworks that promote
   competitive markets without decommodifying institutions; embedded
   liberal regulations that allow markets to work efficiently, but within
   the framework of decommodification and equality; and embedded
   illiberalism, where regulations hinder markets in favor of powerful
   social groups and where decommodification undermines both efficiency and
   equality. Okun's trade-off emerges as a special case limited to the
   English-speaking democracies: other OECD countries tend to exhibit
   either efficiency and equality together, or inefficiency and inequality
   together. These findings suggest a corrective to both naive market
   liberal views of the incompatibility of efficiency and equality, but
   also to the more sophisticated Varieties of Capitalism framework, which
   pays insufficient attention to the ways in which markets can be embedded
   in stable but apparently dysfunctional institutional arrangements.},

Abstract = {Intelligence failures occur for more reasons than just sloppy tradecraft
   and are often attributable to decision- makers as well as to the
   intelligence community. Before exploring the subjective nature of
   intelligence failures, this article first discusses three foundational
   concepts underlying them: process vs. product, fact vs. judgment, and
   prediction. It then outlines major components of intelligence failures:
   accuracy, surprise, and the role of decision- makers, particularly
   unrealistic expectations and the use or nonuse of intelligence. The
   article concludes with a discussion of what the intelligence community
   and decision- makers can do to deal with these three components.},

Journal = {INTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY},

Volume = {27},

Pages = {896-912},
Abstract = {Each of the criteria most frequently used to evaluate the quality of
   intelligence analysis has limitations and problems. When accuracy and
   surprise are employed as absolute standards, their use reflects
   unrealistic expectations of perfection and omniscience. Scholars have
   adjusted by exploring the use of a relative standard consisting of the
   ratio of success to failure, most frequently illustrated using the
   batting average analogy from baseball. Unfortunately even this relative
   standard is flawed in that there is no way to determine either what the
   batting average is or should be. Finally, a standard based on the
   decision-makers' perspective is sometimes used to evaluate the analytic
   product's relevance and utility. But this metric, too, has significant
   limitations. In the end, there is no consensus as to which is the best
   criteria to use in evaluating analytic quality, reflecting the lack of
   consensus as to what the actual purpose of intelligence analysis is or
   should be.},

Abstract = {This paper traces the recent evolution of North American economic and
   security relations within the context of broader debates in
   international political economy (IPE) concerning globalization and its
   effects on the state in the international system. Borrowing from David
   Lake's discussion of hierarchical sovereignty, this paper argues that
   efforts to meld security to economics in an integrated North American
   market devoid of institutions have made sovereignty more hierarchical.
   It presents an approach to looking at North American integration, which
   can assist in understanding recent developments that are suggestive of
   new areas of research and policy development for both practitioners and
   theoreticians.},

Abstract = {First, this study tests for media effects on support for EU enlargement
   in a natural setting, while including actual media content in the
   analysis. Second, the moderation by anti-immigrant attitudes of media
   effects is tested, as it is argued that perceptions of `others'
   influences how new information on enlargement is received. The study
   draws on a two-wave panel survey and a media content analysis in 21
   countries. The results suggest there is a media effect, although not
   from individual exposure but from the information environment. In
   addition, individuals with stronger anti-immigrant attitudes are more
   strongly affected by a negative information environment.},

Abstract = {This article explores the impact of war-related traumatic experiences on
   political identities and political behavior by exploring different
   pieces of empirical evidence from the Spanish Civil War (1936-39), the
   Franco dictatorship (1939-75), and its aftermath. On one hand, the
   author analyzes semistructured interviews of survivors of the civil war
   and the dictatorship; on the other hand, she assesses data from a
   specialized survey implemented on a representative sample of the Spanish
   population. The analyses broadly suggest that, controlling for family
   leanings during the civil war, victimization experiences during the
   civil war and the subsequent dictatorship lead to the rejection of the
   perpetrators' identities along the political cleavage that was salient
   during the war (i.e., left-right). The survey analysis also indicates
   that (1) although grudges related to severe wartime violations are
   transmitted through generations, moderate wartime violations do not have
   such a long-term political impact; (2) the political effects of
   victimization do not increase with proximity to the traumatic events
   (i.e., age); and (3) victimization experiences do not have a significant
   impact on identities along cleavages that were not salient during the
   war (i.e., center-periphery).},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SOCIOLOGY},

Volume = {6},

Pages = {260-276},

Abstract = {This article analyzes counterterrorist lawmaking as an instance of
   security politics. It does so through archival parliamentary analysis of
   British counterterrorism legislation at three different times: in the
   wake of a perceived security emergency (2001); when the impact of an
   emergency is fading (2008); and when there is no emergency (2000). The
   findings show that over time, legislative exceptions and emergencies
   become normalized. By taking a parliamentary, legislative, and
   historical perspective, the article also challenges some of the
   assumptions of the exceptionalism debate.},

Abstract = {This article looks at the influence of minimum quality standards in a
   two-region partial-equilibrium model of vertical product differentiation
   and trade. Three alternative standard-setting arrangements are
   considered: full harmonization, national treatment and mutual
   recognition. The analysis integrates the choice of a particular
   standard-setting alternative by governments into the model. The article
   provides a set of sufficient conditions for which mutual recognition
   emerges as one regulatory alternative that always improves welfare in
   both regions. Mutual recognition, being the default procedure if
   governments do not reach a unanimous decision, is the only possible
   equilibrium of the game.},

Abstract = {While many studies have examined the external dimensions of
   democratization, the role of external anti-democratic factors remains
   unaddressed. Using an original dataset to analyze the presence and
   impact of external anti-democratic factors, this article aims to
   untangle the international dimensions of regime transition by singling
   out foreign trade. International post-Soviet trade links' impact on
   subnational political regimes in Russia is analyzed. Trade links between
   post-Soviet states and their regions are longstanding, dating back to
   the Soviet or even the tsarist period. The authors hypothesize that this
   variable was an important factor in regime transition in Russia's
   regions. The findings have wider implications for area studies and
   theoretical studies of democratization and regime transition.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes how exchange participants in university-industry
   agricultural biotechnology research collaborations manage and create
   differences between the academy and industry with regard to the open
   dissemination and commercialization of scientific knowledge. Our focus
   is on the constitutive relations that define the boundary between
   academic and commercial science. We identify a particular ``relational
   package{''} that formalizes and standardizes exchanges of money from
   industry for privileged access to university research discoveries. Our
   analysis of academic scientists' justificatory narratives about their
   patenting decisions challenges the oft-made assertion that academic
   patenting on its face should be taken as evidence of a blurred
   institutional boundary between academic and commercial science.},

   Studies Association Londons successful bid for the 2012 Olympic Games
   presented a diverse, cosmopolitan city opening its arms and welcoming
   the world. This article explores the apparently benign gesture of
   hospitality contained in Londons official candidature files submitted in
   2004 and asks how such a promise of inclusiveness is managed. We argue
   that Londons depiction of itself as hospitable to every kind of visitor
   relies on subtle techniques of governmentality in which the subject
   positions of host and guest are imagined and produced in ways that make
   them more governable. By this, we are not referring to acts of
   authority, coercion, or discipline that exclude subjects or render them
   docile bodies within a rigid panoptical city. Rather, we are referring
   to the delicate ways in which the official bid document imagines and
   produces the ideal subject positions of host and guest and in so doing
   enables, encourages, and incentivizes certain behaviors. This analysis
   of urban welcoming takes us beyond reductive oppositions of hospitality
   and hostility, inclusion and exclusion, self and other. It focuses
   instead on how Londons inclusive welcome produces a variety of host and
   guest positions (for example, the Olympic Family, volunteers, guest
   workers), segregates them within the city, and then conducts their
   conduct in the areas of planning, security, transport, accommodation,
   education, and training. By analyzing the techniques of governmentality
   at work in Londons 2004 bid document, this article foregrounds the
   enabling form of power driving the citys inclusive welcome and exposes
   its inherent micropolitics.},

Volume = {8},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {While significant attention has been dedicated to explaining women's
   election to office, fewer studies have assessed female politicians'
   access to positions of power within legislatures. This latter topic
   became particularly salient in the British House of Commons following
   the 2010 general election, when recently adopted reforms introduced
   intracameral elections for select committee members and chairs. This
   article outlines three hypotheses concerning the influence of candidate
   sex on election outcomes: a gender bias against female candidates, a
   gender advantage favoring female candidates, and gender-neutral
   outcomes. Drawing on two original data sets, the results not only fail
   to support the gender-bias hypothesis but also demonstrate that women
   were advantaged in the interparty elections for committee chairs. These
   findings offer new insights into both the position of female legislators
   in the UK Parliament and gender and the allocation of power within
   national assemblies more generally.},

Volume = {50},

Abstract = {This article reflects on the politics of European Union citizenship -
   and the ethical possibilities and limitations of a cosmopolitan or
   `normative power' EU - via an analysis of the situation of the Roma in
   France, which was widely mediatized in summer 2010. It argues in a first
   step that during this period the French government `securitized' the
   Roma, `extra-ordinarily' casting them as collective threat and thereby
   justifying their deportation. The European Commission's outspoken
   response demanded that the French authorities refrain from
   discriminating against EU citizens on grounds of ethnicity; in so doing,
   the EU seemed to act as protector of minorities in accordance with its
   raison d'etre as liberal peace project. However, in a second step, the
   article draws attention to the deportations perpetrated before these
   high-profile events, highlighting that conditionality within the law
   pertaining to EU citizenship allowed for the securitization of Roma.
   Thus, in a third step, it is argued that the invocation of citizenship
   may be a useful but limited strategy of political resistance by and with
   excluded groups such as Europe's Roma. Rather, it is the inherently
   ambiguous nature of a multi-level EU liberal or cosmopolitan government
   - and concomitant EU citizenship - which opens an important space for
   resistance.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SOCIOLOGY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Pages = {4-20},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The article provides a critical analysis of the performative effects of
   invocations of trauma and traumatic imagery during the sub-prime crisis.
   We develop a pragmatic approach to performativity that foregrounds the
   ambiguity between the importance of performative utterances, on the one
   hand, and overlapping performativities that produce subjects capable of
   ``hearing{''} such utterances, on the other. We argue that a
   performative effect of the traumatic narrative of the sub-prime crisis
   was to constitute it as ``an event{''} with traumatic characteristics.
   Financial subjects came to anticipate the object of financial salvation
   through intervention to save the banks; and such a view worked to
   curtail the range of political possibilities that were thinkable. Lines
   of pragmatic resistance are suggested, which turn the logic of trauma
   toward broadly progressive ends. In this way, the political dimension of
   performativity is brought forward: if finance is performative, then this
   only invites the question of how we might perform it differently.},

Abstract = {Education reform in Brcko district of Bosnia and Herzegovina is
   considered successful in terms of integrating and fostering
   reconciliation between the three main ethnonational groups, Bosniaks,
   Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Croats, after the 1992-1995 war. This article
   examines the politics of reconciliation as played out in and outside
   classrooms and challenges assumptions underpinning any notion of
   institutional reform leading directly to reconciliation. In doing so, it
   shifts the view from institutions to people, locality and contestation.
   Findings from empirical fieldwork conducted in 2007 and 2008 demonstrate
   how the actions of those whom education is supposed to transform in fact
   mediate and might even subvert the ways in which reform plays out in
   daily life. The article posits a need to understand this link in order
   to be able to assess fully the success of such interventions undertaken
   in the name of transition.},

Abstract = {This article explores the role of the news media in overseeing
   intelligence services and their work. As an informal mechanism, how do
   they fit into the wider landscape of intelligence oversight? By drawing
   on examples of US counter-terrorism efforts in the post-9/11 era, the
   article identifies three roles for the news media in intelligence
   oversight: as an information transmitter and stimulator for formal
   scrutinizers, as a substitute watchdog and as a legitimizing
   institution. Yet there is a danger of the news media acting merely as a
   lapdog. Other limitations include the impact of regulatory frameworks,
   government secrecy and the media strategies of intelligence services.
   The article concludes that the news media play an important role in the
   wider intelligence oversight landscape, but that their ability to
   scrutinize is uneven and ad hoc and as a result the picture they produce
   is blurred.},

Abstract = {In a world of rapid technological change and increasing interdependence
   between national and global networks, what institutions are necessary to
   facilitate the execution of a developmental project? An increasingly
   popular view expects the East Asian model of development to be
   ill-equipped to deal with the challenges involved in the information
   economy while the institutions of a `developmental network state' are
   argued to be of greater utility. This paper tests this view in light of
   a dramatic shift in the business strategy of Korean firms in the
   telecommunications sector in the early years of the twenty-first
   century. I argue that core features of the Korean model have been
   recombined in creative and unanticipated ways to meet the twin
   challenges of economic openness and knowledge-based industrialisation.
   The argument is developed through an examination of the Korean
   government's promotion of a novel Korean-developed mobile broadcasting
   standard. I identify and trace the emergence of the institutional
   conditions which facilitated the rise of new and innovative forms of
   state-industry collaboration. The findings have implications for two
   outstanding issues in the developmental state literature: the role of
   former developmental states after liberalisation and the type of
   institutions useful beyond the catch-up process.},

Abstract = {Since the 1970s, gender expertise has achieved a high degree of salience
   in global governance processes in general, and, over the last decade,
   within institutions concerned with international peace and security in
   particular. This study addresses the question of what happens when
   feminist knowledge is incorporated into the discourse of security
   institutions. It draws on Michel Foucault's concept of governmentality
   to examine the contingent encounters of feminist discourses with the
   liberal peace paradigm and traditional conceptions of security in the
   context of United Nations multidimensional peacekeeping operations over
   the period 1999-2010. Throughout these encounters, political
   rationalities of peacekeeping tend to subjugate feminist objectives to
   the broader goal of conflict resolution. Simultaneously, feminists and
   women's rights activists who engage with mainstream peacekeeping
   rationalities are turning into potentially influential `gender experts',
   who contest and redefine traditional meanings of peace and security. As
   bureaucratic machineries become involved in the collection of data on
   post-conflict gender dynamics, such as violence against women and girls,
   women's formal political participation and acts of sexual violence
   committed by peacekeepers, feminist knowledge increasingly informs
   technologies of population management in post-conflict settings. In the
   process, certain gendered and racialized identities are normalized, and
   certain rationales for military intervention in the post-colonial world
   are put forward, thus contributing to creating new marginalities and
   consolidating existing ones.},

Abstract = {World politics and economic relations have undergone profound and
   drastic adjustments since 1990s while an eye-catching phenomenon
   occurred: globalization and increasing anti-globalization movements.
   Since the World Trade Organization suffered the first large-scale
   protest by anti-globalization people in Seattle in 1999, more than 10
   similar ``anti-globalization{''} protests have been staged with
   increasing scale and better organizing. Though such protests were once
   lessened after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, they were up again during the
   following World Economic Forum held in New York at the end of 2001 and
   the European Union Summit held in Spain in February, 2002. Various signs
   showed that Western countries' ``anti-globalization front{''} was
   ubiquitous. These protest activities used to be spontaneous and
   orderless, but now they are well organized and planned, evolving toward
   another ``globalization of anti-globalization movements{''}. In the
   foreseeable future, these protests will remain closely related to
   globalization and have a significant influence on the world. Because the
   central stage of globalization is in developed countries, the driving
   force behind anti-globalization movements also comes from Western
   countries. Therefore, this article is to analyze the rising
   anti-globalization movements from the perspective of ``democratic
   deficit{''}.},

Abstract = {This paper focuses on post-Soviet regional integration as a special case
   where integration projects are established by countries that originally
   comprised a single political entity after its collapse. It shows that in
   this framework the existing economic ties between countries are likely
   to affect adversely the interest of functional bureaucracy to support
   regional integration given that cutting existing connections is often
   more promising from the point of view of the budget expansion. Hence,
   the interaction of national and supranational bureaucracies is unlikely
   to generate impetus for increasing regional cooperation, which,
   surprisingly, can, however, be supported by adverse economic shocks. The
   results are validated using the experience of two low-level politics
   sectors of interaction in the post-Soviet space: electricity and
   transportation.},

Abstract = {This study explores whether negative political advertising has any
   impact on adolescents. Two datasets are merged for this inquiry: (1)
   content-coded ad-buy data on the placement of campaign messages on a
   market-by-market and program-by-program basis and (2) national survey
   data of parent-child dyads collected immediately after the 2008
   presidential election. The authors' analysis finds that the negativity
   of political advertising to which adolescents were exposed predicted
   human-interest candidate knowledge, but not policy-relevant candidate
   knowledge. In addition, the negativity of political advertising exposure
   suppressed political consumerism among adolescents, but had no effect on
   their levels of political participation. This study shows that political
   campaigns can affect adolescents' knowledge and participation in
   unconventional and potentially deleterious ways.},

Abstract = {This symposium critically engages with the volume Experimentalist
   Governance in the European Union: Towards a New Architecture (2010),
   edited by Charles F. Sabel and Jonathan Zeitlin. Experimentalist
   Governance (EG) opens up an original theoretical perspective on the
   emergent governance architecture of the EU and sheds new light on
   developments in key policy sectors. This symposium brings together a
   transatlantic group of distinguished political scientists and legal
   scholars to discuss the added value of EG as a concept for analysis, its
   theoretical underpinnings, empirical relevance, and normative
   implications, in terms of legitimacy. Contributors discuss EG from
   different disciplinary and theoretical perspectives, referring to a
   variety of empirical examples in the EU context and beyond. The
   symposium closes with a response from the authors to their critics. This
   collection of essays sheds new light on debates around the nature of the
   EU and democratic governance beyond the nation state.},

Journal = {POLITICS \& SOCIETY},

Volume = {40},
Number = {3},
Pages = {349-388},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This paper presents a study of gatekeeping in the U.S. political blog
   ``Daily Kos.{''} Open online collectives like Daily Kos use relational
   mechanisms, such as gatekeeping, to manage organizational boundaries and
   filter the contributions of participants. However, neither prior
   theories of gatekeeping nor the existing analyses of open online
   collectives account for the character or implications of gatekeeping in
   the Daily Kos community. Using qualitative evidence as well as
   statistical analysis of a large sample of comment threads on the site
   from 2008, I argue that gatekeeping on Daily Kos takes centralized and
   decentralized forms, and that both modes depend critically on relational
   boundary work among site participants. Centralized gatekeeping proceeds
   through actions by high-status members of the community. Decentralized
   gatekeeping, by contrast, consists of more numerous and small-scale
   interactions between community members, who filter and moderate each
   other's participation. Both forms of gatekeeping enhance the ability of
   site leaders and incumbent community members to regulate access to
   privileges and agenda-setting responsibilities on the site. These
   findings imply that the egalitarian ethos of open online collectives
   exists in tension with the mechanisms through which participation and
   status inequalities emerge among participants. How collectives engaged
   in mobilization and discursive production resolve this tension will
   shape the long-term impact of online participation and blogs on the
   political and public spheres.},

Abstract = {This article addresses regulatory reforms in the Indian
   telecommunications sector and emphasizes the role of the Indian
   judiciary. Our claim is that when confronted with a series of disputes
   relating to the nascent telecom regulatory landscape, the Supreme Court
   of India sought to make a constructive contribution to both the actual
   disputes as well as the overall regulatory framework. Our reading of
   these cases suggests that in the sphere of telecom, the Supreme Court
   has been less interested in stamping its own authority on issues, and
   has instead sought to bolster the authority and legitimacy of the
   recently constituted telecom regulatory institutions. We seek to draw
   attention to the role of the Indian judiciary as marking an exceptional
   feature of evolving regulatory systems in the Global South. Conventional
   wisdom in the regulatory jurisprudence that has evolved in the Global
   North suggests that judiciaries should have little or no role to play in
   regulatory systems. We suggest that to overcome the special challenges
   that regulatory systems in the Global South confront, more established
   institutions and actors might have to lend credibility and legitimacy to
   enable nascent regulatory actors to develop over time. At least in the
   Indian case, this is one way to understand the Indian judiciary's
   interventionist actions in the sphere of telecom regulation.},

Abstract = {Sabel and Zeitlin's Experimentalist Governance offers an insight into
   European governance in those cases where the EU institutions do not have
   clear competence and where member states are not prepared to accept a
   unified policy on a problem at hand. Experimentalist Governance
   identifies four steps of action: agree on common goals, have lower
   levels propose ways to meet goals, then report on their meeting of
   goals, and, finally, periodically reevaluate the review procedures. By
   looking at the developments in EU policymaking through the lens of
   experimentalist governance (EG), one obtains an appreciation of how
   goals might be achieved that would otherwise not likely have been
   achieved through the community method. Sabel and Zeitlin highlight how
   EG can be effective in obtaining results, integrating peers, and
   incorporating deliberation, and offer a different way to deal with
   accountability and legitimacy. This article closes by taking the next
   step, namely, asking what challenges EG poses to democratic processes.},

Abstract = {This article explores the determinants of banking sector fragility in
   the eurozone. For this purpose, a stock-market-based banking sector
   fragility indicator is calculated for eight member countries from 1999
   to 2009 using the Merton model (1974). Using a panel framework, it is
   found that the macroeconomic environment, the structure of the banking
   sector and the intensity of banking regulation all have an effect on
   banking sector fragility in the eurozone.},

Abstract = {More than a decade after the signature of the 2000 Arusha Peace and
   Reconciliation Agreement, which announced the establishment of
   transitional justice mechanisms in Burundi, a Truth and Reconciliation
   Commission (TRC) is about to be launched. This note highlights how
   political factors and dynamics related to the peace process and to the
   2010 general elections explain the timing as well as elements of the
   proposed mandate and composition of the forthcoming TRC. There is reason
   to fear that the dominant party's attempts at controlling the TRC
   process, in addition to the context of increased insecurity, or possibly
   even of renewed armed insurgency, may undermine the Commission's ability
   to shed light on the past.},

   Politics of `Moral Entrepreneurs'},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS PRACTICE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {4},
Number = {1},
Pages = {57-81},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This article examines the challenges that human rights leaders face as
   they attempt to navigate the complex relationship between human rights
   and politics, especially during protracted conflicts and resultant peace
   processes.
   The appeal of human rights is in its commitment to the idea of
   universalism. But in entrenched conflicts where national or ethnic
   loyalties are extremely pervasive, human rights NGOs are pressured by
   all sides to highlight the violations committed against their own
   members and criticized when addressing violations against the other
   national or ethnic groups. Amongst the most difficult decisions for
   human rights leaders in such contexts are judgements about whether and
   how to engage with armed groups, or whether and how to address issues
   that are perceived to be at the heart of those conflicts but that also
   have human rights dimensions.
   The article focuses on the political dilemmas faced by human rights
   leaders in two different national conflicts: Northern Ireland and
   Israel/Palestine. It is drawn from an analysis of NGO reports and
   fieldwork based on rare `on the record' interviews with human rights
   activists about some of the hard choices faced by those organizations in
   the most difficult of times.
   As shown in the article, human rights groups exercise finely balanced
   decisions in such difficult contexts. They do so taking into account a
   whole set of factors, such as their own conceptions of rights, their
   views on the applicable human rights or humanitarian standards, their
   organization's internal political divisions, and the need for public
   credibility.},

Abstract = {Analyses of the global financial crisis that assign causality to the
   erosion of parts of the welfare state that protected individuals miss
   the importance of macro level regulation that protected firms and the
   financial system from itself. Post-Depression macro level regulation of
   finance prevented the emergence of mismatched maturities where deposits
   lacked state guarantees, and thus prevented runs on banks or near-banks.
   A balance sheet approach shows that macro regulation linked long
   duration liabilities in housing finance (mortgages) to long duration
   assets (pensions). Deregulation permitted the reemergence of mismatched
   maturities, providing both a necessary and sufficient condition for the
   current financial crisis.},

Title = {Parent States versus Secessionist Entities: Measuring Political
   Legitimacy in Cyprus, Moldova and Bosnia \& Hercegovina},
Journal = {EUROPE-ASIA STUDIES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {64},
Number = {7},
Pages = {1271-1296},
Abstract = {This article questions whether a relatively strong conviction that
   legitimacy conveys nothing more than acceptance derived from legal
   recognition. Therefore several indices are constructed which are
   applicable to comparing and contrasting four major dimensions of
   political legitimacy both in parent states and in secessionist entities.
   In measuring political legitimacy in Cyprus, Moldova and Bosnia \&
   Hercegovina in terms of identity and security on the one hand, and
   democracy and performance on the other, we may be able to observe cases
   where internal legitimacy has been neglected by the international
   community. This article concludes that legitimacy is a variable
   continuously used in the support and rejection of secessionist bids and
   integrationist endeavours.},

Journal = {EUROPE-ASIA STUDIES},

Volume = {64},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1033-1059},
Abstract = {On 23 August 1989, two million Balts joined hands in a human chain that
   stretched through Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. How has this phenomenon
   of solidarity against the Soviet regime and historical remembrance of
   the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact been narrated and commemorated in the 20
   years that followed? This article highlights the memory and
   commemoration of the Baltic Way in Latvia and identifies agents and
   contesting narratives in memory politics. It introduces the concept of
   commemoration spectacle, a collective ritual untethered from the burdens
   of the past or `grand narratives' of history, which subsumes struggles
   over memory beneath show and spectacle.},

   Analysis Useful},
Journal = {INTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {27},
Number = {3},
Pages = {398-422},
Abstract = {Improving intelligence analysis requires bridging the gap between
   scholarship and practice. Intelligence studies as an academic discipline
   is not very theoretical compared to the more established disciplines of
   political science and international relations. In terms of conceptual
   depth, levels of abstraction and theoretical development, even the
   theoretical portions of the academic intelligence studies literature
   could be described as policy relevant and potentially useful for
   practitioners, including intelligence analysts. Yet despite this
   orientation to the practitioner, there is still a substantial gap
   between scholars and practitioners, thus replicating within a more
   applied context the conventional theory/practice divide that exists in
   other fields. Those fields do, however, possess a variety of ideas and
   recommendations that could be used to bring scholarship on intelligence
   analysis closer to practice. If implemented, these ideas might help
   actualize the benefits of scholarship that are as yet still unrealized
   potential.},

Title = {Nuclear Weapons in Russian Foreign Policy: Patterns in Presidential
   Discourse 2000-2010},
Journal = {EUROPE-ASIA STUDIES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {64},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {495-519},
Abstract = {This essay is based on a close reading of speeches and other public
   statements made by Vladimir Putin and Dmitri Medvedev during their
   presidencies, covering the period 2000-2010. It argues that the pattern
   of presidential discourse reveals that both presidents have regarded
   Russia's nuclear weapons as primarily political rather than military
   instruments. Both Putin and Medvedev demonstrated a sustained desire to
   pursue strategic nuclear arms reductions through negotiations,
   particularly on a bilateral basis with the United States, and an
   interest in minimum nuclear deterrence. The shifts in position taken by
   both presidents on US plans for missile defence in particular reveal
   that they each attached as much, if not more, importance to Russia being
   regarded as an equal partner by the United States than to any strategic
   gains that might be achieved through preventing the deployment of an
   effective missile defence system.},

Title = {Transnational regulatory capture? An empirical examination of the
   transnational lobbying of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision},
Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {19},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {663-688},
Abstract = {Since the global financial crisis, scholars of international political
   economy (IPE) have increasingly relied on the concept of `regulatory
   capture' to explain the weakness of regulatory oversight and, hence,
   regulatory failures. Yet despite the widespread use of the concept of
   regulatory capture, its precise mechanisms are not well understood. This
   paper empirically investigates this hypothesis by examining one
   important institution of global financial governance that has been
   subjected to intense private sector lobbying at the transnational level:
   the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. Using extensive archival
   material as well as interviews with participants in the generation of
   the Basel II Capital Accord, I argue that while private sector lobbyists
   had unprecedented access to the regulatory policymaking process, this
   access did not always translate into influence. Furthermore, when
   influence was present, it sometimes had the effect of increasing
   regulatory stringency, rather than weakening regulation. As such, I
   argue that our understanding of the process of transnational policy
   formation would benefit from a more nuanced understanding of the
   contingency of private sector `influence' over the regulatory process,
   rather than the extensive, all-or-nothing depiction of regulatory
   `capture' that currently prevails within the IPE literature.},

Abstract = {The World Bank claims to be a ``knowledge bank,{''} but do its knowledge
   products influence development thinking, or is the Bank merely a
   proselytizer? The World Bank is a prolific publisher; for example, it
   has published more journal articles in economics than any university
   except Harvard. But what about their impact on development thinking?
   Using citation data from Google Scholar it is hard to discern more than
   a negligible impact for a great many Bank publications. However, a
   sizeable minority of its journal articles and books have been highly
   cited. Compared to leading research universities and other international
   institutions, the Bank's ranking in terms of widely-used citation-based
   indices is no lower than for its journal article counts. This suggests
   that the Bank's research does much more than proselytize.},

Abstract = {Because ethnographies report what is already known in some part of
   society, the warrant for the method is uniquely double. Each ethnography
   promises both positive and negative knowledge, a contribution to
   understanding the social logic that organizes some area of social life
   and a contribution to the sociology of ignorance. Those reported in this
   volume illustrate seven distinct warrants that hinge on morally charged
   forces blocking the dissemination of knowledge about locally known
   social realities. In addition, running through many of the studies is a
   focus on an amoral warrant. Ethnographies are distinctively suited for
   studying the ubiquitous, naturally occurring hiding that is necessarily
   part of social expression, or how things are hidden in the foundations
   of the social world.},

Title = {The Justiciability of Housing Rights: From Argument to Practice},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS PRACTICE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {4},
Number = {2},
Pages = {213-232},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Drawing from critical legal studies, this paper questions the idea of a
   generic argument for the justiciability of economic, social and cultural
   (ESC) rights. Justiciability is defined as the potential for a legal
   claim to be addressed by courts. The argument for the justiciability of
   ESC rights implies that courts can complement the executive and
   legislative powers in improving living standards. The author examines
   this presumption in the case of current housing rights issues in
   Cameroon.
   Firstly, the author describes how a generic argument for the
   justiciability of ESC rights is formulated within the international
   human rights movement. This argument is based upon the idea of a viable
   state which can be held accountable for poor living standards. Secondly,
   the author explains how many housing rights issues in Cameroon can be
   explained by the non-viability of the state with regard to the
   management of housing because of complex factors over a long period of
   time. These factors are systemic and pervasive, and are not adequately
   taken into account by the generic discourse on the justiciability of ESC
   rights. Therefore, the author argues that a critical analysis of
   justiciability can be more relevant in the context of Cameroon. This
   argument goes beyond strict legalization and embraces ESC rights as part
   of a more holistic development enterprise. The author focuses on the
   rhetoric of human rights. He does not deny the possibility that the
   justiciability of ESC rights can be successful, but does not assess the
   conditions for this success here.},

   from the survey to explore the determinants of MEPs' policy preferences
   and, more specifically, whether MEPs from recent enlargement states
   continue to differ from those of longer-standing EU Member States. The
   findings here indicate that `enlargement' MEPs remain somewhat farther
   to the right, but are no longer more cautious about integration. The
   results also reinforce the importance of ideology, even more than
   nationality, as a factor underpinning MEPs' political attitudes.},

Abstract = {Old-age income protection is provided in wealthy democracies by publicly
   funded defined-benefit pensions. Budgetary challenges have forced policy
   makers to consider private alternatives to these traditional systems. I
   consider the shortcomings of private saving arrangements in duplicating
   the advantages of public pensions. Some shortcomings can be overcome by
   introducing compulsory elements into private saving plans. Worker
   contributions into such plans could be mandatory; some or all worker
   accumulations in the plans could be converted to annuities at
   retirement; and workers' investment choices could be narrowly
   circumscribed. These restrictions do not eliminate the biggest weakness
   of private saving plans. Fluctuations in asset prices make it hard even
   for well-informed savers to select an affordable saving rate and an
   investment strategy that will assure decent income in old age. Public
   pension systems partly insulate workers against economic and financial
   market risks by sharing those risks broadly across workers, retirees,
   and taxpayers in multiple generations.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Pages = {83-105},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Empirical work with those most affected by transitional justice, namely
   victims of violations and populations of states in transition, remains
   rare. Here, an effort is made to use ethnographic research methods to
   understand the expectations and needs of transition of victims of
   serious crimes committed during Timor-Leste's conflict, as well as the
   extent to which these needs have been met by the decade of transitional
   justice process undertaken in the country. The study is an attempt to
   evaluate the success or otherwise of transitional justice process on the
   terms of victims. The process in Timor-Leste was led by the Commission
   for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation (CAVR), which articulated a
   claim that is standard for such bodies: that its truth-telling role
   would be healing for victims. This study suggests that CAVR was not well
   known by victims and had little impact on their lives. Victims emphasize
   the need for economic support and appropriate treatment of the missing
   and the dead. They share the views of Timor-Leste's leadership that
   prosecutorial justice is not a priority. The most successful mechanism
   in terms of victim comprehension and appreciation has been the
   valorization programme, which has seen veterans of the liberation
   struggle awarded medals, compensation payments and pensions. The
   victim-centred evaluation discussed here offers a contextualized measure
   of the quality of transitional justice process based not on global
   practice and international prescription but on the needs of those most
   impacted by violence.},

Abstract = {The changes in the European financial architecture in the aftermath of
   the 2008 global financial crisis have highlighted the tension between
   the need for greater centralization of financial regulation at the EU
   level and the reluctance of some Member States to give up national
   regulatory autonomy. This article analyses the attitudes of new EU
   Member States toward the EU financial regulatory reforms. It
   investigates whether the extent of foreign ownership in the domestic
   financial sector, Euroscepticism, government support for deregulation
   and recent experiences of a severe financial crisis have an impact on
   countries' reservations. According to the results of the analysis, the
   higher the foreign ownership of a country's financial sector, the more
   reservations it expresses. The Eurosceptic attitude of the political
   parties in government matters as well. The more the governing political
   parties are opposed to EU integration in general, the more reservations
   one finds in a country's official position on the new EU financial
   architecture.},

Abstract = {The European Employment Strategy (EES) emerged in the early 1990s under
   the influence of an acute rise in unemployment and the introduction of
   economic and monetary union (EMU). Its purpose is to foster convergence
   towards lower unemployment and higher employment. This article considers
   these outcomes over a longer time frame and in a broader geographical
   context than previous studies have done. Overall, outcomes in the EU-15
   improved and converged since the introduction of EES. Comparisons
   suggest that these developments do not merely reflect long-term or
   international trends. The recent crisis, with deteriorating and
   divergent outcomes, might signal the start of a new EES cycle.},

Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {17},
Number = {3},
Pages = {339-360},
Abstract = {This article defends three ethical arguments against emissions trading.
   The first argument alleges that emissions trading is morally
   objectionable, because it `commodifies' the atmosphere. The second
   argument involves various objections to attaching prices to units of
   emissions - loosely speaking, the objection is to pricing that which is
   priceless or should not be priced. The third argument turns on the idea
   that if a large cut in emissions is to be made by society overall,
   everyone should `do their bit' by making a particular kind of sacrifice
   rather than paying others to do it instead. Some general conclusions
   concern the limitations of confining the analysis to idealised emissions
   trading, the difficulty in separating `economistic' thinking about
   policy delivery from policy choice and the need to focus questions of
   justice on consumers rather than on producers.},

Abstract = {This article examines masculinities in relation to the New Zealand
   police force Community Policing Pilot Program in Timor-Leste (East
   Timor). We find that despite calls for less militarized, more
   community-centered approaches to security sector reform, various forms
   of militarized masculinities persisted within the culture of the New
   Zealand Police during its international mission. In doing so, we not
   only complicate singular representations of militarized masculinity, but
   also challenge accounts that see masculinity as a monolithic negative,
   violent construct that is engaged with in only problematic ways.},

Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {17},
Number = {5},
Pages = {633-656},
Abstract = {Ordoliberalism is the theory behind the German social market economy.
   Its theoretical stance developed in the context of the economic crisis
   and political turmoil of the Weimar Republic in the late 1920s. It is
   premised on the strong state as the locus of liberal governance, and
   holds that economic freedom derives from political authority. In the
   context of the crisis of neoliberal political economy and austerity, and
   debates about the resurgence of the state vis-a-vis the economy, the
   article introduces the ordoliberal argument that the free economy
   presupposes the exercise of strong state authority, and that economic
   liberty is a practice of liberal governance. This practice is
   fundamentally one of social policy to secure the sociological and
   ethical preconditions of free markets. The study of ordoliberalism
   brings to the fore a tradition of a state-centric neoliberalism, one
   that says that economic freedom is ordered freedom, one that argues that
   the strong state is the political form of free markets, and one that
   conceives of competition and enterprise as a political task.},

   Failure},

Abstract = {This article explains how flawed intelligence assessments of Iraq's
   aluminum tubes became ` Exhibit A' in the Bush administration's case for
   the Iraq War. The assessments seem to have begun as a consequence of a
   debate within the administration over US Iraq policy in early 2001. The
   neoconservatives wanted intelligence that would help them argue for
   regime-change. A WINPAC ` Red Team' analyst analyzed the tubes using the
   same methodology as 1976' s infamous Team B panel, whichskewed
   intelligence to support neoconservative policies. The Red Team analyst
   erroneously concluded the tubes were for a nuclear program thus
   countering assessments that they had a non-nuclear purpose. After the
   attacks of September 11 and President Bush's embrace of regimechange,
   the Red Team tubes assessment began to become the official position of
   the Intelligence Community. In September 2002, the President cited the
   assessment publicly, forcing the Intelligence Community to adopt it as
   the majority position in the Iraq NIE. ` Exhibit A' in the case for war
   was thus the product of a Red Team and, as such, was essentially
   propaganda masquerading as intelligence.},

Abstract = {Nascent democracies usually adopt measures of transitional justice to
   deal with the legacies of undemocratic regimes. This article examines
   one of the most comprehensive programmes of transitional justice which
   has been implemented in the Czech Republic since 1990. Based on a survey
   conducted in 2010, 10 policies are assessed by means of descriptive
   statistics, and by examining their effect on the perception of justice,
   truth and reconciliation. Property restitution is viewed as the most
   successful policy for dealing with the past; it contributes to the
   positive perception of both justice and truth but it undermines the
   perception of reconciliation.},

Abstract = {From 1934, Britain expanded its military and naval intelligence agencies
   against Japan. At the outbreak of war in Europe, they, and most of their
   personnel, were moved from Hong Kong to Singapore, and joined into an
   interservice organization, the Far East Combined Bureau. Much of the
   evidence about the Far East Combined Bureau is lost, but the surviving
   record illustrates what intelligence was available to decision-makers in
   Singapore during 1940-41, thus illuminating every debate about this
   disaster. Even more: it enables a reconceptualization of the
   relationship between intelligence and the outbreak of the Pacific War as
   a whole.},

   least 148 were injured in racist and neo-Nazi attacks in 2011 in Russia.
   Although a decline on 2007 (when 89 people were killed and at least 618
   injured), the figure remains worryingly high. These people, as well as
   many others who are not included in these statistics, are victims of
   Russia's violent geographies of ethnic relations. Through research
   conducted over the course of two years in 2008 and 2009, supplemented by
   an analysis of research conduced by NGOs and independent researchers, I
   document post-Soviet ethnic relations in Stavropol'skii Krai.},

Abstract = {This essay compares the role of the social networking sites, Facebook in
   Finland and Vkontakte in Russia, in organising civic activism. It is
   based on data collected about two successful campaigns mobilised by
   local residents against urban building projects in St Petersburg and
   Helsinki in 2009. Though in both cities these sites were important
   channels for transmitting information and organising and coordinating
   the campaigns, their role was clearly limited in terms of impartial,
   democratic discussion of the issue of common concern: the sites were
   rather used to build and reinforce emerging collective identities and to
   create consensus within the movement. In contrast to the situation in
   Helsinki, Vkontakte also had a central role in creating and maintaining
   ties between formerly isolated campaigns against building projects
   elsewhere in St Petersburg, thereby helping to build a `network of
   grassroots resistance' in the city.},

Booktitle = {CHINESE PERSPECTIVES ON GLOBALIZATION AND AUTONOMY},
Series = {Issues in Contemporary Chinese Thought and Culture},
Year = {2012},

Abstract = {There are two approaches to study the cultural implications of
   globalization on national interests, one ontological and the other
   instrumental rationality. According to the instrumental rationality
   approach, national cultural factors play roles in national interests at
   three levels. Firstly, culture serves as the foundation for resisting
   cultural hegemony. Secondly, the influence of culture is basically part
   of the self-realization of the big powers in the world. Thirdly,
   political culture turns out to be the basic engine to build national
   interests. China is a big country with a long cultural history. To
   fulfill its national interests at the three levels, it should lift
   itself out of the national nihilism. In other words, it should face up
   to the cultural modernization.
   In the era of globalization, the international relations have offered
   China many strategic opportunities to rise but also posed many
   challenges to China. To realize the fixed strategic goals and basic
   national interests, China needs to come up with approaches politically,
   economically, militarily and culturally. The article focuses on the
   cultural approach to deal with how to fulfill the national interests and
   the problems concerned.},

Abstract = {This article examines the link between oil abundance and regime
   durability by providing insight into how and why oil-rich leaders use
   elections to maintain power. Using data from presidential elections in
   Central Asia, the article argues that oil-rich leaders are better able
   to manipulate their economies in the run-up to elections than their
   resource-poor counterparts. Oil-rich leaders use oil profits to increase
   pre-electoral spending to increase popular support, to deter potential
   opposition and to secure elite loyalty. Such electorally timed increases
   in spending help oil-rich leaders increase their re-election prospects
   and ensure their continued control over their countries' resources.},

Abstract = {This essay analyses Chechen-related suicide attacks, locating them
   within the historical and political context of the anti-Russian
   insurgency in the North Caucasus and the different factions of the
   anti-Russian armed resistance movement in the period between the first
   and second Russo-Chechen wars. The core of the essay is an analysis of
   the different character of two waves of suicide operations, (2000-2002)
   and (2002-2004). The first wave was linked to nominally Islamist groups,
   whereas the second set of attacks were linked to Operation Boomerang
   devised by Shamil Basaev. Finally, the essay considers other attacks
   that do not fit into either of these two waves of terrorism.},

Journal = {ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {639},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Despite the popularity of diversity management, there is little
   consensus on how to design diversity practices that work. In this
   article, the author provides an inside look into one type of diversity
   practice: diversity recruitment. Drawing on qualitative evidence from
   hiring in elite law firms, investment banks, and management consulting
   firms, the author analyzes what diversity recruitment looks like in
   these firms in theory and in practice. The author finds that although
   these firms tend to have the ingredients for success on paper, in
   practice the presence of structural and status divides between those
   responsible for overseeing diversity recruitment and those making hiring
   decisions, alongside widespread cultural beliefs among decision-makers
   that diversity is not a valid criterion of evaluation, stymies firms'
   efforts to diversify. The author's findings highlight that to be
   successful in translating diversity programs into results, those charged
   with overseeing diversity programs need not only formal organizational
   authority but also sufficient informal power and status to wield
   influence.},

Title = {Checking the Pulse of Diversity among Health Care Professionals: An
   Analysis of West Coast Hospitals},
Journal = {ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {639},
Pages = {236-257},

Abstract = {What factors are associated with variation in the racial/ethnic
   composition of hospital health care professionals? Institutional
   theories suggest that organizations react to external environmental and
   internal structural pressures for the racial/ethnic integration of
   workers. Using an institutional framework, we bring to bear new insight
   into how hospitals respond to such pressure for diversity. Models
   estimated with original data from 328 U.S. West Coast hospitals provide
   evidence that establishment size and a hospital's minority patient base
   promote diversity among health care professionals. The state legal
   environment is also associated with the racial/ethnic composition of
   professional hospital workers, indicating the importance of fair
   employment laws and court decisions in signaling expectations about
   workplace diversity. Last, the findings show that factors within
   hospitals' competitive and internal environments have positive
   consequences for diversity among health care professionals. We discuss
   implications for our findings, especially in the context of health care
   worker shortages and ongoing health care reform.},

Abstract = {Many Western researchers have hailed blogs of politicians as new,
   interactive and `inherently democratic' tools of political
   communication. Yet, as this essay illustrates, blogs can be of
   comparatively even greater appeal to politicians in semi-authoritarian
   political contexts. In Russia, 29 out of 83 regional leaders (roughly
   35\%) were keeping a weblog in May 2010. This essay provides a
   comprehensive content analysis of all governors' blogs and,
   subsequently, fleshes out a typology of three characteristic types. It
   is argued that politicians' blogs are playing a far greater role in
   generating legitimacy for the Russian political system than they do in
   democracies, because the semi-authoritarian Russian system lacks other
   mechanisms which generate (input) legitimacy in developed democracies,
   such as highly competitive elections.},

Abstract = {Responses to Mozambique's 1976-1992 civil war and its multiple legacies
   have taken place in different social and political contexts over time.
   This article analyses responses developed during wartime and in the
   postwar context in Gorongosa, a district in the centre of Mozambique.
   Mainstream transitional justice literature has tended to ground analysis
   in linear temporalities, assuming that peace agreements or military
   defeats are the starting point of transitions and that justice and
   healing interventions with predefined lifespans transform societies.
   This article argues that indigenous understandings and practices of
   justice and healing are constituted by multiple temporalities that blend
   present, past and future in contingent and contested ways and on an
   ongoing basis. Culturally effective responses to wartime violations both
   shift and take prewar, wartime and postwar temporalities into account.
   Analysis based on recognition of multiple temporalities allows for a
   comprehensive understanding of the continuities and changes in the
   meanings of justice and healing. This type of analysis also reveals that
   from a cultural perspective, transitional justice is better interpreted
   as an open-ended process in that nobody can predict the lifespan of
   indigenous processes that address violations committed during major
   armed conflicts.},

   Strategies or Cultural Arrangements?},
Journal = {ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {643},
Pages = {106-133},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The authors use the Migration between Africa and Europe (MAFE) project
   data to examine the incidence and duration of child-parent separations
   and the determinants of child-parent reunification among Senegalese
   migrants. Their findings indicate that approximately one-sixth of the
   Senegalese children in the sample were separated from their parents due
   to parental migration to Europe. These separations are relatively long,
   especially if the absent parent is the father. Reunification of
   Senegalese migrant parents with their children is infrequent, both in
   Senegal and in Europe. However, the location where reunification occurs
   is important, as it is associated with markedly different family types.
   Parents who end separations by returning to Senegal belong to families
   that clearly depart from the Western nuclear model, whereas Senegalese
   families in which parents decided to bring their children to Europe are
   closer to Western family arrangements.},

Abstract = {In this article, the authors investigate the short-run educational
   expectations and long-term educational aspirations of the children of
   immigrants living in Italy and attending eighth grade. The authors look
   at educational ambition, both as a predictor of educational choice and
   as a measure of social integration. They consider both secondary-school
   track and university goals. Data come from the ITAGEN2 survey
   (2005-2006). First, the authors analyze the relationship of short-run
   expectations and long-term aspirations to structural (e.g., migration
   status and country of origin) and social (e.g., family socioeconomic
   status and friendship ties) conditions. The latter seem to be
   determinants of both expectations and aspirations, but long-term
   educational aspirations are not associated with migration status.
   Second, the authors investigate the relevance of context in delineating
   educational attitudes. The authors performed a multilevel analysis
   including both individual- and school-level variables. Their results
   show that attending a school where most of the Italian pupils have high
   educational expectations may lead children of immigrants to enhance
   their own aspirations.},

Abstract = {The Greensboro Truth and Reconciliation Commission (GTRC) was a
   grassroots initiative with no state sanction, organized and supported
   solely by civil society. Its purpose was to discover and disseminate the
   truth about a racially motivated shooting by members of the Ku Klux Klan
   in 1979. This article asks whether such an initiative can succeed in
   seeking the truth in the same way that a formal transitional justice
   measure would. It reviews how the GTRC originated from civil society,
   how it was funded and its truth-seeking mandate, and presents data from
   qualitative interviews with victims of the shooting who participated in
   the GTRC. The article demonstrates how the GTRC faced significant
   obstacles to truth seeking, including lack of participation from many
   perpetrators, local government and law enforcement and lack of
   engagement from a wider segment of Greensboro. Nonetheless, the GTRC
   stands as an example of participatory democracy and of how civil society
   can accomplish truth seeking despite government resistance.},

Abstract = {Most gunshot victims do not die. In some estimates, 80 percent live to
   see another day. Yet social scientists continue to focus on gun
   homicide. What happens to individuals who get shot and survive? How do
   they experience life after the shooting? This article examines how
   gunshot injuries transform the lives of victims. In practical ways,
   gunshot injuries complicate sleeping, eating, working, and other
   previously taken-for-granted activities. These disruptions also have
   much larger existential significance to victims. Indeed, daily
   experiences with a wounded body become subjective reminders that
   individuals are no longer who they used to be. Ironically, in some
   interactions, being wounded becomes attractive and advantageous to
   victims. Together, these themes illustrate the need for more sustained
   ethnographic work on the foreground of violent crime victimization.},

   Association In this paper, I explore one way of thinking about political
   community. Drawing on Jean-Luc Nancys idea of community, I suggest that
   community is not a full circle, but an open-ended line. Thinking
   community-as-a-line is to shift our focus from the completed pictures of
   community to the inception of community. In this way of thinking,
   community is a shared mode of being. I argue that at the heart of
   sharing lies translation-communication or translation space where one
   (singularity) is perpetually ingrained in others (plurality). The
   subject constantly emerges in relation to others in translation space. I
   argue that looking at community as a line is a way to avoid the statist
   boundary, the subject of which is situated either inside or outside. I
   further argue that the elusive subject in translation space engages in
   politics through escape.},

Journal = {INTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {27},

Pages = {669-688},
Abstract = {There are considerable concerns about public perceptions of intelligence
   stemming directly from the highly politicized nature of intelligence
   estimates in the run-up to the US-UK invasion of Iraq in 2003. In this
   article we use a new public attitudes dataset to provide the first ever
   analysis of British public confidence in MI6 and Government use of
   intelligence. The article demonstrates that the public have relatively
   high confidence in the intelligence produced by MI6 but are extremely
   sceptical about how the Government will present that intelligence. Using
   an ordered logit model this article then examines the factors that
   influence public perceptions of both intelligence and Government,
   finding that women are a lot less confident in both the intelligence
   services and government presentation of intelligence than men,
   suggesting that this might help explain gender differences in support
   for military action. The study also demonstrates that party identifiers
   and Catholics have very low confidence in the intelligence produced by
   MI6. The study shows that public confidence in both government and
   intelligence has a strong effect on support for preventive military
   action against terror camps, suggesting that the intelligence agencies
   need to avoid being contaminated by political agendas as much as
   possible if the intelligence case for future military actions is to be
   supported by the public.},

Abstract = {The World Trade Organization (WTO) is one of the most judicialized
   dispute settlement systems in international politics. While a general
   appreciation has developed that the system has worked quite well,
   research has not paid sufficient attention to the weakest actors in the
   system. This paper addresses the puzzle of missing cases of
   least-developed countries initiating WTO dispute settlement procedures.
   It challenges the existing literature on developing countries in WTO
   dispute settlement which predominantly focuses on legal capacity and
   economic interests. The paper provides an argument that the small
   universe of `actionable cases', the option of free riding and the
   assessment of the perceived opportunity costs related to other foreign
   policy priorities better explain the absence of cases. In addition (and
   somewhat counterintuitively), we argue that the absence of cases is not
   necessarily bad news and shows how the weakest actors can use the
   dispute settlement system in a `lighter version' or in indirect ways.
   The argument is empirically assessed by conducting a case study on four
   West African cotton-producing countries (C4) and their involvement in
   dispute settlement.},

Abstract = {The label `poor governance' throws together real evils such as
   corruption and rent-seeking with a new group of alleged evils which are
   actually good for development, including a role for the state in the
   economy and support for domestic capital. Successful development
   policies of Europe in the late nineteenth century and the Asian Tigers
   and Brazil in the second half of the twentieth century are now labelled
   as `poor governance.' This is what Ha-Joon Chang described as `kicking
   away the ladder' by which rich countries climbed to development, so that
   today's poor countries cannot follow. Mozambique is cited as an example
   of how the good governance rhetoric has been misused to retard
   development and poverty reduction.},

   explores the existence of Anglo-Arab secret liaison and cooperation in
   instituting anticommunist measures in the early ColdWar. It shows that
   owing to their concern about a war against the Soviet Union, the placing
   of a British security/police adviser in specific countries was the
   preferred method by Britain for checking and combatting communism in the
   Middle East. It argues that the development of the `anti-communist
   triangle' (the security liaison between Lebanon, Iraq and Jordan) was
   largely influenced by British concern about the expansion of communist
   influence. Moreover, the expansion of British influence in the region
   also converged with the demands from Middle Eastern countries for a
   British expert in anti-communist measures. The article implies the
   importance of the role of secret liaison in historical enquiries.},

Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},

Pages = {562-585},
Abstract = {France's plan de soutien bancaire was in many ways similar to other
   national rescue plans that were adopted in the context of the global
   financial crisis. Yet, the French plan stands out for its remarkably
   collective and conflict-free nature. In order to account for this
   distinctiveness, we highlight the role of an informal consortium among
   public and private actors in the French financial establishment. We
   argue that the bank support plan should be viewed as a gift that members
   of the same elite group extended to each other in exchange for future,
   albeit still indeterminate, counter-gifts. Thus, the presidential
   rhetoric of `rupture', a hallmark of Nicolas Sarkozy's mandate
   (2007-2012), should not be taken at face value. Behind the scenes, a
   closed decision-making process brought together and strengthened a small
   group of high-powered public officials and bankers. The role of this
   consortium in shaping the bank rescue plan underscores its importance in
   France's evolving model of capitalism.},

Abstract = {In post-Soviet Russia, changing migration patterns have led to the
   formation of Muslim communities in new regions, and to increased
   contacts between Russian and foreign Muslims. This article examines two
   Russian regions, Belgorod Oblast' and the Republic of Adygeya, in which
   such post-Soviet mobility is causing political conflicts over the
   governance and rights of Muslim communities. In Belgorod, regional
   authorities have blocked construction of a mosque for a new Muslim
   community. In Adygeya, authorities are seeking to restrict foreign
   influences on local Muslims. In both regions, officials still operate on
   the outdated Soviet assumption that they can contain the mobility of
   Islam.},

Abstract = {Mountainous Karabakh-an Armenian-populated area within Elizavetpol'
   guberniya with a Turkic majority-became a source of dispute between
   Armenia and Azerbaijan after the collapse of the Russian Empire. During
   the Soviet conquest of the region, the Bolshevik Party used the issue of
   Karabakh to promote its agenda by supporting at times the claims of its
   ally Azerbaijan, or those of Armenia when it needed to facilitate the
   capture of Zangezur. By 1921, when the Sovietisation of the region was
   complete, the Karabakh issue was still unresolved. The solution adopted
   was to leave Karabakh under Azerbaijani control on condition that it had
   autonomous status, but this was a solution that satisfied neither side.},

Volume = {14},

Pages = {470-488},
Abstract = {Undergirded by the notion of the manly state, feminist works on military
   masculinities have tended to focus on prerogative practices of
   soldiering. Yet the significance of the military uniform can only be
   grasped if read against a performative concept of the gentlemanly state,
   emphasizing that the abstraction from violence is constitutive to
   military masculinities. Thus the powerful function of soldierly costume
   can be understood as one of demarcating boundaries of gentlemanly
   statehood: dressed in military attire, the soldier is authorized to use
   civilized force. Based on this conceptual argument, I trace the
   uniform's imperial reconfigurations, before describing the manifold
   historical strands of meaning that have been woven into its contemporary
   fabric in Thailand. Exploring the gentlemanly connotations attached to
   the soldiers' costume by girls in Thailand's southern provinces, I
   moreover argue that its favourable contours have to be read in light of
   military counterinsurgency practices that have intensified the
   vestimentary encoding of gendered, religious and ethnic difference. In
   this context, the military uniform has been attached to Thai notions of
   gentlemanly modernity, encompassing gentlemanly manners, light skin as
   well as fashionable progress. In conclusion I argue for broadening the
   feminist research agenda towards practices of gentlemanly soldiering
   that work to codify and re-define its violent Other.},

Abstract = {The human rights movement in Argentina has remained steadfast in its
   demand for retributive justice in addressing the legacies of the
   Argentine military dictatorship (1976-1983), which disappeared up to
   30,000 citizens. One of the most agonizing issues has been the need to
   locate kidnapped children of the disappeared in the custody of members
   of the armed forces and the efforts to reunite them with their
   biological families by a human rights organization, Grandmothers of the
   Plaza de Mayo. The process of `restitution' by which their biological
   identities are restored to them has generated resistance among some of
   the children, who reject the notion that they are victims of a crime.
   Through several case studies, this article examines how the everyday
   lives and interpersonal familial relationships of these children have
   become battlegrounds for transitional justice.},

   Justice},

Abstract = {`Tradition' plays a central role in emerging grassroots transitional
   justice (TJ) processes, furnishing a familiar framework for the
   unfamiliar process of learning to live together again after conflict.
   `Tradition,' in its guise as a canon of autochthonous praxis, presents
   itself as all but essential in structuring community-level processes.
   This article examines three TJ processes in Sub-Saharan Africa, each of
   which illustrates a distinct deployment of `tradition' in grassroots TJ.
   In Rwanda, discourses of `tradition' disguise the exercise of state
   authority in the gacaca courts. In Sierra Leone, Fambul Tok enables
   reconciliation processes by assembling a diversity of local
   consociational leaders, `traditional' and novel. In Zimbabwe, Tree of
   Life eschews a focus on `traditional' authority in favor of a flexibly
   `atraditional' approach that encourages collaboration with emergent,
   locally legitimate leadership.},

Abstract = {Six years into Liberia's transition from war to peace, the Truth and
   Reconciliation Commission (TRC) released its final report. The
   recommendations of the report are far-reaching and radical inasmuch as
   they reach into the highest levels of Liberia's political elites. Not
   surprisingly, reactions to the report have been mixed. On the one hand,
   ordinary Liberians are delighted that the report named those who bear
   the greatest responsibility for the conflict and are determined to see
   its implementation. On the other, former perpetrators - many of whom are
   now part of the political elites, the legislature and the judiciary -
   have condemned the report and want it withdrawn. Given their ability to
   obstruct prosecutions, the likelihood that the recommendations of the
   TRC will be implemented appears to be slim. Instead of promoting
   reconciliation, therefore, the report has only reemphasized the sour
   relationship between victims and perpetrators: victims' pleas for
   recognition and acknowledgement have been repeatedly ignored, while
   former perpetrators have used the TRC public hearings to reinvent
   themselves for political gains. Hence, for as long as Liberia's postwar
   political elites are composed primarily of former perpetrators, as
   emphasized by the recent elections in Liberia, implementation of the TRC
   recommendations is unlikely.},

Abstract = {The popular media, both Russian and Western, portray legal nihilism-at
   its core, a lack of respect for law-as a serious problem for Russia.
   This article uses data collected in 2004 and 2006 as part of the Russian
   Longitudinal Monitoring Study of the Higher School of Economics to
   examine the incidence of legal nihilism in Russia and to investigate who
   the legal nihilists are and what characteristics tend to be associated
   with legal nihilism. The effects of a number of characteristics,
   including political participation, political attitudes, the role of
   material and emotional well-being, and age, are analyzed.},

Abstract = {Three types of internal tensions have characterized the process of
   European integration. They are not new, but are exacerbated by factors
   such as globalization, enlargement, increased diversity of views and
   interests. The first one is the tension between law and politics. Legal
   instruments have been the main tool of integration, but politics come
   back with a vengeance as democratic practices are challenged by
   regulatory regimes and institutions. The second one is the alternative
   between the persistence of an international organization regime or the
   creation of a federation. This unresolved and lasting issue takes
   dramatic tones with the euro crisis. The third one relates to the
   growing gap between elites and peoples.},

Year = {2012},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Pages = {119-129},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This essay explores the rise and decline of regulatory independence in
   Turkey. Framing the ongoing process of limiting independence of these
   agencies as the politics of de-delegation, it raises the question of why
   Turkish regulatory agencies have become subject to increasing political
   intervention. Contending that institutional legacies and mounting
   illiberal predispositions of the Turkish state facilitate the politics
   of de-delegation, the essay focuses on centralization, executive
   discretion, and politicization of bureaucracy as the major institutional
   legacies. Then it briefly discusses formal and informal mechanisms of
   political intervention, which have impaired the independence of the
   regulatory agencies.},

Title = {There is life after the Commission: An empirical analysis of private
   interest representation by former EU-commissioners, 1981-2009},
Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Pages = {59-80},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Our sample includes 92 former EU commissioners who left the seven
   Commissions serving from 1981 to 2009. We find that 36 (39\%) became
   private interest representatives after leaving the Commission-14 with
   registered institutions, 22 with non-registered institutions. Our probit
   analysis shows that an ex-commissioner is significantly more likely to
   turn lobbyist if he or she is still young and has been in charge of
   competition, the internal market, industry or taxation. At the 10\%
   level of significance, the probability is lower if the commissioner has
   been proposed by a left wing government, has stepped down after the
   introduction of the code of conduct (1999) or has retired from the
   Delors I Commission, and the probability is higher for commissioners
   from central Europe. The descriptive statistics reveal in addition that
   the share of private interest representatives in all ex-commissioners is
   largest for Portuguese, Austrian, Bulgarian and Maltese commissioners
   and zero for Scandinavians. With regard to the commissioners' training,
   48\% of the lawyers but only 35\% of the economists have become
   lobbyists. Commissioners who have turned private interest
   representatives have on average stayed somewhat longer (6.3 years) with
   the Commission than the others (5.5 years). Registered lobbyism is
   significantly more likely than non-registered lobbyism if the
   ex-commissioner is a lawyer, has been in charge of competition, the
   internal market, industry or taxation and-at the 10\% level-has been
   proposed by a left wing government.},

Abstract = {The development of prediction and forecasting in the social sciences
   over the past century and more is closely linked with developments in
   Russia. The Soviet collapse undermined confidence in predictive
   capabilities, and scenario planning emerged as the dominant
   future-oriented methodology in area studies, including the study of
   Russia. Scenarists anticipate multiple futures rather than predicting
   one. The approach is too rarely critiqued. Building on an account of
   Russia-related forecasting in the twentieth century, analysis of two
   decades of scenarios reveals uniform accounts which downplay the
   insights of experts and of social science theory alike.},

Journal = {EUROPE-ASIA STUDIES},

Volume = {64},
Number = {4},
Pages = {715-735},
Abstract = {The article examines the harnessing of the contemporary Russian diaspora
   in certain domains of Russia's international relations. It looks
   specifically at Russian officialdom's ambivalent efforts at developing
   and engaging with a global network of state-backed diaspora
   associations, especially as instruments of cultural outreach. The focus
   is on the relatively recent implementation of this strategy in the West.
   The first half of the article discusses the ideological ambiguities of
   this project in general terms; the second examines how it plays itself
   out in practice, on the example of the United Kingdom. The article
   suggests that analysing the ambiguities established in the relationship
   between state and diasporic structures in this context is vital to
   understanding the current role of the Russian state in the politics of
   Russian diasporisation.},

Abstract = {Following the collapse of European state socialism, economists quickly
   identified a central role for foreign direct investment and Western
   multinational corporations in moving the region towards a market
   economy. Knowledge transfers and capital infusions would allow former
   state-owned enterprises to take on market-economic characteristics and
   therefore engage more fully in the global economy. This article examines
   the post-socialist management experience of international joint ventures
   (IJVs) through a study of the critical events in the life of a
   German-Czech IJV. The story is told from the local managers' perspective
   and, drawing on the vocabulary of organisational identity, sense-making
   and sense-giving actions, we show how the IJV process is constrained and
   enacted by the post-socialist context.},

Title = {When rules started to rule: the IMF, neo-liberal economic ideas and
   economic policy change in Britain},
Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {19},
Number = {3},
Pages = {477-500},
Abstract = {This article reassesses the neo-liberal shift within British economic
   policy-making and the international political economy, focusing
   especially the role of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in the
   1960s. The IMF has always used the conditions attached to its lending to
   try and shape borrower's policy; here we explore the evolving content of
   that conditionality and the economic ideas underpinning it. Using
   recently released IMF records, as well as other archives, we argue that
   the negotiations between the IMF and the UK Government in the 1960s can
   be seen as part of the Fund's drive towards a crucial change from
   discretionary to rules-based approaches to macroeconomic policy making.
   This drive took place within a struggle over a specific policy
   instrument, domestic credit expansion (DCE), at that time regarded as an
   important measure of monetary policy. The article locates the IMF
   advocacy of DCE within an attempt by the Fund to constrain discretionary
   policy-making through increasingly specific and binding rules. In
   response, UK Government officials began to pre-empt and even deceive the
   Fund to avoid being tied down. Our analysis unpacks which neo-liberal
   economic ideas the Fund embraced, noting its rejection of monetarism. In
   the period charted here (1965-69), the rules-based regime remained
   compatible with Keynesianism. However, the UK Government's grudging
   acceptance of this approach provided a crucial condition of possibility
   for a significant qualitative shift in macroeconomic policy-making when
   rules later became infused with an increasingly neo-liberal character.},

Abstract = {Increasing women in state legislatures is associated with greater
   legislative support for social policies serving families with children.
   We examine whether the family friendly impact of women legislators
   extends to supporting family elders. We draw on a cross-sectional data
   set of the American states in conjunction with regression. We find that,
   controlling for prominent alternative factors shaping state policies,
   women's legislative presence exerts a strong positive influence on state
   elderly friendliness. Our results are more exploratory than definitive,
   but they suggest that states with more extensive legislative
   representation of women better meet the growing challenges of an aging
   population.},

Abstract = {How do Commission officials conceive the Commission's role in the
   European Union? Should the Commission be the government of Europe or the
   servant of Member States? Is there a third possibility that of
   institutional pragmatism, whereby Commission and Member States share
   authority? This article lays out jurisdictional options and role
   conceptions adopted by Commission officials, and estimates their
   relative incidence using a 2008 large-scale survey among Commission
   officials (N = 1,901). There is a plurality of views, though within
   relatively narrow parameters. In explaining variation, national
   background shapes views more than professional background.},

Abstract = {The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the
   Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) represent competing sets of
   international norms in Central Asia. The contestation between these sets
   of norms has not led to a complete polarisation between members of the
   two organisations, however. Instead, the OSCE has used a range of
   discursive tactics to reduce political contestation, downplaying some
   contested issues and seeking shared discourses on security threats. This
   article explores these tactics and suggests that these discursive shifts
   may eventually threaten the normative identity of the OSCE and lead to
   the acceptance of a more hybrid set of security-related norms in the
   region.},

   GENDERING THE INTERSECTIONS OF NEO-CONSERVATISM AND NEO-LIBERALISM},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL FEMINIST JOURNAL OF POLITICS},

Abstract = {This article analyses the US response under former President George W.
   Bush to the global HIV/AIDS epidemic at the intersection of
   neo-conservatism and neo-liberalism, highlighting the various ways their
   distinct gender logics collide to reproduce masculine privilege and
   gender inequalities on a global scale. The President's Emergency Plan
   for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) is the United States global HIV/AIDS policy and
   is the largest commitment made by any single nation for an international
   health project. My analysis is based on PEPFAR's `formal' policy texts,
   including its authorizing legislation, five-year strategic framework and
   specific policy directives for recipient organizations. In addition, I
   examine more `informal' texts like Congressional reports and
   Presidential speeches delivered by George W. Bush on various occasions.
   Drawing on a rich body of feminist ethnographic work in the fields of
   global governance, international political economy, organizational
   theory and sexuality and masculinity studies, the following article
   examines the various ways market-based norms and practices can
   legitimate the moral imperatives of neo-conservatism to promote
   `traditional' values and institutions in the global South as leading
   solutions to global problems and insecurities.},

Volume = {64},
Number = {7},
Pages = {1239-1270},
Abstract = {In 1959, Indriks Pinksis, Eduards Berklavs and Vilis Krumins. were among
   the prominent targets of Moscow's National Communist purge of supposed
   `bourgeois nationalists' operating within the leadership of the Latvian
   Communist Party. A decade earlier all three had been active leaders of
   the Latvian Komsomol. This article explores the Stalin years of the
   Latvian Komsomol, and argues that the Komsomol was only able to win an
   acceptable number of recruits when it abandoned attempts to recruit on
   the basis of wartime activity or class allegiance and focused on
   recruiting ethnic Latvians. However, this raised the same issues later
   faced by the National Communists: as membership was extended to those
   with a `doubtful' background, and the press played down `proletarian
   internationalism', Moscow took fright. In early 1953 the Latvian
   Komsomol experienced a purge similar in tone to that which would take
   place within the Latvian Communist Party more broadly in 1959.},

   fashion specified by globalization. It is, therefore, of great
   importance to carry out in-depth studies of the process of globalization
   and its features, and to accurately locate its special values and
   significance for the existence and development of mankind. Thus a clear
   consciousness about globalization may develop, which will help regulate

Pages = {223-240},
Abstract = {Students of international relations should seek to understand the ways
   in which power in international relations can be amplified by secrecy.
   Discussions of ` decision advantage' over rival states have explained
   information asymmetries and means for competitors to gain advantages by
   keeping secret their sources of information or the special insights they
   gain even from information that is widely available. The histories of
   war, diplomacy and intelligence illuminate such advantages, and also
   show various ways in which secrecy amplifies `action' advantages as well
   as `information' advantages. That amplification often seems to be
   accomplished by the same people and organizations, and this essay
   suggests the prime reason for this common institutional co- location of
   secret functions can be termed the `economy of secrecy'. The key to
   grasping this point is to set aside traditional and academic
   distinctions between knowledge and action, and information and
   implementation, when viewing the moves of sovereignties. Sovereign
   leaders opt to co- locate their secret activities when they judge it too
   risky (e. g. potentially expensive and dangerous) to distribute secret-
   information and secret-action functions around too many different
   offices. The handful of subordinates that receive these functions are
   what we now call ` intelligence agencies.' Finally, a firmer grasp of
   the economics of secrecy can improve oversight of secrets and the
   offices that deal with them.},

Abstract = {Much thought has been given of late to how national preferences impact
   upon European Union-level policy-making towards Russia and it is widely
   accepted that discrepancies in Member State attitudes can undermine
   consistent and effective multilateral policies. So far there has been no
   attempt to ascertain whether subregional groupings that exist inside the
   EU (which represent a potential in-between layer of policy-making
   between the bilateral and multilateral) are inclined or able to attempt
   to co-ordinate their positions on Russia. This article focuses on the
   Visegrad Group (VG), which would appear to be an obvious candidate, but
   actually has virtually no co-operation agenda vis-a-vis Russia (the
   other main groupings are the Benelux Economic Union, the Nordic Council
   and the Weimar Triangle). The article argues that it is difficult to
   accommodate Russia in the current VG foreign policy framework due to the
   focus on low politics and integration assistance. It also contends that
   limited capacity and intra-VG divergence on key aspects of relations
   with Russia mean that the VG is unlikely to expand its agenda so as to
   attempt more co-operation on Russia in the future.},

Abstract = {The abundant literature on the European Constitution has largely
   overlooked the role party politics played in the European Convention.
   This article fills this gap by analyzing transnational party groups: how
   they were organized and which purposes they served. It shows that they
   mattered, but in unexpected ways due to the particular set-up of the
   Convention. For instance, they helped to bring MEPs and MNPs closer to
   each other. Overall, the analysis contributes to a better understanding
   of how parties operate at the transnational level and helps to explain
   the way in which polity-building in the European Union's multi-level
   system takes place.},

   Association A post-liberal peace engages with the politics of hybridity
   emerging from a mixture of contextual and international social,
   political, economic, cultural, and historical dynamics of peace. It
   represents an attempt to escape liberal enclosure and distant
   administration as well as contextual forms of violence in post-conflict
   zonesfrom Bosnia Herzegovina to Afghanistan. Critical agency as a form
   of resistance aimed at liberation from the structures of conflict, and
   structural violencewherever they lierather than solely relying on
   external norms and capacity, is key. From this tension, a range of
   local, transversal, and transnational agencies can be uncovered in many
   peacebuilding or statebuilding contexts, which may resist, modify, or
   co-opt intervention in unexpected ways. A hybrid form of peace emerges
   from this agonistic process, which points to an understanding of
   peacebuilding-as-liberation. Rather than producing subjects, this
   enables subjects to produce peace.},

   negotiations? In contrast to societal explanations, this article
   develops a novel argument as to how the European Commission manages the

   preferences and theorizes the conditions under which the agent sets
   specific focal points and interacts strategically with principals and
   third parties. The argument is discussed with case study evidence drawn
   from the first trade agreement concluded and ratified since the EU
   Commission announced its new strategy in 2006: the EU-South Korea trade

Abstract = {In this article, the authors present an overview of the relationship
   between immigrant households and crime and violence, drawing on
   sociological and public health literature. They present a critique of
   popular culture perspectives on immigrant families and youth violence,
   showing that crime and violence outcomes are if anything better for
   youth in immigrant families than one would expect given the social
   disadvantages that many immigrant households find themselves living in.
   They examine the extent to which exposure to violence among immigrant
   youth is comparably lower than among nonimmigrants living in similar
   social contexts and the extent to which social control and social
   learning frameworks can account for the apparent lower prevalence of
   violence exposure among immigrant youth. Their analyses show a
   persistent lower rate of violence exposure for immigrant youth compared
   to similarly situated nonimmigrant youth-and that these differences are
   not meaningfully understood by observed social control or social
   learning mechanisms. The authors focus then on the apparent paradox of
   why youth living in immigrant households in relative disadvantage have
   lower violence exposure compared to nonimmigrants living in similar
   social contexts. The answers, they argue, can be viewed from an
   examination of the effects that living in poverty and underclass
   neighborhoods for generations has on nonimmigrants in American cities.},

Title = {Beliefs Underlying Eating Better and Moving More: Lessons Learned from
   Comparative Salient Belief Elicitations with Adults and Youths},
Journal = {ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {640},
Pages = {81-100},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The reasoned action approach has been used to identify the determinants
   of a behavior to be modified by social and behavioral interventions.
   Information on the specific beliefs underlying behavioral decisions is
   vital to intervention design. More attention is needed on the salient
   belief elicitation-a critical step in a theory-based formative research
   process. This article considers the methodological issues involved in
   conducting a salient belief elicitation with special attention to an
   elicitation that allows the comparison of results across several
   behaviors and priority groups. The author uses the behaviors underlying
   overweight and obesity as her central example. To support the
   development of interventions to improve cardiovascular health and to
   explore methods for a comparative analysis of salient belief
   elicitations, semistructured interviews were conducted with 243 adults
   from two rural and two urban worksites in Indiana and 344 students from
   three middle schools in rural Indiana. Content and frequency analyses
   identified the modal salient beliefs underlying several eating and
   physical activity behaviors. Illustrative results are presented, and
   recommendations for salient belief elicitation are discussed.},

   FOR WOMEN'S EMPOWERMENT},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL FEMINIST JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Pages = {389-407},
Abstract = {United Nations bodies and large private companies have recently entered
   into partnerships for women's empowerment in developing countries. Such
   public-private partnerships have not previously been the subject of
   feminist scrutiny. In this article I examine three partnerships, feeding
   into research exploring business influence on global governance gender
   policies. The article demonstrates how partnerships assert their
   legitimacy through a proposed mutually supporting relationship between
   women's empowerment and companies' economic gains, in contrast to a
   human rights-based approach to development. I show how UN - business
   partnerships for women's empowerment mobilize discourses, policies and
   governmental techniques to create alignments between business objectives
   and individual women's empowerment. Each woman is constituted as an ally
   of economic success by pursuing her education, increasing productivity
   and entrepreneurship. I argue that public-private partnerships for
   women's empowerment do not challenge the gendered structures of the
   global economy, though they may improve individual women's economic
   situation in the short term. The critical and emancipatory potential of
   empowerment is weakened by the imposed boundaries of neoliberal market
   criteria and their demands for economic effectiveness.},

Abstract = {The number of civilian casualties in Afghanistan has increased
   dramatically in recent years as the International Security Assistance
   Force (ISAF) has tried to put down the Taliban insurgency. Reports of
   civilian casualties are, however, frequently dismissed as being examples
   of Taliban propaganda or blamed on the actions of enemy fighters, while
   the tragic loss of civilians is rarely marked or even acknowledged
   within the dominant frames of war. At first glance, the fact that
   civilians are so easily expendable appears to be at odds with the
   humanitarian intentions underpinning the war. However, I argue that the
   rhetoric of humanitarianism operates to preclude Afghans from appearing
   as recognizable human beings, foreclosing the possibility that they
   possess a life worthy of protection. Drawing on the work of Judith
   Butler, I will trace the ways in which Afghans have been reduced to the
   status of absolute victims, denied the very essence of their humanity
   and therefore a publically grievable death. By effectively constructing
   them as the living-dead, existing in a state of abeyance, Afghans have
   been exposed to a deathly logic in which their lives are expendable in
   the quest to make them liveable once again.},

Abstract = {Since 1970, women have made substantial inroads into management jobs.
   But most women are in lower- and middle-management jobs; few are in
   top-management jobs. Human capital theory uses three individual-level
   variables to explain this vertical gender gap: women acquire fewer of
   the necessary educational credentials than men, women prefer different
   kinds of jobs than men, and women accumulate less of the required work
   experience than men. The authors argue that cultural schemas,
   specifically gender roles and gender norms, explain most
   individual-level differences between men and women and that when
   cultural factors are ignored, any observed effects of these factors can
   be dismissed as spurious. This analysis is based on data on nationally
   representative samples and the results of published research.},

Abstract = {Military engagement of insurgents risks destruction of religious
   monuments and historic structures, and political and economic
   instability that follows armed conflict enables looting of antiquities.
   In combination, threats to cultural structures and movable cultural
   patrimony compromise cultural security. This article explores the
   potential of the art market for open-source intelligence assessments of
   cultural security. A comparison of the market value of artifacts of
   different ethnic origins provides a measure of the risk of looting of
   cultural patrimony by geographic region. Intelligence assessments of the
   relative desirability of cultural artifacts by region of origin can
   inform strategic planning to mitigate looting in conflict zones and to
   alert security services to emerging threats of trafficking in cultural
   patrimony.},

Pages = {208-235},
Abstract = {This article discusses public sector reform in North America and Western
   Europe. The argument is made that recent comparative literatures have
   yet to adequately consider governments themselves, and how changes to
   their budgeting, operation, and collective bargaining structures have
   affected jobs and income inequality. Drawing on a range of recent OECD
   and trade union statistics, as well as qualitative studies, it is
   claimed that governments converged substantially over period 1990-2005,
   introducing fiscal austerity measure and making substantive changes to
   public sector management and operation through privatization,
   marketization, and public-private partnerships. These substantially
   recast public sector industrial relations and led to job loss, labour
   market segmentation, and declining public sector labour power. This is
   the first study to report on comparative changes and qualitative reforms
   to fiscal policies, public sector services, and public sector labour
   forces in 13 OECD countries between 1980-2005.},

Abstract = {Latin American regional governance today represents a conglomerate of
   commercial, political and trans-societal welfarist integration projects.
   In this overlapping and sometimes conflicting scenario what Latin
   Americanness should mean, and how integration projects should respond to
   current challenges of global political economy are being redefined. The
   focus of the paper is twofold: to better understand current regional
   transformations and to discuss what new developments mean for how we
   theorise non-European regionalism. Looking at the Bolivarian Alliance
   for the Americas and the Union of South American Nations we ask: How are
   we to understand regional agreements that are grounded in different
   systems of rules, alternative ideas and motivations that contest `open
   regionalism'? We argue that Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) and
   Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas (ALBA) represent different pathways
   to regional building, creating foundations for post-hegemonic and
   post-trade regional governance. We thus challenge New Regionalist
   approaches that assume regionalism as taking place within and modelled
   by neoliberal economics, establishing the debate around `old' vs. `new'
   regionalism. As these categories are limited in grasping the full
   meaning and implications of post-hegemonic regional orders, we discuss
   UNASUR and ALBA as `arenas for action' to understand divergent
   practices, outcomes and types of regionness emerging in alternative
   regional spaces in South America.},

Journal = {EUROPE-ASIA STUDIES},

Volume = {64},

Pages = {857-877},
Abstract = {In the 1990s a regulative pattern that strongly mirrored the structure
   and basic functions of post-war European corporatism was formed and
   stabilised in Slovenia. The system enabled the country's relatively fast
   and smooth inclusion in the European monetary system. However, its
   former rise and recent tendency towards disorganisation clearly overlap
   with the qualitatively different phases of Europeanisation. At first
   glance, this overlap supports the thesis that there has been a decline
   of corporatist pacts in the post-EMU period, suggesting that the decline
   is caused by the more or less successful internalisation of EMU demands
   and pressures during the accommodation process. In the Slovenian case,
   this interpretation is basically misleading. It is true that the decline
   of corporatism in Slovenia was connected with EMU pressures, but the
   primary source of its disorganisation lay in its specific
   micro-foundations.},

Series = {Issues in Contemporary Chinese Thought and Culture},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {3},
Pages = {27-47},
Abstract = {In the era of globalization, the transition from international politics
   to global politics calls for the construction of a new global
   co-governance theory. The core principle of this theory is co-governance
   by all actors in the international arena, that is, co-governance based
   on global multilateral cooperation. The basic variables are
   multilateralism and the behavior of the various actors, especially the
   states. This theory argues that state-centered politics has been
   transformed into co-governance on the basis of the cooperation of states
   and the authority originally monopolized by the states is now shared by
   the society. Reflecting the trends in reality, this theory combines
   synthesis and the Middle Way. It is the outcome of the Chinese culture
   of harmony.
   International relations are undergoing a critical period of historical
   changes. Globalization and regionalization develop rapidly; all major
   countries and nation groups are trying their best to build up their
   strategic superiority in future competition; all kinds of non-state
   forces are actively seeking legitimacy for their existence and due
   survival space around the world; all kinds of theories are put forward
   to standardize and guide the uncertainty of development. In short, we
   are at a turning phase that people has yet to recognize clearly during
   which the old system and ideological paradigm has been challenged but
   not been replaced by new ones. So, a theoretical paradigm in conformity
   with both national interests and the historical trend is badly needed.
   It can guide the policies and acts of all actors, unify people's
   thoughts to reach consensus, lead the developed of history and reduce
   the negative impact uncertainty can possibly impose on the world. This
   is a key reason and aim for our exploration of new global political
   theories.
   Here, we establish our analysis and forecast on such a dialectic
   relation: first, our analysis is based on the present reality of
   international relations for any description divorce from reality can
   only be an illusion; second, our analysis can not rigidly stick to the
   reality and need to define some budding factors as long as they conform
   with the logic of history and world development. So this paper's
   analysis is composed of three parts: an overall analysis of the reality
   and trend of international relations at present, the definition of new
   global political theory, attempt to seek answer from the Chinese
   culture.},

Abstract = {In Jakarta, Indonesia, in July 2011, the United Nations (UN) Special
   Rapporteur on freedom of opinion and expression, Frank La Rue,
   highlighted how governments in South East Asia are increasingly using
   legislation and the courts to impair the freedom of expression,
   association and assembly of human rights defenders (HRDs) in the region.
   This article uses Cambodia as a case study to explore the use of
   repressive legislation against HRDs. It considers the state of the
   judiciary and critically analyses new laws, both enacted and in draft
   form, which undermine freedom of expression, association and assembly in
   the country. These laws include the new Cambodian Penal Code, the Law on
   Peaceful Assembly, and the highly contentious draft Law on Associations
   and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO Law). Drawing on La Rue's
   interviews with Cambodian HRDs, this article provides unique insight
   into how the Cambodian government is stifling free speech, association
   and assembly through specific laws rather than violent action. Finally,
   the article considers a number of options that both national and
   international players have in preventing, or at least helping to curb,
   this trend that affects human rights advocacy efforts in Cambodia and
   beyond.},

Abstract = {Adolescents worldwide are at high risk for adverse consequences of
   sexual activity, including HIV, other sexually transmitted diseases, and
   unintended pregnancy. Effective intervention strategies are needed to
   address this risk. This article discusses the advantages of the reasoned
   action approach for developing such strategies, including the ability to
   integrate population-specific qualitative information with the approach
   to develop an intervention that is both theoretically grounded and
   culturally appropriate. It also describes an application of the approach
   in developing ``Let Us Protect Our Future,{''} a culturally appropriate
   HIV risk-reduction intervention for adolescents in South Africa, where
   sexually transmitted HIV infections are having an especially devastating
   impact. The results of a randomized controlled trial revealed that grade
   6 students in schools that received the intervention were less likely to
   report having sexual intercourse, unprotected sexual intercourse, and
   multiple sexual partners during the 12-month follow-up period than their
   counterparts in control schools.},

Abstract = {This article examines gender mainstreaming in European Union (EU)
   development aid toward the European Neighborhood through quantitative
   and qualitative research of policy documents. The objective is to
   evaluate whether a shift has been made from a ``Women in Development{''}
   paradigm to a ``Gender and Development{''} paradigm. First, documents
   are examined quantitatively, looking at language, format, and budget.
   Next, the qualitative analysis embarks on a deeper reading of how gender
   equality is approached. The data indicate that a shift toward the
   ``Gender and Development{''} paradigm has not been made. The internal
   European agenda as well as the limited space for civil society are
   proposed as explanations.},

Journal = {EUROPE-ASIA STUDIES},

Volume = {64},

Abstract = {This article examines the question of European identity in Russian
   foreign policy through the notion of European norms. By considering
   attitudes towards the death penalty, it identifies different strands of
   thought in the Russian elite, and argues that an assertive Europeanism
   is now dominant as Russia seeks to be an equal participant in the
   development of common norms. However, there is a tendency for Russia's
   `Europeanness' to be questioned because of behaviour that is considered
   out of step with European Union standards. I argue that even in an area
   of significant controversy between Russia and other European states,
   self-determination for national minorities, there is potential for the
   delineation of common principles, but only as an inclusive process on
   the basis of consensus.},

Title = {Beyond `Poverty Reduction through Good Governance': The New Political
   Economy of Development in Africa},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {17},
Number = {5},
Pages = {683-690},
Abstract = {The new political economy of development, characterised by the rising
   powers' new resource finds in many poor countries and the financial
   crisis, has driven development ideas and practices towards a paradigm
   shift, moving it beyond the post-Washington Consensus which marked the
   high point of development's `Poverty Reduction through Good Governance'
   agenda. This has important implications for the extent to which
   developing countries remain governed by the institutional and
   ideological imperatives of development. Optimists suggest that this
   could herald a new era of sovereignty that enables African countries to
   take fuller control of their governance and development priorities,
   including a shift towards a `southern consensus' around structural
   transformation, whilst pessimists argue that the hegemony of orthodox
   development ideas has only been partially reordered and that new
   problems of sovereignty are now emerging. Insights from Uganda suggest
   that both of these scenarios are currently unfolding, leaving the
   outcomes uncertain and much to play for. What remains of the `good
   governance' agenda has yet to adapt itself to this new politics of
   development, which requires the emergence of new forms of developmental
   state in Africa.},

Abstract = {`Capitalist racist patriarchy' is how Zillah Eisenstein ( 1998)
   characterizes global inequalities and the hierarchies of `difference'
   they constitute. This article assumes that feminist theory aims not only
   to `empower women' but to advance critical analyses of intersecting
   structural hierarchies; that this entails not only a critique of
   patriarchy but its complex conjunction with capitalism and racism; and
   that such critique requires rethinking theory. Through a critical lens
   on devalued ('feminized') informal work worldwide, the article explores
   how positivist, modernist and masculinist commitments variously operate
   in prevailing theories of informality - including those of feminists
   with the effect of impeding both intersectional analyses and more
   adequate critiques of capitalist racist patriarchy.},

Abstract = {Tax havens represent a crucial, but neglected, test of deep trends in
   the international political economy. Over the last decade, and again
   after the onset of the financial crisis, tax havens have come under
   sustained pressure from powerful developed states and the international
   organisations they dominate. Despite their diminutive geographic and
   power profile, the havens have shown a puzzling resilience. Although
   like other economies havens have suffered from the financial crisis,
   they have nevertheless confounded predictions of decline premised on
   their purported vulnerability to discriminatory financial regulations
   imposed from onshore. This article explains the continued growth in
   offshore finance by the rise of new developing country markets. More
   broadly, the increasing availability of alternative markets means that
   G7 states are losing the crucial leverage they previously enjoyed by
   threatening to close their markets. The fortunes of tax havens are thus
   indicative of a tectonic shift: the rise of developing economies is
   producing a relative decline in the ability of core G7 states to
   dominate global economic governance.},

   development and the precautionary principle. Interests comprise economic
   opportunities and the climate changesecurity nexus. It is argued here
   that the normative orientation has dominated the EU's leading by example
   strategy in global negotiations. In Copenhagen, it yielded little
   influence as it was insufficiently geared towards the context of the
   negotiations. This challenges the notion of normative power Europe and
   makes a review of the Union's external climate policy necessary.},

Abstract = {In this article I systematically incorporate empirical work on rising
   income inequality and wage stagnation into a regulation theoretic
   framework for analysing macroeconomic growth. The rise of job
   polarisation and income inequality coincides with a long period of
   macroeconomic stagnation, both continuing through to the present (with
   the exception of a brief period of strong growth and declining
   inequality in the second half of the 1990s). The corporate scramble to
   restore profit rates after the crisis of Fordism has transformed the
   institutional configuration of the political economy. In particular,
   institutions supporting upward mobility and middle-class incomes in the
   economy have been eroded by the twin forces of internationalisation
   (leading to the re-emergence of wage-based competition) and employment
   externalisation (outsourcing, downsizing, antiunionism, etc). The
   current growth regime, which may be characterised as Waltonist, based on
   the Wal-Mart model of buyer-driven global supply chains focused on
   cutthroat wage-based competition and deunionisation, is not transitional
   but rather embedded in apparently long-term institutional settlements
   that amount to a dysfunctional regime.},

Abstract = {Following Japan's successful attacks against Allied targets throughout
   the Far East and the Pacific in December 1941, Canada focused on
   protecting its own Pacific coastline in British Columbia, participating
   in joint US- Canadian defence measures as required. Canadian authorities
   removed all Japanese Canadians from the Pacific Coast, placed conscript
   troops in British Columbia, and searched for other enemies in the
   province. They investigated subversion and sought to avert coastal
   attacks, whilst Japan conducted nuisance raids and maintained a presence
   in the Aleutians. Recently declassified intelligence files show that
   several factors influenced the way in which Canadian authorities viewed
   ` the enemy within' and ` the Pacific threat'. During the Pacific War,
   the Canadian conscription policy, public complacency, wartime
   allegiances and enemy activity along the coast all impacted the way in
   which security intelligence was collected and interpreted in British
   Columbia.},

Abstract = {This study examines how numbers in transnational governance constitute
   actors, objects, and relationships, including relationships of power. We
   review the existing literatures on numbers for insights relevant to
   their role in transnational governance, including the ontology of
   numbers, the history of numbers and their role in governance. On this
   basis, we set out the main distinctive ways that numbers are implicated
   in transnational governance. We conclude that studies of transnational
   governance would benefit from paying more attention to the much
   overlooked performative role of numbers in governance processes. Numbers
   have properties that differ from words, and shifts from one to the other
   in governance, for instance in the displacement of laws or norms with
   risk models or rankings based on numbers, have particular effects,
   including political effects on states, firms, individuals, and other
   actors and institutions.},

Abstract = {This article engages with trans-theorizing to show how International
   Relations (IR) is currently blind to gender diversity, and the
   conceptual contributions trans-theorizing could make. To do so, it asks
   what insights trans-theorizing might provide for the study of global
   politics generally, and for feminist theorizing about gender in global
   politics specifically. After briefly introducing the terminology of
   trans-theorizing, the article addresses the potential for (and potential
   hazards of) an alliance between trans-theorizing and feminist theorizing
   in IR. The article then discusses several potential contributions of
   trans-theorizingincluding hyper- and in-visibility, liminality,
   crossing, and disidentificationwhich provide explanatory leverage for
   IR. The article concludes with some suggestions for further
   collaboration between trans-theorizing and (feminist) IR to deepen and
   widen IR's work on gender specifically, and global politics generally.},

   Comparative Perspective},
Journal = {ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE},

Abstract = {This article examines the fertility of women who migrated as children to
   one of three OECD countries-Canada, the United Kingdom, and France-and
   how it differs from that of native-born women, by age at migration. By
   looking at child migrants whose fertility behavior is neither
   interrupted by the migration event nor confounded by selection, the
   authors obtain a unique perspective on the adaptation process as a
   mechanism that explains variation in observed foreign and native-born
   fertility differentials. The authors find patterns that are broadly
   consistent with the adaptation hypothesis-which posits that as migrants
   become accustomed to their host countries, their fertility norms begin
   to resemble those of the native population-and, on average, limited
   cross-national variation in fertility differentials. The effect of
   exposure to the host country, however, seems to vary by country of
   origin, a finding that underscores the importance of taking into account
   the heterogeneity of the foreign-born population.},

Abstract = {Most students of the EU agree by now that it is best described as a
   governance system. There is far less consensus on what kind of
   governance the EU actually features: modern, postmodern, network,
   cooperative, innovative or simply new? Sabel and Zeitlin have advanced
   yet another concept. This paper discusses the added value of their
   experimentalist governance (EG), as presented in an edited volume
   published in 2010, for understanding and explaining the nature of EU
   policymaking, addressing four questions: First, to what extent is EG
   distinct from existing concepts of governance? Second, how pervasive is
   EG in the EU when compared to alternative forms of governance? Third,
   what is the effect of EG on EU policy outcomes, on the one hand, and the
   overall architecture of the EU, on the other? Finally, does EG solve or
   exacerbate the EU's democratic deficit?},

Title = {Why Some Immigrant Neighborhoods Are Safer than Others: Divergent
   Findings from Los Angeles and Chicago},
Journal = {ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {641},
Pages = {148-173},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Contrary to popular opinion, scholarly research has documented that
   immigrant communities are some of the safest places around. Studies
   repeatedly find that immigrant concentration is either negatively
   associated with neighborhood crime rates or not related to crime at all.
   But are immigrant neighborhoods always safer places? How does the larger
   community context within which immigrant neighborhoods are situated
   condition the immigration-crime relationship? Building on the existing
   literature, this study examines the relationship between immigrant
   concentration and violent crime across neighborhoods in Los Angeles and
   Chicago-two cities with significant and diverse immigrant populations.
   Of particular interest is whether neighborhoods with high levels of
   immigrant concentration that are situated within larger immigrant
   communities are especially likely to enjoy reduced crime rates. This was
   found to be the case in Chicago but not in Los Angeles, where
   neighborhoods with greater levels of immigrant concentration experienced
   higher, not lower, violent crime rates when located within larger
   immigrant communities. We speculate on the various factors that may
   account for the divergent findings.},

Abstract = {One of American society's enduring debates centers on the immigration
   and violent crime relationship. This classic debate is revisited using
   data for individual homicide incidents and census-tract-level homicides
   in Miami, Florida, and San Antonio, Texas, in the 1980s and 1990s,
   respectively. The article starts with these two comparative cases
   because they mirror the immigration influx, Latino growth, and homicide
   decline seen throughout the country since 1980. These findings are also
   replicated in an analysis of the immigration and crime influx across the
   nation using U.S. counties in 2000. In sum, results from comparative
   cases, different time points, homicide motivations, and
   individual/community/national levels-and even controlling for Latino
   regional concentration-are reported. The findings were clear and
   unequivocal: more immigrants did not mean more homicide, and that
   outcome held across time and place.},

Journal = {REGULATION \& GOVERNANCE},

Volume = {6},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Risk-based regulation is becoming a familiar regulatory strategy in a
   wide range of areas and countries. Regulatory attention tends to focus,
   at least initially, on high risks but low-risk regulatees or activities
   tend to form the bulk of the regulated population. This article asks why
   regulators need to address low risks and it outlines the potential
   difficulties that such risks present. It then considers how regulators
   tend to deal with lower risks in practice. A body of literature and
   survey-based research is used to develop a taxonomy of intervention
   strategies that may be useful in relation to low-risk activities, and,
   indeed, more widely. In an article to be published in the subsequent
   issue of this journal, we will then develop a strategic framework for
   regulators to employ when choosing intervention strategies and we will
   assesses whether, and how, such a framework could be used by regulatory
   agencies in a manner that is operable, dynamic, transparent, and
   justifiable.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the productivity of the service sector within the
   countries of the European Union during the period 1994-2005. After
   disaggregating the sector into 11 branches, the article quantifies the
   relative contribution of each branch to the growth of service sector
   aggregate productivity. The main conclusion is that the structure of the
   industry is increasingly dependent on those branches which have lower
   growth in labour productivity. This conclusion reveals that the EU
   service sector suffers from `Baumol's disease', which helps to
   accentuate the slow productivity growth that characterizes this sector.},

Title = {Remembering Hiroshima BIO-POLITICS, POPOKI AND SENSUAL
   EXPRESSIONS OF WAR},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL FEMINIST JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {14},
Number = {2},
Pages = {202-222},
Abstract = {This article seeks to explore the bio-politics of memory, focusing on
   intersections of gender, memory, peace/war and activism. The article
   rests on the belief that states use bio-politics to construct,
   manipulate and maintain national identity and collective memory and
   addresses, in particular, three myths that still influence the field of
   international relations: the myth of gender neutrality; the notion that
   verbal representations should be privileged over physical and/or sensual
   expressions; and the myth of objectivity and the need to distance the
   study of IR theory from the practice of social activism. The article
   begins with a discussion of bio-politics and collective memory in
   general and then focuses on ways of remembering the atomic bombing of
   Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It concludes with some examples of narratives by
   survivors which employ sensual memory that challenge the way we think
   about expressions and representations of war. These examples were
   gathered by the Popoki Peace Project, a grass roots peace organization.
   The article suggests that theories of bodily and sensual expressions of
   memory can be useful in peace activism and can provide different
   understandings of war experiences. It suggests that making visible some
   of the differences obscured in the formation of the collective memory of
   national trauma can be a way to begin to acknowledge the precarity of
   life and to prepare the way for forgiveness.},

Abstract = {This essay reviews failed historical attempts at regional integration in
   the South Caucasus since the early twentieth century, and in particular
   the failed Transcaucasian federations of 1918 and 1922-1936 and the
   breakdown of Soviet economic integration in the region. It argues that
   there is much that makes the South Caucasus a viable region in terms of
   geography, culture and economic potential, but political contradictions
   and persistent perceptions of insecurity make for a pattern of recurring
   fragmentation. Both Caucasians and outsiders have a role to play if
   voluntary integration is to work as a project in the future.},

Abstract = {Not all biases are equivalent, and not all biases are uniformly
   negative. Two fundamental dimensions differentiate stereotyped groups in
   cultures across the globe: status predicts perceived competence, and
   cooperation predicts perceived warmth. Crossing the competence and
   warmth dimensions, two combinations produce ambivalent prejudices:
   pitied groups (often traditional women or older people) appear warm but
   incompetent, and envied groups (often nontraditional women or outsider
   entrepreneurs) appear competent but cold. Case studies in ambivalent
   sexism, heterosexism, racism, anti-immigrant biases, ageism, and
   classism illustrate both the dynamics and the management of these
   complex but knowable prejudices.},

Abstract = {Why do companies choose the private labour regulations that they do?
   Scholars know plenty about why companies might accept private regulators
   to oversee and protect labour standards. But they know very little about
   why companies choose one rather than another private regulatory approach
   when several are available, differing in terms of stringency. This paper
   explores the conditions under which companies in the clothing industry
   choose private labour-standards regulation with more rather than less
   stringent regulation. It does so based on qualitative and quantitative
   analysis of clothing companies in Europe. It argues that business
   preference for more stringent private labour regulation is positively
   affected by societal pressure, and that this societal pressure is
   predominantly orchestrated by activist groups. This not only entails
   campaigns, but also can be a combination of public and informal efforts
   to influence companies, together with pressures from consumers and
   media. This research also shows that national and industrial factors
   play a role. In particular, the position of the firm in the value chain
   and its distance to consumers and manufacturers affect preference for
   more or less stringent private regulation. Societal pressure is
   therefore important but not the only source of business preferences for
   private regulation.},

Journal = {EUROPE-ASIA STUDIES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {64},
Number = {5},
Pages = {929-947},
Abstract = {The discourse on EU-Russia relations amongst practitioners, think-tank
   experts, journalists and academics has congealed around a
   postmodern-modern binary. It is frequently argued that whereas Russia is
   caught up in a `modern' framework of fixed territory, national identity
   and traditional geopolitics, the European Union is driven by a
   `postmodern' spatial mindset that transcends these `backward' values.
   This article argues that the EU's supposed postmodern geopolitics
   remains enmeshed in a very modern temporality-a consciousness of time
   that valorises the present over the past. It also detects a problematic
   disillusion with the postmodern and questions its implicit normativity.},

Abstract = {The Russian Far East has, since Gorbachev, been used in foreign-policy
   discourse as a tool to access the integrative processes of the
   Asia-Pacific. However, vulnerability, symbolised by the border with
   China and the asymmetry of the Sino-Russian economic relationship,
   highlights the geopolitical and geoeconomic implications of engagement
   with the Asia-Pacific. The `modernisation' agenda, which became a
   leitmotiv of the Medvedev administration, focused attention on the
   challenges of development in this region, but development within this
   agenda tends to be based on the most optimistic scenarios, and
   development plans for the border areas are heavily geared towards China.
   Integration with the Asia-Pacific is often advocated as a means of
   escaping economic dependence on China, but approaches and strategies
   remain overly politicised.},

Abstract = {This article compares the web presence of the Communist Party of the
   Russian Federation and the British Liberal Democrats in order both to
   analyse the ability of the internet to strengthen parties as political
   institutions as well as to reflect upon the relative democratic value of
   parties online in different types of regimes. The article compares the
   party websites in early 2010 through an analysis of online audience, web
   links, content posted by parties and user-generated material linked to
   the two parties. The research found that the online potential of party
   communication, despite the universal availability of powerful tools of
   information distribution and social networking opportunities, was far
   more closely tied to national political culture than to cyber-culture in
   general. The Communist Party web activity tended to parallel the party
   activity offline, failing to craft the appearance of a more modern or
   inclusive party. At the same time, supporters of the British Liberal
   Democrats made greater use of external social networking and were
   apparently more connected with the broader political sphere, although
   perhaps at the expense of party branding and control. The findings
   demonstrate the need to understand how national political organisations
   and attitudes can play a much stronger role than technological potential
   in shaping the democratising forces of the online sphere.},

Title = {Delaying the inevitable: A political economy approach to currency
   defenses and depreciation},
Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1},
Pages = {114-139},
Abstract = {When faced with speculative pressure on their currencies, policymakers
   often delay devaluations by spending billions of dollars in defense of a
   given exchange rate peg, only to succumb and devalue their currency
   later on. Using a political economy approach we argue that the
   interaction of distributional concerns, cognitive limitations,
   time-consistency problems, and institutional structures can keep
   governments from implementing the economically optimal policy response.
   We argue that distributional concerns often lead to a `bias' in favor of
   currency defense as long as market pressures are mild. The political
   incentives to initially delay devaluations can be exacerbated by
   institutions that either increase the size of interest groups vulnerable
   to depreciation or give policymakers incentives to adopt a short
   time-horizon. Once market pressure becomes strong, however, the
   politically salient alternative to not depreciating becomes raising
   interest rates rather than just running down reserves. This acts as a
   wake-up call that changes perceptions of the underlying distributional
   considerations and hence the political trade-off between the costs and
   benefits of an exchange rate defense. As the coalition of
   devaluation-proponents grows, the likelihood of a devaluation increases.
   We illustrate our argument by discussing the salient distributional
   issues and their interaction with domestic institutions in four brief
   case studies.},

Abstract = {What explains Germany's exceptional labor market performance during the
   Great Recession of 2008-09? Contrary to accounts that emphasize
   employment protection legislation or government policy (i.e., short-time
   work), this article argues that actions by firms-embedded in
   ever-changing coordinative institutional structures-were crucial. Firms
   chose to keep rather than shed labor, a strategy induced by (i) a
   ``toolkit{''} of flexible labor market instruments that had evolved
   incrementally over the past thirty years; (ii) wage restraint and
   successful internal restructuring of firms during the past decade, which
   fueled an export boom before the crisis. Firms thus had some margin for
   maneuver, using internal flexibility to protect their investment in
   skilled workers. These and other institutional changes driven by firms
   reflect a process of successful adaptation to external economic
   challenges, but did not fundamentally undermine Germany's coordinated
   form of capitalism. The result is not a new German model that was
   purposefully designed; instead German firms slowly discovered new ways
   to cope with economic challenges.},

Abstract = {The resurgence of Russia's energy diplomacy animates debate among
   realists, who regard pipelines as instruments of competitive resource
   nationalism, and their critics, who treat them either as mechanisms for
   strengthening cooperation or reflecting obsolescing bargains that
   empower transit states upon construction and operation. Yet, this debate
   conspicuously overlooks the variable record of the arbitrary disruption
   of Eurasian energy transit. This article addresses these oversights by
   explicating pipeline politics as an international credible commitment
   problem. It focuses specifically on the different incentives among
   producer, consumer and transit states and on how insights into the
   economic and institutional dimensions of bargaining shape the value,
   risks and capacity of the parties to forge and uphold pipeline
   agreements. Accordingly, arbitrary disruption is more likely under
   conditions in which the primary stakeholders are not preoccupied by
   recouping returns on investment and face incentives to gamble on new
   terms, as well as operate within opaque national regulatory settings.
   Credible commitments to uphold cross-border transit arrangements are
   more likely when the opposite conditions obtain. These claims are probed
   in comparative cases of arbitrary interruption of Soviet legacy
   pipelines and curious non-events in Eurasian oil and gas transit.},

Journal = {ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {644},
Pages = {236-255},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Twenty years of major policy and activist interventions that seek to
   promote sustainable consumption have been guided by what I term the
   ethical values paradigm, despite that this paradigm has significant
   conceptual flaws and has not produced impressive results. This article
   critiques the ethical values paradigm and proposes an alternative by
   adapting the market constructionist paradigm. The author analyzes the
   development of the American market for bottled water and demonstrates
   that this unsustainable consumption is an unintended consequence of the
   construction of a consumption ideology that is specific to the bottled
   water market, what the author terms ideological lock-in. This model
   explains why activist interventions have not worked and points the way
   toward more effective strategies. The author argues that we should
   reallocate the vast government, NGO, and foundation sustainability
   investments from promoting consumer value transformations toward a
   federation of market-focused social movements aimed at leapfrogging the
   ideological lock-in in key unsustainable markets.},

Title = {Selectivity on aid modality: Determinants of budget support from
   multilateral donors},
Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},
Number = {3},
Pages = {267-284},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Since the late 1990s a selection on policy approach to aid was advocated
   such that more aid should be allocated to countries with good policies,
   but there is little evidence that this has occurred. This paper argues
   that donors may exercise selectivity over the aid modality.
   Specifically, multilateral donors will cede more recipient control over
   aid by granting more budget support to those recipients with better
   expenditure systems and spending preferences (towards the poor) aligned
   with the donor. We test this for European Commission and World Bank
   budget support over 1997-2009 and find some support. Both donors have
   given budget support to almost half of the countries they give aid, and
   it is usually a significant share of their aid. The principal
   determinants of receiving budget support are having a poverty reduction
   strategy in place, which can be considered a good indicator of aligned
   preferences, and indicators of government efficiency. These variables
   did not, however, influence the amount of budget support given.
   Multilateral donors have been more likely to give budget support to
   countries with aligned spending preferences and better quality systems,
   even if they have not reallocated the total aid envelope in that way.},

Abstract = {Limited data on regional and preferential trade agreements prevent
   social scientists from testing some of the international cooperation
   literature's most important claims. Expert surveys-a technique that is
   widely used in the field of comparative politics but thus far
   underutilized in international relations-allow us to capture many
   aspects of trade agreements for which data would otherwise be
   unavailable. They also provide us with a means of comparing agreements
   across regions and issue areas. We present a new dataset of expert
   opinion on the world's regional trade organizations. Our survey covers
   24 dimensions of 40 different regional agreements-including the
   perceived effectiveness of trade liberalization, the degree to which
   dispute settlement mechanisms are easy to use, and the political and
   international influence of the agreement. Bayesian factor analysis
   allows us to extract a principal dimension of effectiveness.},

Abstract = {Metaphoric descriptions of the world offer simple cognitive schemes to
   put things in their place, thereby offering keys to make reality easily
   interpretable. For centuries, the prevailing understanding of the
   political relied on an imaginary where borders were conceived like the
   lines of a coloring book, cutting political space into distinct state
   boxes, where citizens were defined congruously with the box of their
   state. The spatial knowledge inherent in this metaphor defined the
   dispositif of modernityhow to map the worldboth in the socio-political
   and artistic domains. In the late nineteenth century, however, painting
   took a different understanding of spatiality and its representation.
   This article suggests that todaywhen the coloring book's imaginary is
   increasingly ill-fitted to describe socio-political realitieswe could
   turn to art for a metaphor that would better capture late-modernity's
   understanding of borders and socio-political spaces. In sum, the article
   suggests turning to the paintings of Cezanne for inspiration.},

Title = {Crossing the threshold: A positive analysis of IBRD graduation policy},
Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},
Number = {2},
Pages = {145-176},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {According to World Bank policy, countries remain eligible to borrow from
   the IBRD until they are able to sustain long-term development without
   further recourse to Bank financing. Graduation from IBRD is not an
   automatic consequence of reaching a particular income level, but rather
   is supposed to be based on a determination of whether the country has
   reached a level of institutional development and capital-market access
   that enables it to sustain its own development process without recourse
   to Bank funding. This paper takes a positive approach to IBRD graduation
   policy, investigating what income and non-income factors appear to have
   influenced graduation status in recent decades, based on panel data for
   1982 through 2009. Explanatory variables include the per-capita income
   of the country, as well as measures of institutional development and
   market access that are cited as criteria by the graduation policy, and
   other plausible explanatory variables that capture the levels of
   economic development and vulnerability of the country. We find that the
   observed correlates of Bank graduation status are generally consistent
   with the stated policy. Countries that are wealthier, more creditworthy,
   more institutionally developed, and are less vulnerable to trade,
   financial, and other shocks are more likely to be graduates. Predicted
   probabilities generated by the model conform closely to the actual
   graduation and de-graduation experiences of Trinidad and Tobago and
   Korea, among other countries, and suggest that Hungary and Latvia may
   have graduated prematurely-a prediction subsequently borne out by the
   large loans that they later received from the IBRD in the wake of the
   global financial crisis.},

Abstract = {Building on earlier articles published in the Journal of Cold War
   Studies by James G. Hershberg and Zoltan Szoke, this article discusses
   Romania's involvement in the attempts to negotiate a peaceful conclusion
   to the Vietnam War before and after the Tet Offensive. The literature
   concerning the Romanian channel (codenamed Packers) is negligible thus
   far. Part of the reason is that even though official U.S. documentation
   on Packers has been available for two decades, relevant Romanian
   documents were only recently declassified by the archive of the Romanian
   Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The new evidence from the Romanian archives
   completes the picture of what was, in effect, the last U.S. chance to
   begin negotiations over Vietnam without compromising the initial U.S.
   position. The conversations between Romanian Deputy Foreign Minister
   George Macovescu and Vietnamese Communist leaders on the eve of the Tet
   Offensive offer a much more detailed inside look at Hanoi's negotiating
   position in December 1967-January 1968. The Romanian documents also show
   the crystallization of the Vietnamese position of March 1968 with regard
   to opening talks and the San Antonio formula.},

Abstract = {The Central Eastern European member states of the European Union have
   introduced a host of anti-corruption measures in the past two decades,
   yet corruption is still prevalent. Rather than asking what is wrong with
   the letter of the law, which has traditionally been the focus of
   analysis, this article identifies some of the reasons why those whose
   behavior the law seeks to change fail to act as expected. Drawing on
   theoretical insights from implementation studies and using Hungary as an
   illustrative example, the article finds that both incentives and
   normative judgments are skewed towards non-compliance with anti-bribery
   laws. The main policy implications are that anti-corruption
   interventions should pay more attention to raising awareness among
   target groups, take existing social norms into account, and rely on
   positive incentives as well as, or rather than, increasing penalties.},

Abstract = {In this article, it is pointed out that the European Union does not have
   a harmonized practice when it comes to trade procedures, implying that
   countries in the rest of the world face different trade barriers
   depending on which EU country they ship their goods to. Estimating the
   impact of trade procedures on exports from non-EU countries, a highly
   statistically significant and negative effect is found. Simulating what
   the effects would be of harmonizing trade procedures to the level of the
   most efficient EU countries, it is found that aggregated exports to the
   EU would increase by 20 per cent for the average exporter.},

Abstract = {The use of customary institutions and mechanisms is increasingly
   presented as a solution to operational problems of justice in general
   and transitional justice in particular. Based on historical research and
   several months of fieldwork in rural Burundi between 2007 and 2010, this
   article argues that both attempts, mainly by the Burundian government,
   to sideline the `traditional' bashingantahe councils as day-to-day
   mediators and potentially important actors in the transitional justice
   process, and strategies, mainly used by international donors and
   organizations, to rehabilitate and modernize the institution, are
   obscuring the issue at stake. A shift in focus from the bashingantahe as
   an institution to the bushingantahe as an organizing principle of social
   existence is needed. Forms of social imaginaries such as the
   bushingantahe should be taken into account as sources and outcomes of
   (transitional) justice.},

Abstract = {The United States has introduced automatic enrollment into retirement
   savings schemes, and the United Kingdom is in the throes of doing so.
   The financial crisis has reminded us that returns on these schemes can
   be poor, even negative. Behavioral economics shows that people can be
   ``nudged{''} into schemes regardless, but it also implies that the
   liberal account of market legitimation through informed choice cannot be
   applied. This article examines how risks are assigned in schemes and how
   enrollees might seek recourse if their expectations are disappointed.
   Comparing the United States and the United Kingdom, it argues that
   enrollees are more likely to seek recourse from the government in the
   United Kingdom. The explanation can be found in regulatory decisions
   that reflect the structure of each country's public pension scheme. This
   structure is conducive to private risk bearing in the United States, but
   not in the United Kingdom, suggesting that regulatory market liberalism
   is undermined by a residual approach to public provision.},

Abstract = {The inclusion of perceptions of control over behavioral performance has
   importantly advanced the ability of reasoned action theory to explain
   behavioral intentions and predict behavior. In consequence, the theory
   has usefulness as a tool for developing behavior change interventions.
   Despite the theoretical and practical importance of a perceived
   behavioral control construct, there remains ambiguity regarding the
   precise meaning and measurement of items. A central issue is that items
   used to measure perceived behavioral control often load on two factors,
   one composed of confidence-framed items and the other of control-framed
   items. According to reasoned action theory, these two factors represent
   capacity and autonomy aspects of perceived behavioral control. In this
   article I review the usefulness of the current dual-aspect
   conceptualization of perceived behavioral control, present illustrative
   perceived capacity and autonomy data, and discuss new areas of inquiry
   that can further advance the conceptualization of perceived behavioral
   control.},

Abstract = {This article examines the ideals of militarized femininity disseminated
   in recruitment advertising. Based on an analysis of 30 years of
   recruitment advertisements for each of the four US military branches, I
   argue that representations of women serve to at once normalize the
   participation of women in the military and to erase it. The inclusion of
   a token number of women is routine, but they are not associated with
   markers of combat. By separating women from the imagery of war, the
   military reinforces gender divisions, reasserting the connections
   between masculinity and warriorhood, even as it helps to broaden
   definitions of femininity.},

   Supplier?},
Journal = {EUROPE-ASIA STUDIES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {64},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {449-469},
Abstract = {In recent years, the Russian authorities have invested significant
   effort into promoting a positive image of Russia as an energy supplier.
   Yet, Russia's behaviour sometimes seems to contradict the declared aim
   of improving this image. A particularly interesting case is the way the
   Russian authorities and Gazprom handled the dispute with Ukraine over
   gas prices in December 2008-January 2009, when the transit of Russian
   gas to a number of EU member states via Ukraine was seriously affected.
   This essay argues that in order to understand Russia's position during
   the crisis, one should take into account the impact of international
   images on Russian politics, in particular self-images and constructed
   images that the Russian authorities have been projecting in the West and
   in Russia itself.},

Abstract = {Following an innovative study showing rapid inferences about the
   competence of candidates based on photos correlated with electoral
   success, we examine the effects of the sex of the subjects and
   candidates on these results. Our results indicate that the relationship
   between inferences of competence and electoral success are more complex
   than previously believed. We found a gender gap in evaluations of
   competence and maturity of candidate faces and in support for women
   candidates; however, an overall preference among all subjects for men
   candidates. Additionally, the relationship between competence and
   victory is affected by a host of variables unconsidered previously.},

Title = {Transnational actors and the politics of pension reform in Sub-Saharan
   Africa},
Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {19},
Number = {2},
Pages = {267-291},
Abstract = {Drawing on recent scholarship on transnational actors and on the role of
   ideas in policy change, this paper analyzes the regional context of the
   pension reform debate in Sub-Saharan Africa, and shows that, at least
   since the 1980s, there was significant attention to pension reforms in
   Africa by global policy actors, including the World Bank. However,
   unlike in Latin America and Central and Eastern Europe, where the World
   Bank proved dominant, the regional environment of pension reform in
   Sub-Saharan Africa was characterized by a fierce competition between the
   World Bank and the International Labour Organization (ILO), with each
   institution promoting different policy preferences. As demonstrated, in
   Sub-Saharan Africa pension reform, the ILO has proved more influential
   than the World Bank. Theoretically, the paper stresses the role of
   transnational actors in the global diffusion of social policy ideas.
   Recognizing the need to explore the interactions between national and
   transnational actors, as well as between transnational actors
   themselves, the analysis explores the dialogical and competitive nature
   of the global politics of ideas.},

Abstract = {A representative sampling of 53 treatises on Re militari, diplomacy and
   theory of state that were published in Europe is analyzed in order to
   outline the role of secret intelligence in the direction of armies and
   the government during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The
   participation of spies, confidants and informers in the exercise of
   power, whether political, military or economic is a timeless constant,
   which is not at all anecdotal or marginal. We offer conclusions
   regarding the formalization of modern intelligence systems based on
   concepts as closely related as secrets, advice and deception, which
   configure the precursors of the systematic theory of contemporary
   intelligence.},

Journal = {EUROPE-ASIA STUDIES},

Volume = {64},
Number = {9, SI},
Pages = {1739-1757},
Abstract = {The essay focuses on the notion of the Caucasus as a reference point in
   the construction of Cossack identity in southern Russia. Since the late
   Soviet period, the Cossack revivalist/nativist movement has emerged in
   the territories which constituted the frontier zones of Tsarist Russia.
   Arguably, the historical Cossack hosts were established as a kind of
   frontier community which played an important role in the expansion of
   the Russian Empire. This essay examines how post-Soviet Cossacks
   reinterpret the meanings of the Caucasus as a spatial and cultural realm
   where, or in relation to which, they produce their identity as a
   distinct ethnic and cultural community.},

   Conflict-Related Sexual Violence},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WOMEN POLITICS \& POLICY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {33},
Number = {4},
Pages = {299-321},
Abstract = {Based on a review of existing literature, this article provides an
   initial analysis of obstacles to addressing impunity for widespread
   conflict-related sexual violence. First, a background of trends of
   sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) in conflict is provided. The
   article then outlines why addressing impunity is important for building
   peace and ending conflict-related SGBV. Next, the article presents an
   overview of developments and mechanisms adopted by the international
   community in an attempt to address impunity. Yet despite these advances,
   conflict-related sexual violence remains widespread and impunity
   persists. Thus, the final section of article sets out one proposal for
   addressing the problem-increasing the number of women working in
   international peace operations through the creation of United
   Nations-sponsored Women's Police Service (UNWPS), which would recruit,
   train, and deploy women's contingents for policing in international
   peace operations.},

   Democracy},
Journal = {INTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {27},
Number = {5},
Pages = {761-780},
Abstract = {The post-9/11 period and its emphasis on tackling terrorism has had a
   fundamental impact on the business of intelligence, not least in raising
   some very difficult ethical issues to the forefront of debate. Many of
   these issues are intertwined with the business of `policing
   globalisation' in the modern era. The changes and developments offer new
   opportunities in Intelligence Studies for exploring ethics, and the role
   of the intelligence function within a modern liberal democracy. The
   questions posed by the new threat picture for such states offer
   something of an `intelligence dilemma', which must balance the provision
   of good security with respecting civil liberties and ensuring the
   continued support of the population for security and intelligence
   policy. This article examines the intelligence dilemma within the
   framework of five dimensions: globalisation, risk and resilience; the
   question of a `surveillance society'; the `intermestic' challenge in the
   new threat picture; difficulties around the use of covert action and
   cyber capabilities; and partnership risks. The article suggests that a
   deeper analysis of these issues represents opportunities for taking
   Intelligence Studies in new directions.},

Abstract = {This article examines the strategies employed by individual investors to
   evade cross-border capital income taxation, and evaluates the
   effectiveness of the European Union Savings Tax Directive (STD). Using
   data for four European countries, the results are, first, individual
   investors adapted to the institutional changes implemented by the STD
   before it became effective in 2005; second, the strategy of reallocating
   assets from debt to equity products in the same country is more
   important than shifting portfolio capital out of co-operating countries
   into third countries; third, countries opting for a retention tax did
   not experience an outflow of portfolio capital, whereas countries
   engaged in information exchange lost capital relative to third countries
   outside the scope of the STD; and finally, there is considerable
   heterogeneity across countries. While there are strong behavioural
   responses by French investors, no evidence was found of cross-border tax
   evasion by Italian investors, which may be explained by the absence of a
   national automatic reporting system on capital income in Italy. Overall,
   the findings show that the STD does not effectively prevent tax evasion
   and thus lend support to calls for tightening the directive.},

Abstract = {The 30-year ethnic-based civil war in Sri Lanka between the Liberation
   Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and the Sri Lanka government ended in May
   2009. This article analyzes the impact of the violent ethnic conflict on
   shaping and reshaping the nationalistic ideology of the women of the
   majority ethnic group-specifically, the Sinhalese. Based on a field
   survey of urban, educated Sinhala women in Colombo, Sri Lanka, this
   article argues that women adopted a Sinhala Buddhist ideology to counter
   what they perceived as a threat to the integrity of a Sinhala Buddhist
   nation by the Tamil Hindu minority. In particular, this study
   demonstrates that the ethnic conflict while reinforcing a gendered
   ethnoreligious identity also seems to have created a political space for
   their voices to be heard in representative electoral regimes.},

Journal = {POLITICS \& SOCIETY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {40},
Number = {4},
Pages = {517-547},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Can we argue that pressures generated from grassroots politics are
   responsible for the rapid expansion and ethnically/racially uneven
   distribution of social assistance programs in emerging economies? This
   article analyzes the Turkish case and shows that social assistance
   programs in Turkey are directed disproportionately to the Kurdish
   minority and to the Kurdish region of Turkey, especially to the
   internally displaced Kurds in urban and metropolitan areas. The article
   analyzes a cross-sectional dataset generated by a 10,386-informant
   stratified random sampling survey and controls for possibly intervening
   socioeconomic factors and neighborhood-level fixed-effects. The results
   show that high ethnic disparity in social assistance is not due to
   higher poverty among Kurds. Rather, Kurdish ethnic identity is the main
   determinant of the access to social assistance. This result yields
   substantive support to argue that the Turkish government uses social
   assistance to contain the Kurdish unrest in Turkey. The Turkish
   government seems to give social assistance not simply where the people
   become poor, but where the poor become politicized. This provides
   support for Fox Piven and Cloward's thesis that relief for the poor is
   driven by social unrest, rather than social need. The article concludes
   that similar hypotheses may hold true for other emerging economies,
   where similar types of social assistance programs have recently expanded
   significantly and have been directed to ethnic/racial groups.},

Abstract = {In 2003, a trial of 10 Nazi officers accused of perpetrating a massacre
   in Sant'Anna di Stazzema began in Italy. The trial took place almost 60
   years after the massacre, in which approximately 400 civilians, mainly
   women, children and elderly people, were killed. This article, based on
   eight years of ethnographic research, analyses these 60 years by
   concentrating on how the survivors and the relatives of the victims were
   able to overcome the trauma and accept, at the end, a late
   reconciliation. The article contends that `choral memory' acted as a
   strong resistance mechanism, protecting the village community from the
   destructive power of violence, as well as from later public oblivion,
   and making possible its material survival and symbolic continuity.},

Abstract = {This article interprets the regulatory state in Colombia as the result
   of a dialectic process between transnational knowledge and domestic
   politics, which influence, transform, and inspire each other. Such a
   process results in an interesting constitutional variant of the
   regulatory state, in which neo-constitutionalism becomes a
   counterbalance to the unchecked expansion of neo-liberal regulatory
   practices. I, therefore, distinguish between neoliberal and
   constitutional regulatory states. As a result of neo-constitutionalism,
   the domestic judiciary is empowered, and becomes a crucial actor to
   understand both the specific traits of this regulatory experience, and
   its interaction with global centers of power.},

Abstract = {This paper deals with the creation of global principle-based standards.
   For such standards to be accepted and effective, particular conditions
   must be fulfilled. One such condition, little explored, is that
   standard-makers and -takers share knowledge about the meaning of the
   principles, as well as the practices through which they are likely to be
   applied. The paper shows that this condition is fulfilled when
   transnational cultural systems exist, by means of which both types of
   actors engage in the explication and representation of their practices
   so that a common, standard understanding emerges of how principles may
   be interpreted on the ground and informs the negotiations. A
   transnational cultural system is a crucial governance infrastructure to
   set global standards, as shown by the long history of creating a risk
   analysis guideline by the Codex Alimentarius, the inter-governmental
   body for food standards.},

Abstract = {This article provides an in-depth examination of the U.S. government's
   role in the case of Raoul Wallenberg, the courageous Swedish envoy who
   died mysteriously in the Soviet Union after being arrested by Soviet
   occupation forces at the end of World War II for unknown reasons. The
   article recounts how U.S. officials, particularly the diplomat Herschel
   V. Johnson, tried to alleviate the plight of Hungarian Jews after German
   forces occupied Hungary in 1944. A key part of this policy was their
   effort to work with Sweden in enlisting Wallenberg's help. The
   U.S.-Swedish relationship was never particularly close, and the mistrust
   that officials in each country felt toward the other side impeded any
   coordinated action. The article discusses the bureaucratic impediments
   on the U.S. side and highlights some of the obstacles that Johnson
   strove to overcome. The article builds on the report produced by the
   Eliasson Commission documenting the Swedish government's handling of the
   Wallenberg case. Although the Swedish authorities bore by far the
   greatest amount of blame for doing nothing in the face of Soviet
   stonewalling, Matz argues that U.S. officials also made significant
   misjudgments that may have exacerbated the situation.},

Abstract = {The year 2009 saw a series of events celebrating the first decade of
   Europe's monetary union. Within a year, however, the eurozone descended
   into the most serious crisis in its short history. The question posed in
   this article is whether scholarly analysis of European monetary
   integration was deficient in ways that led observers to miss impending
   problems. The answer given here is that the standard analysis was
   broadly on the mark, although it missed the need for effective oversight
   of banking and financial systems at the level of the monetary union and
   underemphasized political economy considerations.},

Abstract = {Research into the causes of the 2008 financial crisis has drawn
   attention to a link between growing income inequality in the United
   States and high household indebtedness. Most accounts trace the U.S.
   idea of credit-as-welfare to the period of wage stagnation and welfare
   retrenchment that began in the early 1970s. Using France as a comparison
   case, I argue that the link between credit and welfare was not unique to
   the United States. Indeed, U.S. charitable lending institutions that
   emerged at the beginning of the twentieth century were modeled in part
   on older French financial institutions. Three historical factors drove
   U.S. lenders and policymakers to push for expanded credit access for the
   working class. First, welfare reformers in the interwar period embraced
   private credit as an alternative to an expansive welfare state. Second,
   U.S. organized labor in the wake of World War II embraced credit access
   as a means to sustain industrial employment and finance strike actions.
   Third, commercial banks in the 1950s began offering revolving credit
   accounts as a means to attract new depositors at a time when banking
   regulation restricted the interest they could offer on deposits.},

Abstract = {This article examines complex patterns of interaction between human
   settlement and the environment in the industrialised Russian north. I
   analyse how new mining towns, built during the Soviet period, were
   located and integrated into the environment. Residents have participated
   in the industrial processing of natural resources in the work domain,
   also developing a strong emotional attachment to the natural
   environments while spending leisure time around the cities. In both
   perception of physical space and ideas about place, the main dividing
   principle is between the spheres of work and leisure.},

Title = {Is worker repression risky? Foreign direct investment, labour rights and
   assessments of risk in developing countries},
Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {19},
Number = {3},
Pages = {415-447},
Abstract = {Quantitative assessments of `country risk' produced by private rating
   agencies have become influential among multinational firms considering
   investment in the developing world. This article considers whether
   developing countries exhibiting more labour rights violations are
   associated with higher risk ratings. It draws from existing literature
   on the determinants of foreign direct investment (FDI) and the
   relationship between labour rights and FDI to illuminate the ways in
   which labour repression may indicate increased risk for potential
   investors. It implements a set of time series of cross-sections models
   for 95 developing countries, from 1985 to 2003. These models present
   predictors of a long-established risk index, plus an additional latent
   risk measure created through factor analysis of three separate and
   distinct risk ratings. Results indicate a consistent association between
   increased labour rights violations and increased risk ratings. The
   article extends the analysis to highlight the heterogeneous nature of
   FDI and possible sector-specific relationships between labour rights and
   risk ratings. The paper argues that the economic profile of a country
   may condition the relationship between labour rights and risk ratings.},

Abstract = {Today ``globalization{''} has turned out to be an important buzzword to
   describe the world where we live. The word `globalization' itself has
   been a source of constant interest and clamor for the Chinese
   theoreticians. No wonder they have not remained unaffected and resorted
   to it while dealing with issues of all hues and colors. However, Edward
   Said warned those involved with oriental studies. When we use the
   Western terminology without thinking, we are likely to look at the
   subjects we study through colored spectacles with a ``Made in West{''}
   tag. Hence, the theory of globalization contains a kind of danger: its
   hidden values might be misleading to the academic community in the third
   world including China. Actually, the landing of globalization theory in
   China is absolutely not a simply academic transplant. Profoundly it
   includes the expansion of the values it advocates. Historically
   speaking, the globalization theory has diverted and covered, from
   ``global{''} perspectives, the Western values that have been criticized
   and defended the global expansion of capitalism based on abstract global
   values. This article argues that China's socialist movement is actually
   against the global expansion of capitalism. In the conformity with this
   fact, Chinese scholars should oppose abstract and non-historic theory of
   globalization. They need to have independent explanations and
   justifications for ``globalization{''}.},

Abstract = {This article examines the inauguration of US political warfare
   operations against the Soviet bloc,1948-50. It builds on diplomatic and
   military historiography of US Cold War foreign policy, and engages with
   more recent scholarship of the `covert' and unconventional confrontation
   between east and west. Two key interrelated themes are explored. The
   failure of Truman's policymakers, particularly the State Department's
   Policy Planning Staff, to devise a coherent strategy to wage political
   warfare against communist regimes was fundamental to its ultimate
   failure. Also, the disordered US government bureaucracy further impaired
   and strategically dislocated the application and overall success of
   political warfare operations by the Office of Policy Coordination.},

Abstract = {The introduction of the Unified State Examination (USE) in Russian
   higher education has been the subject of much debate. One of the primary
   factors hindering the transition has been ambivalent public and
   professional perceptions of the effectiveness of the USE in addressing
   the problems associated with inequalities of access to higher education.
   This essay contributes to research in this area through a case study
   analysing the introduction of the USE in Ul'yanovsk Oblast'. It draws on
   survey data collected from pupils and parents of final year high school
   students about the USE reforms and explores the reasons why the
   transition to USE did not proceed as smoothly as its creators might have
   envisaged. Here the negative perceptions of the high-school graduates
   and parents reveal that the reforms have been judged to be largely
   ineffective with regard to reducing the role of material and regional
   inequalities in determining access to higher education, and in
   addressing how the differing institutional status of ordinary
   `comprehensive' and elite, specialised schools continues to create
   inequalities in access to higher education in Russia.},

Title = {The Scope and Limits of a Public-Private Hybrid: Dispute Settlement
   under NAFTA Chapter 19},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {17},
Number = {2},
Pages = {117-135},
Abstract = {Globalisation is often depicted as having led to an increase in private
   authority at the expense of that of the state. It is important to
   correctly specify the scope that private authority has achieved and the
   capacity of states to push back and limit that authority. This article
   grounds these theoretical issues in a discussion of the hybrid,
   public-private dispute settlement mechanism set up in the original
   Canada-US Free Trade Agreement (CUSTFA), and later extended into Chapter
   19 of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). It finds that
   privatising the enforcement process did make a difference. Trade experts
   on panels saw things differently to judges and in ways that were more
   sympathetic to exporters. This favoured Canadian and Mexican interests.
   However, the arrangement lacked deep roots. It was a late-stage
   compromise in trade negotiations. This rendered it vulnerable to a US
   counterattack once panels began to rule in favour of Canadian and
   Mexican challenges to US trade determinations. The transfer of
   quasi-judicial authority to a public-private hybrid proved contingent,
   partly on the hegemonic state's ongoing level of comfort with the
   arrangement, as well as on a lack of business consensus within the
   United States.},

Abstract = {This article explores how the US `war on drugs' depends on certain
   notions of femininity and womanhood. In particular, I examine how female
   drug couriers from the Americas are constructed at US border sites of
   international airports in the 1990s. I find that female drug couriers
   are described in terms of victims and vamps - a take off of the
   madonna/whore dichotomy. The victim and vamp discourses, I argue, are
   the performative enactments of a security state that operates according
   to a racialized logic of masculinist protection. I hold in tension the
   circulation of the victim/vamp discourses with the story of Paula, a
   Colombian woman who was caught trafficking heroin in hidden compartments
   of her suitcase. I use Paula's story to call attention to the political
   work in dismissing women as agents in the international drug trade.},

Year = {2012},
Volume = {3},
Pages = {49-78},
Abstract = {China needs to adopt a theoretical perspective that is different from
   that of the prevailing western theory of global governance. Such a
   theory with a Chinese perspective may be termed ``global governance at
   the national level{''}. It refers to global governance 1) transformed
   into transnational cooperation carried out at the domestic level, 2)
   exclusively focused upon the management of global issues and 3) deeply
   rooted in the effort to foster a civil society within China and develop
   grassroots democracy. China is practising such a type of global
   governance and providing the world with fresh and helpful experience and
   lessons: 1) a multi-actor, multi-departmental cooperation system is the
   basic form and effective mechanism for global governance; 2) while
   government still plays a leading role in global governance, the notions
   of power and management of government agencies and officials are
   undergoing constant change; 3) although global awareness and global
   values are clearly discernible in global governance, they are far from
   adequate for a global transformation; and 4) the evolvement of civic
   virtue and civil society organisations is a great asset created by
   global governance.},

Title = {An Emerging Challenge for Justice Sector Aid in Africa: Lessons from
   Mozambique on Legal Pluralism and Human Rights},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS PRACTICE},

Abstract = {This article discusses the role of justice sector aid in sub-Saharan
   Africa, and its implications for legal pluralism and the implementation
   of human rights at grass roots level. Based on a case study in
   Mozambique, the article argues that development actors can potentially
   play a crucial role in contributing to the implementation of human
   rights within the structures of dispute management that most people have
   access to in that country and in sub-Saharan Africa more generally.
   First, the article provides a theoretical framework on legal pluralism
   and human rights. Second, it outlines the Mozambican landscape in terms
   of human rights and access to justice. Third, it examines how justice
   sector aid in Mozambique deals with these challenges in practice. The
   concluding discussion demonstrates that it is vital to scrutinize how
   legal pluralism and human rights are conceptualized in aid
   interventions. It shows the drawbacks of policies and interventions that
   adopt a state-defined conception of legal pluralism and a one-off,
   unidirectional approach to the promotion of human rights. Finally, these
   strategies are contrasted with a number of initiatives that embrace an
   empirical understanding of legal pluralism and dialogical methodologies
   in relation to human rights.},

Abstract = {This article develops the notion of ``sustainable citizenship{''} and
   distinguishes it from more conventional forms of citizenship. The
   authors formulate indicators of the presence of sustainable citizenship
   among individuals, in corporations, and in nongovernmental organizations
   and apply those indicators in two empirical studies. The first study is
   of institutions (Fairtrade International, People for the Ethical
   Treatment of Animals, and The Walt Disney Company), and the second is of
   individuals, particularly those who practice political consumerism and
   vegetarianism. The studies show that citizenship is expanding in three
   significant ways: by addressing concerns about past and current
   injustices and their effects on the future (broadened temporal
   dimension); by addressing responsibilities worldwide, not just within
   one's country (broadened spatial dimension); and by adding a material
   dimension that emphasizes responsibility to nature and animals. The
   studies find that the development of sustainable citizenship is taking
   detours. In particular, self-interest often dominates its nonreciprocal
   or other-regarding concerns.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS PRACTICE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {4},
Number = {2},
Pages = {233-252},

Abstract = {Human rights are statements of values and putting them into practice can
   present a range of challenges. In Australia, these challenges are
   compounded by the widespread belief that human rights are only at issue
   somewhere else. In 2006 human rights legislation entitled the `Charter
   of Human Rights and Responsibilities Act', based on the British Human
   Rights Act, was introduced in the Australian state of Victoria, locating
   the acknowledgement of, and respect for, civil and political rights
   firmly `in our own backyard'. The Australian Centre for Human Rights
   Education (ACHRE) developed a teaching and training programme to assist
   the implementation of this legislation. In this practice note we analyse
   how ACHRE has used education to advance the civil and political rights
   covered by `the Charter' from guiding principles into practical
   applications in organizational settings. We explore the pedagogical
   approach by reviewing teaching and learning materials and participant
   responses to activities. We evaluate how effective the programme is in
   achieving understandings of how to apply human rights in local
   organizational contexts. We argue that the methodology is strengthened
   by using a human rights based approach to the design, documentation and
   application of course materials. This approach offers the potential for
   wide scale application of human rights values and principles in
   organizational settings. Importantly, it develops an understanding of
   human rights as relevant in local contexts.},

Title = {``Litterers{''}: How Objects of Physical Disorder Are Used to Construct

Abstract = {How do people get constructed as ``litterers{''} through objects of
   litter on the ground? Middle- and working-class white and black
   homeowners of the suburb under ethnographic study believe that litter is
   a significant problem in their community. Despite rarely seeing anyone
   actually litter, they develop folk theories that blame this problem on
   black, poor renters moving into the suburb. This article documents the
   structural features that sustain litter accumulation across different
   spaces. It then examines how longtime residents interpret these patterns
   and use their own behavior toward litter (picking it up) to claim a
   moral status for themselves as community insiders while constructing
   those they perceive as outsiders as disreputable litterers. The author
   considers the relationship between physical and social disorder as they
   construe it and the consequences of this process for theories of
   ecological contamination and the reinforcement of racial and class
   distinctions.},

Abstract = {The core argument of this article is to advocate the recognition of
   regional organizations as international actors. Conceptions of the
   European Union (EU) as an international actor are not new. However, a
   great deal of the literature regards the EU as sui generis in nature and
   lacking in external capabilities when compared to nation-states. Other
   regional organizations, such as the Association of Southeast Asian
   Nations (ASEAN) fare even worse. This article notes that we need to move
   beyond a state-centric view of world politics to assess the actor
   capabilities, nascent or advanced, of other players in the global arena,
   particularly regional organizations.},

Abstract = {Immigration and crime have received much popular and political attention
   in the past decade and have been a focus of episodic social attention
   for much of the history of the United States. Recent policy and legal
   discourse suggests that the stigmatic link between immigrants and crime
   has endured, even in the face of evidence to the contrary. This study
   addresses the relationship between immigration and crime in urban
   settings, focusing on areal units where immigrants tend to cluster
   spatially as well as socially. The authors ask whether immigration
   creates risks or benefits for neighborhoods in terms of lower crime
   rates. The question is animated in part by a durable claim in
   criminology that areas with large immigrant populations are burdened by
   elevated levels of social disorder and crime. In contrast, more recent
   theory and research suggest that ``immigrant neighborhoods{''} may
   simply be differentially organized and function in a manner that reduces
   the incidence of crime. Accordingly, this research investigates whether
   immigrants are associated with differences in area crime rates. In
   addition, the authors ask whether there are differences in the effects
   of immigration on neighborhood crime rates by the racial and ethnic
   makeup of the foreign-born populations. Finally, the authors examine the
   effects of immigration on patterns of enforcement.},

Abstract = {This article presents a new theory - the VCR (Values, political Culture
   and Rural society) model - to clarify what Norwegian Euroscepticism is
   really about and explain why so many Norwegians do not want their
   country to be a member of the European Union. It argues that at the
   centre of Norwegian Euroscepticism is a concern for post-materialist
   values, political culture and rural society, and that values (the desire
   to make Norway and the world a better place) is a much more potent
   explanation for Norwegian Euroscepticism than economic interest (the
   desire to make Norway a richer place) or perceived threat to Norwegian
   national identity. The VCR theory finds support in the empirical study
   conducted: a thematic analysis of newspaper debates in a major Norwegian
   newspaper from the 1960s, 1970s and 1990s. The findings also indicate
   that the Euroscepticism found in Norway in the 1990s is extremely
   similar to that which was formed during the first membership debates in
   the 1960s and 1970s. In addition to contributing towards the literature
   on Norway and the EU, the article makes a contribution to the general
   study of Euroscepticism by putting forward a new approach to studying
   and comparing the subject across time and across countries.},

Abstract = {This article critically examines the relationship between the human
   rights movement and armed groups. Drawing upon a wide array of case
   studies, it examines some of the most important legal and policy
   developments which have shaped this field since the 1980s. It also
   critically explores some of the theoretical and practical models of
   interventions which have been deployed by different human rights
   organizations concerning abuses by armed groups. The paper then explores
   the dilemmas of engagement with armed groups while managing the
   difficulties associated with conferring legitimacy on such groups. It
   also explores how human rights groups deal with the realities of the
   involvement of some armed groups in governance functions within their
   own communities. Finally, we identify two areas where we believe
   important future developments in this field could be directed: the
   framework of transitional justice, and the role of human rights
   organizations in navigating the increasingly blurred boundaries between
   some armed groups and organized crime.},

Abstract = {The post-2007 financial crisis created an opportunity for reforms that
   could close the regulatory gap between transnational banks and national
   bank resolution regimes. During the decade before the crisis, the
   European Union tried to develop a cross-border bank resolution regime
   relying on voluntary agreements and complex governance networks.
   However, these arrangements failed to commit national authorities to
   multilateral resolution as was exemplified by the case of Fortis. The
   crisis experience provided the Commission with an opportunity to propose
   legislation that would either deepen the pre-crisis co-ordinated regime,
   or replace it with an integrated resolution regime for systemically
   important cross-border banks. The Commission considered the more
   ambitious reforms, but after the experience with negotiations over the
   powers of European Supervisory Authorities, postponed the proposals for
   an integrated regime until after 2014. The initial round of post-crisis
   reforms thus remained limited to minimal improvements of the pre-crisis
   status quo.},

Abstract = {Representative democracy has been accorded constitutional status with
   the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty. The European Parliament (EP)
   and the history of its empowerment embody this constitutional principle
   and its gradual institutionalization. To shed light on the EP's
   empowerment and the institutionalization of the principle of
   representative democracy in the EU, this article adopts a domain of
   application approach. Instead of presenting rival theoretical approaches
   competing for explanatory superiority, the article shows that a more
   comprehensive picture of the EP's empowerment can be obtained by
   distinguishing between three types of institutional choice and
   associated explanations. Institutional creation, institutional change
   and institutional use are introduced as different types of institutional
   choice, and it is argued that each type gives primacy to particular
   explanatory mechanisms and dynamics to analyze the EP's empowerment.},
