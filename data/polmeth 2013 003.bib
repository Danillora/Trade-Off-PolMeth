Abstract = {The aim of this article is to study whether development aid shows some
   empirical association with the polarization of income in Latin America.
   The main hypothesis to be verified is that aid flows, focused on people
   in the lowest income brackets, could generate lower polarization. To
   examine this effect, the hypothesis is first inserted into a theoretical
   framework related to the transfer problem, and then define the indicator
   of income polarization and study their evolution in 18 countries between
   1990 and 2009. This is followed by an econometric regression using the
   Generalized Method of Moments system estimator. The main result is that
   aid shows a significant positive association with the polarization,
   which is interpreted as a lack of effectiveness in its focus on the
   lowest income decile or an inability to counter-rising incomes in the
   highest decile of income. In addition, polarization also appears
   positively associated with public spending and remittances and
   negatively with Conditional Cash Transfers.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the political and policy discourses of Quebec's
   integration toolkit for immigrants. With a focus on value codes for
   immigrants, I argue first, that recent debate on accommodation of
   immigrants and religious minorities resuscitates the dominant historical
   narrative of Quebec's fragility as a conquered settler colonial nation
   but where the major threat is defined as the cultural otherness of
   racialized immigrants and religious minorities. Second, such value codes
   instantiate a form of governmental strategy that combines neo-liberal
   and communitarian rationalities and insist on cultural assimilation as
   the price of entry into Quebec citizenship. Finally, the paper examines
   how Quebec's current national imaginary of the worrier nation' maps
   spatially onto the urban-rural divide.},

Abstract = {The scholarly turn to the unilateral presidency has expanded our
   understanding of the presidency and executive power, but, to date, this
   body of work has focused on presidents since the New Deal. This is
   somewhat surprising, given that many of the most well-known unilateral
   orders were issued before 1900. Rather than being isolated events, they
   are part of a longer list of unilateral presidential orders among early
   presidents that, as a group, have received little scholarly attention.
   This article seeks, first, to introduce ``settle down{''} proclamations
   (which are issued as warnings to the public) issued by presidents before
   Theodore Roosevelt as a way to further understand the development of
   executive power in the early presidency. Second, it uses these
   proclamations to test whether the findings of the unilateral presidency
   scholarship hold with respect to unilateral power before the twentieth
   century. The article concludes by comparing unilateral power to
   prerogative power and proposing a path for future research.},

Abstract = {Political involvement varies markedly across people. Traditional
   explanations for this variation tend to rely on demographic variables
   and self-reported, overtly political concepts. In this article, we
   expand the range of possible explanatory variables by hypothesizing that
   a correlation exists between political involvement and physiological
   predispositions. We measure physiology by computing the degree to which
   electrodermal activity changes on average when a participant
   sequentially views a full range of differentially valenced stimuli. Our
   findings indicate that individuals with higher electrodermal
   responsiveness are also more likely to participate actively in politics.
   This relationship holds even after the effects of traditional
   demographic variables are taken into account, suggesting that
   physiological responsiveness independently contributes to a fuller
   understanding of the underlying sources of variation in political
   involvement.},

Abstract = {In this article we examine what we call the president's invisible
   appointments. We designate Senior Executive Service and Schedule C
   appointees as invisible because, in lieu of a scandal, these appointees
   serve in the bureaucracy, generally with significantly less direct
   attention from the press or scholars. In addressing the invisible
   appointees, we use new data from an ongoing research project that
   collects and codes data from the resumes of political appointees in the
   George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations. In this article we
   examine data from the resumes of appointees serving in the Department of
   Labor during these two administrations. We describe the characteristics
   presidents consider when making appointments, explain which factors are
   most important for which positions, and compare the results to existing
   expectations about the factors presidents consider when making
   appointments.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},

Volume = {32},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Democratic representation involves tradeoffs between collective actors -
   political parties seeking to maximize seats - and individual actors -
   candidates seeking to use their personal vote-earning attributes (PVEAs)
   to maximize their own chance of election and reelection. We analyze
   these tradeoffs across three different electoral systems used at
   different times for the large-magnitude nationwide tier of Japan's House
   of Councillors. These electoral systems - closed and open-list
   proportional systems and the single non-transferable vote - differ in
   the extent to which they entail candidates seeking individual preference
   votes and in whether collective vote shares affect overall party
   performance. We use local resources as a proxy for PVEA and seek to
   determine the extent to which parties nominate ``locals{''} and how much
   the presence of such locals affects party performance at the level of
   Japan's prefectures. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Democracy and the Policy Preferences of Wealthy Americans},
Journal = {PERSPECTIVES ON POLITICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Pages = {51-73},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {It is important to know what wealthy Americans seek from politics and
   how (if at all) their policy preferences differ from those of other
   citizens. There can be little doubt that the wealthy exert more
   political influence than the less affluent do. If they tend to get their
   way in some areas of public policy, and if they have policy preferences
   that differ significantly from those of most Americans, the results
   could be troubling for democratic policy making. Recent evidence
   indicates that ``affluent{''} Americans in the top fifth of the income
   distribution are socially more liberal but economically more
   conservative than others. But until now there has been little systematic
   evidence about the truly wealthy, such as the top 1 percent. We report
   the results of a pilot study of the political views and activities of
   the top 1 percent or so of US wealth-holders. We find that they are
   extremely active politically and that they are much more conservative
   than the American public as a whole with respect to important policies
   concerning taxation, economic regulation, and especially social welfare
   programs. Variation within this wealthy group suggests that the top
   one-tenth of 1 percent of wealth-holders (people with \$40 million or
   more in net worth) may tend to hold still more conservative views that
   are even more distinct from those of the general public. We suggest that
   these distinctive policy preferences may help account for why certain
   public policies in the United States appear to deviate from what the
   majority of US citizens wants the government to do. If this is so, it
   raises serious issues for democratic theory.},

Abstract = {The paper analyses two sets of determinants, economic and non-economic,
   to assess the influence they exerted on migration in Central and Eastern
   Europe, from 2000 to 2010. In the category of economic factors we have
   analysed the doing business index and the labour market regulation
   index. In the category of non-economic factors we have included the
   judicial independence index and integrity of the legal system index.
   Since we are talking mainly of labour migration, we have considered that
   the two economic indicators are suitable for the research purposes.
   Besides these, the indicators that characterise judicial independence
   and legal system can be considered as indicators that reflect a certain
   level of freedom and democracy. The results show that these factors have
   limited influence on migration.},

Abstract = {After the end of World War II, East Asia gradually formed what can be
   referred to as a quasi-anarchical regional order. The quasi-anarchy
   system is defined by the anarchy system associated with a
   sub-hierarchical system, so this system possesses the characteristics of
   both anarchy and hierarchy in terms of security relations among states.
   The states in a quasi-anarchical order can be differentiated into three
   types according to the method through which they seek security. They
   comprise that of self-help states, the state that provides security
   guarantees to client states (security guarantor), and states that
   receive security protection from the security guarantor (client states)
   within the quasi-anarchy. The standard security relationship between
   states consists of two types: the first is a competitive security
   relationship; the second is a security-dependent relationship. The
   quasi-anarchical order in East Asia has restricted the continuance and
   positive effect of a rising China's reassurance policy through three
   mechanisms: dependence, reliance on support, and imitation.},

Abstract = {This article examines the extent to which individual-, party- and
   system-level characteristics affect the attitude congruence of voters
   and candidates for elections to the European Parliament. It examines
   attitudes towards basic policy packages in the socioeconomic and
   libertarian/authoritarian issue domains and on immigration and European
   Union integration. The analysis is based on the 2009 European Election
   Study and European Election Candidate Survey, which covered 27 countries
   of the European Union (EU), 162 parties and over 11,500 respondents. It
   shows that the European Parliament suffers from inequalities in
   representation for different groups of citizens, representing much
   better the attitudes of educated, middle-class and politically
   knowledgeable voters. Furthermore, the analysis uncovers significant
   differences across political parties in how well they match up to
   voters. We provide tentative evidence suggesting that voters are better
   represented in open and ordered ballot systems.},

Abstract = {Despite the growing preoccupation with Russia since the early modern
   era, the Western public still sees the country as deeply alien. Media
   coverage is not solely responsible for this; so is academia. This view
   is based in part on real differences in spatiality, politics, and the
   history of ideas and in part on stubborn stereotypes in perceptions at
   home and abroad. Only critical examination of such cliches and
   essentialist attributions opens our eyes to what in fact lies hidden
   behind the alleged large ``other{''}.},

Title = {Czech Senate Electoral Districts},
Journal = {POLITOLOGICKY CASOPIS-CZECH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Number = {2},
Pages = {139-156},
Abstract = {The members of the Czech Senate, the upper chamber of the Czech
   Parliament, are elected every six years through a two-round majority
   system in 81 single-seat electoral districts, with one-third of the
   chamber up for election every two years. District boundaries are set by
   a law which stipulates they must be modified by amendment if the number
   of inhabitants in any district diverges more than 15 \% from the
   average. Recently, these changes have been carried out every two years
   shortly before the regular election is announced, and the number of
   districts affected by changes is gradually increasing. The extent of
   these changes, however, is usually very small, which makes later changes
   necessary. During last ten years, many districts have been changed more
   multiple times. It follows that the Samuels-Snyder index of
   malapportionment has increased from 0.0289 in 1996 to 0.0346 in 2010.
   Moreover, during the last electoral cycle, the 15\% limit was not in
   fact observed in four of the 81 districts. Moreover, the criterion
   chosen for district size is not an optimal one, as it fails to take into
   account the uneven distribution of minors and foreigners, who do not
   have voting rights. In fact, the percentage of minors and foreigners in
   various districts varies in the interval <-2.3\%; 2.8\%> and <-2.8 \%;
   6.8\%>, respectively. This affects the weight of votes in various
   districts accordingly. Besides the problems with malapportionment, the
   law does not provide for any prevention of gerrymandering. Although
   there is no strong evidence of gerrymandering being used so far, at
   least one attempt in this respect was made in 2008. The article analyzes
   the law and its outcome and suggests some modifications to the law.},

Abstract = {In the interdisciplinary field of Law and Anthropology addresses are:
   the recognition of the right of self-determination to the peoples in the
   twentieth century; the implications on the concepts of people and State;
   reasons drawn by the new States and the socialists to deny this right to
   indigenous peoples; criticism of anthropology to social evolutionism
   legitimizing colonialism and unequal treatment between peoples and
   States of central and peripheral; genesis of the difference between
   them; the debate on the application of the right of self-determination,
   set in the UN Charter; the update semantics which allowed the
   application in situations of internal colonization; the XXI century,
   indigenous peoples, the UN Declaration of 2007 and the democratic
   system; using the method of analysis of applicable international legal
   instruments, the anthropological literature and international law as
   well as data and information obtained directly with indigenous peoples,
   with the aim of contributing to debate on the topic from the perspective
   of the right to difference, concluding that the update semantics in the
   XXI century studied law extends the indigenous peoples who should enjoy
   internal self-determination in democratic States and access the external
   self-determination.},

Abstract = {A vast literature argues that the majority party in most legislatures
   enjoys a policymaking advantage through its access to gatekeeping
   institutions that let it block bills from reaching the floor. However,
   agenda-setting institutions vary substantially across legislatures. We
   propose that this variation should have demonstrable consequences for
   the majority party's influence. In this article, we develop hypotheses
   about the institutional features of legislatures that enable the
   majority party to block bills. Then, we canvass all 99 U. S. state
   legislative chambers to measure whether those institutions are present
   and test whether they lower the rate at which the majority party is
   rolled. We find that in legislatures where majority-appointed committees
   can decline to hear bills or decline to report them to the floor, or
   where the majority leadership can block bills from appearing on the
   calendar, majority roll rates are significantly lower than in
   legislatures where those veto points are absent.},

Title = {The Legalization of Dispute Resolution in Mercosur},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS IN LATIN AMERICA},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {5},
Number = {3},
Pages = {97-132},
Abstract = {The Southern Common Market (Mercosur), the world's fourth-largest
   trading bloc, represents an intriguing yet under-researched case of a
   regional organization which has made significant advances in regional
   integration in the past decades, legalization being a central dimension
   of its integration process. In 2002, Mercosur's dispute settlement
   system was substantially revised by its four member states. Up until
   then, disputes among member states had been resolved by diplomatic
   negotiations and ad hoc tribunals with limited independence from the
   member-state governments. The reforms mark a significant advance in the
   legalization of this regional organization: a standing court with a more
   independent judiciary and improved access to the court's jurisdiction
   was established. In order to account for the shift towards more
   legalization of Mercosur, this article presents a rational
   institutionalist explanation and develops hypotheses about states'
   preferred levels of legalization (why), an account of the ``timing{''}
   of qualitative shifts in legalization (when), and the institutional form
   that legalization decisions take (how).},

Abstract = {The article explores interaction in the U.S.-Turkey-France triangle on
   military and political issues related to the rejoining of NATO military
   organization by France in 2009. This analysis is important to clarify
   the level of NATO coherence, speed of the emergence of polycentric world
   and to forecast behavior of these three partners.
   The article studies differences in doctrines and approaches of the three
   countries to the Iranian, Syrian, Libyan and Afghan crises. In regards
   to each of the crises interests of three countries are identified, which
   define their poitions. The authors come to the conclusion that existing
   differences are not deep and reflect divergent rather than antagonistic
   interests.},

Abstract = {One of the biggest problem in OSCE election observation methodology
   concerns the selection of polling stations where the observation is
   conducted: in practice, polling stations that are visited by observers
   are disproportionally urban and located in or around the national
   capital and in regional centers. Because visited polling stations are
   not representative of all polling stations, the observation mission
   risks getting an unbalanced picture of the shortcomings in the election.
   In this article, we present findings from original research that shed

Abstract = {During the last thirty years, the researchers working within the
   orientation known as ``pragmatic sociology{''} have produced a
   considerable amount of empirical investigations relating to all areas of
   social life. In accordance with the theoretical and methodological
   assumptions they intended to defend, they have developed significantly
   new ways to conduct their inquiries, to collect data, to explore their
   fields, to think through the cases and controversies they used as entry
   points to explore the social order and its always problematic
   reproduction. The aim of this paper is to characterize by highlighting
   ten points the pragmatic style in sociology and to specify what are its
   methodological requisites and practical implications in the conduct of
   research.},

Abstract = {This documentary research analyzes how the Constitutional Chamber of the
   Venezuelan Supreme Court, when interpreting the content and scope of the
   concept of democracy in the exercise of jurisdictional function, is an
   institution that influences politics, specifically, when it resolves
   disputes concerning electoral processes. This research studies certain
   judgments of the Constitutional Chamber, selected for their legal and
   political significance, which comes from the circumstances in which they
   were issued and because they have been a landmark case or have repeated
   or modified a previous criterion. The existing relationships are
   determined between the decisions of the Constitutional Chamber, in which
   it develops its concept of democracy as a principle in certain contexts,
   and the political effects of these judgments on elections. Conclusions
   are that the political role of the Constitutional Chamber is so
   important that it can affect even institutional factors of voting.},

Abstract = {Voter turnout has consistently declined since the 1980s across a wide
   range of advanced democracies. Much of this decline appears to be the
   result of young people abstaining. In this article the authors test two
   arguments for this trend. The first rests on the claim that the
   character of elections has changed, specifically that elections have
   become less competitive and that young people's propensities for voting
   are particularly negatively affected by this. The second maintains that
   recent generations have different values and that these value
   differences explain turnout declines. The authors test these two
   explanations using three different data sets: (a) individual-level and
   election-specific data from 83 elections in eight countries since the
   1950s, (b) longitudinal individual-level and district-level data from
   British elections for the period 1974-2005, and (c) panel data from
   American presidential elections. The findings provide strong evidence
   for the generational value change argument, whereas the authors find
   scant support for the competition argument.},

Abstract = {The article discusses versions of spontaneous order that emerged in the
   small towns of the Far East against the background of the state control
   weakening, types of confrontation arising from the ``return{''} of the
   dirigiste state as well as the conditions under which such confrontation
   might end up with the interests reconciliation. It is shown that
   although state and local communities interests are rarely the same, such
   a situation does not necessarily produce conflict. The decisive factor
   here is an institutional opportunity to articulate community specialty
   and interests that in its turn hinges upon the availability of a legal
   and legitimate ``negotiator{''} as well as space for negotiations.
   However, the long-term alignment of interests is hindered by
   inarticulate interests of the state itself. Such circumstances make it
   extremely difficult to avoid the perception of the state version of the
   public weal as a form of structural violence.},

Abstract = {Dominant party systems are defined by a lack of party alternation at the
   national level; however, dominant party systems do not inherently
   preclude electoral competition at the macro level, the micro level, or
   both. Nonetheless, little systematic work has documented the
   competitiveness of elections under a dominant party system. This article
   describes the nature of competition under one of sub-Saharan Africa's
   most enduring dominant party systems, Botswana. By examining electoral
   outcomes at the constituency level, this article demonstrates that
   elections in Botswana produce significant levels of competition,
   especially when compared to other sub-Saharan countries. Furthermore,
   electoral competitiveness appears unrelated to the party system at
   large: namely, competitiveness is no less or greater under dominant
   party systems than under multiparty systems.},

Title = {Why Do Military Regimes Institutionalize? Constitution-making and
   Elections as Political Survival Strategy in Myanmar},
Journal = {ASIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {21},
Number = {2},
Pages = {105-125},
Abstract = {In recent years Myanmar underwent drastic political changes. While many
   see these changes as first tentative steps towards democratization, we
   argue that the current political transformation is not a deliberate
   process of liberalization, but a survival strategy of the military
   regime. Using arguments of the `new institutionalism' as a theoretical
   foundation, this article explores the hypothesis that the high degree of
   professionalization of the Burmese military creates the incentive to
   institutionalize power-sharing among the ruling elite. Our empirical
   analysis finds evidence for both a highly professionalized military and
   institutions that by securing the military's continuing dominance serve
   the purpose of institutionalizing military power-sharing. These results
   imply that further democratization is unlikely as it must be initiated
   from within the still dominating military itself.},

Abstract = {The Internet is often singled out as the key means through which
   extremists and terrorists are radicalised. Yet, argue Charlie Edwards
   and Luke Gribbon, research thus far has fallen short of unearthing the
   actual mechanisms through which this radicalisation takes place. Using
   examples from a wider study, they explore different ways in which
   individuals have used the Internet in their processes of radicalisation
   and point out that policy- makers and researchers need to focus their
   efforts on understanding not merely the content that is available
   online, but the ways in which this content is used in the process of
   radicalisation.},

Pages = {177-211},
Abstract = {This paper utilised a combination of explicit and implicit techniques to
   investigate the ways in which children aged 5-16 from two small European
   nation-states develop in-group favouritism, and positive and/or negative
   attitudes towards other nation-states. The study adopted a combination
   of data collection approaches to gain greater evaluation of variability
   in the responses obtained. Data were analysed statistically for both
   quantitative and qualitative data. The findings show self-regulation of
   overt negativity and clearly demonstrate some disquieting outcomes. It
   poses questions of the extent to which social norms of xenophobia and
   racism disseminated to children through access to an adult directed
   media; and what interventions might diminish out-group negativity and
   prejudice whilst maintaining a level of in-group favouritism that
   delivers personal self-esteem, and provides the basis for national
   regard that does not compromise the rights of others.},

   fact timely warned Spanish diplomats about the need to change their
   approach in relation to Ceuta, Melilla and the Canary Islands. insofar
   as sensitive questions should be avoided.. To that end, Spain had to

Pages = {348-361},
Abstract = {Nowadays it is commonplace to argue that candidates' personal
   characteristics play a large part in determining how individuals vote.
   In the domain of political marketing this assumption is often given for
   granted, and no clear conceptual understanding of how image crafting
   techniques affect voters has emerged. This article is an attempt to link
   political marketing's concern for impression management strategies with
   our knowledge of leader effects in democratic elections. A
   counterfactual analysis of post-election survey data from the last three
   Italian elections demonstrates that political candidates can actually
   gain votes-and at times win elections-due to the way in which their
   personality profile is perceived by voters.},

Title = {Venezuela in Unasur: regional integration and political discourse},
Journal = {DESAFIOS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1},
Pages = {129-163},
Month = {JAN-JUN},
Abstract = {The behavior of Venezuela in Unasur can be understood from the
   perspective of the regional integration policy and the political
   discourse of its government (2004-2012). The first one highlights the
   objectives (interests) of that policy and how they converge or diverge
   from those of another powerful actor - Brazil. Analysis of the political
   discourse of the government shows the ideas behind its integration
   policy and also to what extent they have been incorporated in Unasur.

Abstract = {Sahrawi contemporary literature cannot be understood in isolation from
   its insertion and evolution context. Such context is marked by the
   tragic experience of the war against Morocco and the exile in Algeria;
   the long period of studies of the Sahrawi youth in Cuba; and the later
   migration process to Spain. These experiences contribute to the
   development of a rich Sahrawi literature where diverse cultures coexist
   in perfect harmony: Arab, Caribbean and European. In this text, the
   influence exerted by literature and migration in the vital experience of
   the Sahrawi writers related to the literary group known as La Generacio
   de la Amistad (The Friendship Generation) is analysed. Currently, this
   group is regarded as the main reference of Sahrawi contemporary
   literature in Spanish language.},

Abstract = {As tax policy is one of the most prominent issues for France at a time
   of great economic crisis and public debt, this article analyses how
   redistribution has been viewed and considered by voters. Assuming three
   main hypotheses about attitudes towards redistribution (egotropic
   perspective, sociotropic perspective and voter incompetence), we propose
   a series of empirical tests of these various explanations from a
   cross-sectional survey fielded after the election. Despite a rather low
   salience of this issue during the campaign, we show that voters
   demonstrate quite coherent attitudes in this area. Preferences for
   redistribution are linked to individuals' socio-economic positions, to
   their beliefs about the effects of taxation, and lead to consistent vote
   decisions in 2012.},

Abstract = {One of the most remarkable democratic developments in Europe in recent
   decades has been the empowerment of the only directly elected
   supranational assembly in the world: the European Parliament (EP). We
   first review the development of the legislative powers of the EP
   vis-a-vis the other European Union (EU) institutions, discussing the
   theoretical models of the power of the EP and the main empirical methods
   that have been used to evaluate these models. We then turn to the impact
   of the growing power of the EP on political organization and behavior
   inside the legislature. We demonstrate that the ``electoral
   connection{''} is weak and discuss what this means for understanding
   legislative politics in the EP. The concluding section demonstrates
   differences in behavior across policy areas, which have received scant
   attention, and suggests avenues for further research.},

Abstract = {Barak D. Hoffman and James D. Long, Parties, Ethnicity, and Voting in
   African Elections Standard theories about elections in Africa suggest
   that they are little more than ethnic headcounts. Data from an exit poll
   conducted on Election Day in Ghana's 2008 election challenge this view.
   The two main parties, the National Democratic Congress (NDC) and the New
   Patriotic Party (NPP), drew support from many ethnic groups; and there
   was little evidence of ethnic block voting. Rather, voters' beliefs
   about the parties and incumbent performance were the main determinants
   of vote choice. Evaluations of the attributes of the NDC and NPP shaped
   the outcome of Ghana's 2008 election far more than the ethnic identity
   of the candidates. These results hold important implications for
   understanding voting, parties, and government performance in multiethnic
   democracies.},

Title = {Nationalist and Power-Seeking Leadership Preferences in
   Ethno-Territorial Conflicts: Theory, a Measurement Framework, and
   Applications to the Breakup of Yugoslavia},
Journal = {CIVIL WARS},

Volume = {15},

Abstract = {Theoretically, variation in leadership preferences is often taken to be
   an important predictor of ethno-territorial conflict outcomes. Yet there
   is a significant gap when it comes to applying this theory. Case studies
   do not take a consistent approach to measuring leadership preferences,
   while statistical research tends to omit the variable altogether. This
   paper suggests a standardized approach to measuring leadership
   preferences along two dimensions - a dimension that captures the weight
   given to achieving ideal nationalist goals as against minimizing
   conflict costs and downside conflict risks, and a dimension that
   indicates how much intrinsic nationalist goals are valued relative to
   the goal of taking and maintaining political power. The resulting
   measurement template is then applied to seven potential
   ethno-territorial conflicts in Yugoslavia in the early 1990s. These
   cases indicate that leadership preferences may help to explain
   ethno-territorial conflict outcomes and, at the same time, are sometimes
   not well predicted by other important variables, such as the balance of
   power and the pre-conflict status quo.},

Abstract = {The history of 20th century Iran is dominated by reoccurring episodes of
   civic struggles in the face of three successive authoritarian regimes -
   Qajar, Pahlavi and the Islamic Republic. ! is century also saw two
   defining moments in Iranian history: the Constitutional Revolution 1906
   and the Islamic Revolution of 1979. Although these revolutions were
   preceded by violent and nondemocratic regimes, they created positive and
   concrete consequences. The first revolution was significant because it
   ushered in a protracted period of modernization, culminating in the
   implementation of liberal reforms. And while the Islamic Revolution has
   seen an unprecedented centralization of the state, it has led to the
   strengthening of civil society, opening the door for viable democratic
   movements.},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Why do governmental institutions look as they do, and who controls them?
   International relations scholars often point to states. However,
   two-thirds of today's intergovernmental organizations (IGOs) were
   created not by states alone, but with participation by international
   bureaucrats working in preexisting IGOs. International bureaucrats'
   design activities can be modest or proactive. Meanwhile, their interests
   differ from states' interests: insulating their organizational family
   from state intervention facilitates international bureaucrats' pursuit
   of material security, legitimacy, and policy advancement. The more
   proactive the design activities of international bureaucrats, I argue,
   the more insulated the resulting institution will be from mechanisms of
   state control (e. g., financial monopolization or veto power).
   Statistical analyses of an original dataset support the prediction and
   are robust to alternative specifications as well as approaches to
   control for endogeneity. The implications-concerning institutional
   design, principal-agent relationships, bureaucratic autonomy, and
   democratic deficits-go far beyond international relations.},

Abstract = {The seizure of Goma by the Mouvement du 23 Mars rebellion in November
   2012 has precipitated a review of the peace strategy implemented in the
   Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and the Great Lakes region thus
   far. As a result, the Congolese government and other peace stakeholders
   in the Great Lakes region and beyond signed the Addis Ababa Peace and
   Security Cooperation (PSC) Framework in February 2013, paving the way to
   the adoption, a month later, of Resolution 2098 by the United Nations
   (UN) Security Council. Notwithstanding the constructive criticisms these
   two policy documents have received due to, amongst other things, the
   shortcomings they may harbour, this article argues that the Addis Ababa
   PSC Framework and Resolution 2098 have the potential of instilling a new
   dynamics into the search for peace and stability in the DRC and the
   Great Lakes region. Rather than dismissing them for their possible
   inadequacies, these two policy documents ought to be embraced as
   important stepping stones in the much needed overhaul of the peace
   strategy that has dominated peacemaking and peacebuilding initiatives in
   the DRC and the Great Lakes region in the past two decades.},

Number = {6},
Pages = {8+},
Abstract = {The author promotes the hypothesis, according to which the variety of
   political systems is the consequence of differences in the behavior of
   people belonging to differing human communities. Decisive role in the
   formation of a political system is assigned to the patterns of people's
   behavior in situations when the problem in question is establishment of
   power. These patterns of behavior differ in the character of resorting
   to aggression. It is the proportion of frequencies of the said patterns
   of behavior met within a given human population that determines the type
   of its political system. Political systems of only one type are
   compatible with institutions of property rights.},

Journal = {AFRICAN JOURNAL ON CONFLICT RESOLUTION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {13},
Number = {3},
Pages = {21-43},
Abstract = {In the old South Africa, with its inhabitants divided into two worlds by
   an ideology-driven white minority, H. W. van der Merwe was one of the
   first white Afrikaners who took the risk of crossing the boundary which
   in the culture of his own group was upheld as divinely ordained. On
   account of the radical change in his socio-political convictions, and
   his resulting research and teaching, he was appointed as director of an
   institution aiming at improving intergroup relations through applied
   research and educational programmes. He also took the lead in founding
   an association for conflict intervention. His remarkable contribution to
   the anti-apartheid struggle and the eventual resolving of the
   white-black conflict was not only a structural one, however, but also an
   interrelated attitudinal one. His outreaching understanding and his
   courageous quest for justice and peace enabled him to bring adversaries
   together, and also to confront the unflinching guardians of apartheid.
   It behoves us, therefore, to celebrate his example and to emulate it in
   our current context.
   We may be grateful for the degree to which transition has already taken
   shape in the new South Africa, but so much remains to be done to
   minimise sociocultural distances between sectors of fellow-South
   Africans. H.W.' s legacy may indeed help us to respect `them' and `us'
   where appropriate, but also to promote an `all of us' orientation as far
   as fellow-humanly possible.},

Abstract = {In the first part I try to elucidate and justify in my own way the
   consistency of a linguistic-pragmatic and transcendental perspective, as
   first introduced by Karl-Otto Apel. I sum up this philosophical approach
   (largely developed in a constant critical debate with Jurgen Habermas)
   under the short title Transzendentalpragmatik. In the second part I
   intend not simply to apply the approach developed in the first part, but
   to use it as a critical-regulative idea in order to offer a less
   abstractive and more geohistorically adequate concept of law, which does
   not identify (valid) law with a necessarily unitary and distinct system
   of prescriptive norms, made possible by the modern
   national/constitutional State. I term such a concept of law a
   jurisdictional one.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ELECTIONS PUBLIC OPINION AND PARTIES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {23},

Pages = {1-26},
Abstract = {The extent to which citizens vote in accordance with their own
   principles and priorities has been proposed as an important measure of a
   democracy's health. This article introduces a new method of evaluating
   the ability of individuals to vote for the political party with policy
   positions closest to their own - to vote ``correctly{''}. Following Lau
   and Redlawsk (1997), a ``correct vote{''} is defined as the vote choice
   individuals would make under conditions of perfect information. In other
   words, a vote is ``correct{''} if it is cast for the party that a voter
   should vote for, based upon a fully informed comparison of his or her
   policy positions with those of the parties contesting an election.
   Voters' policy preferences are estimated here using election study data,
   and the positions of parties are derived through data from the
   Comparative Manifestos Project. For illustrative purposes, this new
   method is applied to the 2004 Canadian federal election. Correct voting
   rates are calculated by comparing voter and party positions in seven
   dimensions of political competition, accounting for the relative
   importance of each dimension. While this study's data are exclusively
   Canadian, the approach introduced is applicable to other settings.},

Abstract = {We examine how special interests, measured by campaign contributions
   from the mortgage industry, and constituent interests, measured by the
   share of subprime borrowers in a congressional district, may have
   influenced U. S. government policy toward subprime mortgage credit
   expansion from 2002 to 2007. Beginning in 2002, mortgage industry
   campaign contributions increasingly targeted U. S. representatives from
   districts with a large fraction of subprime borrowers. During the
   expansion years, mortgage industry campaign contributions and the share
   of subprime borrowers in a congressional district increasingly predicted
   congressional voting behavior on housing related legislation. Such
   patterns do not hold for non-mortgage financial industry. The evidence
   suggests that both subprime mortgage lenders and subprime mortgage
   borrowers influenced government policy toward subprime mortgage credit
   expansion.},

   American resorts clustered primarily in Greene County, New York, it
   demonstrates that ethnicity continued to shape the social and cultural
   lives of many European immigrant New Yorkers and their families well
   after World War II. Ethnic resorts provided vacationers with an
   insulated recreational environment in which group identity and
   transatlantic ties - both real and imagined - could be fostered and
   sustained. However, the flexibility of these ethnic identities and the
   pervasive discrimination against African Americans at ethnic resorts in
   the 1940s and 1950s reveals the extent to which European Americans had
   largely internalized a sense of white ethnic identity by the postwar
   decades. The history of ethnic resorts in the Catskills sheds light on
   the process by which generations of European Americans in New York City
   negotiated these multiple ethnic, national, and racial identities.},

Abstract = {The key to analyse the behaviour of Morocco in the Western Sahara
   conflict lies in the articulation of its international and internal
   management. Four stages can be distinguished between 1999 and 2013: 1)
   political opening and relative waning of repression in the territory
   under Rabat's control, and progress of the idea of a third way in both
   the internal and the international sphere (1999-2003); 2) crisis of the
   Moroccan negotiating strategy (rejection of the Baker Plan II) and
   explicit abandonment of the referendum option (2003-2006); 3) commitment
   to integration or reconciliation policies towards the Saharawi
   population and regaining of the international initiative with the
   Autonomy Plan (2006-2008): and 4) new increase in domestic repression
   and loss of positions in foreign policy (2009-).},

Abstract = {The metropolitan area of Greater Buenos Aires (Argentina) is often
   highly praised for its electoral weight and also suspected of
   clientelism. While studies of voting behavior and sub- national have
   been developed in several directions, there is much written about the
   local voting explanatory models. This paper proposes, from different
   statistical regression models, make a contribution in this direction
   through the testing of ideas of socio-oriented national vote and
   incumbent local effects. On that basis, will consider an explanation of
   voting behavior local representative called juxtaposed trying to shed
   the most stigmatizing and less founded on the grounds of the local vote

   clearly a very remarkable, if still highly uneven, process of capitalist
   development taking place in the global south. Nowhere was this clearer
   than with the integration of China into global capitalism. At the same
   time, the severity and duration of the latest crisis in a global
   capitalist economy that the American state had been so central to
   constructing has, unsurprisingly, led to a resurgence of pronouncements
   that US hegemony was coming to an end. China's entry into the circuits
   of the international economy, many commentators now predicted, marked a
   fundamental ``reorientation{''} of the global capitalist order. However,
   far from displacing the American empire, China rather seems to be
   duplicating Japan's supplemental role in terms of providing the steady
   inflow of funds needed to sustain the US's primary place in global
   capitalism. Were this to change, it would require deeper and much more
   liberalized financial markets within China, which would entail
   dismantling the capital controls that are key pillars of Communist Party
   rule. Furthermore, a major reorientation of Chinese patterns of
   investment and production away from exports towards domestic consumption
   would have incalculable implications for the social relations that have
   sustained China's rapid growth and global integration. In this regard,
   though the outcome of the working class struggles now underway in China
   cannot be known, this cannot but impinge on, and possibly even be
   affected by, the direction working classes elsewhere take out of the
   current crisis.},

Abstract = {After six years in power, 2012 marked the pinnacle of the accumulation
   of political power for Rafael Correa. In addition to an assertive
   foreign policy and dominance over the legislative branch, the president
   was able to exercise widespread control over the judicial branch and the
   media. Under Correa's leadership, Ecuador has benefitted from an
   increase in social spending, achieving a reduction in poverty and
   unemployment. Yet these policies have created a large fiscal deficit
   that the country is financing through commercial agreements with China.
   This and other events, such as protests in the oil-producing Oriente,
   presage possible limits on the sustainability of current policies.
   However, the short-term is bright for Correa, thanks to his economic
   achievements, the weakness of a credible opposition, and his control of
   state institutions. The success of the ``Citizen's Revolution{''}
   manifested itself in the 2013 elections, which resulted in the
   re-election of the president as well as a legislative supermajority.},

Pages = {49-54},
Abstract = {The deterrence mechanism is based on increasing the costs of terrorism
   or other crimes by (threat of) punishment, retaliation or other social
   sanctions, aiming at reducing the motivation to carry out such acts.
   Measures are generally repressive, such as imprisonment, violent force
   and other sanctions. The police, criminal justice system and military
   forces are main actors. However, diplomatic and economic sanctions have
   also been used against states sponsoring terrorists. Deterrence has
   generally been more effective against such states than against highly
   motivated terrorists, whose decision making is often based on different
   rationalities. The use of military reprisals after terrorist attacks has
   frequently been justified as means of deterrence but the side effects
   are grave and have often turned out to be counter-productive,
   reinforcing a spiral of violence.},

Pages = {129-147},
Abstract = {Why have commercial financial flows-as a major force in contemporary
   society with a number of significant problematic consequences-attracted
   relatively little effective public-interest response from civil society?
   Change-oriented nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), labour unions,
   faith-based organizations, and other social movements have mostly
   remained in the shadows vis-a-vis private financial markets. Impacts
   from these citizen associations have not gone beyond promoting modest
   rises in public awareness, certain limited policy shifts, and minor
   institutional reforms of a few public governance agencies. The reasons
   for these scant achievements are partly related to capacities and
   practices in civil society groups, relevant governance agencies, and
   financial firms. Also important in constraining civil society impacts to
   reform and transform contemporary financial markets are deeper
   structural circumstances such as embedded social hierarchies (among
   countries, classes, etc.), the pivotal role of finance capital in
   accumulation processes today, and the entrenchment of prevailing
   neoliberal policy discourses.},

Abstract = {The present article provides a summary of the most important political
   events in the United States during 2012. It offers a discussion of the
   economic crisis and the main domestic and international issues. The
   focus of attention, however, is on the most relevant event of the year:
   the general elections that led to the reelection of Barack Obama as well
   as on the electoral campaign and election results. I advance an
   interpretation of the Democratic victory and the resulting divided
   government based on key notions about political polarization, the
   transformation of the American median voter, the social coalition behind
   Obama's reelection, and the effect of gerrymandering on congressional
   districts.},

Abstract = {Twenty years since the onset of the traumatic wars of Yugoslav
   secession, the countries of the Western Balkans continue to nurture
   narratives of the past that are mutually exclusive, contradictory, and
   irreconcilable. The troubling ways in which states in the region
   remember their pasts provide continuing obstacles in the search for
   acknowledgment and justice. In this essay, I develop an argument for
   understanding the relationship between justice and remembrance of the
   past. To illustrate this relationship, I explore ways in which education
   and memorialization projects contribute to justice efforts. I critically
   analyze a few ongoing education and memory projects in the region, and
   then present alternative ideas on mechanisms of public memory that would
   be more conducive to building the foundational blocks of justice based
   on trust, respect, and dignity.},

Abstract = {This paper starts out from a puzzle. During the past thirty years,
   incomes have grown more unequal, a small group at the top has captured a
   much greater share of resources and poverty has increased. Despite this,
   most people are markedly less likely to want government to redistribute
   income or tackle poverty and are less sympathetic towards those without
   jobs. The greater insecurity of many people's lives in the current
   crisis renders the issue more perplexing. This paper describes trends in
   inequality, poverty and unemployment; presents new data on attitudes,
   media discussion and political platforms; discusses theoretical
   approaches from social psychologists, political scientists, sociologists
   and other commentators; and considers how a more generous welfare state
   might be pursued.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL POWER},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {6},
Number = {2},
Pages = {179-199},
Abstract = {In this paper, I develop a functionalist theory of social domination to
   compete with current theories of this kind of social power that have
   arisen with and from the work of Philip Pettit. In the latter view, the
   basic structure of domination is seen as the capacity for `arbitrary
   interference' of one agent in the life choices of another agent.
   According to this account, domination is performed by agents, acting
   arbitrarily, within structured social relationships, but is not seen as
   being caused by those social structures or systems themselves. On my
   alternative account, modern forms of domination need to be seen as
   outside of the interests of agents themselves and instead as part of the
   functions of the social systems and institutions within which agents are
   socialized, live, work, and to which they become adapted. In this view,
   domination becomes not a property of agency, but a central property of
   the social facts that make up the process of socialization itself.
   Domination is social and systemic, in this sense, and it persists
   because of the particular social forms that are held as legitimate by
   broad segments of any population.},

Abstract = {Japan's foreign and defence policy is changing in response to new
   developments in the regional security environment and in the wider
   international arena. As Tokyo looks to strengthen its relationship with
   Western partners and especially NATO, the EU and their member states,
   the UK appears a natural choice both in itself and as a link to Europe.
   Michito Tsuruoka analyses the many strategic considerations driving
   Japan's efforts to build stronger partnerships in the defence and
   security field and explores what the UK can do to strengthen its
   engagement in Asia.},

Abstract = {The article addresses the process of transitional justice developed in
   the Southern Cone of Latin America after the term of recent
   authoritarian regimes. The main aim is to analyze the different
   strategies adopted by the post-authoritarian civilian governments in the
   fields of truth, memory and justice for the confrontation the legacy of
   human rights violations of the military dictatorships in Brazil
   (1964-85) and in Argentina (1976-83). Our hypothesis is that political
   context of redemocratization was decisive in shaping the dynamics of
   transitional justice in those countries. The text aims, even,
   theoretically discuss the foundations of the idea of transitional
   justice and the possible policy implications of truth and justice for
   democratic deepening.},

Abstract = {A common threat to democratic politics in developing countries is state
   interference with the independent media. Despite the importance of this,
   we know very little about when and why governments attack the media. In
   this study we explain media harassment in Africa with a theory focusing
   on varying government incentives to control information over time. We
   propose that media harassment will increase when governments face
   threats to maintaining power or undertake extraordinary efforts to
   consolidate power. Leveraging an original dataset that covers 15 years
   and 23 countries, our findings offer support for this. Media harassment
   increases when governments are faced with major protests, coup plots,
   and conflict onsets and when they are seeking to amend constitutions in
   ways that increase or extend their power.},

Abstract = {Engaging students with material associated with public budgeting
   processes can be a challenge. Our experience in an interdisciplinary

   including increased student engagement and strengthening
   student-learning outcomes, while offering a vehicle with which to
   explore significant policy issues. The effort described here draws on
   literature from both political science and education. It offers an
   approach that is adaptable and that can be used to encourage significant
   engagement from students with variable levels of prior experience and

   Campaigning?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ELECTIONS PUBLIC OPINION AND PARTIES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {23},
Number = {2},
Pages = {154-176},
Abstract = {This article presents the findings of an explorative study examining to
   what extent and under which conditions gender influences the use of
   negative campaigning in Western Europe. It advances existing research in
   two ways. First, it is one of the few empirical examinations to date
   exploring gender differences in negative campaigning outside the US
   context. Second, it brings to bear novel data on this topic from
   British, Dutch and German parliamentary election campaigns between 1980
   and 2006. In essence, this study explores whether we can find gender
   effects on the use of negative campaigning in Western Europe. These
   effects are less likely to be found in these three Western European
   countries than in the United States, because we expect smaller candidate
   effects in parliamentary systems than in presidential systems. The
   analysis suggests that female party leaders are significantly more
   likely to ``go negative{''}. However, this difference between male and
   female party leaders is entirely due to the inclusion of Margaret
   Thatcher in the analysis. Without her, the difference disappears.},

Abstract = {This article compares three popular children's public television
   shows-Thomas \& Friends, Barney \& Friends, and Bob the Builder-to an
   earlier PBS children's program, Sesame Street. Utilizing Althusser's
   theory of ideology and Hall's theory on encoding/ decoding, we examine
   the underlying process of signification in these media texts and argue
   that children's television plays an important role as an Ideological
   State Apparatus (ISA). We complicate the existing research on children's
   television programming and provide an alternative approach for
   understanding, situating the content of these shows against the
   sociohistorical changes in the social relations of production that have
   occurred since the emergence of neoliberal capitalism as a dominant
   ideological discourse. We argue that newer media texts such as Thomas
   are more closed than Sesame Street, which emerged prior to the shift
   toward neoliberalism, though in the newer programs contradictions exist
   that could serve to undermine rather than support neoliberalism},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to identify the possible analytical provisions
   between two authors whose theoretical proposals might seem very distant:
   Michel Foucault and Niklas Luhmann. We analyze not only how the
   dispositif/difference that generates power relations operates, but also
   how it operates on its discourse manifestation, on its difference as a
   communication mean or in the construction of meaning as a discursive
   regime by asking specifically: what does the power communicate/operate?},

Abstract = {When will people prefer ``iron fist{''} governments to a government that
   acts with everyone's consent in mind? Democracies can and do implement
   policies that vary across a hard-line to soft-line continuum. I
   hypothesize that: a) citizens are more likely to prefer an authoritarian
   government when they are more satisfied with the outcomes yield by a
   hard-line policy and b) the effect of these outcomes on preferences will
   be accentuated for those that feel insecure. Data from Mexico collected
   by the Americas Barometer brings strong support for the first and
   moderate support for the second hypothesis. Evidence from more than 3
   000 face to face interviews collected by the Americas Barometer in
   Mexico during the years 2008 and 2010 shows that the phenomenon
   presented is not exclusive to the year 2010 but is particular to the
   government's hardline security policy.},

Abstract = {Concerns over a possible brain drain and a failed integration policy
   have been raised by the emigration of qualified persons of Turkish
   origin. However, there is little reliable data available regarding the
   profile and the motivations for this in the Germany-trained workforce.
   In order to explore the relative importance of different migration
   motivations, an online survey (n = 128) and interviews with selected
   respondents were conducted. The main finding is that family-related
   reasons are the most important factor in emigration to Turkey. In
   contrast, a negative career outlook and/or experience of discrimination
   in Germany, highlighted in public discourse, played only a secondary or
   even tertiary role. Instead, motivations for emigration of persons with
   and without a migration background are often similar, reflecting the
   increased mobility in a globalised world - a factor confirmed by the
   fact that a significant number of respondents expressed an intention to
   return to Germany.},

Abstract = {This paper aims at analysing the impacts of China's rise on Latin
   American countries. The literature on the topic has stressed the
   emergence of an asymmetrical pattern of relationship, where the region
   would be trapped in a less dynamic status of producer and exporter of
   raw materials. We focus on identifying the post-global financial crisis
   trends, providing fresh evidence concerning the characteristics of
   Sino-Latin American economic relationships, emphasizing the Brazilian
   experience. Ours results suggest that, particularly in the Brazilian
   case, there is evidence of the emergence of an increasingly regressive
   pattern of production and trade specialisation.},

Abstract = {Influential economic models predict that as inequality increases, the
   public will demand greater redistribution. However, there is limited
   research into the determinants of support for redistributive tax
   increases because such proposals have been so rare in America in recent
   decades. We use Washington State's Proposition 1098 to examine how
   economic self-interest, concerns about inequality, and partisanship
   influence support for redistributive taxation. The results show that all
   of these factors influenced support, with strong support among the lower
   income, indicating that when the distributional implications of policies
   are clear, citizens can translate their self-interest and broad
   attitudes into congruent redistributive preferences.},

Abstract = {The sex of a congressional candidate can influence voting choices, but
   does candidate sex also influence the timing of those choices? This
   paper examines that question in light of other information that voters
   weigh in making their decisions. Using a national survey from the 2006
   election, and a unique dataset of political informants, we find that the
   sex of the candidate conveys ideological information that permits voters
   to make swifter judgments. Additionally, it reduces the probability of a
   delayed decision by supplying information helpful to the choice between
   candidates-even in the absence of ideology. In fact, the impact of
   candidate sex rivals other variables that are traditionally used to
   explain the time-to-decision. Consistent with the literature on sex
   stereotypes, we find a stronger influence for Democratic than Republican
   female candidates.},

Abstract = {Spatial models of Supreme Court appointments assume that the president
   knows the preferences of nominees and is constrained only by the
   ideology of the Senate. However, nominees vary in the amount of
   available information that can be used to determine their preferences. I
   find that justices who offered more information in the form of relevant
   professional experience at the time of nomination are more congruent
   with their appointing president. Institutional factors, such as
   polarization between the Senate and president, exert less influence on
   congruence. The president is, however, constrained from appointing
   highly experienced justices if the Senate and president are distant
   ideologically.},

Abstract = {Taking the specific case of street protests in the United Kingdom - the
   `word from the street' - this article examines recent
   (re)conceptualisations of political representation, most particularly
   Saward's notion of `representative claim'. The specific example of
   non-electoral claims articulated by protestors and demonstrators in the
   United Kingdom is used to illustrate: the processes of making,
   constituting, evaluating and accepting claims for and by constituencies
   and audiences; and the continuing distinctiveness of claims based upon
   electoral representation. Two basic questions structure the analysis:
   first, why would the political representative claims of elected
   representatives trump the non-electoral claims of mass demonstrators?
   And, second, in what ways does the `perceived legitimacy' of the former
   differ from the latter?},

Abstract = {Throughout the 1990s and well into the first half of the new century,
   there was intense activity in Mergers and Acquisitions (M\&As) in the
   commercial banking industry of Western Europe. The frequency of M\& As
   diminished when the 2007-2009 financial crisis hit the markets. One of
   the last of these activities that took place before the full explosion
   of the 2007-2009 financial crisis was the cross-border takeover that a
   consortium made up of Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS-England), Fortis
   (Belgium-Netherlands), and Santander (Spain) carried out of one of the
   largest banks in the world, ABN AMRO (Netherlands). A few months later,
   the write-offs of significant amounts of subprime mortgage securities
   had affected the balance sheet of RBS and Fortis, with severe strategic
   consequences. The financial crisis forced RBS and Fortis to
   withdrawfromLatin America but also represented a golden opportunity for
   Santander to further strengthen its already solid position in the
   region. This article offers a detailed discussion of these events and
   concludes with a reflection on the need to further investigate the
   economic consequences of the participation of foreign banks in emerging
   countries.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the effectiveness of European Parliament candidates'
   campaigns. We analyze the relationship between candidates' spending and
   their likelihood of success, controlling for a range of relevant
   co-varying factors. We then investigate whether the effects of electoral
   spending are conditioned by two variables: ballot design and incumbency.
   We find that, ceteris paribus, spending was positively related to a
   candidate's likelihood of electoral success in the 2009 campaign, though
   this effect is small in scale. We also reveal that the electorally
   positive effects of spending are observable across both `party-centered'
   and `candidate-centered' ballot structures, and that there is some
   evidence that incumbent spending is less effective than challenger
   spending. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The concept of normative power has gained prominence, and consequently,
   invigorated research endeavours in recent years. With the exception of
   the ``normative power Europe{''}, the concept still remains a relatively
   under-researched topic in international relations. This is particularly
   valid for case studies of East Asian countries, and this article
   attempts to fill this void to some extent by analysing the case of
   Japan. In looking at Japan's quest for normative power, we analyse three
   areas, in which successive Japanese governments invested significant
   financial, material and human resources, aiming at recognition of Japan
   as ``an international force of good{''}. The three areas are:
   peace-building (including peace-brokering), human security and regional
   initiatives (the case of ReCAAP). Even though the normative behaviour of
   an actor does not imply using the instruments of hard power, this paper
   argues that Japan, aiming at reinforcing its normative power, has relied
   on significant economic means, used in the security-related fields. This
   was conducted multilaterally in accordance with other actors in the
   international community, but mostly in areas where the, normative
   activities. of Japan do not contradict the strategic interests of
   influential international actors.},

Abstract = {Along with the mobilization of political support, repression is one of
   the two basic instruments dictators use to stay in power. Yet, there is
   no systematic investigation analyzing whether repression actually helps
   dictators retain power. This article fills this gap by addressing the
   simultaneous relationship between survival and repression. The results
   reveal that repression certainly increases the likelihood of dictators'
   survival. Furthermore, this article also analyzes different types of
   authoritarian leader exit and repression. The article distinguishes
   between, on the one hand, nonviolent and regular exits and, on the other
   hand, violent and irregular exits as well as between political terror
   and restrictions on civil liberties. It argues that terror is effective
   against threats from organized groups, while restrictions on civil
   liberties essentially serve to prevent collective action. The empirical
   evidence confirms that political terror only reduces the likelihood of
   nonviolent and regular exits. Instead, restrictions on civil liberties
   are effective in deterring both sorts of threats.},

Abstract = {How are party coalitions shaped and reshaped? Elected officials choose
   coalitions to win elections, but they must work to maintain those
   coalitions. Non-elected political actors, advancing an ideology at odds
   with the party coalition, can undermine the party. This article explores
   this possibility in the case of partisan change on slavery in the
   Antebellum United States. Intellectuals in 1850 divided into two camps
   over slavery and the other major issues of the day at a time when
   slavery cross-cut the two parties in Congress. The ideological division
   matches one that develops in Congress a decade later, suggesting that
   the parties responded not just to electoral incentives, but also to this
   elite division.},

Number = {6},
Pages = {729-736},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Austerity: The History of a Dangerous Idea is a compelling analysis of
   the most pressing issues of the post-financial crisis world. Blyth shows
   with great lucidity just how a European banking crisis was turned into a
   eurozone sovereign debt crisis, and engages with a superb comparative
   breadth on the implications of this for understanding the political
   choices made by governments in the developed world over the past few
   years. Blyth's account of intellectual genealogy of present austerity
   policies is in places less persuasive. As Blyth argues, there has been
   much narrative fiction about the sovereign debt crisis, but there is
   also more to that crisis than ideological construction. If the
   generalisations about the `need' for austerity are untenable as Blyth
   shows, so are some of his claims about the origins and political
   responses to the financial crisis},

Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {36},
Number = {6, SI},
Pages = {1239-1255},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {This study compares the role of the Council presidency before and after
   Lisbon focusing on the continuity of the legislative work of the
   Council, which was a major concern in the discussions leading to the
   Lisbon Treaty. The Lisbon Treaty established an elected presidency to
   head the European Council for a period of up to five years. In addition,
   18-month programmes should facilitate smooth proceedings in the Council.
   The presidency of the Council, however, continues to rotate every six
   months between member states at the ministerial and working group level
   where the bulk of the legislative work takes place. Discontinuity of
   leadership in negotiations decreases their efficiency. Different
   priorities of the changing chairmen can be disruptive and lead to major
   delay. The hybrid solution of the Lisbon Treaty falls short of an
   institutional design that would have put a premium on continuity in the
   legislative work of the Council.},

Volume = {66},
Number = {4},
Pages = {772-797},

Abstract = {The departmental select committees of the British House of Commons deal
   with executive oversight, but not with legislation. This has two
   important knock-on effects. First, although these committees are
   permanent, expert, and largely well regarded in Britain, they are often
   overlooked by comparative scholars. Second, and connectedly, their
   impact on policy is very difficult to assess. Even in the UK there is
   considerable scepticism about whether the committees really matter to
   policy outcomes. This paper reports the first detailed
   cross-departmental investigation of the select committees impact on
   government policy for many years, employing both quantitative and
   qualitative methods. It concludes that numerous committee
   recommendations are implemented by government, including many for major
   policy change. But counting successful recommendations is a poor proxy
   for committee influence overall, and this also takes many other, perhaps
   more important, forms.},

Abstract = {Which new parties entered national parliaments in advanced democracies
   over the last four decades and how did they perform after their national
   breakthrough? This article argues that distinguishing two types of party
   formation (that facilitate or complicate party institutionalisation)
   helps to explain why some entries flourish, while others vanish quickly
   from the national stage. New parties formed by individual entrepreneurs
   that cannot rely on ties to already organised groups are less likely to
   get reelected to parliament after breakthrough than rooted newcomers.
   This hypothesis is tested on a newly compiled dataset of new parties
   that entered parliaments in 17 advanced democracies from 1968 onwards.
   Applying multilevel analyses, the factors that shape newcomers' capacity
   to reenter parliament after breakthrough are assessed. Five factors have
   significant effects, yet affect party performance only in particular
   phases: both a party's electoral support at breakthrough and its
   operation in a system with a strong regional tier increase the
   likelihood of initial reelection. In contrast, a distinct programmatic
   profile, the permissiveness of the electoral system and easy access to
   free broadcasting increase a party's chance of repeated reelection. Only
   formation type significantly affects both phases and does so most
   strongly, substantiating the theoretical approach used in this article.},

Abstract = {What is the relationship between human development, religion, and social
   conservatism? We present a model in which individuals derive utility
   from both the secular and religious worlds. Our model is unusual in that
   it explains both an individual's religious participation and her
   preferences over social policy at different levels of development. Using
   data from the pooled World Values Survey, we find that religious
   participation declines with human development and an individual's
   ability to earn secular income. We also find that although social
   conservatism declines with development in absolute terms, religious
   individuals become more socially conservative relative to the population
   average. Paradoxically, our results suggest that human development may
   make it easier for religious individuals to overcome collective action
   problems and obtain disproportionate political influence, even as their
   numbers dwindle and society as a whole becomes less socially
   conservative. Our analysis has important implications for the debate
   about secularization theory.},

Abstract = {This article takes the opportunity presented by the current global
   downturn to reassess the latest scholarly work on globalization's
   long-term implications for economic and political development. Will the
   market inequities generated by trade and international interdependence
   systematically undermine the domestic redistributive systems on which
   poor, redistribution-reliant citizens depend for their economic
   wellbeing and continuing engagement with society? Or should we expect to
   find trade-induced market inequality biasing political systems in
   exactly the opposite direction-toward more, not less, market-correcting
   redistribution? To answer these discipline-spanning questions with any
   degree of confidence, we will first need to develop a more theoretically
   integrated model of the mechanisms that link market inequality to
   nonmarket redistribution. Creating that model-and, to that end, unifying
   major theoretical strands within political science and economics-should
   be our first priority.},

Abstract = {Albert Camus's existential thinking has been the object of renewed
   interest over the past decade. Political theorists have looked to his
   work to shed light on the contradictions and violence of modernity and
   the dynamics of postcolonial justice. This article contends that Camus's
   account of the modern human condition provides a means of engaging
   critically with one of the most compelling ideas linked to thinking
   about global politics today: cosmopolitanism. By developing Camus's
   position on absurdity and rebellion, it suggests that the idea of
   cosmopolitanism should be situated in a postfoundationalist and
   post-teleological nexus to prevent it becoming a new political ideology
   of immutable truth. In order to make this argument, the article focuses
   on how Camus's thinking supports a rebellious cosmopolitan disposition
   towards global transformations. In so doing, it shows that
   cosmopolitanism must strive against the injustices of a deeply divided
   world, yet at the same time accept theoretical, factual and moral limits
   on its vision and actions.},

Abstract = {Whereas presidents represent the entire nation, members of Congress
   serve districts and states. Consequently, presidents and members of
   Congress often disagree not only about the merits of different policies
   but also about the criteria used to assess them. To investigate the
   relevance of jurisdictional-and by extension criterial-differences for
   policymaking, we revisit classic models of bargaining under uncertainty.
   Rather than define uncertainty about the mapping of one policy into one
   outcome, as all previous scholars have done, we allow for every policy
   to generate two politically relevant outcomes, one local and another
   national. We then identify equilibria in which the president's utility
   is increasing in the value that a representative legislator assigns to
   national outcomes. As an application of this theory, we analyze
   budgetary politics in war and peace. We find that during periods of war,
   when members of Congress assign greater importance to the very same
   national outcomes that preoccupy presidents, congressional
   appropriations more closely reflect presidential proposals.},

Abstract = {This study focuses on the relation between the Committee of the Regions
   (CoR), an advisory institution of the European Union defined as the
   political assembly of holders of a regional or local electoral mandate
   serving the cause of European integration, and the democratic deficit,
   understood as the effective ways of citizens' participation in the
   institutional decision making. The work hypothesis is that the CoR, in
   spite of being mostly unknown to citizens, could be an effective tool
   for tackling the democratic deficit. Through qualitative interviews and
   surveys at different levels, the article analyzes the current situation
   and the potential opportunities of the CoR in its relation with
   citizens.},

Abstract = {This essay focuses on the relationship between democracy and the
   environment. The aim is to reflect on the idea of an ecological
   democracy. First, the arguments shaping the view of an ecological
   democracy as a deliberative democracy are illustrated. Then I
   concentrate on Robyn Eckersley's theory of ecological democracy, and
   highlight the main differences between her account and liberal
   democracy. Eckersley's conception is analyzed form the point of view of
   green political theory and contrasted with other versions of
   deliberative democracy. Finally, John Dryzek's democratic thought is
   introduced as a counterpoint. I claim that Eckersley's proposal
   privileges the state as the key actor of ecological democracy, and this,
   I contend, is problematic on various grounds for ecological democracy
   itself.},

Abstract = {Austerity has become the norm of economic management in the EU, Britain
   and the USA. In each it is offered as the answer to different problems
   but everywhere the result is cuts in public spending, higher
   unemployment and low growth, none of which helps recovery from
   recession. Labour's response should not be to endorse or continue
   austerity but to initiate a Keynesian expansionary stimulus based on
   borrowing and spending on a huge programme of building public housing
   for rent. This should be accompanied by a competitive exchange rate, an
   industrial policy to boost the manufacturing sector and a National
   Investment Bank, the aim being to expand the production base so that it
   can pay the nation's way in the World and support the structure and the
   improvements Labour needs. This makes the choice at the next election
   the issue of what kind of Britain the electorate wants to see: a low
   wage, mean economy or a determined attempt to rebuild a stronger nation
   with a more powerful economy.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY},

Volume = {12},
Number = {4},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Does shame have a limited moral role because it is associated with a
   loss of self-respect or is it an important emotional support for
   socially beneficial behaviours? Aristotle supports the latter position.
   In his ethical theory, he famously claims that shame is a semi-virtue
   essential in the habituation of moral norms. He clarifies this role in
   the Rhetoric's lesser-known distinction between true and conventional
   shame, which implies human beings make subjective evaluations of those
   appropriated cultural norms. Importantly, he locates this potential for
   ethical assessment in friendship and not in public discourse, as he
   thinks it would be shameless to publicly evaluate moral rules. The
   article ends by exploring potential critiques to his position and argues
   that Aristotle's approach makes shame indispensable for moral progress,
   even though we might want to consider some limited role for shameless
   public protest.},

Abstract = {Instant-response technologies, or clickers, are student response devices
   that help address some of the challenges involved in teaching large
   classes, namely student motivation and engagement with the material.
   This article evaluates a diverse set of teaching and learning strategies
   enabled by clicker technology and their impact on student learning. We
   highlight five aspects of teaching that are enhanced by the use of
   clickers, describe an experiment comparing student performance in
   traditional and clicker lectures, and report results of a survey of
   student perception about the effects of this technology on motivation,
   learning, and engagement. We argue that while the use of clickers is
   time-consuming for the instructor and presents a steep learning curve,
   clickers improve teaching effectiveness in large classes and hold
   promise for increasing student learning.},

Abstract = {This study examines changes in negative campaigning in the Netherlands
   between 1981 and 2010. In addition, we examine which factors determine
   whether political parties are likely to make use of this campaign
   strategy in the Dutch multi-party system. We advance existing research
   on negative campaigning in two ways. First of all, this is the most
   extensive study of negative campaigning in the Netherlands conducted so
   far and to our knowledge also the most extensive conducted in any
   multi-party system. Second, our study contributes to the theoretical
   understanding of the determinants of negative campaigning in a
   multiparty context by differentiating between parties' vote-seeking and
   office-seeking incentives, and stating the implications of
   office-seeking for the use of negative campaigning.},

Abstract = {We examine how the growth in vote-by-mail and changes in voting
   technologies led to changes in the residual vote rate in California from
   1990 to 2010. In California's presidential elections, counties that
   abandoned punch cards in favor of optical scanning enjoyed a significant
   improvement in the residual vote rate. We also conduct the first
   analysis of the effects of the rise of vote-by-mail on residual votes.
   Regardless of the election, increased use of the mail to cast ballots is
   robustly associated with a significant rise in the residual vote rate.},

Abstract = {The intrusion of war is likely to alter the standard economic voting
   calculus. A wartime economy is not expected to deliver the same
   political benefits or costs, in terms of presidential approval or votes
   in an election, as does a peacetime economy. The Roosevelt presidency
   presents a perfect target to examine economic voting in wartime. Using
   monthly polling data on presidential approval from late 1937 to 1945, we
   demonstrate that the American public suspended standard economic-voting
   logic during World War II. One explanation for this suspension is the
   enormous size of U.S. military spending. Using data on government
   spending from 1929 to 1950, we show that military spending had a huge
   effect on unemployment while the effect of non-military spending proves
   negligible and non-significant. It was military spending triggered by
   war, not the New Deal, that vanquished the Great Depression. (C) 2013

Title = {Is there really a retreat from multiculturalism policies? New evidence
   from the multiculturalism policy index},
Journal = {COMPARATIVE EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {11},

Abstract = {In much of the Western world, and particularly in Europe, there is a
   widespread perception of a wholesale `retreat' from multiculturalism.
   Governments that once embraced a multicultural approach to diversity are
   said to be replacing it with a strong emphasis on civic integration.
   This assumption that new civic integration policies displace older
   multiculturalism policies (MCPs) has not properly been tested. Existing
   indices of immigrant integration policies (such as Migrant Integration
   Policy Index (MIPEX) or Civic Integration Policy Index (CIVlX)) have
   captured the rise of civic integration policies, but are not designed to
   measure the presence of MCPs. Drawing on an updated version of the
   Multiculturalism Policy Index introduced earlier, the article presents
   an index of the strength of multicultural policies for European
   countries and several traditional countries of immigration at three
   points in time (1980, 2000 and 2010). The results paint a different
   picture of contemporary experience in Europe. While a small number of
   countries, including most notably the Netherlands, have weakened
   established multicultural policies during the 2000s, such a shift is the
   exception. Most countries that adopted multicultural approaches in the
   later part of the twentieth century have maintained their programmes in
   the first decade of the new century, and a significant number of
   countries have added new ones. In much of Europe, multicultural policies
   are not in general retreat. As a result, the turn to civic integration
   is often being layered on top of existing multicultural programmes,
   leading to a blended approach to diversity. The article reflects on the
   compatibility of MCPs and civic integration, arguing that more liberal
   forms of civic integration can be combined with multiculturalism but
   that more illiberal or coercive forms are incompatible with a
   multicultural approach.},

Abstract = {Despite a changed international political context in the post-Cold War
   period, Western European small states remain firmly engaged in peace
   policy. One would be tempted to describe them as natural born
   peacemakers. This article shows a different approach to small states'
   peace policies. Using a typology from the literature on the role of
   norms and ideas, it argues that the type of peace engagement followed by
   small states has changed considerably during recent decades. More
   precisely, a shift has occurred in their peace policies from normative
   to cognitive ideas. This may be explained through their closer
   cooperation with international organisations (such as the EU), loss of
   significance of traditional role concepts such as neutrality, and the
   changed content of peace policies. Two consequences result from it:
   firstly, cognitive ideas are less linked to historically deep-rooted
   identities and therefore more prone to change; secondly, there fewer
   comparative advantages accrue to small states in promoting cognitive
   ideas. Thus, though small states remain very active peacebuilders, they
   have become less natural peacemakers than they used to be.},

Abstract = {We research the political impact of how users access the Internet.
   Recent research suggests that Internet usage may promote political
   participation. Internet usage is proposed to be beneficial because it
   increases activity in diverse politicized social networks and through
   greater access to information. Even though Internet usage may begin as a
   non-political activity, we outline several reasons to believe that it
   may spark later political participation. This impact, however, is likely
   to be non-existent in new forms of Internet browsing such as through
   mobile phones, where users do less full-scale browsing. The more
   difficult browsing interface of mobile phones reduces activity in chat
   rooms and in-depth browsing of online sources of information which
   promote participation. To test these ideas, we use nationally
   representative survey data from Japan, a country which has more
   pronounced usage of mobile phone browsing. Using a Seemingly Unrelated
   Regression Model, we also show that the chief determinants of using PC's
   over mobile phones for Internet browsing are age and education. We then
   show that PC-based Internet activity correlates with increased political
   participation, but mobile phone usage correlates with less
   participation.},

Abstract = {In this paper we review a special pension scheme established by the
   Government of Iceland for elderly workers that foreseeably would not
   enjoy any significant pension benefits from the pension system founded
   on the basis of the general labour agreements of 1969. This pension
   scheme that was run alongside the private labour market pension system
   and social security was conceived as a temporary measure but extended
   over a longer time period than originally envisaged. Based on
   unpublished data we seek answers to questions on the financing of the
   scheme and its impact in terms of the relative share of its pension

Abstract = {Convincing scholarly evidence shows the economy directs the mass
   public's support for parties and leaders. But the extent of economic
   voting depends on a country's ``clarity of responsibility.{''} According
   to several scholars, political clarity is important because it
   determines whether people link national economic performance to the
   parties in government. This study explores a potential second role,
   which involves how clarity moderates the strength of partisan-motivated
   reasoning. Clarity of responsibility makes the economy more or less
   central to party politics. It could therefore moderate people's
   motivation to rationalize economic facts in a biased direction. Using
   cross-national survey data, this study tests this possibility by
   examining economic disagreement between people who support a party in
   government and those who support the opposition. Results from a Bayesian
   multilevel regression show that partisan disagreement varies
   systematically with clarity of responsibility. This finding raises new
   questions about cross-national differences in economic voting. (C) 2013

Abstract = {In the second term of the New Labour Government, the issue of fox
   hunting occupied 700 hours of parliamentary time and received extensive
   press attention. This article shows that the hunting case reveals a
   different pattern than that found for voting on other conscience issues
   in the UK parliament, with party an almost perfect predictor of voting
   in the two main parties. In examining this outcome, we focus on way in
   which the issue played in both the main political parties during the
   passage of the Hunting Bill. In the Labour party, the strength of
   backbench support for the Bill overwhelmed the ambivalence of the
   frontbench. In contrast, the Conservative Party became more united as a
   response to the increased politicisation of the issue by Labour
   backbenchers and increased extra-parliamentary political activity by the
   Countryside Alliance.},

Abstract = {After 50 years of formal independence in the anglophone Caribbean, this
   article suggests gains for both analysis and policy may be made by
   something of a paradigm shift towards a focus on transnational and
   regional relations. This is especially so for the myriad small,
   particularly island, states which have always been relatively `open'
   especially as contemporary governance demands proliferate as indicated
   in the first section below. And it holds potential for island
   communities in the Indian and Pacific Oceans as well as the Caribbean,
   especially for those associated with inter- and non-state Commonwealth
   networks; these now include not only the original established
   `Dominions' of Australia, Britain and Canada but also 2/5 BRICS, or 25\%
   of the G20. A focus on the transnational and regional helps to transcend
   the old binary of `vulnerability' versus `resilience'.},

   up a small part of this challenge of mapping the role of VEGAs in larger
   systems of environmental governance by examining the development and
   implementation of a range of VEGAs in the Australian building sector,
   here defined as the construction and use of buildings.},

Abstract = {The success of processes of democratic change is often predicated on the
   moderation of anti-systemic and extremist parties. The literature on
   such parties argues that such moderation, namely the acceptance of
   democratic procedures, human rights, and a market economy, comes about
   through inclusion. This seems to be borne out when one analyses a number
   of Islamist parties having contributed to the progressive
   democratization of their respective countries. The Tunisian case,
   however, offers a different perspective on moderation. This article
   argues that it has been exclusion through repression and social
   marginalization that has led the Islamist party Ennahda to move from its
   extreme anti-systemic position of the 1970s to become the mainstream
   conservative party it is today.},

Abstract = {The article examines the ministerial selection and estimates the chances
   of selection of professional politicians vis-a-vis the selection of
   technocrats or political novice in multiparty cabinets. The ministerial
   selection is analyzed as a supporter calculation to convert the
   ministerial appointment a resource for retention and/or projection of
   their party cadres. Two hypotheses were tested: (a) loyalty, the bonds
   belonging to supporters and parties increase the chances of competitive
   selection of professional politicians for the posts of ministers; (b)
   the chances of selection of political novices or technocrats increase
   with expertise and membership of parties under organizational expansion.
   The analysis focuses on multiparty governments formed in Brazil
   (1995-2010). The results show that the trajectory within the party is
   decisive for the selection of professional politicians, while belonging
   to the party of the President favors the entry of new members in the
   high command of the government. The study provides evidence of the
   complexity of multiparty cabinet ministerial selection in light of
   organizational dilemmas faced by the parties.},

Journal = {POLITICAL THEORY},

Volume = {41},
Number = {4},
Pages = {533-561},

Abstract = {This essay interprets Hannah Arendt's concept of the social question
   through a reading of her controversial essay Reflections on Little Rock.
   I argue that Arendt's social question refers to social climbing and not
   simply poverty, as she initially suggests. The social-climbing framework
   illuminates Little Rock in two ways. First, it explains why Arendt
   opposed mandatory school desegregation, which she saw as black social
   climbing, that is, African American citizens and the NAACP using the US
   courts and federal government to raise the status of African Americans
   to the level of whites. Second, and more significant, it provides a
   framework for criticizing Little Rock with Arendt's own standards and
   criteria in mind. Reminded by Arendt of the suspect politics of social
   climbing, we can see something she did not: segregation was not natural
   association but an institution established after the Civil War to

Abstract = {Adjudications are an important, though understudied, means through which
   administrative agencies create policies that have a lasting impact. We
   argue that executive branch agency heads utilize their oversight of
   agency adjudications to advance agency goals. Relying on an original
   data set of adjudications appealed to the U.S. Department of
   Agriculture's agency head's adjudication delegee, our empirical results
   indicate a substantial positive effect on the probability that the
   agency head will reverse an administrative law judge (ALJ) when he
   receives the appeal of an antiagency ALJ decision. However, the agency's
   adjudication oversight is conditional on political constraints,
   including partisanship differences between an agency and the litigated
   law and whether the case is being heard during a time of presidential
   transition. These results have clear implications for the use and
   effectiveness of agency adjudications as a political tool.},

Abstract = {Unions are not a privileged object of study in Political Science in
   Argentina, and when they have been studied it was in relation to the
   State. Because of this epistemological definition, hegemonic approaches
   on trade unionism are pluralism and corporatism.
   We propose to review critically the research conducted in Argentina from
   such approaches. To do this we will first review the interpretations of
   Argentine trade unionism in three stages (postwar, `90s, post-crisis of
   2001), to finally evaluate them, note their contributions and
   weaknesses. Among the contributions highlight the theoretical
   development of the categories of corporatism and its use to address
   empirically the relationship between State and trade unions. As
   weaknesses we note that sub-valued capital-labor axis in a social
   formation, prevents capture in their complexity and specificity union
   strategies.},

Abstract = {The relationships between think tanks, political parties and policy
   change in Colombia are not completely understood. In order to cope with
   this theoretical and empirical gap, the article explores how think tanks
   may have potentially influenced the adoption of two laws that redesigned
   key institutions in the Colombian electoral and political arena (i.e.
   political reforms). The first of these two laws was enacted in 2003, the
   second one was enacted in 2009. The article also discusses preliminary
   evidence according to which think thanks influenced the regulation -not
   only the enactment- of the latter Law. In short, the core idea of the
   paper is that think tanks mobilized knowledge and opinions that, in the
   last analysis, may have facilitated the design, adoption, and regulation
   of political reforms in Colombia. The paper thus suggests think tanks
   activities should be theorized, and systematically tested, as an
   explanatory factor for policy change related to institutional change in
   Colombia.},

   the case of foreign aid public policy in Spain, from transition to

   change departing from the public policy analysis perspective. It is
   showed that, similar to other cases, stability more than change
   characterizes the dynamics of foreign aid in Spain. At the same time, it
   is stand that the particular characteristics of the policy system of
   foreign aid policy influence the magnitude and the frequency of change.},

Abstract = {Despite the conflict over ideology, the Bolsheviks exported oil to the
   capitalist West. In exchange, they received foreign currency and
   technology. Little has changed in the structure of this exchange. In the
   mid-1950s, the Soviet Union gained influence in the European oil market.
   But it was only in the early 1970s, with the development of gas deposits
   in western Siberia, that the rise of the Soviet Union as an energy
   superpower began. This was fostered by the policy of detente and the
   idea of ``change through trade{''}, as well as by the perception among
   West Europeans that energy supplies from Eastern Europe were more
   reliable than those from the Middle East. Today, the question is how to
   deal with energy dependence. There is no way around Russia's raw
   materials.},

Abstract = {Mediation is a relatively new procedure in Romania, and because of that,
   as well as of the mediator's lack of experience, the clients encounter
   several problems regarding this procedure, most of them because they
   lack trust in the procedure and the mediator. The relationship of trust
   between mediators and parties is a key element of the mediation process.
   Psychologists have found that trust is vital to people's willingness to
   contribute their time and attention to reach common goals and to reveal
   useful information in order to do that. How we can build this trust will
   be the subject of the following article.},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {We investigate Americans' stereotypes of Muslims. We distinguish
   specific dimensions of stereotypes and find that negative stereotypes
   relating to violence and trustworthiness are commonplace. Furthermore,
   these stereotypes have consequences: those with less favorable views of
   Muslims, especially in terms of violence and trustworthiness, are more
   likely to support several aspects of the War on Terror. Our findings
   contrast with some previous research that emphasizes the role of a
   generalized ethnocentrism, rather than specific stereotypes of Muslims,
   in explaining public opinion in this domain. We argue that citizens do
   use specific stereotypes when there is a close correspondence between
   the dimension of the stereotype and the policy in question.},

Abstract = {Under the UK Fixed-term Parliaments Act, apart from a motion of no
   confidence, the only way to obtain a dissolution is by an absolute
   majority of at least two-thirds of the House of Commons. However, it
   might be possible for a motion of no confidence to be engineered by the
   government against itself. This would seem to defeat the purpose of the
   Act, and ought only to be permitted if the government is no longer
   capable of acting because of lack of support in the House of Commons.
   Control on the exercise of this power should therefore lie with the
   courts. The Canadian Constitution is insufficiently similar here, but
   the German Constitution offers a possible model for judicial control. It
   allows for governments feeling themselves unable to act to ask for a
   vote of confidence, intending to suffer a defeat leading to dissolution
   of the Bundestag; and this can be challenged in court proceedings.},

Abstract = {Recent literature models leadership as a process of communication in
   which leaders' rhetorical signals facilitate followers' co-ordination.
   While some studies have explored the effects of leadership in
   experimental settings, there remains a lack of empirical research on the
   effectiveness of informational tools in real political environments.
   Using quantitative text analysis of federal and sub-national legislative
   addresses in Russia, this article empirically demonstrates that
   followers react to informational signals from leaders. It further
   theorizes that leaders use a combination of informational and
   non-informational tools to solve the co-ordination problem. The findings
   show that a mixture of informational and non-informational tools shapes
   followers' strategic calculi. Ignoring non-informational tools-and
   particularly the interrelationship between informational and
   non-informational tools-can threaten the internal validity of causal
   inference in the analysis of leadership effects on co-ordination.},

Abstract = {With the rise of the Justice and Development Party under the leadership
   of Recep T. Erdogan, Turkish foreign policy has experienced an ``Eastern
   turn{''}, which raised question marks in the minds of many. In this
   study, we investigate the ``Eastern turn{''} in Turkish foreign
   relations through an analysis of Turkish Prime Minister Erdogan's
   foreign visits to the non-Western world between 2003 and 2010. Using
   Poisson regression models, we test ideological and economic explanations
   of Turkey's ``Eastern turn{''}. We fail to find a particular
   anti-Western trend in Erdogan's foreign visits. To the contrary,
   Erdogan's most frequent destinations in the non-Western world were
   pro-Western countries. The results of our statistical analyses provide
   support to the argument that the Justice and Development Party's foreign
   policy has been guided more by a sensible economic rationale than by
   ideological orientation.},

   transition is necessary. Turkey can play a decisive role by virtue of
   its geography and history, which provide it the capacity of having its
   voice heard in Asia, Africa, and Europe alike. The various international
   environmental initiatives hosted in Turkey over the last few years, as
   well as the highly determined standpoints of Turkish leaders, prove that
   this country is eager to play a stronger role in the major environmental
   movement that we see underway in most regions of the globe. Moreover,
   the vibrant debate in Turkey has demonstrated an environmental awareness
   among Turkish people. This should inspire authorities to move even
   further on environmental issues. Turkey could play a key leadership role
   particularly with regards to biodiversity, water, and energy.},

Volume = {6},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {This study surveys the institutional conditions that produce corruption
   in BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India and China) nations. While this study
   focuses on BRIC as a case study in institutional corruption, it
   emphasizes the special role that each nation plays in the evolution of
   BRIC as a part of the global political economy. We utilize a helix
   structure as a means of expressing the intertwined, trans-dimensional
   aspects of corruption in BRIC among its various institutions. Our
   ``quadruple helix model{''} reveals that the presence of a strong,
   meaningful alternative civil society is a significant fourth helix in
   several big emerging economies. This model demonstrates that data
   collected from multiple sources can effectively characterize the
   multi-dimensional systemic features of corruption if they are understood
   as institutional forces that evolve in sync with one another. This model
   demonstrates that, while the conventional wisdom that economic growth
   reduces corruption, bureaucratization and other institutional problems
   can increase corruption, especially when there are few conscious efforts
   to manage growth in relation to the evolution of civil society.},

Abstract = {There is universal agreement among development stakeholders that
   parliaments play a crucial role in enhancing good governance, economic
   growth, and development as well as the general quality of democracy. It
   follows from this fact that several international organizations (IOs)
   have embarked in activities that seek to strengthen legislative
   capacity. However, we note that there is a lack of consensus-among IOs
   and in key literature-on the right approach to strengthen parliaments.
   Consequently, IOs have been offering varying legislative-strengthening
   exercises that have inevitably produced significantly different and, at
   times, disappointing outcomes. Using a multicase study design that
   includes five Pacific countries, we show that to attain positive and
   significant outcomes, legislative capacity-building initiatives need to
   be country specific and informed by local needs assessment. We further
   reassert that no amount of legislative capacity-building effort can
   enhance parliamentary performance in the absence of local political
   will.},

Abstract = {Since achieving independence in June 1960, the Democratic Republic of
   Congo (DRC) has been grappling with the question of the citizenship of
   Kinyarwanda and Kirundi-speaking populations settled on its territory at
   different historical periods, herein referred to as the Banyarwanda.
   While there is evidence of the presence of some Banyarwanda communities
   on current Congolese territory prior to the advent of Belgian
   colonisation in the area, the majority of the Banyarwanda currently
   living in the DRC are descendants of those brought into the country
   through colonial immigration and labour recruitment processes, political
   exile and refuge as well as clandestine migration. Using a historical
   perspective, this article analyses the manner in which the question of
   the citizenship of the Banyarwanda has been handled in the DRC since the
   establishment of the Congo Free State in 1885. The article locates the
   roots of the problem in the poorly designed colonial policies
   surrounding the relocation of these populations to the Kivu region.
   However, the article acknowledges that the sole shortcomings on the part
   of colonial authorities would have never had the current consequences if
   it was not for the inconsistencies of the different post-colonial
   governments that have ruled over the DRC. Instead of resolving the
   citizenship question in an effective and sustainable manner, all these
   governments have based their respective responses to the issue on
   short-term political expediencies as dictated by the balance of forces
   within the country, the Kivu area and the Great Lakes region at a
   particular juncture.},

Abstract = {For Ulrich Beck, the Enlightenment project aimed to subordinate
   religious truth to the authority of reason in questions of the true and
   the good, and thus to replace religious conflict with peace. Although
   the First Modernity' delivered risks like climate change rather than
   progress like peace, Beck discerns signs of hope for the Enlightenment
   project in the processes of individualisation and cosmopolitanisation. I
   argue, first, that Beck exaggerates his claims about the relative
   influence of tradition on religion and reason; second, that his
   cosmopolitanisation thesis fails to identify triggers for a paradigm
   conversion; third, that the thesis relies upon essentialist commitments
   of the kind he condemns; and finally, that only the classicist view of
   essentialism is vulnerable to his attack.},

Abstract = {For many decades, the Arab despots would serve the Western interests in
   the region in return fora Western disregard to democracy policies in
   their countries. By the outbreak of the Arab uprisings in the Middle
   East, this implicit agreement between the West and the Arab despots was
   put in jeopardy. This article defines the challenges faced by the
   Western interests as a result of these revolts. Moreover, it digs deeper
   into the American and European reactions to the uprisings. Finally, the
   article contemplates the reasons behind the western behavior towards
   these revolts. Against this backdrop, this article argues that the
   implicit agreement is still possible in spite of the Arab uprising
   albeit with a diverse formula.},

Title = {Emotions and the Microfoundations of the Arab Uprisings},

Abstract = {In any political setting, a few people will defy political authority.
   The main challenge for theories of rebellion is to explain when and why
   others join en masse. Scholarship on social movements typically develops
   answers to this puzzle on the basis of either of two microfoundations.
   Explanations that conceptualize individuals as utility-maximizers
   contend that they protest as a means to other ends. Explanations that
   see individuals as driven by values and beliefs suggest that people
   protest for the inherent benefit of voicing dissent. Both perspectives
   generate compelling explanations. Yet how do purposeful individuals act
   when utilitarian calculations and cherished values recommend contrary
   courses of action? Why might an actor prioritize one or the other at
   different points in time? Taking on these questions, I argue for an
   approach to microfoundations that focuses on emotions. Emotions such as
   fear, sadness, and shame promote pessimistic assessments, risk aversion,
   and a low sense of control. Such dispiriting emotions encourage
   individuals to prioritize security and resign to political
   circumstances, even when they contradict values of dignity. By contrast,
   anger, joy, and pride promote optimistic assessments, risk acceptance,
   and feelings of personal efficacy. Such emboldening emotions encourage
   prioritization of dignity and increase willingness to engage in
   resistance, even when it jeopardizes security. When instrumentality and
   values offer different answers to the question of whether to resign or
   rebel, therefore, emotions can shift individuals toward one or the
   other. I ground this argument in findings from the neurosciences and
   illustrate it with evidence from the 2011 uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt
   and the absence of an uprising in Algeria.},

Abstract = {This comprehensive article provides an overview of the broader process
   of political, legal and societal changes characterizing the Baltic
   countries' convergence towards the European Union. The article aims to
   identify the specific areas and issues which reveal both similarities
   and differences between the three Baltic countries. Special focus has
   been given to issues of economic development, economic policy choices,
   employment, public opinion and some legal aspects. The article, first of
   all, tries to reveal the differences between Estonia, Latvia and
   Lithuania stemming from different economic policy decisions made by the
   Baltic countries in the 1990s as well as from to the fact that in
   1997-1999 the European Union treated the Baltic countries somewhat
   differently in terms of conditionality. However, during the 21st
   century, especially due to the economic recession, the `Baltic clocks'
   have been synchronized despite the obvious differences in political
   system and levels of economic development. The author of the current
   article believes that the main factor behind that development was the
   convergence to European Union.},

Abstract = {The European Council is an institution which brings together the Heads
   of State, or Governments of the European Union (EU) Member States. For
   the Presidency, preparing the agenda of European Council meetings
   involves a tension between loyalties. Existing research is divided over
   the question whether the Presidency pushes its domestic policy agenda on
   the EU level. Using empirical data on the Conclusions of European
   Council meetings, and national executive speeches presented annually in
   five Member States, this article investigates the relationship between
   the policy agendas of the EU and its constituent countries. It tests
   whether national issue attention of the Presidency holder dominates the
   European Council agenda. The findings suggest that having the Presidency
   does not provide a de facto institutional advantage for agenda setting
   power for any of the countries in the sample. The analysis points out
   that normative and political constrains limit the leeway of presiding
   Member States to push for domestic agenda preferences in the European
   Council.},

Abstract = {Previous scholarship has described how members of Congress struggle to
   attract media attention. The Speaker of the House, however, is uniquely
   positioned to drive media agendas. That position may be conditioned
   though by the framework in which the Speaker operates, shocks to the
   system of leadership in the House, and the process of legislating. We
   inquire into the conditions under which the Speaker of the House
   receives increased or decreased attention from newspapers, network
   newscasts, and cable newscasts. We also examine the contraction and
   expansion of the gap between levels of presidential and Speaker
   coverage. We find that Speaker coverage is often shaped by increases in
   House polarization, changes in which party holds the position, Speaker
   scandal, and turning bills into laws.},

   training-supplemented welfare regimes from transfer-based welfare
   regimes. Evidence from descriptive and multivariate analyses of World
   Values Survey based on 17 advanced industrial democracies supports my
   argument that public investment in skill provision prevalent in
   training-supplemented welfare states leads to higher accumulation of
   social trust, whereas passive social transfers result in lower social
   trust. Especially, high investment in public skill provision leads to a
   decreased gap in social trust between employers and low-skilled workers,
   as well as among different occupational groups. In addition, the
   negative effect of passive social transfers on trust is greatly
   ameliorated when it is jointly configured with high active labor market
   policies. The findings lend credibility to my claim that specific social
   policies aiming to upgrade citizens' skill levels provide employees with
   better prospects for managing life chances (and risks) and therefore
   building higher social trust.},

Abstract = {The standard model of political party density emphasizing the
   interaction of social cleavages and district magnitude (M) is incomplete
   in accounting for number of parties in cases of high values of M in an
   arbitrary way. We explore an alternative model for such cases
   emphasizing the slack in the issue agenda available to parties with
   which to construct viable identities or niches they can employ to
   mobilize cognitively-limited voters. The model is tested with time
   series data and event history analysis on the sizes of the public policy
   agenda and the political party system in the Netherlands, an extreme
   case of large district magnitude given its single national district.
   Change in the slack of the issue agenda influences the births and deaths
   of political parties, a result that may also have implications for cases
   of lower district magnitude.},

Abstract = {Italy's economy and polity are considered to be continuously in turmoil.
   The recent multiplication of corruption affairs, the spreading of
   clientelistic practices, the internal economic crisis and the decline in
   the country's role on the European and international stages suggest that
   Italy is at a political and historical turning point. For the above
   stated reasons, it appears relevant to re-evaluate the state and quality
   of Italian democracy. On the basis of a comparative and
   interdisciplinary approach, this study aims to analyse the recent
   changes in Italian polity, economy and society in order to assess
   whether Italy can be considered as a `deviant case' among European
   countries. In this article, we present a preliminary reflection on this
   research question and we outline the topics of concern that will be
   explored in this special issue. The first part of the article highlights
   the transformation of Italian democracy over the years with an emphasis
   on the persisting inconsistency between institutions and civil society.
   The second part of this article addresses the problem of the current
   political and economic crisis and the erosion of the democratic quality
   of Italian political and institutional settings. The third section
   addresses the question of whether Italy, in a comparative perspective,
   can be considered alternatively a `backward' country in terms of
   democratic development, a political and institutional laboratory of
   future trends, an anomaly compared to other European democracies or,
   finally, a specific variation of common trends already characterizing
   other European democracies. Comparative European Politics (2013) 11,

Abstract = {The chapter addresses the question of the discontinuity and continuity
   in Italian discourse about European integration after WW2. On the one
   hand, discontinuity is shown by the changing approach to EU by Mr S.
   Berlusconi (three times Prime Minister from 1994 to 2011) and the
   leaders of the ruling centre-right coalitions of the 2nd Italian
   Republic starting in 1992 as well as by the effects of the economic
   crisis in underpinning populism. On the other hand, by a historical
   institutionalist approach, the author stresses that the weight of the
   anti-fascist origins of the Europeanist streams, the rich cultural
   heritage and the lack of any practical nationalist alternative explain
   the comparatively high rate of continuity in Italian support for EU
   integration. Comparative European Politics (2013) 11, 296-316.

Abstract = {How do domestic constraints affect international negotiations? Most
   existing research takes these constraints as given, owing to the
   presence of certain types of domestic institutions. We analyze a
   two-sided international bargaining model with endogenous domestic
   constraints. Our model includes a principal-agent tension between
   domestic audiences and leaders, and it shows how constraints may arise
   endogenously and be tailored to the strategic situation at hand by
   domestic audiences. We show that domestic actors can often use
   accountability mechanisms to garner bargaining leverage and control
   special interests, even when leaders hold private information about
   their distributive preferences. We also show that the relative strength
   of accountability across countries is important for understanding the
   emergence of endogenous constraints. We discuss the implications of
   these theoretical findings for the influence of domestic constraints in
   several prominent examples of international negotiations.},

Abstract = {Does the division between ``red{''} and ``black{''} Croatia exist not
   only in ideological space but in actual geographical space? Which
   factors are associated with local and regional political behavior and
   political identities? This article uses spatial analysis to provide
   answers to these questions. Visual analysis is used as are multivariate
   models based on the idea of spatial dependence, i.e. spatial clustering
   and agglomeration. Units of analysis are municipalities and cities in
   Croatia. The analysis suggests that the most relevant factors are prior
   political choices of a locale and the political preferences of
   neighboring locales. Economic and demographic factors are not
   unimportant but are weaker determinants of the political choices of a
   county or city. The analysis suggests a high degree of local and
   regional fortification of political parties. The space for political
   competition is comparatively open in Slavonia, especially in its
   northwestern part.},

Abstract = {This article offers an overview of the genesis, development and decline
   of the Respect Party, a rare example of a radical left party which has
   achieved some degree of success in the UK. It analyses the partys
   electoral fortunes and the reasons for its inability to expand on its
   early breakthroughs in East London and Birmingham. Respect received much
   of its support from Muslim voters, although the mere presence of Muslims
   in a given area was not enough for Respect candidates to get elected.
   Indeed, despite criticism of the party for courting only Muslims, it did
   not aim to draw its support from these voters alone. Moreover, its
   reliance on young people and investment in local campaigning on specific
   political issues were often in opposition to the traditional ethnic
   politics which have characterised the electoral process in some areas.},

Abstract = {The fear of being perceived as gay, as not a real man, keeps men
   exaggerating all the traditional rules of masculinity, including sexual
   predation with women'. This view on men's sexual (Following feminists
   such as Tamale {[}2011. African Sexualities: A Reader. Nairobi:
   Pambazuka Press] that thinking on sexuality without looking at gender is
   like cooking pepper soup with pepper', meaning that they are mutually
   imbricated with and shape one another, unless I wish to stress a point
   or indicate otherwise, whenever sexuality and associated concepts are
   used here it is meant gendered sexuality) and gender practices in
   relation to the traditional' expressed by Kimmel is shared with other
   leading scholars on masculinities. Yet, in situating queer sexualities
   against the traditional' or outside tradition, studies on masculinities
   have engendered a paradox which needs untangling in any serious attempt
   to unsettle traditionalist positions that clash with claims for the
   recognition of sexual equality. The main purpose of this article is to
   offer a different reading of the relation between masculinities and the
   traditional'. Arguing that it is at the moment that the word critical'
   or its equivalents is uttered that a tradition leaks through, the
   article offers a critique of anti-traditional masculinity' critiques
   which reinforce the homogenisation and retribalisation of African (While
   acknowledging the complexity accompanying the use of the terms in South
   Africa, as well as recognising their ideology-ladenness, in this article
   African and black are used interchangeably and refer to those
   historically defined as Bantu.) tradition and culture. At the same time,
   the article examines and seeks to undo some of the arguments of
   patriarchal hetero-masculinist traditionalism resistant to the
   recognition of desires and rights of women and men who are attracted to
   others of the same sex through foregrounding claims for equality for
   queer attraction and recognition.},

Abstract = {Which parties represented in the European Parliament (EP) are able to
   extract regular donations from their MEPs' salaries and, if they extract
   donations, how great are they? In the literature on party finances,
   there has been a lack of attention paid to the use of salaries of
   elected representatives as a source of funding. This is surprising given
   that the national headquarters of many parties in Europe regularly
   collect party taxes': a fixed (and often significant) share of their
   elected representatives' salaries. In filling this gap, this article
   theoretically specifies two sets of party characteristics that account
   for the presence of a taxing rule and the level of the tax,
   respectively. The presence of a tax depends on the basic acceptability'
   of such an internal obligation that rests on a mutually beneficial
   financial exchange between parties' campaign finance contributions to
   their MEPs and MEPs' salary donations to their parties. The level of the
   tax, in contrast, depends on the level of intra-organisational
   compliance costs and parties' capacity to cope with these costs. Three
   factors are relevant to this second stage: MEPs' ideological position,
   the size of the parliamentary group and party control over candidate
   nomination. The framework is tested through a selection model applied to
   a unique dataset covering the taxing practices in parties across the
   European Union Member States.},

Title = {Questioning generational replacement. An age, period and cohort analysis
   of electoral volatility in the Netherlands, 1971-2010},

Abstract = {Political behavior has been changing all over Western Europe and
   electoral volatility is one of the facets of politics in which this
   change is apparent. Theories on stabilization of political attitudes and
   behavior in lifetime and the slow rate at which change in the electoral
   arena is found to proceed, have led to the assumption of generational
   replacement as the mechanism driving change. The Netherlands, however,
   provide a remarkably different case of this trend in electoral
   volatility. The country has shifted from an example of how cleavages
   stabilize politics to one of the most electorally volatile countries in
   Europe. The Dutch surge in electoral volatility thus contrasts with
   expectations of a slow process driven by generational replacement.
   Starting from this apparent contradiction between the evolution of
   volatility in the Netherlands and theories on generational replacement,
   this article investigates time effects of electoral volatility. The
   study is based on an age, period and cohort analysis on the repeated
   cross-sectional data of the Dutch Parliamentary Election Studies,
   1971-2010. Based on characteristics of such repeated cross-sectional
   data, individuals are cross-classified in birth cohorts and election
   years respectively, which overcomes the identification problem inherent
   in cohort analyses. Results of a Cross-Classified Random Effects Model
   (CCREM) indicate that, contrary to the hypothesis of new generations
   causing the increase in volatility, the Dutch change can be attributed
   primarily to period effects. As such, the analyses indicate that a
   general shift in the Dutch electorate has caused the growth in
   volatility and that supply-side factors should probably be analyzed when
   trying to explain electoral volatility. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

   Pursue Unpopular Reforms},
Journal = {SCANDINAVIAN POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {36},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Most political science accounts assume that governments in Western
   democracies avoid unpopular reforms to protect their re-election
   chances. Nevertheless, governments sometimes embark on electorally risky
   reforms even in times when they have no slack in the polls. In this
   article, it is argued that pursuing unpopular reforms can be a perfectly
   rational strategy for vote-seeking governments. Based on a simple game
   theoretical model that compares strategic framing with the classic blame
   avoidance strategy, it is demonstrated that unpopular policy reforms
   allow governments to pursue gains of both policy and votes by opting for
   a highly visible strategy of reframing the substantive reform issue in
   question. This general argument is illustrated with the substantial 2011
   retrenchment of Danish early retirement benefits. This particular
   welfare state programme was highly popular. Nevertheless, the incumbent
   Liberal prime minister proposed to abolish it only a few months prior to
   a national election while his government was trailing significantly in
   the polls.},

   to leave the United States and enter Mexico, leading to the deaths of
   hundreds of Mexicans. Initially, the Justice Department denied that ATF
   ever intended to have guns flow to Mexico. Ten months later the
   department conceded that its statement was ``inaccurate.{''}

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},

Number = {1},

Abstract = {Drawing on the concept of habitual voting (Plutzer, 2002), Franklin
   (2004) argues that the effects of electoral context on voter turnout
   will be largely limited to the cohorts who have experienced few
   elections in their lifetime. Those with more electoral experience would
   thus remain unaffected. Testing the above hypothesis is a way of a
   feasible indirect examination of the concept of habitual voting. Such
   tests have so far focused primarily on the impact of electoral
   competitiveness on turnout. I propose a new superior analysis of
   Franklin's hypothesis that, I claim, approaches the standards of a
   natural experiment. My test - focusing on the national election cycles
   as a contextual trait of the European Parliament elections - delivers
   new evidence supporting this hypothesis. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {This article applies the social-network conception of national power,
   derived from the social-network conception of the international system
   structure, to economic sanctions, one of the most widely studied
   empirical phenomena in international relations. The empirical analyses
   of economic sanctions presented here find that sanctions cases with
   disproportional structural-network power between sender and target were
   far less likely to be successful and those with the target state
   possessing high structural-network power were far more likely to be
   successful. The evidence from nonparametric model discrimination
   statistics and information criteria measures shows that the sanctions
   models with new social-network power measures have greater explanatory
   power than or statistically outperform those with old attributional
   power measures, such as the Correlates of War index and GNP.},

Abstract = {How should small-n researchers aggregate the information collected
   during their research in an effort to measure the relevant theoretical
   concepts with high levels of validity and reliability? This article
   specifically focuses on the method of triangulation, which is frequently
   used in process-tracing approaches. We introduce and theorise different
   aggregation strategies commonly used in triangulation, such as weighted
   and simple averages or `the winner takes it all' strategy. We then
   evaluate their performance with regard to their proneness to measurement
   error using computer simulations. Our simulation results show that
   averaging different information sources, in general, outperforms other
   aggregation strategies. However, this is not the case if poorly informed
   sources are biased in a similar direction; in these situations the
   `winner takes it all' strategy shows a superior performance.},

Abstract = {Based on data collected from a representative-sample survey conducted in
   five Chinese cities (Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Chengdu, and Hangzhou)
   in the middle of 2008, this study examines the behavioral orientations
   of Chinese middle class toward the local elections which are held in
   urban areas, and the attitudinal orientations of Chinese middle class
   toward the current regime. The results indicate that there is a strong
   division within the group of the middle class, especially along the
   lines of the relationship with the state. Therefore, this study suggests
   that the Chinese middle class is a class without a shared class

Title = {Is measuring interest group influence a mission impossible? The case of
   interest group influence in the Danish parliament},

Abstract = {The question of interest groups influence is fundamental to our
   understanding and evaluation of political systems and processes. The
   definition and measurement of influence is however one of the most
   serious challenges to empirical studies of interest groups. Some argue
   that it is a mission impossible to observe the diffuse concept of
   influence. Nevertheless, more innovative methods have been developed to
   manage this challenge, but we do not know to what extent these different
   measurement methods agree, and therefore to what extent we can compare
   different studies and accumulate knowledge about which groups are
   influential and why. This article argues that, if different measures of
   influence correlate, we can have more faith in our measures and perhaps
   by triangulation come even closer to measuring at least important
   aspects of interest group influence. Therefore, the article is set out
   to test measurement agreement across different measures of interest
   groups' influence. It focuses on studies of many cases (large-N studies)
   and uses measures based on (i) survey data and (ii) documentary data.
   The Danish Parliament is the empirical setting of the study. First, the
   article reviews different definitions of influence and outlines the
   definition of this study. Here, influence is understood as control over
   political outputs, such as bills or parliamentary debates. Second, the
   article discusses strengths and weaknesses of different measures of
   influence. Survey data can illuminate informal venues of influence but
   may be biased by strategic replies from the interest groups. Documentary
   data can track the impact of group activity on political outputs in a
   more unbiased manner but can only uncover formal venues of influence.
   Put together, these indicators may provide a more valid measure of
   influence. This, however, requires the indicators to correlate. The
   article tests the agreement between these two sources of data across
   three different measures: (i) group activity; (ii) agenda-setting
   influence; and (iii) legislative influence. Agreement is strongest with
   relation to activities and weakest with relation to legislative
   influence, which was also expected. In general, the analyses show that
   even though measurement agreement is low, it is promising for future
   studies that different measures of influence are strongly and
   significantly correlated. The article finds no clear indications of some
   group types being less `honest' in their responses. We do not need to be
   very suspicious towards specific categories of groups, such as business
   for instance. The article does obtain results indicating that the
   formulation of response categories is very important to the answers we
   obtain and also important to the agreement between survey and
   documentary data. These findings implicate that measuring - aspects - of
   influence is not necessarily a mission impossible. As different measures
   correlate, we can compare different studies and thereby arrive at more
   general conclusions, and we may improve our studies by combining more
   measures of influence and also by paying even more attention to the
   design of the surveys we use.},

Abstract = {The Jewish Museum in Berlin is devoted to telling the 2,000-year history
   of Jews in Germany in a stunning building designed byDaniel Libeskind.
   It isGermany's premier museum devoted to Jewish history and memory, but
   it is expressly not a Holocaust museum and most reference to the
   Holocaust is architectural. In its interactive and sophisticated
   exhibitions, the Jewish Museum represents contemporary international
   trends in museology and in many ways resembles the many Holocaust and
   other memorial museums around the world, one of the most prominent and
   striking international museological trends. However, in rejecting the
   categorization as a memorial museum and in focusing on a celebration of
   German-Jewish culture and history rather than the tragedy of the
   Holocaust, the Jewish Museum is what we might call a countermemorial
   museum. As such, it challenges the new norms around the creation of
   memorial museums and other sites of memory to be self-reflexive
   meditations on the negative past and its trauma. If memorial museums
   emerge from a particular orientation toward the past that Jeffrey Olick
   calls the ``politics of regret{''} and claims is a major characteristic
   of our age, then the JewishMuseum might represent a parallel trend that
   we can call a ``politics of nostalgia.{''}The museum serves, in many
   ways, as a screen upon which present-day Germany can project an
   idealized image of its past, masking some of the present tensions around
   German national identity and ideas of German multiculturalism. At the
   same time, the museum often seems to be in conflict with Libeskind's
   building, which is infused with Holocaust symbolism andmeaning.},

Abstract = {Political responsibilities for systemic mass violence have been
   subordinated to the moral guilt and legal liability of perpetrators and
   collaborators, while the role of the bystander has been narrowly
   construed in terms of charitable rescue or negligence. This dominant
   victim-perpetrator framework ignores the complex political dimensions of
   bystander responsibilities for systemic mass violence, especially those
   responsibilities that stem from the benefits that bystanders receive.
   The films of Claude Lanzmann, Rithy Panh, and Yael Hersonski contain
   elements of an alternative framework of bystander responsibility and
   also can serve as catalysts for the political education of bystander
   beneficiaries and those from whom they have benefited.},

Abstract = {The research reported here sets out in some detail an experiment in
   deliberative democracy that took place in Ireland in 2011. The We the
   Citizens initiative featured a nationwide pilot citizens' assembly, the
   first of its kind in Ireland. It recruited a random selection of Irish
   residents to deliberate on specific issues relating to the economy and
   also reform in Irish politics. The paper explains the background to
   this, setting out how it was done and presenting some headline results.
   The results also tell us something about contemporary Irish attitudes to
   the political system.},

Abstract = {The theme of this article is political citizenship among people with
   disabilities. Political citizenship on the basis of gender and ethnicity
   has received attention internationally. However, there has been little
   attention on political citizenship of persons with disabilities. The
   article sheds light on political representation at the local level in
   Norway. The data used are from a survey sent to 767 political
   representatives in local politics and 50 administrative representatives.
   Our study shows that disabled people are under-represented in local
   political assemblies, and thus, their political citizenship is not fully
   acknowledged. We apply Fraser (N. Fraser, 1997. Justice Interruptus.
   Critical Reflections on the Postsocialist' Condition. New York and
   London: Routledge) concepts of redistribution and recognition to analyse
   the lack of representation of disabled people. According to the
   dimension of redistribution, the analysis shows that neither the
   physical conditions nor the organization of the different meetings is
   particularly well adapted for disabled people. The dimension of
   recognition shows that disabled representatives are expected to be more
   occupied with issues concerning disability than other representatives.
   The analysis also shows that over time it has become more important for
   elected disabled representatives to put issues concerning disability on
   the agenda.},

Abstract = {The signs of a definite anti-pluralist turn in the politics of some
   newly democratized countries in Europe are growing. The paper describes
   the present Hungarian political situation since the 2010 election. Due
   to a landslide electoral victory of the Hungarian Civic Union - Fidesz,
   the new government felt free to rearrange the whole constitutional and
   political system. Earlier institutions of control over the government
   have been restrained. The declared need for a ``strong state{''} in a
   crisis situation seemed to justify a resort to some authoritarian
   tendencies of the Hungarian past. The paper analyzes the political and
   ideological features that endanger the guaranties of rights and the
   achieved political pluralism. It deals with changes of the constitution
   and the role of the Constitutional Court, the much debated new media
   law, the constrained autonomy of interest organizations and local
   self-governments, and the decisive change of the electoral system. The
   paper analyses also presumable reasons for this anti-pluralist turn,
   weighing simple path-dependency in the political culture against the
   impact of the contemporary economic crisis. It stands in for the
   pluralist democratic engagement of 1989 that should be saved under the
   new challenges of the contemporary crisis.},

Abstract = {The simplistic, but still influential, idea of a clear-cut boundary
   between science and politics does not capture the complexities of the
   ongoing ``dialogue between science and politics.{''} Neither do
   political scientists live in an ivory tower, nor do they breathe the air
   of a separate world. However, the relation between political science
   practitioners and the rest of the world remains knotty. In this
   contribution we outline the value of a focus on ``practical
   reflexivity{''} to assist in the dialogue with political practice. Based
   on proposals from social theory we evaluate six strategies of coping
   with the dilemmas of engaging with practice. The strategies provide a
   menu of choice for political scientists, as well as systematization of
   furthering the discussion on practical reflexivity.},

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {57},
Number = {1},
Pages = {30-48},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Policy debates on strategies to end extremist violence frequently cite
   poverty as a root cause of support for the perpetrating groups. There is
   little evidence to support this contention, particularly in the
   Pakistani case. Pakistan's urban poor are more exposed to the negative
   externalities of militant violence and may in fact be less supportive of
   the groups. To test these hypotheses we conducted a 6,000-person,
   nationally representative survey of Pakistanis that measured affect
   toward four militant organizations. By applying a novel measurement
   strategy, we mitigate the item nonresponse and social desirability
   biases that plagued previous studies due to the sensitive nature of
   militancy. Contrary to expectations, poor Pakistanis dislike militants
   more than middle-class citizens. This dislike is strongest among the
   urban poor, particularly those in violent districts, suggesting that
   exposure to terrorist attacks reduces support for militants.
   Long-standing arguments tying support for violent organizations to
   income may require substantial revision.},

   author separates fight for breaking the dominating social and economic
   system and competition between political groupings within the existing
   formation. He analyses both examples of lawful political competition and
   actions going beyond legal field. He also mentions that widely discussed
   hypothesis of disappearance of revolutions ignores remaining social
   tensions, which even grow due to the development of globalization.},

Journal = {SCIENZA \& POLITICA-PER UNA STORIA DELLE DOTTRINE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {25},
Number = {49},
Pages = {81-106},
Abstract = {The dispute on mtissage starts to play a fundamental role in Latin
   America inside the modernist debates about the national unity between
   the end of the XIX century and the beginning of the XX century, to later
   acquire an unprecedented global diffusion in the eighties and the
   nineties of the last century. Using the writings of the Bolivian
   sociologist Silvia River Cusicanqui and of the Argentinian
   anthropologist, who has long since been active in Brazil, Rita Segato,
   the essay reconstructs the historic and political happening of mtissage
   in Latin America. The authors show that it is an historical concept
   which worked as an instance of legitimation both in the period of
   colonial oppression and later in the epoch of republican modernization.
   It represents the instrument to hide - if not to delete - the original
   character of modern State; for this reason it has been able to play a
   fundamental role in the epoch of liberalism as much as in the neoliberal
   one. However in mtissage what is also at stake is that it can express
   the radically de- colonizing impulse of the differences as forms of
   litigation which inhabit the complex contemporary Latin American
   territories.},

   Concerns for an Identity Crisis},
Journal = {ASIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Pages = {80-101},
Abstract = {The discipline of public administration in the Philippines has been
   undergoing its version of an `identity crisis' over the past decade.
   This crisis has been manifested in four areas: (1) the inordinate
   influence of mostly American public administration theories and concepts
   upon Philippines public administration has led Filipino academics in the
   early to mid-1980s to ask the question `is there a Philippine public
   administration?'; (2) the perceived disconnect between theories of
   public administration as taught in schools and the realities in the
   outside world has raised questions of the relevance of the discipline to
   real world challenges; (3) the continued frustration over the perception
   that in spite of many public administration and governance reforms, the
   Philippines continues to be among the more corrupt nations in the
   region; and (4) the recent fascination of academics in other
   disciplines, especially economists, that `institutions matter', has led
   some public administration scholars to argue that their discipline has
   been arguing precisely the same point since the 1950s.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {18},
Number = {2},
Pages = {219-242},
Abstract = {This paper develops a new method of examining ideology in mass
   populations. It presents results from an in-depth survey of 252 people
   examining their ideology, which is understood, following the account
   developed by Michael Freeden, as an interlinked series of conceptions of
   essentially contestable concepts. In contrast to the traditional
   left-right spectrum, measures of the presence of five ideological
   families in respondents thought behaviour (liberalism, socialism,
   republicanism, conservatism and libertarianism) were created. This was
   done by examining the degree to which they agreed with alternate
   conceptions of political concepts such as freedom, fairness and justice.
   This paper provides a short introduction, a theoretical framework, and
   presents the model used. Finally, it considers how the internal parts of
   the ideologies studied link to each other and to concrete policy
   preferences in aggregate data.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},

Volume = {75},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-16},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Electoral campaigns and policy debates are dynamic processes that unfold
   over time. In the contest for public opinion, each side tries to frame
   issues to its advantage, but success also depends on developing
   effective responses to opposition frames. Surprisingly, scholars have
   paid little attention to the dynamics of counterframing. In this
   article, we explore how the timing and repetition of counterframes
   affect their success. Using an over-time experiment, we test several
   hypotheses that the best counterframing strategy is contingent on the
   nature of audiences. Our results show that counterframing effects depend
   on the extent to which people hold strong or weak opinions. Thus, a
   uniformly successful communications strategy may be impossible as
   tactics that are effective on those with weak attitudes may be
   counterproductive on those with stronger viewpoints. We conclude with a
   discussion of normative and practical implications.},

Abstract = {Although contemporary political theory has recently develop an interest
   in the `disabled' as an expression of its concern with difference and
   minorities, it has not paid enough attention to the heterogeneity of
   bodily experiences described under the label disabled that is
   uncritically applied to the deaf. With the help of contemporary deaf
   studies and social and political theory, the article interprets deafness
   as a social construct that is instantiated partly though oralism and its
   educational dispositive. The article analizes the educational
   dispositive of oralism that aims at determining the field of action and
   the production of subjectivity of the deaf according to the model of
   modern subject and democratic citizen. This model, based on oralism and
   audism, has oppressive effects of cultural imperialism and symbolic
   violence over the deaf population. In opposition to the educational
   biopolitical dispositive of oralism, the sociopolitical action of the
   Deaf has the potential of activating an affirmative biopolitics of the
   body and a politics of identity and recognition of Deaf culture.},

Abstract = {Political projects are often grounded in theoretical analyses that
   present themselves as adequate to the world they hope to transform. This
   is true of many projects on the right as well as many on the left. In
   contrast, J. K. Gibson-Graham refuse any such notion of adequacy. Their
   refusal substantially complicates the ethical dimensions of academic
   practice, especially for those scholars who seek to promote projects of
   economic emancipation and justice. Gibson-Graham's practice provides a
   challenging vision of how we can engage ethically a world we cannot
   control. It is a practice based on what theologian Sharon Welch calls an
   ``ethic of risk{''}rather than an ``ethic of control{''}},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ELECTIONS PUBLIC OPINION AND PARTIES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {23},

Pages = {423-443},
Abstract = {In this article we analyze how issue attitudes of Austrian voters and
   political elites are ideologically structured. Our mass and elite data
   are based on the Austrian National Election Study (AUTNES) and allow for
   direct comparisons of the demand side (voters) and the supply side
   (party elites). Testing four different models from the literature with
   Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), we find that politicians' attitudes
   correspond to two-as well as three-dimensional configurations with quite
   strongly correlated economic and cultural dimensions. Voters' attitudes,
   by contrast, are not explained by any of the four models. This result
   casts some doubt on the existence of any strong ideological structure of
   attitudes in the mass public and therefore also questions the use of
   abstract concepts such as left-right to study the attitudinal congruence
   of representatives and voters.},

Abstract = {John F. Kennedy is remembered as the consummate American politician of
   his day, but he was also shaped by a distinct ethnic-religious
   tradition, that of Catholic Irish-Americans in the US. The often tragic
   history of Ireland is not easily reconciled with the power and glamour
   of the Kennedy family, but John Kennedy was closer to his immigrant
   roots than perhaps any other president. That heritage was often evident
   in his early political career and his rise to the White House. It was
   necessarily less obvious once he became president of a large and diverse
   nation. In the final months of his presidency, as he began to set a
   clearer direction for the nation both at home and abroad, he found time
   to visit Ireland. This seemingly sentimental journey had a more serious
   tone as well, as Kennedy recognized the origins of modern Irish
   nationalism.},

Journal = {POLITOLOGICKY CASOPIS-CZECH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Number = {4},
Pages = {392-418},
Abstract = {Research on political speeches is often done in countries with strong
   presidential powers, typically in the USA. However, political speeches
   by presidents are also a critical method of influencing public opinion
   in the Czech Republic. Therefore this article is focused on the analysis
   of speeches of the former President of the Czech Republic, Vaclav Klaus.
   Our research is based on a combination of quantitative and qualitative
   content analysis of Klaus' speeches (thematic units are used as the unit
   of analysis) found on his website (www.klaus.cz) in the period from 1995
   to the end of his presidency, March 2013 (N = 470).
   We aim to identify the changing structure of political issues in Klaus'
   speeches and changes in Klaus' position on those issues, and to uncover
   any characteristic features of his speeches (the use of personal
   pronouns, the role of the speaker, the tone of the speech, etc.).},

Abstract = {Patrick Emmenegger and Robert Klemmensen, What Motivates You? The
   Relationship between Preferences for Redistribution and Attitudes toward
   Immigration The tension between immigration and redistribution has
   attracted increased attention in recent years. Many authors argue, based
   on economic self-interest theory, that there is a negative relationship
   between support for redistribution and preferred levels of immigration.
   Notwithstanding the role of economic self-interest, there is in fact a
   multitude of motivations that moderate the relationship between
   preferences for redistribution and attitudes toward immigration. A model
   of preferences for immigration shows that self-interested and strongly
   reciprocal individuals experience a tension between immigration and
   redistribution, while egalitarians do not experience this tension.
   Humanitarians express a general willingness to help those who are worse
   off, immigrants included, but this motivation does not affect their
   preferences for redistribution.},

Abstract = {The chapter assesses the resource needs of the East Asian claimant
   states and discusses how their quest for and acquisition of natural
   resources has been influenced by international law. The East Asian
   states have increasingly turned to the sea in the hope of securing
   access to their living and non-living resources. For example, China is
   currently the world's largest consumer of marine resources and its
   economic growth is dependent on maintaining a secure supply of
   hydrocarbon resources. Significantly, the United Nations Convention on
   the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) has allowed coastal states to claim
   sovereignty rights to living and non-living natural resources in their
   exclusive economic zones (EEZ) and to the sedentary and non-living
   resources in their continental shelves.},

Abstract = {Severe economic and financial market crises exacerbate collective action
   problems and thus trigger challenges to legitimacy in democracies. The
   article presents a typology of decision-making modes in economic
   policy-making in normal times and crisis times. It shows that problems
   of time-inconsistency in combination with high uncertainty over
   re-distributive implications lead to an ``ad-hoc-technocratization{''}
   of economic policy-making. The separation of decision-taking from
   input-based legitimacy-procedures is relevant for scholars of democracy
   because the redistributive implications of crisis policies are high. The
   ``democratic deficit{''} of crisis policies is thus not a symptom of
   ``Post-Democracy{''} but of the specific context arising in an economic
   crisis.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CIVIL SOCIETY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {21-40},
Abstract = {This article proposes a modification of existing theory on the
   interaction between associational externalities and identity-based
   conflict, based on a case study of the Davao Ministerial Interfaith in
   the Mindanao region of the southern Philippines. Current explanations of
   conflict-related externalities, centring on the work of Robert Putnam
   and Ashutosh Varshney, tend to emphasize bridging associational
   structures to the extent of overlooking associational complexity and
   dynamism. While the case study data confirm the importance of bridging
   structures, there is equally strong evidence for the role of individual
   mindsets. Mindsets draw on deeply held beliefs, including religious
   beliefs, and shifts in mindset can catalyse behavioural and
   organizational change. Mindsets both enable and limit associational
   bridging, especially in societies that are deeply divided along
   identity-based lines. This article proposes a highly applicable,
   cyclical model for re-conceptualizing the mutual influence of structure
   and mindsets in shaping an association's conflict-related externalities.},

Abstract = {Assumptions that higher levels of trust in government are always
   beneficial to democracy may be inappropriate, and the extent to which
   residents of the United States (US) trust government is often
   underestimated due to common interpretations of public opinion data.
   Reexamining the widely used American National Election Studies (ANES)
   data, we find that US citizens are more trusting than is generally
   portrayed and typically have attitudes and behaviors that are healthy
   for democracy. We also outline shortcomings with the ANES trust
   question. Using an alternative measure of political trust, we
   demonstrate that the ANES question hides important variation in
   citizens' levels of trust and tends to understate levels of trust. In
   sum, the often- expressed concern over current levels of political trust
   in the US is likely misplaced and researchers there and elsewhere should
   give careful consideration to measuring and interpreting trust.},

Pages = {53-76},
Abstract = {Personalization of politics is a major topic in discussions about
   elections and electoral behavior. Does the personalization of politics
   imply an individualization of campaigning as well? Up to now, this
   question has not been sufficiently dealt with. On basis of the 2009
   European Election Candidate Study carried out in all 27 member countries
   of the EU, three main research questions are addressed: (1) Are there
   significant differences with regard to candidate-and party-centered
   campaign strategies between countries or party families? (2) Which
   factors account for such differences? (3) Do preferences for a campaign
   strategy have consequences for campaign efforts of candidates and the
   means they use? Results show that the dominant feature is party-centered
   campaigning, but close to one-fifth of the candidates prefer
   candidate-centered campaigning. A number of hypotheses are tested with a
   multi-level model showing that candidates react to electoral and
   institutional incentives. It is a strategic choice to go for a more
   personalized campaign. This choice has consequences for campaign efforts
   and means used.},

   represent the most political sports event of all. The following article
   focuses on two of the most important aspects of the Olympics (and sports

   Olympics by states to showcase the host nation and the hoped-for
   `legacies' that arise from them. Both aspects are, of course,
   interlinked: the `legacies' are often put forward as the key rationale

Abstract = {The Conferences of the Ministers of the German `Lander' (LMKen) are
   classified as horizontal co-ordination bodies in co-operative
   federalism, although the federal level is known to be involved in their
   negotiations. Our paper investigates conditions and extent of federal
   involvement in order to come to a more precise understanding of the
   conferences' role in German federalism. An analysis of resolutions of
   the LMK proceedings shows that federal involvement is far higher than
   theoretically expected. The LMKen serve not primarily as a shield
   against federal interference, but rather to coordinate and influence
   federal decision-making. The combination of obligatory negotiations
   (Politikverflechtung) and voluntary co-ordination (co-operative
   federalism) promotes flexible yet committing decisions thus avoiding
   decision deadlocks.},

Title = {Does critical diversity pay in higher education? Race, gender, and
   departmental rankings in research universities},
Journal = {POLITICS GROUPS AND IDENTITIES},

Pages = {299-310},
Abstract = {``Critical diversity{''} is the equal inclusion of people from varied
   backgrounds on a parity basis throughout all ranks and divisions of an
   organization. The critical diversity perspective argues that as
   organizations become more diverse, they benefit relative to their
   competitors. This is in contrast to other accounts that view diversity
   as either inconsequential to success or actually detrimental. Using data
   from the 2011 National Academy of Sciences (NAS) Rankings of U.S.
   Research Universities, this paper examines whether racial and gender
   diversity ``pay{''} in terms of the rankings of academic programs at
   research universities. The NAS data set consists of several indicators
   relating to research productivity, student support and outcomes, and
   program diversity from over 5000 doctoral programs at US research
   universities. The results show that net of factors such as publication
   rates, grants, scholarly awards, program size, region, and whether the
   institution is public or private, racial and gender diversity among
   faculty and students at research universities are positively associated
   with departmental rankings. The paper discusses the implications of
   these findings for diversity in higher education.},

Title = {A Political Science Study of Mediation in Central America: The Case of
   Costa Rica},
Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {50},

Pages = {113-144},
Abstract = {Mediation is a method of alternative dispute resolution. It should be
   considered as an instrument for the peaceful resolution of conflicts
   that contributes to make a change in the conduct of human relations. It
   also provides a better quality of life and promotes social peace.
   Mediation is the inter-vention of a neutral third party in a conflict.
   The conflict could be in the community, it could be organizational,
   economic, legal or political. The third party (mediator) will intervene
   in order that the parties in conflict resolve their problems and
   differences in a safe environment.
   This paper examines the mediation that the Costa Rican political system
   has used to resolve dis-putes. This analysis evaluates the theoretical
   elements, and it does a brief historical overview of the peace process
   in Central America. It studies the way in which the Supreme Electoral
   Tribunal, the Ombudsman, the Episcopal Conference of the Catholic Church
   and the National Council of Rectors (CONARE), intervened as third
   parties (mediatiors). They were recognized by non-governmental actors
   that needed help from a mediator to resolve their conflicts relating to
   certain gubernamental public policies developed by the current
   government. It also addresses a turning point in 2007, when was
   presented the first referendum in Costa Rican political system as an
   alternative to resolve the dispute in connection with the discussion of
   the text of the Free Trade Agreement between the United States of
   America Central America and Dominican Republic (DRCAFTA). This happened
   because of the loss of legitimacy of some parts, who historically had
   been involved in conflict resolution.},

Number = {1},
Pages = {16-27},
Month = {JAN-MAR},
Abstract = {Despite its worthy motives, social market philosophy provides neither a
   useful analytical framework for understanding modern capitalism, nor the
   policy tools to address our present economic and social predicament. The
   concept of market failure', with its underlying assumption of market
   equilibrium, does not capture the systemically adverse outcomes of
   collective market forces. A more sophisticated understanding of
   capitalist economies, and the societies in which they exist, would
   recognise that the market economy is a dynamic but not self-regulating
   system. It is embedded in, and impacts on, four other economies of the
   natural environment, of family and care, of voluntary association, and
   of the public sector which operate under different motivations and
   allocative principles. The role of government is central, to balance the
   values created by different kinds of institutions and to constrain the
   dynamic impacts of market forces. A number of policy conclusions are
   offered arising from this framework.},

Abstract = {Throughout her history, Iran's experiences with the West have been
   rather paradoxical. While on one hand these experiences have been
   troubled by violence and exploitation, Western ideas have also acted as
   an impetus for democratic reform. The second half of the \& 19th century
   saw a number of intellectuals advocate judicial, political and economic
   reforms based on Enlightenment principles, and particularly
   republicanism, which laid the groundwork for constitutional demands in
   1906. Secularist intellectuals were not the only actors responsible for
   Iranian constitutional transformation, however. The Ulama were crucial
   in effectively mobilizing the Iranian population around nonviolent
   resistance strategies such as bast (sanctuary), which were crucial in
   gaining democratic concessions from the Qajar government.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ELECTIONS PUBLIC OPINION AND PARTIES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Pages = {86-110},
Abstract = {Analyses of both aggregate-level constituency data and individual-level
   survey data from the 1983-2005 British General Elections indicate that
   when available information clearly signals which parties in a
   constituency are viable and which are not, supporters of nonviable
   parties vote tactically. Alliance/Liberal Democrat tactical voters tend
   to split their votes between Labour and the Conservatives, so the major
   parties derive limited net benefit from them. When Labour faces a dismal
   outlook in a constituency many of its supporters also vote tactically,
   and those that do overwhelmingly cast their votes for the
   Alliance/Liberal Democrats. Strong tactical support received from Labour
   voters has furnished the margin of victory in as many as a fifth of the
   contests that the Alliance/Liberal Democrats have won. A party that has
   repeatedly seen Duverger's ``mechanical{''} factor reduce the sizable
   share of votes it wins nationally to a far smaller share of seats thus
   turns out to be the biggest beneficiary of tactical voting.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to contribute to the scholarly understanding of both
   Catholicism and Latino religious beliefs. Our approach is to look within
   the Catholic category to test whether differing theological approaches
   have political implications. Using a recent Texas survey with a range of
   religious questions and an oversample of Latino respondents, we test
   whether intra-Catholic religious orientations help to structure
   attitudes toward immigration and life policies for Latinos and Anglos.
   For each group, we compare two kinds of Catholics - ``Evangelical
   Catholics{''} (those who report evangelical-charismatic-literalist
   beliefs) and ``Mainstream Catholics{''} (those who do not). This builds
   on McDaniel and Ellison's findings by asking whether ostensibly similar
   religious beliefs may have different effects by race and ethnicity. Our
   aggregate data provide some evidence that intra-Catholic differences can
   influence policy opinions, and that race-ethnicity can play a mediating
   role.},

   back to Mexico's presidency appeared as a central episode. One of the
   legacies of the presidential campaign was the emergence of the social
   movement \#YoSoy132 made up primarily of youngsters and university
   students. During 2012, the Mexican economy continued to grow, slowly but
   at a steady pace, while different reforms were approved in Congress. We
   review the labor, educational, and political reforms. Finally, we
   describe the evolution of violence -homicides and disappearances- and
   changes in the prosecution of human rights violations.},

Abstract = {Why run for reelection when the logic and incentives of the political
   system leave no doubt that running for other offices is a better option?
   This paper focuses on the factors that influence both the choice of
   career and the electoral success of those who run for reelection and
   those who attempt to obtain other offices, using Brazil as a case study,
   a typically fragmented, multiparty environment with a strong executive.
   We argue that legislators run for reelection because it is the safest
   bet for them. The probability of winning is higher for those who attempt
   reelection than for those running for any other office. Because static
   ambition is conditioned by election results and not by the intrinsic
   desire to develop a career in the legislative branch, career paths do
   not necessarily lead to improvements in legislative professionalization
   and institutionalization. This finding contradicts theories that relate
   career paths to legislative institutionalization.},

Abstract = {Given that hipsters typically come from the ``professional middle
   class,'' how are we to make sense of the interest they have in objects
   that have a working-class aura about them: things like Pabst beer,
   trucker hats, and secondhand work shirts? I present two ways of
   interpreting these objects: as markers of ``cool'' within status games
   played by hipsters and as acknowledgment of a kind of solidarity between
   hipsters and the working class. In both cases, the class dimension is
   covered over in the consciousness of hipsters. With an awareness of the
   class dimension of what hipsters do, perhaps we can reconfigure hip
   rebellion so as to increase the likelihood that people attracted to it
   will channel their rebellious urges in anticapitalist directions. One
   direction they should be encouraged to go in is that of learning how to
   work with working-class people to transform capitalist social
   arrangements, which is what leftists from the professional middle class
   must do as well.},

Abstract = {By analyzing the European policy on the `Iranian nuclear crisis' and
   examining the transatlantic relations on this issue, this article
   explores the position of the European Union in the international system.
   The study highlights the role of leading states in the European foreign
   policy process and the recurrent distance from the U.S sanctions policy
   against Iran. Rather than conceiving of it as an instrument or as an
   autonomous actor, we suggest that the European Union can be useful
   considered as an arena where actions are transformed in order to
   understand how its specific dynamics shape international politics.},

   There are many problems: the constant churn in new qualifications
   reduces their vale to higher education and to employers; they are
   implemented without proper trialling; the EBacc in particular narrows
   the learning experience. There is a need for a moratorium on change and
   for a long, hard look by a non-politically partisan advisory committee
   on the development of a qualification system.},

   a slogan that has guided not only the three most populous countries in

Journal = {POLITOLOGICKY CASOPIS-CZECH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Number = {1},
Pages = {69-92},
Abstract = {This study deals with the phenomenon of paradiplomacy, or parallel
   diplomacy. Paradiplomacy refers to international activities of cities
   and regions and includes marketing and public diplomacy, cross-border
   cooperation, functional trans-border cooperation, cultural and
   educational cooperation, and other activities. Paradiplomacy developed
   in the last third of the 20th century as a result of economic
   globalization, state decentralization, nationalism and the strengthening
   of regional identity, European integration, and the internationalization
   of cultural, educational, environmental, transport and other topics
   labelled as ``low politics{''}. Thus, we can identify both economic and
   political foundations of paradiplomacy. The first part of the study
   presents a review of literature on paradiplomacy; the second part is a
   case study of foreign policy instituted by the City of Prague in the
   electoral term 2006-2010. This case study confirmed initial hypotheses:
   first, that paradiplomacy is influenced by three supra-national factors:
   economic globalization (a), regional and global political and economic
   regimes (b), and transnational networks, mainly based in the EU (c);
   second, that paradiplomacy is influenced by institutional and
   constitutional relations between the centre and regions; third, that
   paradiplomacy is influenced by the antagonistic nature of these
   relations.},

   Competition for Funding},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CIVIL SOCIETY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Pages = {341-360},
Abstract = {The debate about the funding and support of civil society by government
   bodies has become a central and politicized issue in many countries.
   European states in particular have sought to make use of civil society
   to deliver key supra-national policy aims of addressing economic and
   social disadvantage, as well as delivering national and territorial
   outcomes. To this end European structural funding has been used at a
   regional level to develop and engage organizations and their
   beneficiaries. One of the key considerations in such activity is the
   ability of civil society organizations to engage with the funding
   available, and whether structural barriers exist that potentially
   prevent organizations with relevant expertise participating. In order to
   illustrate this, this article investigates how civil society
   organizations fared in gaining funds from the 2007-2013 European Social
   Fund (ESF) programmes in Wales, what, if any, barriers were found to
   exist in acquiring those funds and what this means for the sector in
   Wales in the context of future funding. The wider significance of this
   work is in revealing how the structural embeddedness of organizations
   plays a significant role in determining organizational success in
   gaining ESF funds, and how this contributes to a cleavage in the sector
   as a whole. Thus, this article concludes that it is organizations that
   are structurally embedded that will be most successful in gaining ESF
   funds, due to their organizational characteristics and their
   institutionalized relationships with, and receipts from, the state.
   Other organizations, conversely, are shown to become structurally
   excluded.},

Abstract = {It is not true that ``once a terrorist, always a terrorist{''}. Most
   terrorist groups and individuals end their involvement sooner or later,
   voluntarily or involuntarily. The preventive mechanism involves bringing
   about an end to individual terrorist careers and collective campaigns
   sooner rather than later. This requires a combination of push and pull
   factors, making continued involvement in terrorism less attractive and
   providing realistic and attractive exit options. Measures could involve
   amnesties or lighter sentencing/prison conditions, peace processes,
   political reforms or programs to facilitate disengagement and
   reintegration into mainstream society. Bringing an end to terrorist
   campaigns should be the ultimate goal of counter-terrorism. However, if
   amnesty to former terrorists is part of the process to end terrorist
   campaigns, it may compromise the rule of law and cause further pain to
   the victims of terrorists.},

   Rampant Rise in Inequality Over the Past Thirty Years?},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {35},
Number = {3},
Pages = {389-402},
Abstract = {This article explores why over the past thirty years political theorists
   largely failed to address the emergence of neoliberal capitalism and the
   debilitating effects of growing inequality on the lives of ordinary
   people and on the nature of democracy. The article argues that the
   predominant focus of political theory from the 1980s onwards on the role
   of group identity in political action and on epistemological questions
   of the nature of the self, while having the positive effect of helping
   theorists to interrogate forms of domination that cannot be reduced to
   class, also led many ``radical{''} political theorists to downplay how
   the macro-structural workings of late capitalism-and the neoliberal
   erosion of social rights-limit the possibilities for human freedom. The
   article concludes by arguing that if radical political theory is to
   inform political practice it must revitalize a theoretical understanding
   of social solidarity and of democratic equality.},

Journal = {TEORIA Y REALIDAD CONSTITUCIONAL},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {31},
Pages = {299-321},
Abstract = {The perception of the Judicial Council is, throughout its existence, too
   often associated to partisan or corporative interests. This has caused
   the image of the judiciary to suffer as a whole. One way to avoid
   dependence on outside interests is the procedure to appoint its members.
   Until now, three systems were tested, but none proved to be effective
   for the intended aims. This essay formulates a new appointment system
   proposal for the Council's members, involving the direct participation
   of judges and the legislature. It pursues the following objectives: to
   observe the democratic principle, and to facilitate and promote the
   participation of all judges and magistrates in the election of its
   governing body -thus ensuring a plural and inclusive body-.
   Additionally, other measures are formulated in order to limit outside
   influences and pressure on the Council, to promote the election of its
   members based primarily on merit and ability, and to steer the Council
   back to its strict mandate of defending judicial independence and
   Justice interests.},

Journal = {BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES OF TERRORISM AND POLITICAL AGGRESSION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {5},
Number = {3},
Pages = {217-224},
Abstract = {Recently, Jackson offered a minimally foundationalist, contingent
   redefinition of terrorism. This response article raises four main
   concerns with Jackson's attempted redefinition. The concerns in short
   are: (1) the redefinition of terrorism is voiced from a narrow
   methodological perspective that unduly limits the scope of possible ways
   to study terrorism in a systematic, critical mode; (2) it reifies
   terrorism as a form of extraordinary violence, which is problematic
   because it leads researchers to assume what could be explained and it
   leads researchers to miss salient and significant empirical traces of
   terrorism and counter-terrorism; (3) the redefinition of terrorism and
   the particular methodological stance it works from are insufficiently
   reflexive for a completely constructivist approach to terrorism studies;
   (4) it is less useful at organizing terrorism studies than a systematic
   clarification of the ontological and epistemological frameworks
   available to scholars studying terrorism.},

Title = {One God, Many Wars: Religious Dimensions of Armed Conflict in the
   Middle East and North Africa},
Journal = {CIVIL WARS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {15},
Number = {4},
Pages = {411-430},
Abstract = {This paper examines the religious dimensions of armed conflicts in the
   Middle East and North Africa (MENA), a region where the monotheistic
   religions of Judaism, Islam, and Christianity traditionally dominate.
   Applying a regional perspective, this study finds that about half of the
   armed conflicts in the MENA region were between parties, where at least
   one side had made explicit reference to religion in their basic demands,
   and this category of conflicts has increased substantially over time.
   Why are religious civil wars becoming relatively more common over time
   in the MENA region? I argue that the relatively high frequency of
   religious armed intrastate conflicts in the region can be explained by
   three major empirical regularities: (1) the intractability of
   interreligious conflicts; (2) the spread of several but relatively
   shorter intrareligious disputes; and (3) the increasingly transnational
   aspect of religious disputes in the MENA region. Although these trends
   have been countered by the emergence of institutional settlements of
   some of the armed conflicts, these types of conflict management and
   conflict resolution attempts have, so far, been too few to generate a
   general shift in the basic empirical patterns. This paper provides an
   empirical overview over the main patterns and ends by identifying some
   important avenues for future research.},

   Incongruence between Voters and Parties},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ELECTIONS PUBLIC OPINION AND PARTIES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {23},

Pages = {456-483},
Abstract = {How come voters and their parties agree or disagree on policy issues? We
   claim that voter-party mismatches are due to a lack of information of
   voters regarding parties' positions. Three mechanisms determine levels
   of information: ideology, salience, and complexity. We test these ideas
   drawing on a large sample of policy statements (50) presented to voters
   and party leaders prior to regional elections in Belgium. Contrary to
   existing studies, we include predictors on all three levels: issue,
   voter, and party level. We find support for our claim. Major ideological
   divides such as the left-right divide yield useful information to the
   voters about where parties stand. Salience also generates information
   for voters, or makes information more accessible for voters, which
   decreases the odds that they have a different stance than their party.
   Our measures of complexity yielded the expected results too. When the
   task of voting is made more difficult, voters succeed less in voting for
   a party that matches their preferences.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL CRITICAL THOUGHT},

Pages = {496-509},
Abstract = {A core requirement for addressing the ecological crisis will be to
   reverse the expansionist thrust, which is inherent in capitalism. I
   explore the political conditions for achieving such a reversal, asking
   specifically on what basis a vast popular movement inspired by this goal
   may emerge. Because the drive to economic accumulation arises from the
   class interest of capital, a coherent and effective opposition to it
   must reflect a class position opposed to capital. In this sense,
   environmentalism is a class issue. After noting earlier theoretical
   expressions of this insight, I review (focusing on the US case) key
   expressions of explicit working-class environmentalism. How can such
   awareness be extended and amplified? Recognizing the diversity of
   constituencies that a working-class perspective must embody, I examine
   environmentalist dimensions of the demands associated with particular
   sectors (notably, the anti-racist and the feminist movements). It
   becomes apparent that whereas the legitimacy of such demands has
   attained wide formal acceptance, the related challenge to concentrated
   economic power continues to be marginalized and even stigmatized. An
   important prop to such stigmatization in the United States is the
   persistent credence accorded, in public discourse, to pseudo-scientific
   denials of the environmental crisis. But a more insidious obstacle to
   anti-capitalist mobilization is the contention, on the part of
   self-proclaimed anti-{''}catastrophists,{''} that although radical
   social change is desirable, advocating it as part of an ecological
   agenda is counterproductive to the near-term task of promoting
   environmental reforms within the capitalist setting. I argue, on the
   contrary, that theorizing and organizing for a socialist alternative is
   necessary not only for long-term purposes, but also as a basis for
   identifying immediate steps to be taken. I suggest that a basis for
   reconciling urgent practical measures with society-wide transformation
   may be found in the tradition of struggles for worker control.},

Title = {Discussions Across Borders: A German-American Partnership},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE EDUCATION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Pages = {474-486},
Abstract = {This article reports on our experiences in a German-American partnership
   in internationalizing the curriculum. In a globalized world, engaging
   other cultures and identities as well as understanding global issues and
   events from other perspectives are important qualifications that allow
   students to gain different insights in political science. Yet, not all
   students have the opportunity to study abroad to achieve these goals.
   Today's technology, however, offers effective methods and techniques for
   internationalizing the curriculum and requiring students to think beyond
   their own national borders. Our ``discussions across borders'' show how
   communication technology can be utilized to create opportunities for
   international exchanges with students at a university in another
   country. Beginning in 2008, students at the University of North Florida
   and University of Muenster engaged in joint online discussions on
   international issues. Based upon the achievement of educational
   objectives, we consider these online discussions an effective way to
   increase student awareness of other cultures and perspectives as well as
   substantive course content. As such discussions could be replicated at
   other institutions, this article presents the educational objectives
   for, design and process of, assessment of, and challenges in carrying
   out discussions across borders.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},

Volume = {32},
Number = {4},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Although national elections in Latin America are now described as
   reasonably free and fair by international observations teams, electoral
   processes are still affected by a series of malpractices (unequal access
   to the media and public resources, registration problems, vote buying).
   These irregularities negatively affect citizens' trust in elections. In
   this paper, we analyze the consequences of low trust in elections and
   exposure to vote buying practices on electoral participation in Latin
   America. Using data from the 2010 wave of LAPOP surveys, we find that
   perceiving that the election is unfair reduces the willingness to
   participate in national elections, but receiving material incentives
   during the campaign has the opposite effect of increasing electoral
   participation. We also show that the effect of trust in elections on
   turnout is larger in countries where voting is not mandatory. (C) 2013

Abstract = {This note places mass killing in a continuum of actions that a ruling
   power can take to remove an unwanted group from a society; that is, it
   views extermination as a means to an end, and it assumes that rulers are
   rational and will choose the combination of means that can achieve their
   goal at the minimum cost to themselves. The means are assimilation into
   the general society, physical removal from view (through either
   deportation within the country or exile from the country), and
   extermination. The note develops a simple model of input choice geared
   to cost minimization and then finds encouraging support from the
   historical evidence on communist regimes.},

Abstract = {This article examines turnout and voting choices at general elections
   among Pacific peoples in New Zealand between 1996 and 2011 and
   investigates this further through a secondary analysis of data from the
   New Zealand Election Study. It finds that turnout is lower among Pacific
   peoples compared to other electors, but that this is mainly accounted
   for by political-psychological and socio-demographic factors. It finds
   strong support for the Labour Party among Pacific peoples, who were
   twice as likely as other electors to vote Labour. Reasons for the strong
   attachment to Labour are explored, and the implications of lower turnout
   among Pacific peoples are discussed.},

Abstract = {This fortieth anniversary edition of Politikon is an opportune moment to
   examine one of the abiding themes of South African foreign policy since
   the end of apartheid, that of the tension between moral foreign policy
   and state interests. This article, situated within the literature on
   norm diffusion and norm localisation, seeks to examine the influence of
   South African leftist academics and the establishment of the moral'
   route in South African foreign policy after the ending of apartheid in
   1994. It is suggested that the rise of an epistemic community, along
   with the liberation struggle history of the African National Congress
   (ANC), facilitated the internalisation of certain global human rights
   norms, but it is less clear the extent to which these norms were
   inhibited from becoming settled' norms or solidified in the wake of
   national liberation in South Africa. Many commentators have questioned
   the loss of moral compass' of South Africa's foreign policy after
   Mandela. This article seeks to analyse which norms academics were able
   to build, and how these norms encountered domestic and international
   opposition in the process of their becoming entrenched. This will go
   some way to resolving the puzzle of South Africa's switch' from
   principled state to pragmatic actor that has accompanied the country's
   profile in recent years.},

Abstract = {This essay compares the National Oil Companies (NOCs) of Venezuela and
   Colombia in three ways: 1.) Describes the trajectories of Ecopetrol and
   PDVSA, diverging since 2003 (with semi-privatization of the former and
   strict Government-control of the latter). 2.) Compares Venezuela's
   current (state-centered) and Colombia's (marketcentered) oil regimes by
   access to resources, organizational model, and competition/monopoly. 3.)
   Compares state governance of the two NOCs in various dimensions of form
   and function, and completes this matrix with a look at their industrial
   relations. Parallels between the NOCs through the times would inspire
   empathy in their managers, helping them to advance joint projects like a
   pipeline from the Orinoco Belt to the Pacific Coast. A
   Colombian-Venezuelan convergence on oil regulation seemed likely, with
   China as another beneficiary.},

Abstract = {In recent years, WikiLeaks and Anonymous have made headlines
   distributing confidential information, defacing websites, and generating
   protest around political issues. Although many have dismissed these
   actors as terrorists, criminals, and troublemakers, we argue that such
   actors are emblematic of a new kind of political actor: extraordinary
   bandits (e-bandits) that engage in the politics of no one via
   anonymizing Internet technologies. Building on Hobsbawm's idea of the
   social bandit, we show how these actors fundamentally change the terms
   of global activism. First, as political actors, e-bandits are akin to
   Robin Hood, resisting the powers that be who threaten the desire to keep
   the Internet free, not through lobbying legislators, but by `taking'
   what has been deemed off limits. Second, e-banditry forces us to think
   about how technology changes `ordinary' transnational activism. Iconic
   images of street protests and massive marches often underlie the way we
   as scholars think about social movements and citizen action; they are
   ordinary ways we expect non-state actors to behave when they demand
   political change. E-bandits force us to understand political protest as
   virtual missives and actions, activity that leaves no physical traces
   but that has real-world consequences, as when home phone numbers and
   addresses of public officials are released. Finally, e-banditry is
   relatively open in terms of who participates, which contributes to the
   growing sense that activism has outgrown organizations as the way by
   which individuals connect. We illustrate our theory with the actions of
   two e-bandits, Anonymous and WikiLeaks.},

Title = {A right-to-left policy switch? An analysis of the Honduran case under
   Manuel Zelaya},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},

Abstract = {A member of the Honduran elite and elected president with a
   right-of-center platform in 2005, Manuel Zelaya soon came to be allied
   with Latin America's bloc of radical left-wing governments - this being
   the first case of a post-democratization right-to-left policy switch in
   the region. The aim of this article is to assess the reasons that could
   have motivated Zelaya's ideological turn. After a brief discussion of
   the Honduran political process, we review the literature about the issue
   of policy switching and proceed to an empirical analysis of the Honduran
   case. We find that the fragility of the country's energy sector and the
   alliance with Venezuela in a context of international economic crisis
   and high oil prices could have triggered a causal mechanism in Honduras
   similar to the one caused by currency scarcity and international
   pressure pointed to by the literature as the leading cause for
   traditional left-to-right switches, which suggests that this case study
   could serve as a pattern-matching exercise to the general findings of
   currently accepted switch theory.},

Abstract = {Soviet culture was obsessed with youth: At the same time, real problems
   of puberty and adolescence could not be discussed. The ambivalence of
   this transitional stage of life was pushed aside. The aesthetics of
   socialist realism demanded clarity. On top of that, there existed in
   Russian culture an older tradition of hostility towards the body. The
   verbal taboo fell during Perestroika. However, the apparent post-Soviet
   liberality in this matter does not mean that puberty has become a phase
   of life free of fear for Russia's youth.},

Abstract = {How are civilian attitudes toward combatants affected by wartime
   victimization? Are these effects conditional on which combatant
   inflicted the harm? We investigate the determinants of wartime civilian
   attitudes towards combatants using a survey experiment across 204
   villages in five Pashtun-dominated provinces of Afghanistan-the heart of
   the Taliban insurgency. We use endorsement experiments to indirectly
   elicit truthful answers to sensitive questions about support for
   different combatants. We demonstrate that civilian attitudes are
   asymmetric in nature. Harm inflicted by the International Security
   Assistance Force (ISAF) is met with reduced support for ISAF and
   increased support for the Taliban, but Taliban-inflicted harm does not
   translate into greater ISAF support. We combine a multistage sampling
   design with hierarchical modeling to estimate ISAF and Taliban support
   at the individual, village, and district levels, permitting a more
   fine-grained analysis of wartime attitudes than previously possible.},

Title = {The reform-security dilemma in democratic transitions: the Turkish

Pages = {1144-1164},

Abstract = {In considering the future of budding Middle Eastern democracies, past
   experience and scholarship show that a possible outcome for even the
   most successful ones is some form of imperfect democracy. Based within
   the literature on democratic transitions and hybrid regimes, this
   article explores possible factors leading to such outcomes. It focuses
   in particular on reform/security dilemmas, and the resulting evolution
   of dual state structures, in which an unelected and often authoritarian
   state establishment coexists with democratic institutions and practices,
   for example, in countries like Russia, Iran, or Pakistan. Much of the
   literature views such duality as an impasse, and thus considers these
   countries as trapped within this hybridness - discouraging news both for
   currently defined hybrid regimes and for countries like Egypt and
   Tunisia, which are now launching democratization processes. To better
   understand the nature and evolution of such regimes, this article looks
   at the case of Turkey, first tracing the rise and consolidation of the
   Turkish inner state, generally equated with the Turkish armed forces. It
   then looks at the apparent diminishing and integration of the inner
   state through pacts and coalitions among both civilian and military
   elements, and calls into question whether the pessimistic view of
   permanent illiberalness is inevitable.},

Abstract = {This article analyses political debates about civic integration policies
   in the Netherlands, so as to identify different conceptions of the role
   of the state in ensuring social cohesion by governing diversity. Drawing
   on the literature on party systems, it presents an analysis of political
   party positions on the role of the state in civic integration along two
   dimensions: economic distribution on the one hand, and sociocultural
   governance on the other hand. I find that while the large majority of
   Dutch political parties adopt authoritarian positions on the
   sociocultural axis in favour of state intervention to protect Dutch
   culture and identity, their positions diverge significantly on the
   classic economic Left-Right dimension. The most contentious issue in
   Dutch civic integration politics is whether the state, the market or
   individual migrants should be responsible for financing and organising
   courses. Thus, this article proposes an innovative model for analysing
   the politics of citizenship, which enables us to comprehend how
   citizenship policies are shaped not only by views on how identity and
   culture relate to social cohesion, but also by diverging perspectives on
   socio-economic justice.},

Abstract = {The likelihood of conflict and the observation of joint democracy tend
   to cluster regionally. This article tests the argument that these
   clusters can be explained by regional variations in the stability of
   international borders using a new dataset of territorial dispute hot
   spots from 1960-1998. These hot spots identify spatial and temporal
   correlations in the territorial dispute data and therefore serve as
   close proxies for regional or neighbourhood instability. The addition of
   these hot spots also eliminates a common form of omitted variable bias -
   the spatial clustering of conflict - in international conflict models.
   These results confirm that joint democracy is only statistically
   significant as a predictor of fatal militarized interstate disputes in
   more peaceful neighbourhoods once territorial hot spots are jointly
   estimated. The interaction between joint democracy and regional
   instability confirms that the effects of regime type on continued
   conflict apply mostly to dyads in peaceful regions.},

Abstract = {Does living in close proximity to members of other ethnic groups make
   people more or less tolerant of ethnic differences? How does the
   interaction between local electoral competition and ethnic demography
   affect tolerance? This article examines these questions by combining
   survey data with new measures of local ethnic composition and political
   competition in Kenya. People living in ethnically diverse areas report
   higher levels of interethnic trust, while residentially segregated
   people are less trusting of members of other ethnic groups. There is
   little evidence that local electoral competition decreases tolerance
   even in ethnically diverse areas. This article has important
   implications for the study of the political and economic consequences of
   ethnic diversity and suggests that even in developing countries, where
   resource conflict, along ethnic lines, is acute and sometimes violent,
   sharing neighborhoods with members of different ethnic groups may lead
   to tolerance.},

Abstract = {Edelman's new ethics of queer theory is focussed on the all-pervasive
   image of the child, which he argues provides the foundation for the
   hegemonic politics of reproductive futurism' (L. Edelman, 2004. No
   future: queer theory and the death drive. Durham, NC: Duke University
   Press). His searing criticism raises important questions for sexual
   citizenship, and particularly for the gay parent as citizen. Edelman's
   argument that queers should abandon accommodation and instead embrace
   their position as the figure of negativity offers a challenge to all
   those gay men that seek to be fathers. In this article, I critically
   engage with Edelman's arguments and explore the implications of a queer
   rejection of reproductive futurism and parental privilege through an
   empirical investigation of young gay men's stories about the possibility
   of becoming fathers. I argue that whilst Edelman's uncompromising stance
   serves to open a space for gay men embracing the jouissance that is
   increasingly being abandoned through an assimilationist desire for
   citizenship, it also, more problematically, closes down possibilities
   for gay men and thus further reinforces present inequalities in
   citizenship. Is negativity the only option in the face of the onslaught
   of reproductive futurism or might there be a dialectical solution that
   is at once radically queer but also reflective of the variety of claims
   for sexual citizenship?},

Abstract = {Outside academia, John Rawls's theory of justicejustice as fairnesshas
   had little impact. This article is part of a broader project to rectify
   this. I offer a distinctive, second-best, argument for Rawls's
   difference principle. The difference principle requires that
   inequalities in income and wealth are justified only if they benefit
   society's least-advantaged citizens. My paper argues that,
   slightly-modified, the difference principle is an excellent principle of
   redress in light of the UK's continued failure to give all citizens fair
   career chances. I show how we might realize the difference principle at
   the level of policy through tax rate reductions or negative tax rates. I
   conclude that if you don't want to accept the second-best argument for
   the difference principle you must get serious about giving all citizens
   fair career chances. As I suggest, this task is extremely difficult.},

Journal = {FORUM-A JOURNAL OF APPLIED RESEARCH IN CONTEMPORARY POLITICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Pages = {385-411},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This article examines what scholars know and need to know to assess the
   role and impact of small donors, engaging with participation theory to
   gauge the potential effects of technology and of public financing on the
   economics of mobilizing donors. As a prelude, the article reviews the
   evidence showing that small donors are more representative economically
   than those whose large contributions now dominate political finance.
   Second, it considers and rejects claims that they are more likely to
   polarize politics. Third, it reviews the role of bundling organizations,
   in light of the economics of contemporary communications technology.
   Fourth, it reviews the impact of those forms of public financing that
   are specifically aimed at changing the incentives for candidates to
   reach out to small donors, by way of tax credits and public matching
   funds. Finally, as a speculative conclusion, it raises important
   questions about which current research so far has little to say: whether
   activating small donors stimulates their giving of time as well as money
   and, if so, whether the political skills thus learned have a noticeable
   effect on citizen engagement over the long haul.},

Abstract = {Do controlled comparisons still have a place in comparative politics?
   Long criticized by quantitatively oriented methodologists, this
   canonical approach has increasingly been critiqued by qualitative
   methodologists who recommend greater focus on within-case analysis and
   the confinement of causal explanations to particular cases. Such advice
   accords with a welcome shift from a combative tale of two cultures
   toward mutual respect for research combining qualitative and
   quantitative methods in the simultaneous pursuit of internal and
   external validity. This article argues that controlled comparisons
   remain indispensable amid this multimethod turn, explicating how they
   too can generate both internal and external validity when their
   practitioners (a) craft arguments with general variables or mechanisms,
   (b) seek out representative variation, and (c) select cases that
   maximize control over alternative explanations. When controlled
   comparisons meet these standards, they continue to illuminate the
   world's great convergences and divergences across nation-states in a
   manner that no other methods can surpass.},

Abstract = {This article investigates how Soren Kierkegaard's work developed a key
   subject utilized in international political theory, and ascribed to
   particular international actors (including nation-states) - the Self.
   Kierkegaard's core insights on `dread' and its functions, the need for
   individuals to will a purpose and, finally, the limits of the Self, I
   argue, provide a basis from which we can understand the anxieties - the
   insecurities - that attend to the work of and on a `Self', including
   that (especially that) of political communities. Specifically,
   Kierkegaard's engagements with the real and the ideal Self - the Self as
   it actually is and as it potentially could be - can be utilized to index
   and understand the focus in certain vitalist philosophies with the Self
   of both individuals and political communities. Kierkegaard's insights
   help us understand this foregrounding of the Self, and yet his work also
   helps critically render particular recent manifestations of vitalism,
   found especially in US neoconservatism.},

Abstract = {The rapidly expanding literature on terrorism can be seen to respond to
   the growing incidence of violent political conflict. Most of the
   relevant discussion is conducted within the framework of just war theory
   - a theory in which armed conflicts are considered legitimate only when
   they are explicitly announced and justified; when they take place
   between states and their armies; and when they are strictly exclusive of
   non-combatants. This article argues that framing the discussion in these
   terms is unhelpful: rather than help us to properly consider and
   delegitimize terrorism, it tends to expose the inadequacy of just war
   theory itself under conditions of modern violence. The purpose of this
   article is thus to establish that the framework of just war theory is
   inadequate to the delegitimation of terrorism. The article concludes by
   arguing, on these grounds, for the replacement of the theory of just war
   with a theory of justified political violence.},

Abstract = {All legitimate democratic governments must remain responsive to the
   interests of their citizens. Such responsiveness depends, in turn, on
   the right of free expression, without which citizens cannot make their
   interests and grievances known. When citizens must compete for attention
   and influence with powerful private corporations, however, unregulated
   expression can become a danger to democracy. Drawing ideas from the
   republican tradition of political thought, this essay argues that
   political speech funded by business corporations-not just during
   election campaigns but in all political seasons-threatens the legitimacy
   of American government. The essay advances an egalitarian, democratic
   theory of free expression and uses the theory to clarify the
   relationship between free speech and vibrant democracy. It then defends
   ambitious restrictions on corporate political speech that extend far
   beyond campaign-finance reform.},

Abstract = {Does income inequality increase political backlash against European and
   global integration? This paper reports research suggesting that it can.
   The article analyses party opposition to and support for trade openness,
   European Union integration and general internationalism of political
   party platforms in advanced industrial democracies between 1960 and
   2008. It finds that inequality tends to increase anti-globalization
   positions of parties, net of pro-globalization positions, an effect that
   does not significantly differ across party families or levels of actual
   globalization. This effect, however, does depend on, and is diminished
   by, generous redistributive policies. These findings clarify
   socio-economic conditions underlying the backlash against political and
   economic globalization.},

Abstract = {How are legislative outcomes shaped by multidimensional negotiations?
   Examining the legislative politics of U. S. immigration reforms, I show
   how alternating coalitions in multidimensional negotiations produce
   centrist legislative outcomes. In doing so, this article sheds light on
   a puzzling aspect of immigration policy-namely, the gap that exists
   between public opinion and legislative outcomes. My investigation of
   major immigration bills in 1986, 1996, and 2006 shows that the
   multidimensional nature of immigration debates contributed to the lack
   of dramatic reforms, by allowing legislative minorities to form
   alternating coalitions to block any dramatic changes.},

Abstract = {Economics and elections have been much-studied in the highincome
   democracies of North America and Europe. However, little is known,
   especially comparatively, about economic voting in low-income
   democracies, such as those of Latin America. Here we offer the first
   comparative election study of the economic vote in this region. We apply
   a series of evermore demanding statistical tests to an election survey
   pool of 12 Latin American nations, measured at three time periods (total
   N > 7000). Unambiguously, the finding is of highly significant, even
   strong, sociotropic retrospective economic effects on the incumbent
   vote. In Latin America, as in other democratic nations studied thus far,
   governments are rewarded or punished, according to the economic
   performance they command. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In his recent From Normativity to Responsibility Joseph Raz argues for
   three features of practical reasons: that they are facts; that they are
   facts that can motivate agents qua being reasons; and that they motivate
   agents in virtue of agents' capacity to reflect on them as reasons
   (which he labels `Reason'). The paper identifies a tension between two
   conceptions of normativity that seem to co-exist in Raz's account: on
   the first of them, reasons remain psychologically efficacious albeit too
   subjective; the other, takes reasons to be objective normative facts
   which exist independently of our practical reasoning (or Reason). I
   caution against a conflation between mind-dependence (psychologism) and
   Reasondependence and suggest that practical reasons can remain
   simultaneously objective and motivating if we understand them in a
   Reason-dependent fashion. In the course of the paper a number of related
   questions on the nature of reasons are discussed and clarified.},

Abstract = {After the AKP gained power in 2002, Turkey's newly assertive ``zero
   problems with neighbors{''} foreign policy strategy sparked debate in
   the Arab Middle East. This grand strategy revealed Ankara's ambitions as
   not only a regional player, but also as a democratic ``model{''} for a
   liberal political system able to incorporate a strong Islamic party.
   Arab fascination for Turkey reached its peak between 2009 and 2010 after
   Prime Minister Erdogan's condemnation of Israel's military operation
   Cast Lead in the Gaza Strip. This, along with the Mavi Marmara incident,
   sparked admiration across the Arab world. Over the last few months
   however, Arab fascination has been severely tested and now support for
   the ``Turkish model{''} appears to be waning. This is the result of
   apprehension over Turkey's strategic choices in different areas such as
   the Syrian crisis and the events in Egypt.},

Abstract = {Authoritarian ruling parties are expected to be exceptionally resistant
   to democratization. Yet some of the strongest authoritarian parties in
   the world have not resisted democratization, but have embraced it. This
   is because their raison d'etre is to continue ruling, not necessarily to
   remain authoritarian. Democratization requires that ruling parties hold
   free and fair elections, but not that they lose them. Authoritarian
   ruling parties can thus be incentivized to concede democratization from
   a position of exceptional strength as well as extreme weakness. This
   ``conceding-to-thrive{''} scenario is most likely to unfold when regimes
   (1) possess substantial antecedent political strengths and resource
   advantages, (2) suffer ominous setbacks signaling that they have passed
   their apex of domination, and (3) pursue new legitimation strategies to
   arrest their incipient decline. We illustrate this heretofore neglected
   alternative democratization pathway through a comparative-historical
   analysis of three Asian developmental states where ruling parties have
   democratized from varying positions of considerable strength: Taiwan,
   South Korea, and Indonesia. We then consider the implications of our
   analysis for three ``candidate cases{''} in developmental Asia where
   ruling parties have not yet conceded democratization despite being
   well-positioned to thrive were they to do so: Singapore, Malaysia, and
   the world's most populous dictatorship, China.},

Abstract = {The relationship between the growing social diffusion of the claims
   related to the commons and their legal definition is far from being
   clarified. This essay focuses on this conundrum, which is considered to
   be paradigmatic of that ``refractional{''} relation between the
   multiplicity of social practices and the autonomy of legal concepts.
   After a reading of the still scanty legal literature on the commons,
   this will appear to be pivoting around a dichotomy: the one separating
   function from entitlement. Concepts such as ``Community{''} or the
   ``Common{''} are usually called into question as potential responses to
   this problem. This legal impasse, which seems more a second-best than a
   solution, is also a chance to propose a ``Roman{''} genealogy of the
   commons. Through a close reading of two crucial essays by Yan Thomas on
   the civil institution of the city and on the res religiosae the essay
   will show that procedure, and especially collective legal actions such
   as class actions, might be the actual domain which allows for a stronger
   politics of the commons.},

Abstract = {In this paper, I provided a justification for human right to the
   Internet access by using Beitz's theory of human rights. Contrasting to
   the naturalistic human rights theory that place the normativity of
   rights on a group of basic values that are derived from the universal
   human nature, the practical concept of human rights proposed by Beitz
   grounds the normativity of human rights concept on both the basic
   interests that are supposed to protect and the political role it is
   expected to play in current human right practice. I argued that Beitz's
   conceptualization of human rights is much more inclusive for new
   potential rights, as his human rights theory gives great deal of
   normative weight to the actual human rights practice. Since the current
   human rights practice in political arena strongly suggests the human
   right to the Internet access, I tested the potential human right to the
   Internet access through the criteria composed by Beitz, and argued that
   Beitz's theory could be very supportive for arguing human right to the
   Internet access.},

Abstract = {This study looks into the interplay between governments and
   transnational corporations (TNCs) regarding corporate social
   responsibility (CSR), and it investigates the potentials to link CSR to
   the international development agenda. The analysis focuses on Norwegian
   CSR, that illustrates a rare combination of strong state with
   significant ownership in national companies, a relatively small number
   of TNCs and a strong civil society. The results of the analysis indicate
   that the Norwegian government exercises a strong influence over
   corporate governance. However, despite an apparent alignment between the
   topics proposed by the State's development cooperation agenda and those
   Norwegian companies are expected to report on, the analysis did not find
   proof of a transfer of agendas. Instead, businesses appear to use CSR as
   a communication tool, thus complying with the government's desire to
   project a positive image of Norway internationally. Furthermore, the
   government appears to prioritize commercial goals and profitability.},

Abstract = {Recent research has taken note of the steadfast growth of the Latino
   population in the United States by examining Latino attitudes toward
   those commonly identified as nonimmigrants, Whites and Blacks. Extant
   literature on Latino racial attitudes explores the determinants of
   Latinos' perceptions of commonality with Whites and Blacks, yet it has
   greatly overlooked the impact that skin tone, a key differentiating
   factor of Latinos, has in explaining these attitudes. Using the 2006
   Latino National Survey, we develop models that examine the extent that
   skin tone explains Latinos' commonality with Whites and Blacks. We find
   that self-reported skin tone considerably explains Latinos' attitudes
   toward Whites and Blacks with light-skinned Latinos sensing greater
   commonality with Whites and less commonality with Blacks than
   dark-skinned Latinos. We also find that skin tone moderates the
   relationship between linked fate with Latinos and closeness with Whites
   and the relationship between social contact and closeness with Blacks
   and Whites.},

Volume = {52},

Abstract = {Interest groups differ in the strategies they use to influence public
   policy. Some mainly try to gain access (i.e., have direct contact with
   decision makers), whereas others tend to `go public' by launching
   campaigns that aim to mobilise the broader public. In this article it is
   argued that group type - namely the distinction between business
   associations, professional associations and citizen groups - is a major
   determinant of the choice of strategy. The effect of group type,
   however, is conditional on the group's endowment with material resources
   and the issue context: the differences across group types are largest
   for resource-rich associations and associations active in distributive
   policy fields. Original data from surveys of national associations in
   five European countries (Austria, Germany, Ireland, Latvia and Spain)
   enable the assessment of this argument. The theoretical expectations are
   supported, with the results having relevance for the normative
   evaluation of political systems and the positive study of interest group
   influence.},

Abstract = {Political parties are not static organizations; they continually adapt
   to changes to the political, electoral, and legal environments. In this
   paper we argue that so-called 527 committees are another form of party
   adaptation. We investigate questions about their role in elections,
   using a dataset consisting of the personnel backgrounds of the largest
   527s in the 2004 and 2006 election cycles. We examine the staffing of
   these groups and their ties to the formal party structures. We find that
   527 organizations with stronger personnel links to formal party
   organizations have more connections to other 527s. The results suggest
   that 527s are not independent actors disrupting the party system, but
   rather well-placed participants in the party networks that helped
   parties adapt to a changing electoral context.},

Abstract = {The article aims to analyze the interconnections between war and natural
   determinism in the political philosophy of Immanuel Kant. First, the
   antagonistic unsocial sociability is presented as a preamble to the
   natural state of war; both conditions (war and unsocial sociability)
   emerge and are nurtured by an omniscient Nature that seems to determine
   the entire course of history. Given this situation, it is necessary to
   reconcile the undeniable primacy of reason and human freedom with
   natural determinism, to finally affirm that the ideals found, when
   articulated with the phenomenon of war, lead to the same end: the
   construction and consolidation of the progress of human culture. The
   hermeneuticdocumentary method is used. Conclusions are that it is
   necessary to rescue the rational ideal of Kantian peace to address our
   contemporary dystopias.},

Volume = {8},

Abstract = {The article seeks to evaluate the role of the Brazilian states' debt in
   the decentralization policy of that country, having as reference the
   1988 Constitution and the democratization. Then, decentralization is
   identified from the political as well as economic point of view given
   the fact that the aforementioned process in the analyzed case presents
   problems in both dimensions with an important and complex relation
   between them within the framework of the democratic transition.
   Nevertheless, in the Brazilian decentralization dynamics, debt was a
   central aspect to explain the way in which the decentralization policy
   runs in a country with formally autonomous regional governments, but,
   conditioned in practice through the use of economic resources among
   government levels as coactive instrument to reverse the power loss of
   the central authorities. Also, the article tries to address recent
   tendencies of Brazilian federalism, such as the growing municipalization
   and the consequences of the Fiscal Responsibility Law, determining
   possible consequences of the patterns now observed.},

Abstract = {From Arendt's own considerations, this article seeks an approach to the
   theory of a thinker such as Niccolo Machiavelli, whose relevance is
   unquestionable, but for Arendt's thinking constitutes a fundamental
   theoretic. Arendt proposes many questions concerning various issues
   around Machiavelli, and that is what we intend to show. Among them we
   find the concept of revolution advocated by Machiavelli which Arendt
   criticized; the indifference of is Machiavelli regarding moral
   judgments, freedom from prejudice, and the Florentine philosopher is
   instrumental advocacy for the construction of the republic.},

Abstract = {Drawing on the original data collected during a period of university
   student protest in Greece, we explore whether the expected gains from
   the act of protesting itself influence an individual's decision to
   participate in collective action. More particularly, we investigate the
   extent to which the process incentives qualify the weight individuals
   attach to the primary elements of the original cost-benefit equation of
   rational choice theory as well as other considerations in their
   decision-making process. Our findings point out that the magnitude of
   the effect of the process incentives is very strong and its inclusion in
   a rational choice model improves our understanding of students'
   participation in protest activities. Turning to indirect effects, we
   show that process incentives behave as a first stage precondition for
   the students' decision to participate in collective action. In the
   absence of perceived benefits associated with the process of protesting,
   the importance of attaining the public good becomes much less important
   in their decision-making process.},

Abstract = {We study the extent of political homophilythe tendency to form
   connections with others who are politically similarin local governments'
   decisions to participate in an important form of intergovernmental
   collaboration: regional planning networks. Using data from a recent
   survey of California planners and government officials, we develop and
   test hypotheses about the factors that lead local governments to
   collaborate within regional planning networks. We find that local
   governments whose constituents are similar politically, in terms of
   partisanship and voting behavior, are more likely to collaborate with
   one another in regional planning efforts than those whose constituents
   are politically diverse. We conclude that political homophily reduces
   the transaction costs associated with institutional collective action,
   even in settings where we expect political considerations to be minimal.},

Abstract = {During the international financial and economic crisis of 2008-2010 all
   OECD member states were facing similar albeit varying challenges.
   However, their reactions to the crisis greatly differed. While many
   states passed extensive economic stimulus packages, others solely relied
   on a restrictive fiscal policy even in times of economic crisis. The
   composition of the fiscal packages also greatly varied. While some
   states increased public expenditure and expanded state investments,
   others enacted considerable tax reductions, thus focusing on an economic
   stimulus by forgoing public revenue.
   This paper aims to identify the main political determinants of the
   different fiscal policy reactions of the OECD member states to the
   economic crisis. The centerpiece of the comparative analysis consists of
   political economic determinants of the size and composition of the
   fiscal packages. A fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis serves to
   identify the driving forces behind the fiscal policy reactions to the
   crisis. The conditions are derived from partisan political theory and
   the ``Varieties of Capitalism{''} approach while other factors are
   controlled for.},

Abstract = {The German Stability Culture is frequently pointed to in the literature
   as the source of the country's low inflation policies and, at the
   European Union level, the design of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).
   In Germany, the term was regularly wielded by central bankers and
   Christian Democrat (CDU-CSU) politicians to legitimise the move to EMU
   in the face of a large majority of public opinion opposed - and
   subsequent EU-level policy developments - particularly in the context of
   the eurozone debt crisis that erupted in 2009. An ordered probit
   analysis is used to demonstrate the depth of the German Stability
   Culture, showing support for low inflation cuts across all party and
   ideological lines. Despite this ubiquity, the term has been wielded with
   regularity only by the centre-right Christian Democrats and is strongly
   associated with this party. A strategic constructivist analysis is
   employed to explain this uneven but persistent usage in German domestic
   politics.},

Abstract = {The 2012 elections in Japan, Taiwan and South Korea exhibit both
   long-term trends and short-term variations in each country's political
   landscape. All three societies are moving towards two-party competition
   lately, thanks mostly to the mixed-member majoritarian system adopted
   for legislative elections, despite the social cleavages that provide, to
   varying degrees, niches for small parties. The cleavage structure
   coupled with the electoral system largely explains the changing
   political landscape in these societies.},

Abstract = {The lamentable collapse of ``socialist{''} countries at the end of a
   history tainted by crimes and mass repressive practices seemed to have
   definitively condemned the communist view. But, with the deep crisis of
   global capitalism, the idea of communism arouses some new interest among
   philosophers. Their prospects are diverse, this paper intends to discern
   the main lines of the debate by taking into consideration the works of
   some of these authors (Badiou, Balibar, Tosel, Zizek...).},

Abstract = {Defenders of the Electoral College frequently assert that victory in the
   Electoral College requires a winning candidate to ``produce a coalition
   of states with wide and diverse interests{''} thereby producing ``a
   broadly based electoral victory.{''} These defenders never stop to
   consider the fact that in a close election the difference between the
   winning and losing coalition of states may depend on highly contingent
   factors. In a 2003 article in this journal Neubauer and Zeitlin
   demonstrated that George W. Bush's Electoral College victory in 2000
   depended on the size of the House of Representatives. In this article I
   demonstrate that the outcome of the 2012 election could have depended on
   the 2012 Electoral College being based on the newly apportioned incoming
   House rather than the previously apportioned outgoing House. This is a
   statutory specification rather than a constitutional requirement. It
   could be changed by simple legislation. We have Elbridge Gerry's
   suspicions to thank for this statutory contingency!},

Abstract = {The role of social structure as a determinant of electoral behaviour has
   been debated across Western countries, with one side in the debate
   arguing that the rise of the electoral conflict between
   authoritarian-libertarian values reflects the diminishing importance of
   socio-structural factors. In contrast, this article shows, using a
   unique representative sample from Denmark, how this conflict has its
   roots in an opposition between high- and low-education groups that
   divide over authoritarian-libertarian values, have developed
   education-based identities and group consciousness, and are influenced
   by these factors to vote for parties, each mobilizing their side in the
   conflict - that is, that the authoritarian-libertarian conflict is based
   on an education cleavage. Documenting for the first time the influence
   of education-based identity and group consciousness on voting, these
   findings demonstrate that socio-structural factors - partly through the
   voters' social identities and consciousness - continue to play an
   important role for electoral behaviour in Western countries. Likewise,
   the findings suggest that the conflict over authoritarian-libertarian
   values will have lasting importance for politics in these countries. The
   logical next step, therefore, will be to extend the analyses to the
   comparative level.},

Abstract = {The general objective of this research is to determine the relationship
   between national legal reserve in a broad sense and national legal
   reserve in a strict sense in Venezuela's 1999 Constitution of the
   Bolivarian Republic. This objective is approached according to a
   documentary research strategy based on the analytic method. Sources for
   data collection include constitutional, legal, doctrinal and
   jurisprudential areas. The national legal reserve includes specific
   national matters that, based on constitutional provisions or
   immobilization of the legal rank, need to be regulated exclusively by
   formal law or decree with force of law as such, excluding executive
   regulation. The national legal reserve is classified as national legal
   reserve in a broad sense and national legal reserve in a strict sense.
   The first is regulated by formal law dictated by the National Assembly
   and decree with force of law as such, dictated by the President in a
   Council of Ministers. The second is regulated exclusively by formal law
   dictated by the National Assembly. Both are complemented by executive
   regulation dictated by the President in a Council of Ministers. This
   guarantees the validity of constitutional principles.},

Abstract = {In the aftermath of the devastating terrorist attacks in the USA and
   Europe, most notably the 9/11 attacks on New York, there has been
   renewed interest in the role of cultural diplomacy in international
   relations as a strategic platform for engaging with other nations and
   for wielding ``soft power{''} on the international stage. Central to
   this renewed interest on cultural diplomacy is that culture can provide
   a critical platform for contact and negotiations when political
   relations are in jeopardy or for recalibrating relationships with
   emerging powers. This study provides an analysis of cross-cultural
   museum exchanges as an instrument of ``soft power{''} and cultural
   diplomacy by considering Singapore's motives and outcomes of engaging in
   the Singapore-France cultural collaboration. The study demonstrates that
   while cross-cultural museum exchanges can serve as symbolic gestures of
   political goodwill, their effectiveness in shaping the preferences of
   other nations through exerting ``soft power{''} on the international
   stage is limited. These exchanges are often apolitical in their
   initiation because museums seldom take their nations' political goals
   into consideration in selecting their prospective partners and the
   subject of collaboration. While cross-cultural museum exchanges are
   apolitical in their initiation, their consequences are nonetheless
   political due to inherent unequal power relations between the
   collaborating parties.},

Abstract = {The construction of the ``other{''}, be it an ethnic, cultural,
   religious or symbolic otherness, is a salient issue for the promotion of
   positive social harmony. This investigation sets out to examine the
   construction of otherness on a national level - within Spain -
   addressing the representation of female immigrants in the Spanish press.
   Within the field of Peace Research, it highlights the way in which the
   media (specifically the press, the focus of this investigation)
   constructs an image of female immigrants based on an otherness which is
   created principally by the interaction of factors of ethnicity and
   gender. It aims to make a contribution to existing research on the theme
   and contribute with up-to-date information. The principal challenges are
   to carry out an analysis based on gender and intercultural perspectives
   and to contribute to a re-conceptualisation and re-reading of the
   representations of female immigrants in Spanish society. The
   investigation aims to contribute to the efforts to transform negative
   stereotypes - in other words ``deconstruct otherness{''} - and make
   visible that which remains excluded from media representations.},

Abstract = {The consequences of ethnic diversity in Africa have been widely noted.
   However, the sources of this diversity remain unexplained, which is
   surprising in light of Africa's high level of ethnic diversity as well
   as its large internal variation. Here I show that ethnic diversity in
   Africa is a result of its tropical location, the pre-colonial slave
   trade, the colonial creation of large states, and low levels of
   urbanization, and that my results are robust to various controls. I also
   show that controlling for the slave trade eliminates the statistical
   significance of an Africa dummy variable in regressions using data on
   global ethnic diversity.},

Abstract = {The failure of the war on drugs requires not only an evaluation of
   previous approaches to the topic, but also a rethinking of drug war
   policies from a rational and deliberative democratic perspective
   allowing for debates that overcome the social representations that have
   been built up around illegal substances. This work reviews the
   international policies regarding drugs and their effects in Ecuador, and
   it ends with propositions that prioritize adequate information access
   and the possibility of organizing civil society through communicative
   action. The argument here is that communicative action remains the only
   way a democratic debate could possibly be generated, demystifying a
   taboo topic based largely in pseudo science and politicized discourse,
   and developing new approaches that break with myths and come
   face-to-face with the drug issue in all its diverse subjective
   applications.},

Abstract = {Recent work on the constitutional signing statement suggests such tools
   can be designed to defend constitutional and institutional powers or
   help presidents shape policy. Much less is known about rhetorical
   signing statements and their significance for presidential power. Our
   analysis from 1981-2008 demonstrates that rhetorical signing statements
   are calculated messages that vary in purpose from heaping praise on
   Congress to credit claiming and building political capital. The findings
   highlight the role of political conditions like divided government and
   presidential approval levels as well as salience of legislative
   opportunities in explaining the type of rhetorical message aimed at
   Congress.},

Abstract = {Since 1949, the CDU/CSU has been the dominant party grouping in the
   German party system yet has rarely occupied the political centre ground,
   as represented by the so-called median legislator within the Bundestag.
   This article seeks to explain the paradox of how a right of centre party
   faction came to dominate what has historically been seen as a consensual
   and centrist party system by drawing upon the conceptual tools of (1)
   formal coalition theory and (2) the notions of path-dependence, rules,
   norms, beliefs and standard operating procedures. The article argues
   there is little reason to believe that the pattern of dominance
   established over the last six decades is in any immediate danger.},

Abstract = {Using a small pilot qualitative study conducted in the North of England
   prior to the 2010 general election, we seek to understand why our
   respondents might feel actively disengaged from mainstream politics. It
   is argued that one major reason is because politicians are seen as
   lacking understanding of the local contexts in which these low-wage
   workers live. The gulf between represented and representative is widened
   if politicians fail to communicate in a down to earth' way. This
   indicates that social inequality between represented and representative
   is a factor in disengagement, but that such disengagement is not the
   result of apathy on the part of citizens. Further research is required,
   but our study suggests that if politicians fail to recognise their
   privilege and politics fails to address economic disadvantage across
   ethnic groups then disengagement from mainstream politics is likely to
   worsen.},

Abstract = {The article approaches the current economic crisis from an historical
   perspective, analyzing the building of the monetary integration and the
   common currency. The process is explained through pointing out its
   effects on the European integration and outlining the positive and
   negative consequences of the introduction of a common currency in the
   European Union. The investigation continues with a general outlook of
   the current situation of the countries which were more affected by the
   current crisis-Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, Italy and Cyprus. What
   all these countries have in common is the necessity of extra funding in
   a context of austerity, plus some national particularities. The author
   proposes an expansion in the public spending as the only reliable way to
   stimulate European economies in the crisis. As the introduction of the
   euro meant the end of the monetary independence for the Member States,
   an innovative solution is proposed-the creation of an Economic
   Government in the union in order to transfer funds from wealthier states
   to the countries in trouble. It is presented as a necessity for the
   states in crisis, a necessity for the wealthier states, and a must for
   the European Union.},

Abstract = {As American business looks toward the future and its role in the
   policy-making process, it must consider how it is going to be affected
   by this country's ongoing demographic changes. As was the case in the
   2012 elections, the changing face of American politics has the potential
   to produce a dramatic impact on the nature of business-government
   relations. This essay examines the future of business advocacy in the
   context of America's emerging demographics in three areas. First,
   although Republicans have long claimed to be ``the party of
   business,{''} the turn to the right by the GOP has created significant
   difficulties for business lobbies. Second, since the political profile
   of business can be influenced by the ways in which they define corporate
   social responsibility, analysis turns to the pressures business faces
   from both their own employees and outside groups to embrace particular
   values or causes. Finally, the essay addresses business leadership. If
   business leaders looked like America, would it make any difference in
   terms of business advocacy?},

Abstract = {The economics and elections connection has been heavily investigated,
   although mostly through single-country studies. The first comparative,
   survey-based research on economic voting, by Lewis-Beck, found serious
   effects. Subsequently, other comparative scholars have explored this
   terrain. The most recent, and most ambitious, examinations are by Duch
   and Stevenson and by van der Brug et al. These impressive efforts arrive
   at opposing conclusions about the importance of economic voting. We
   carry out another major examination, with an eye to reconciling these
   differences. A carefully specified model of vote choice is estimated on
   a balanced survey pool (N > 40,000) from 10 Western European nations.
   Special pains are taken with issues of economic measurement, estimation,
   and endogeneity. The finding is that economic perceptions are formed
   from economic reality, and importantly influence vote choice. Besides
   enhancing our understanding of comparative political behavior, the
   strong result speaks to the functioning of government accountability in
   advanced democracies.},

Abstract = {How do modern individuals form a sense of the vast societies in which
   they live? Social cognition has evolved to make sense of small, intimate
   social groups, but in complex mass societies, comparable vivid social
   cues are scarcer. Extant research on political attitudes and behavior
   has emphasized media and interpersonal networks as key sources of cues.
   Extending a classical argument, we provide evidence for the importance
   of an alternative and internal source: imagination. With a focus on
   social welfare, we collected survey data from two very different
   democracies, the United States and Denmark, and conducted several
   studies using explicit, implicit, and behavioral measures. By analyzing
   the effects of individual differences in imagination, we demonstrate
   that political cognition relies on vivid, mental simulations that engage
   evolved social and emotional decision-making mechanisms. It is in the
   mind's eye that vividness and engagement are added to people's sense of
   mass politics.},

Abstract = {This article addresses the ontological presuppositions of the discourse
   on world politics in political and international relations theory. We
   argue that the ambivalent status of world politics is due to the
   understanding of its central concept, that is, the world, in terms of
   totality or `the whole'. Drawing on Alain Badiou's set-theoretical
   ontology, this article demonstrates that such a concept is logically
   inconsistent, which leads the discourse on world politics to a perpetual
   oscillation between the presupposition of a universal totality and the
   unmasking of its impossibility. We then proceed to the particularistic
   concept of the world as a limited totality with no pretense to
   universality, as developed in Heidegger's phenomenological ontology and
   Badiou's objective phenomenology. Although this approach affirming the
   existence of the infinity of infinite worlds appears of little use to
   the universalist problematic of world politics, it provides us with a
   pathway to the third concept of the world as the void, in which a
   plurality of positive worlds coexist and which is their ontological
   condition of possibility. We argue that only this concept of the world
   enables a logically consistent notion of universality as non-totalizable
   and immediate. The final section addresses the implications of this
   concept for rethinking world politics as a practice of transformation of
   particular worlds in accordance with the universal principles derived
   from the disclosure of the world as void. Contemporary Political Theory

Abstract = {While members of the European Parliament are elected in national
   constituencies, their votes are determined by the aggregation of MEPs in
   multinational party groups. The uncoordinated aggregation of national
   party programmes in multinational EP party groups challenges theories of
   representation based on national parties and parliaments. This article
   provides a theoretical means of understanding representation by linking
   the aggregation of dozens of national party programmes in different EP
   party groups to the aggregation of groups to produce the parliamentary
   majority needed to enact policies. Drawing on an original data source of
   national party programmes, the EU Profiler, the article shows that the
   EP majorities created by aggregating MEP votes in party groups are best
   explained by cartel theories. These give priority to strengthening the
   EP's collective capacity to enact policies rather than voting in accord
   with the programmes they were nationally elected to represent.},

Abstract = {This study explores how candidates running for the European Parliament
   (EP) in 2009 used micro-blogging and online social networks - in this
   case Twitter (www.twitter.com) in the early stage of its adoption - to
   communicate and connect with citizens. Micro-blogging in general, and
   Twitter in particular, is one of the new and popular Web 2.0
   applications, yet there has been little research focusing on the use of
   Twitter by politicians. After reviewing different types of campaigning
   strategies and introducing a new and distinct strategy, this descriptive
   and exploratory study focuses on political candidates' use of
   micro-blogging and online social networking (i.e. Twitter) from a
   longitudinal, social network, and ideological perspective. The results
   clearly show that most candidates in 2009 still used Twitter
   reluctantly. Those who used Twitter did so predominantly for electoral
   campaigning and only sparingly for continuous campaigning. Candidates
   from progressive parties are the most active users of Twitter as a
   campaigning tool, whereas conservatives are virtually absent online.
   Although candidates' first degree networks are still relatively small
   and unconnected, their second degree networks are quite extensive.
   Candidates from parties in opposition have more extensive first degree
   networks than those from ruling parties. Candidates from fringe parties
   show small online networks.},

Abstract = {Underlying Giorgio Agamben's and Alain Badiou's disagreement over the
   apostle Paul we find common cause: following Paul's deactivation of law,
   both Agamben and Badiou see the fixed identities necessary to the
   naturalised nomos of State politics as transfigured by a politics of
   grace. This transfiguration is differently rendered as either the
   emergence of a universal subject (Badiou) or the opening up of existing
   subjectivities (Agamben), but both the messianic vocation in Agamben and
   the universal subject in Badiou allow subjective possibility to that
   which is not in the present objectified order. Developing this theme of
   a basic emancipatory affinity, two moments of the political which exist
   in a difficult but necessary tension are identified: revolution and
   dissent. While revolution signals subjective possibility itself by
   determining that the truth of the event is for all, dissidence keeps
   that possibility alive by pointing to the human subject's fundamental
   indeterminacy.},

Abstract = {Religion can be a source of undemocratic attitudes but also a
   contributor to democratic norms. This article argues that different
   dimensions of religiosity generate contrasting effects on democratic
   attitudes through different mechanisms. The private aspect of religious
   belief is associated with traditional and survival values, which in turn
   decrease both overt and intrinsic support for democracy. The communal
   aspect of religious social behaviour increases political interest and
   trust in institutions, which in turn typically lead to more support for
   democracy. Results from multilevel path analyses using data from
   fifty-four countries from Waves 4 and 5 of the World Values Survey
   suggest there is some regularity in mechanisms responsible for the
   effect of religiosity on democratic support that extend beyond religious
   denomination.},

Abstract = {This article addresses the democratically fundamental question of the
   inclusiveness of electorates and of its impact on citizens
   representation. While the literature has focussed on the congruence
   between voters and representatives, it has neglected congruence issues
   between citizens and representatives. The article investigates
   comparatively this source of newly disenfranchised citizens in a
   globalised society with increasing mobility. On the one hand, electoral
   laws vary in their inclusion or exclusion of emigrants and in the right
   to vote to non-national residents (immigrants). On the other hand,
   naturalisation laws vary in the maintenance of nationality for nationals
   abroad (emigrants) and in their inclusion of non-national residents. We
   illustrate levels of discrepancy between electorate and citizenship in
   22 OECD countries qualitatively, by presenting differences of electoral
   and nationality laws, and quantitatively, by comparing the size of
   citizenship with that of the electorate, and the national and resident
   populations. We show that shifts between political and national
   communities are primarily due to naturalisation laws and that electoral
   laws have so far been unable to correct for the discrepancy.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the issue salience of social welfare for disabled
   people in electoral politics with reference to party manifestos in
   Westminster and regional elections in the UK. Innovative aspects include
   mixed methods analysis of multi-tier elections on a cross-cutting issue.
   The findings reveal an initial post-war clinical-medical approach to
   welfare and the subsequent emergence of a policy discourse of rights,
   legal protection and equality as part of growing electoral competition
   over policy aimed at disabled people. It is argued that the formative
   role played by party manifestos needs to be incorporated into
   contemporary study of the politics of disability.},

Abstract = {The rise of the Republican Right in the 1960s reshaped not only the
   politics of the Republican Party, but ultimately that of the country as
   well. What had started as an improbable movement to draft Goldwater for
   president in 1964 emerged, amid the political and social turmoil of the
   decade, as the dominant force within the Republican Party. But what has
   not received as much attention is the significant role that the national
   Republican Party leadership and the emphasis it placed on party renewal,
   rather than reform, played in the Right's rapid post-Goldwater ascent.
   This article examines how the process of party renewal, specifically the
   emergence of a national ``service party{''} structure, helped not only
   to unify the GOP after the 1964 Goldwater loss, but also led to the
   development of a more conservative Republican Party during the second
   half of the 1960s.},

Abstract = {This article combines theory and narrative to shed new light on the
   politics surrounding the making of central bank independence in
   contemporary Britain. Its central argument is that Gordon Brown's
   rewriting of the British monetary constitution in May 1997 constituted
   political manipulation in a Rikerian sense. The government removed a
   contentious issue from party politics in order to signal competence and
   enforce internal discipline. Building on Elster's constraint theory, the
   paper argues that Brown adopted a pre-commitment strategy aimed at
   binding others. The heresthetic move had dual consequences, both
   constraining and enabling. The institutionalization of discipline
   enabled New Labour to achieve economic and political goals. By
   revisiting the political rationality of precommitment, this article
   questions the dominant credibility story underlying the choice of
   economic institutions.},

Abstract = {This article presents an original extensive data set on the results of
   the 2012 French legislative elections and explores different ways of
   aggregating electoral outcomes. Building on the official results
   centralized by the Ministry of the Interior, this data set is a unique
   effort to allocate reliable candidate labels that account for both the
   extreme plurality of the French political landscape and the main
   alliances between parties. The presentation of the database is
   accompanied by a description of the main features of the 2012 French
   legislative elections, including an unprecedented discussion of the
   differences in patterns of party competition between metropolitan and
   overseas France due to territorial divisions.},

Abstract = {With no less than half a billion people in the world without electricity
   supply, and electricity being the back bone for technological
   development, it makes sense that electricity is the center of
   discussion. While innovation and technology have radically transformed
   other industrial sectors, the electric system, has continued to operate
   the same way for decades. The real challenge today is not to meet the
   minimum functionality but to be prepared for future demands. These
   demands make it necessary for the transformation from regular grid to a
   Smart Grid. In this paper: the Smart Grid was evaluated for its impacts
   on the environment, industry, and the global population. Additionally;
   the role of ICTs in solving the hurdles of Smart Grid has been examined.},

Journal = {IZQUIERDAS},

Pages = {125-140},

Abstract = {The present research pretends to discuss about the way violence and
   armed fight as a constitutive part of political identity instituted by
   the MIR's activist, being a fundamental part from the ``ethos
   mirista{''}, with different shades in different historical moments since
   their organization. In this sense, the temporal frame established for
   this research, involved us in two important knots ``erageneration{''}
   which mark significantly the conformation of political identity on
   activists and where the character of violence acquires different shades,
   encouraging, each one of them to the conformation of a whole political
   unity, establishing an interesting dialogue inter-generational, instead
   of breaks and ruptures, relationship and continuity.},

Abstract = {This article examines the determinants of the positioning of parties on
   the question of territorial reform in Belgium. It argues that one cannot
   explain the high salience assigned to the issue of decentralisation
   among political parties by looking only at voter demands. Instead, it is
   the dynamics of party competition that has encouraged parties to adopt
   an electoral and territorial logic of action. The article shows that the
   main driver of territorial reform in Belgium has been the continuous
   relevance of regionalist parties in the Flemish party system, which have
   compelled mainstream parties to accommodate their demands for
   territorial autonomy, and, more recently, independence. Regionalist
   parties have capitalised on a strong sense of Flemish national identity,
   itself shaped by long-run structural factors. The article also shows
   that the adoption of an electoral and territorial logic has been
   strengthened by the split of the Belgian party system and the
   reinforcement of social cleavages, and, more recently, by the increasing
   competitiveness of elections and the opening up of party competition at
   multiple levels.},

Abstract = {QCA's ability of addressing complex theoretical expectations and taking
   account of configurational relationships is rarely fully exploited.
   Assessing comparative welfare-state research, which has employed QCA, we
   find that only about half of the studies reviewed have expressed complex
   theoretical propositions in set-theoretical terms, revisited cases
   subsequent to the formal analysis, or subjected findings to robustness
   checks. We discuss the relevance of each of these three aspects and
   argue that carefully considering these will improve the quality of QCA
   applications.},

Abstract = {This article discusses the issue of what kind of a region Vestnorden is.
   The need for such a discussion arises from the challenges posed by
   globalisation for the idea and construction of the West Nordic space,
   and the need to observe how this regional unit counters these processes.
   The article is based on an analytical framework which presupposes that a
   functional region has to consist of four elements. First, whether the
   space has its own institutions for decision making; second, how far
   there is economic complementarities among the involved nations and
   territories; third, to what degree they have common economic interests;
   and finally, to what extent social, cultural and historical ties exist
   between the territories involved. The article argues that there is an
   urgent need to discuss and reorient the institutional functionality of
   Vestnorden as a regional unit.},

Abstract = {Although both France and the United States take pride in the secularism
   of their legal systems and claim historical primacy when it comes to
   establishing a human rights regime based on secular laws, their
   constitutional separation of Church and State was achieved through very
   different historical circumstances. By comparing the French and US
   approaches to republicanism and secularism, this article argues that
   French history is a prime example of the controlling tendency of
   European nation-states over religion-and that this is precisely what
   distinguishes it from the United States. The contribution also shows
   that the connection between laicite and France's imperialism was
   intimate, and that this represents a second crucial difference between
   the French and the American conceptions of secularism.},

Abstract = {Acommon view of Abraham Lincoln is that he was a pragmatic compromiser.
   While not exactly false, this view is only half true. Through a close
   reading of Lincoln's most important prewar statements on slavery and
   race and the problem of public opinion, this study makes the claim that
   he was, rather than a pragmatist, actually a prudent statesman. Less
   radical than the most radical of abolitionists, Lincoln was nevertheless
   not a conservative. Nor was he a populist in the Jacksonian tradition.
   As concerned with shaping public opinion as following it, Lincoln was a
   speaker of truth as well as a man of prudence, and he possessed
   qualities of a good politician that are compatible with being a good man
   only under the rule of the most rigid conscience.},

Abstract = {Different perspectives on the role of organized interests in democratic
   politics imply different temporal sequences in the relationship between
   legislative activity and the influence activities of organized
   interests. Unfortunately, lack of data has greatly limited any kind of
   detailed examination of this temporal relationship. We address this
   problem by taking advantage of the chronologically very precise data on
   lobbying activity provided by the door pass system of the European
   Parliament and data on EU legislative activity collected from EURLEX.
   After reviewing the several different theoretical perspectives on the
   timing of lobbying and legislative activity, we present a time series
   analysis of the co-evolution of legislative output and interest groups
   for the period 2005-2011. Our findings show that, contrary to what
   pluralist and neo-corporatist theories propose, interest groups neither
   lead nor lag bursts in legislative activity in the European Union.},

Abstract = {Libertarians often rely on arguments that subordinate the principle of
   liberty to the value of its economic consequences. This invites the
   question of what a pure libertarian theory of justice-one that takes
   liberty as its overriding concern-would look like. Grotius's political
   theory provides a template for such a libertarianism, but it also
   entails uncomfortable commitments that can be avoided only by
   compromising the principle of liberty. According to Grotius, each person
   should be free to decide how to act as long as her actions do not
   violate the equal liberty of others. According to this principle,
   however, people are free to enter any contract and alienate any rights,
   permitting even contracts of slavery or the alienation of rights of
   bodily integrity. Libertarians can escape this commitment to absolute
   freedom of contract only by adopting ad-hoc amendments to the principle
   of liberty.},

Volume = {17},
Number = {1},

Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Post-national' scholars have taken the extension of social rights to
   migrants that are normally accorded to citizens as evidence of the
   growing importance of norms of universal personhood' and the declining
   importance of the nation-state. However, the distinct approach taken by
   the state toward another understudied category of non-citizen stateless
   people complicates these theories by demonstrating that the state makes
   decisions about groups on different bases than theory would suggest.
   These findings suggest the need to pay more attention to how the state
   treats other categories of semi-citizens'. This article examines the
   differential effects of universal healthcare reforms in Thailand on
   citizens, migrants, and stateless people and explores their
   ramifications on theories of citizenship and social rights. While the
   state has expanded its healthcare obligations toward people living
   within its borders, it has taken a variegated approach toward different
   groups. Citizens have been extended differentiated but unambiguous
   rights'. Migrants have been granted conditional rights' to healthcare
   coverage, dependent on their status as registered workers who pay
   mandatory contributions. Large numbers of stateless people, however, saw
   their right to state welfare programs disenfranchised following passage
   of the new universal healthcare law before later being granted
   contingent rights' through a new program.},

Abstract = {This article explores the relationship between economic development
   strategies and conflict outcomes in Africa, using a comparison of Cote
   d'Ivoire and Ghana. Findings suggest that development strategies that
   create contestation for resources along identity group lines, absent
   provisions for co-opting disenfranchised groups, increase the likelihood
   of communal violence, whereas development plans that transcend
   ascriptive social identities bear the greatest chance of generating
   long-term peace, irrespective of their short-term economic success. The
   author complements the comparative case study with evidence of intracase
   variation in Ghana and with original micro-level data collected in 2009.},

Abstract = {A satisfactory model of decision-making in an epistemic democracy must
   respect democratic values, while advancing citizens' interests, by
   taking account of relevant knowledge about the world. Analysis of
   passages in Aristotle and legislative process in classical Athens points
   to a ``middle way{''} between independent-guess aggregation and
   deliberation: an epistemic approach to decision-making that offers a
   satisfactory model of collective judgment that is both time-sensitive
   and capable of setting agendas endogenously. By aggregating expertise
   across multiple domains, Relevant Expertise Aggregation (REA) enables a
   body of minimally competent voters to make superior choices among
   multiple options, on matters of common interest. REA differs from a
   standard Condorcet jury in combining deliberation with voting based on
   judgments about the reputations and arguments of domain-experts.},

Abstract = {Representing democracy and the development of the political persona in
   the XIXth century Romanian political discourse means, first of all, to
   focus the analysis on the implications the concept of democracy could
   provide. In the first half of the XIXth century, the concept of Romanian
   democracy and its place within political discourse are conditioned by
   philosophical and historiographical discontinuities between the periods,
   the intellectual sources, as well as the political and institutional
   framework of that time. Within that context, democracy should be
   regarded as a fundamental concept to political and institutional
   development in the beginning of the XIXth century. The present article
   goes on this path, analysing some examples of political discourse during
   the period of establishment of the fundamental democratic institutions
   in the Romanian modernity.},

Abstract = {Leonardo R. Arriola, Protesting and Policing in a Multiethnic
   Authoritarian State: Evidence from Ethiopia The antigovernment protests
   that erupted in one ethnic region of Ethiopia can be attributed to the
   group's historical grievances or to its access to mobilizing resources.
   However, conventional explanations are insufficient in accounting for
   protest patterns in terms of their geographic distribution or varying
   levels of violence. The likelihood of protest onset was inversely
   related to local heterogeneity, intraethnic as well as interethnic.
   Protest violence spiraled through the interaction between ethnic
   homogeneity and the government's policing strategy. Woundings were less
   likely to occur in localities where protesters were repressed by police
   forces staffed by their own co-ethnics.},

Abstract = {Within the context of the ongoing scholarly debate on post-accession
   compliance in the Central and Eastern European new member states, this
   paper examines the implementation of EU environmental policy in the
   Czech Republic since 2004, focusing on the transposition and application
   of six EU directives. It argues that, while the Czech Republic has had
   some difficulty complying with EU environmental law since becoming a
   member state, overall its performance in this area does not conform to
   pessimistic scenarios, but instead presents a more complex and
   differentiated picture. It also discusses the main factors inhibiting
   and supporting the implementation of EU environmental policy in the
   Czech Republic, showing that these tend to vary according to the
   specific issue or directive concerned.},

Abstract = {Political Science research methods courses face two problems. First is
   what to cover, as there are too many techniques to explore in any one
   course. Second is dealing with student anxiety around quantitative
   material. We explore a novel way to approach these issues. Our students
   began by writing a qualitative paper. They followed with a term paper,
   on the same topic, that incorporated material learned in the qualitative
   paper with quantitative data analysis. This helps students appreciate
   how different methods complement one another. By starting with more
   familiar qualitative techniques, then moving to the quantitative, and by
   writing the paper in stages, we help alleviate student anxiety. Students
   start within their comfort zone, then move outside it once their
   attention has been piqued by their research question. We offer a
   multi-method analysis of the advantages and limitations of this
   approach. While not perfect, it offers another option for teaching this
   challenging course. We conclude by discussing how to build upon this
   approach in the future.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS IN LATIN AMERICA},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {67-94},
Abstract = {Since the return to democracy, Uruguayan presidents have built cabinets
   of varying natures (majority and minority coalitions, majority and
   minority parties). Most studies on presidential government assume that
   the partisan composition of a cabinet is a good predictor of the
   performance of a government's legislative program. In this paper I test
   this hypothesis using Cox and McCubbins' (1993, 2005) party cartel
   theory. The results confirm that six of the eight presidential cabinets'
   legislative performances were consistent with theoretical expectations,
   while two were deviant cases. This article also provides a theoretical
   explanation for these two outliers, highlighting the importance of
   legislative parties, the presidential style of government, and
   preferences as regards legislative initiative.},

   Social Survey, we examine respondents' beliefs about citizenship duties
   and rights. Starting from theories on group membership and
   self-interest, and given the unequal access to full citizenship inherent
   in the United States, we hypothesize more support for citizenship as a
   duty among Whites, but more support for democratic rights among
   non-Whites. The findings of our multivariate analyses show that support
   for these expectations is mixed. Whites and non-Whites do not differ in
   the importance they place on citizenship duties. However, non-Whites are
   significantly more likely to support citizenship rights. The difference
   is partly explained by non-Whites' greater likelihood of identifying
   with the Democratic Party. Implications for democracy and racial (in)
   equality are discussed. Acta Politica (2013) 48, 47-67. doi:

Abstract = {A minimum voting age is defended as the most effective and least
   disrespectful means of ensuring all members of an electorate are
   sufficiently competent to vote. Whilst it may be reasonable to require
   competency from voters, a minimum voting age should be rejected because
   its view of competence is unreasonably controversial, it is incapable of
   defining a clear threshold of sufficiency and an alternative test is
   available which treats children more respectfully. This alternative is a
   procedural test for minimum electoral competence. A procedural test for
   minimum electoral competence also succeeds in fulfilling adults' duties
   to promote children's rational and moral engagement with democracy. A
   minimum voting age should therefore be rejected, all things considered.
   A procedural test for minimum literacy and independent voting is the
   most justified means to ensure competency from voters and to promote the
   democratic agency of children.},

Title = {Regulatory Agencies and Courts in the South: The Overlaps in Colombian
   Water Regulation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS IN LATIN AMERICA},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {5},
Number = {2},
Pages = {105-132},
Abstract = {How can we explain the emergence and evolvement of the overlaps between
   the Colombian Water and Sanitation Regulatory Commission (CRA) and the
   Constitutional Court? This paper shows the dominant literature's
   limitations in explaining these overlaps. By contrast, I argue that the
   ``regulatory enterprise{''} approach developed by Tony Prosser (2010)
   and the theory of ``institutional isomorphism{''} explained by DiMaggio
   and Powell (1991) are better equipped to offer plausible explanations.
   Moreover, I hypothesize that the lack of understanding regarding the
   differences between the role of a regulatory agency in developed
   countries and the role of a regulatory agency in Colombia is critical in
   these overlaps. The specific conditions that determine these differences
   are a precarious legislature, a ``thick{''} constitution that includes
   several social rights, and an activist judicial enforcement of these
   rights. This qualitative research does not allow for generalizable
   conclusions. However, the intention of this study is to provide insights
   into the role and specific challenges for a regulatory agency in
   developing countries. Furthermore, this case study seeks to demonstrate
   that regulation researchers must focus on the political context to
   develop tools appropriate for evaluating regulatory agencies outside the
   developed world.},

Abstract = {In Neil MacCormick's legal writings there is both a legal theory - the
   so-called institutional theory and a theory of legal argumentation. His
   concern with the justification of legal decisions has made him ask
   questions which cannot be answered by a positivistic theory of law. This
   is, beyond any doubt, one of the reasons why this author has openly
   advocated a post-positivistic theory of law. In this paper, this theory
   is contrasted with contemporary positivism, which can be exemplified by
   Joseph Raz's juridical writings. I conclude, after a brief analysis of
   the central theses of Joseph Raz and of some of the theses advanced by
   MacCormick against positivism, that his post-positivism is a superior
   form o legal theory. In the case of MacCormick, the following points are
   both relevant for the development of legal science and incompatible with
   positivism: (1) his characterization of law as an argumentative concept;
   (2) his critical theory of the sources of law; (3) his Kantian
   conception of legal justification and his theory of legal argumentation;
   (4) the special case thesis; (5) the thesis of the claim to correctness
   and the obligation to do justice in accordance with the law; and (6) the
   role played by the ethical life of the community and by the political
   morality in the development and application of law.},

Abstract = {This study examines the role of partisanship in the effectiveness of the
   Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs. As a soft governance approach,
   Lisbon aims to disseminate best practices on labour market policy across
   EU member states. The policy learning view, as the underlying philosophy
   of Lisbon, holds that national governments can learn new and better
   policy practices through interaction with alternative ideas. In
   contrast, the partisanship approach suggests that governments choose
   only the components of the Lisbon strategy fitting the ideological
   preferences of the political parties in government. In this article, I
   analyse the labour market policies of Denmark, the Netherlands and
   Sweden in two separate years to trace the effects of the Lisbon strategy
   in varying political environments. The study reveals that the
   governments of these countries do not give equal attention to all
   recommendations and guidelines; they address in particular those
   recommendations and guidelines that fit the ideological preferences of
   the incumbent parties. Comparative European Politics (2013) 11, 70-92.

Title = {Portraits of Religion in Introductory American Government Textbooks:
   Images of Tolerance or Intolerance},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE EDUCATION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {89-107},
Abstract = {The link between religion and political tolerance in the United States,
   which has focused predominantly on Christianity, is replete with
   unfavorable images. Often, religious adherents (largely Evangelicals or
   the Christian right) are characterized as uneducated, poor, and white,
   suggesting that members of these groups may act in an intolerant manner.
   Our objective is to examine how different religious groups and
   individuals of faith pictorially appear within introductory American
   government textbooks. Are they visually portrayed as politically
   tolerant or intolerant? Are the images of individuals and groups
   presented as exercising rights to speech, assembly, and petition or as a
   threat to others' civil rights? What general themes or issues
   surrounding the visual representation of religion and politics are
   emphasized? We find that the textbook depictions show religious
   individuals in a tolerant light (just about as likely to be the victims,
   as the perpetrators, of intolerance), educated, and not poor. Although
   people of color are shown in numerically similar proportions to that in
   the U.S. population, there is an overrepresentation of the Muslim faith.
   Legal issues surrounding the separation of church and state emerged as
   one dominant theme in the textbooks. Finally, the textbook pictures
   convey a message that religion and politics are connected with a number
   of the images mixing the two.},

Journal = {DEMOCRACY \& SECURITY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {9},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {270-286},
Abstract = {Lone wolf terrorism has a long and bloody past, even if the motivations
   and context of this tactic over the last three decades by right-wing
   extremists and, more recently, jihadi Islamists, have witnessed a
   noticeable spike with the onset of the Internet Age. By approaching lone
   wolf terrorism as a generic phenomenon, this article will retrace both
   the historical trajectory and recent revival of this self-directed
   recourse to the ``terrorist cycle.{''} This extends to an overview of
   earlier waves of lone wolf terrorism (notably deriving from anarchist
   and leftist doctrines), as well as a survey of the surprisingly sparse
   academic literature on the subject in English. By way of contribution,
   this review of some key instances and interpretations of lone wolf
   terrorism pursues two straightforward aims. The first is the
   identification of a nearly 150-year tradition of lone wolf terrorism now
   at its most ideologically disparate and potentially destructive, and the
   second is a heuristic definition and accompanying discussion of
   pan-ideological, solo-activated terrorism.},

Abstract = {Since the 1980s, governments and transnational corporations from core
   countries led by the United States have driven a global upward ratchet
   of intellectual property protection. In agriculture, this has meant
   strengthening the rights of seed companies over the plant varieties they
   develop and curtailing the rights of farmers over the seeds they
   cultivate. Exceptionally, from the 1990s to 2013, Argentine soy growers
   overcame the pressures from the seed industry, guaranteeing the right to
   freely save seeds of proprietary varieties from their own harvests for
   future cultivation. Based on a comparative historical analysis of
   conflicts over intellectual property on seeds in Argentina, Brazil, and
   Paraguay from the 1990s to 2013, this study suggests that a successful
   mobilization of knowledge-users in struggles over intellectual property
   depends on (1) the organizational stability of their political
   representation, (2) the coordination between the organizations that
   represent them, (3) the existence of independent channels for the
   representation of knowledge-users most sensitive to royalty payments,
   and (4) their ability to produce a public discourse capable of drawing
   support from a broad coalition.},

Title = {The Role of Civil Society in Holding Financial Powers Accountable},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CIVIL SOCIETY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2},
Pages = {178-195},
Abstract = {Financial power includes the ability to create and allocate credit-based
   money, to call on government subsidies, to decide which economic
   projects go ahead, and to determine the intellectual and political
   agendas for regulation. Regulators, politicians, and market
   selfregulation mechanisms failed to hold these powers to account
   throughout the financial crisis. Reform advocates in civil society have
   struggled to fill the gap in the face of powerful lobbying by the
   financial industry. Finance Watch was created in 2011 in response to a
   call from MEPs for a counter-lobby and has established itself as an
   effective, independent public interest advocate. Its presence highlights
   a number of ways for reform advocates to coordinate their actions and
   for policy-makers to help bring financial power to account. These
   include asking policy-makers to engage more with non-industry
   respondents, give greater weight to nonindustry voices in consultations
   and increase financial and technical support for public interest
   advocacy.},

Journal = {CRITICAL STUDIES ON TERRORISM},

Pages = {351-370},
Abstract = {This article empirically analyses the provenance, application and
   abandonment of Project Champion, a scheme designed to encircle two
   Birmingham neighbourhoods with surveillance cameras. Locating analysis
   within the anticipatory turn in social control practices, particular
   emphasis is placed on how collapsing distinctions between internal and
   external security draw multiple new actors and agencies into the
   despatch of counterterrorism. The article argues that topological
   approaches informed by Foucauldian notions of ``security{''} allow for a
   better understanding of these heterogeneous techniques and
   configurations of security practice. Foucauldian notions of security
   represent a move beyond territorial control to the management of
   circulations, where subjects are left in situ, but their mobilities are
   monitored, delineated and assessed.},

Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Pages = {69-88},
Abstract = {While the French colony of Algeria was known to have been a violent
   place, historians have rarely compared the specificities and contours of
   its violent culture with those of other nineteenth-century settler
   colonies such as Australia and America. This review article asks why
   this has been the case and whether new definitions of genocide that have
   emerged from the study of other colonies might not be applied to
   Algeria. It contends that the systematic qualities of organised French
   violence-chiefly in the form of massacres known as `razzias'-have been
   underestimated and that the Algerian case merits study by functionalist
   and intentionalist scholars of genocide. While work still needs to be
   undertaken connecting French `exterminationist' literatures to the
   practice of mass killing in the colony, a series of recent histories of
   Algeria have suggested that traditional literatures underestimated the
   scope and effects of French violence upon the indigenous peoples of
   Algeria.},

Abstract = {The implementation of the Urban Massive Transportation Systems in
   Colombia response a policy transfer logic. Bogota with TransMilenio
   began the way for adaptation of a model that emerged originally in
   Curitiba, Brazil. Later this model of Bus Rapid Transit would be
   transferred by the national authorities to major Colombian cities. The
   transfer of the model was established as a main government strategy to
   attend the challenges created by urban transport in our metropolitan
   areas. Cali is the metropolitan area in Colombia where the system has
   been implemented more recently. In this context, the article presents
   the experience in this city through the Western Integrated Mass (MIO) as
   transferred response by national authorities and later adapted to the
   needs of urban transportation in this metropolitan area.},

Abstract = {Political science can gain from incorporating richer conceptions of
   social relations into its analyses. In place of atomistic entities
   endowed with assets but few social relationships, social actors should
   be seen as relational entities embedded in social and cultural
   structures that connect them to others in multifaceted ways.
   Understanding those relationships requires a deeper understanding of how
   institutional and cultural frameworks interact to condition the terrain
   for social action. More intensive dialogue with sociology can inform
   such an understanding. We review the analytical tools cultural sociology
   now offers those interested in such a perspective and illustrate it in
   operation in studies of inequalities in population health and the
   effects of neoliberalism. We close by outlining several issues to which
   this perspective can usefully be applied, including the problems of
   understanding social resilience, how societies build collective
   capacities, and why some institutions remain robust while others
   deteriorate.},

Abstract = {The attainment of independence by Zimbabwe in 1980 was accompanied by
   great hope as Mugabe enunciated a policy of National Reconciliation.
   Zimbabwe, in its current state is a country that, more than in 1980, is
   in need of reconciliation, social integration and national healing. This
   need arises from the colonial and post-colonial experiences of
   dehumanisation and brutalisation of segments of the populace in
   Zimbabwe. It is the intention of this paper to interrogate the need for
   reconciliation, social integration and national healing in Zimbabwe as
   well as the challenges and possibilities. The paper traces the earlier
   attempts at reconciliation in Zimbabwe, the successes and the challenges
   and what led to the present situation of extreme polarisation in
   Zimbabwean society. The paper further provides an assessment of current
   attempts at reconciliation, integration and national healing.
   Furthermore, the paper discusses some conceptions of reconciliation and
   integration and what appear to be necessary conditions for the success
   of any attempts at reconciliation, social integration and national
   healing in Zimbabwe.},

   the current debates in IR research},
Journal = {CRITICAL STUDIES ON TERRORISM},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {6},
Number = {3},
Pages = {414-428},
Abstract = {The focus of attention within the constructivist literature on norm
   dynamics has recently shifted from the ``good{''} side of norm
   development to the investigation of reverse norm dynamics, through which
   established norms in liberal democracies, particularly those related to
   civil and political rights, are challenged and discursively put under
   pressure. This shift was triggered not least by counterterrorist
   security politics since 9/11, leading to a more thorough investigation
   of such dynamics in critical security studies and the literature on norm
   contestation. The basic research interest of these strands of literature
   is to critically assess and better understand the drivers of such
   processes. This article gives an overview of constructivist approaches
   to the study of ``bad{''} norm dynamics and points to further research
   perspectives that could be used to enhance our understanding of
   ``bad{''} norm dynamics in counterterrorism.},

Abstract = {Timothy Hicks, Partisan Strategy and Path Dependence: The Post-War
   Emergence of Health Systems in the UK and Sweden Why did a highly
   redistributive, nationalized health care system emerge in the UK, where
   the Left was comparatively weak, while a more redistributively neutral,
   cash-centric, insurance-based system was pursued in Sweden, where the
   Left was strong? The explanation is two fold. First, in contrast to the
   Swedish Social Democrats, the weakness of the British Labour Party
   constrained it to pursue redistribution via health policy. Second, given
   the redistributive goals of the National Health Service, it became
   imperative for the Labour Party to construct a system that would be
   difficult for future Conservative governments to retrench. More
   generally, this formulation posits rational actors operating in the
   kinds of processes typically studied by historical institutionalists.
   The result is a tendency for a type of path dependence by design.},

Abstract = {In spite of a record number of female parliamentary candidates, the 2010
   general election campaign became notable for the intensity of coverage
   given to the female spouses of the three main party leaders. We find
   that this resulted from a combination of party communication strategy,
   established media discourses, and the agency and visibility of the wives
   themselves. First, Labour and the Conservatives were the most prominent
   in integrating their leaders' wives into their campaigns, often to
   counter the less marketable qualities of the leaders themselves. Second,
   while mainstream media outlets-particularly newspapers-sought to cover
   all three women, they did so drawing upon established gender-based
   conventions, focussing on the wives' physical appearance and apparent
   dedication to their husbands. Third, while the wife of the Liberal
   Democrat leader opted for limited and strategic contact with media, the
   wives of the Conservative and Labour leaders exploited a range of new
   media platforms, combining official party websites, personal blogs, and
   webcasts. We argue that any assessment of the role of the spouses of
   party leaders has to look at media-driven priorities only alongside the
   various strategies open to parties and individuals in managing media
   activities. We also suggest that there is scope to use the coverage of
   leaders' spouses to explore the development, limits, and gender politics
   of any shift toward presidentialism.},

Title = {Ideology after the end of ideology. China and the quest for autocratic
   legitimation},
Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {61-81},

Abstract = {In political science literature on contemporary China, ideology is
   mostly regarded as a dogmatic straitjacket to market reforms that has
   been worn out over the years of economic success, an obsolete legacy of
   the past waiting to be cast off in the course of the country's
   transition toward capitalism. This article posits, however, that
   ideology still plays an indispensable role in the quest to legitimize
   authoritarian rule in contemporary China, and that it does so precisely
   due to its high degree of adaptability. Based on David Beetham's
   theoretical model of political legitimacy, three legitimating functions
   of ideology that demand the constant adaptation of party theory and
   official language are introduced. Presenting various examples of
   reformulations of party theory and official language from the beginning
   of the reform period up to the present, the article demonstrates how the
   party regime relies on ideology to constantly reproduce its legitimacy,
   as well as the pitfalls of this reliance. It argues that ideology in
   contemporary China should be analysed not as a matter of belief but of
   playing by the rules of the official language game, and it shows how
   ideology is deployed as a set of practices and incentives for the proper
   performance of the political elite.},

   into domestic affairs of independent states remains a comparatively new

   hard today to talk about the existence of general theory that is capable
   of explaining inherent features of such operations. Trying to at least
   partly fill the existing gap, A.Ivanov employs methodological results of
   conflictology in order to identify key characteristics of intervention
   that make it different from other forms of interstate confrontation.},

Title = {Barking Up the Wrong Tree: Why Bo Didn't Fetch Many Votes for Barack
   Obama in 2012},

Abstract = {In ``The Dog that Didn't Bark: The Role of Canines in the 2008
   Campaign,{''} Diana Mutz (2010) argues that dog ownership made voters
   significantly less likely to vote for Barack Obama in the 2008
   presidential election. We examine this claim further. Although President
   Obama has owned a dog since shortly after his 2008 election, we argue
   that Bo's presence most likely did little to improve his owner's chances
   of being reelected in 2012. Rather, the apparent significance of dog
   ownership uncovered by Mutz is due largely to key variables being
   omitted from the analysis. Using the same data, we show that Obama
   didn't so much have trouble with dog owners in 2008 as he had trouble
   with conservative, rural, Southern whites, who, for reasons we examine,
   are more likely than other Americans to own dogs. Accordingly, we
   suspect that Bo failed to boost Obama's vote tally in 2012. While we
   recognize the tongue-in-jowl tone of portions of Mutz's article, this
   tale is an important one, and is consistent with recent research linking
   racial attitudes to levels of support for Barack Obama. We also argue
   that while scholars are often wise to include control variables such as
   ``South{''} in studies of political attitudes and behavior, it is
   important to consider the variety of politically relevant
   characteristics that such variables may be capturing.},

Abstract = {At the turn of the 20th century, a multiplicity of strong interests
   emerged within Iran surrounding the nation's course of development, some
   of which continue to surface in one form or another to this day. Around
   the time of the Constitutional Revolution these interest were
   represented by: (a) the Qajar elite, which wished to solidify its
   control over Iran, (b) intellectuals who demanded Western-style reforms,
   (c) merchants and bazaaris demanding more economic protection against
   Western expansion, and (d) the Ulama, whose traditional authority was
   challenged by a growing state. Although the Ulama was instrumental in
   the revolutionary struggles of 1906 and 1979, it was their different
   aims and strategies that led to their defeat in 1906 and triumph in
   1979.},

Title = {Exploring Gumaa as an indispensable psycho-social method of
   conflict resolution and justice administration},
Journal = {AFRICAN JOURNAL ON CONFLICT RESOLUTION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Pages = {37-58},
Abstract = {Oromo as a society, like many African societies, is rich in indigenous
   institutions of conflict resolution and justice administration. Gumaa is
   one of the multitude of Oromo indigenous institutions that has
   exclusively been used to settle blood feuds of various types. In spite
   of its wider utilisation and its multi-disciplinary nature,
   psycho-social analysis of gumaa is lacking in literature. With an aim of
   helping to fill this gap and of maximising gumaa's potential
   contributions to conflict resolution, justice administration and
   peacebuilding, this article offers a psycho-social perspective on gumaa.
   Having analysed combined data from multiple sources regarding gumaa
   within psychological and social frameworks, the author identifies and
   highlights six interrelated theses (themes) about the key roles gumaa
   plays in conflict resolution, justice administration and peacebuilding
   (in cases of homicide). Finally, based on the themes identified and
   highlighted and other pertinent elaborations and case material, the
   author theorises gumaa as a vital psycho-social method of conflict
   resolution, justice administration and peacebuilding and calls for its
   official recognition and revitalisation as per article 78(5) of the
   Constitution of Ethiopia.},

Abstract = {The Sarkozy presidency is shot through with paradox and contrast.
   Sarkozy was a well-elected president swiftly loathed by most voters; a
   ohyperpresident' who probably weakened the office; a talented party
   leader who lost effective control of his party; a right-wing president
   who was readily compared with Tony Blair; and an ambitious reformer who
   promised a clean break with the indecision of his two predecessors, but
   whose record was more timid than his rhetoric. This article interprets
   Sarkozys record in the context of the presidential office, the specific
   circumstances of his presidency and of the presidents own personality,
   skills and shortcomings.},

   postdemocracy in the EU has to be looked at as a semi-permeable
   administrational structure, which enhances the power of global
   enterprises by its excluding character. The EU offers links for Maus'
   conception of decentral and functional jurisdiction. The analysis shows
   that the question of the addressees, the necessary symmetry and scale of
   such institutions will be problematic. The latter derives from the
   imperative of small bodies for consensus oriented communication
   structure which are still neglected.},

Abstract = {The article raises the question of using ``language substitutions{''}
   and euphemisms when defining contemporary political regime in Russia.
   The problem is considered on the examples of the expert discussion on
   the terms ``dictatorship{''} and ``authoritarianism{''} as well as
   short-term and medium-term forecasts of the political development of
   Russia carried out by the Fund Indem. The authors conclude that without
   reflecting on substitutions that occur as a result of playing around the
   words, concepts and meanings, and without acknowledging their
   consequences we risk finding ourselves in a situation described in a
   famous article by Benjamin Whorf The Relation of Habitual Thought and
   Behavior to Language, when workers comfortably smoke while standing near
   the gasoline tanks since the latter are labeled as ``empty{''}.},
