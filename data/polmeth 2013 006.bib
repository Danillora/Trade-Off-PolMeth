Abstract = {This article offers a new empirical perspective on the state of
   Comparative Politics (CP) in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). We
   present findings on the authors, methods, and epistemology of CP
   publications in the most relevant journals from eleven countries in the
   region. The major finding is that CP is rather marginal in CEE Political
   Science. Furthermore, CP articles predominantly focus on the authors'
   country of origin, use off-the-shelf data, apply mostly qualitative data
   analysis techniques, and rarely take a historical perspective.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS AND LAW},

Abstract = {This article refers to the concepts of the community of interests and
   the responsible leadership present in Hans J. Morgenthau's political
   thought. The author analyses both ideas in a broader context of
   Morgenthau's understanding of power and politics and the need to master
   the destructive potential of politics. The second aim of the article,
   however, is to indicate the community of interest and the responsible
   leadership as two interesting points of reference while analyzing the
   process of European integration and its current problems. The article
   concludes that both concepts remain the useful tools in this analysis
   and without the reference to the community of interests it would be
   difficult to talk about the effectiveness of the mechanisms aimed at
   limiting the presence of power in Europe. The case of the responsible
   leadership is a bit more problematic in this regard yet the responsible
   leadership remains the indispensable element of the regional strategy to
   master the destructive potential of politics in Europe. Finally the
   author refers to possible consequences following the collapse of the
   mechanisms that Europe has so far developed to tame and limit the
   struggle for power on the continent.},

Journal = {POLITICAL THEORY},

Volume = {41},
Number = {1},
Pages = {61-89},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Isaiah Berlin's political thought consistently combines tragic value
   pluralism with moral priority for a minimum sphere of individual liberty
   which is defined and protected by a core set of basic human rights. His
   fundamental concept of a common moral minimum includes multiple
   components, including the idea that there is a common moral world of
   plural and conflicting incommensurable objective values and the idea
   that humans share a common nucleus of needs and interests centered on
   the overriding goal of human survival. The basic human rights have
   priority over competing values because the rights are essential for
   human survival. They determine a common threshold of human decency:
   decent societies must respect the rights, which are in principle
   mutually harmonious under ordinary conditions, although emergencies can
   arise in which some of the rights must be sacrificed to respect others.
   Berlin's focus is on decency, which he insists can be maintained without
   a commitment to political democracy.},

Journal = {POLITIQUE EUROPEENNE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {41},
Number = {3},
Pages = {12-39},
Abstract = {This article explores the issue of the mandatory display of the crucifix
   in Italian public schools, which is regulated by acts dating back to the
   1920s. Italian jurisprudence on the matter has been oscillating, while
   the Constitutional Court has repeatedly refused to take a position on
   this issue. The 2011 decision of the European Court of Human Rights in
   the Lautsi case put an end to a nine year-long judicial odyssey. The
   Court argued that the decision as to whether a crucifix should be
   displayed in public classrooms belongs to each European state. By doing
   so, it renounced to play a universalistic role in favour of national
   constitutional systems. However, a number of questions remain open for
   Italy: specifically, the question of the presence of religious symbols
   in public spaces; their relationship with the notions of a democratic,
   pluralistic, secular society and neutrality of the state; and the limits
   to both freedom of religion and freedom from religion at individual and
   collective levels.},

Abstract = {This article provides a cumulative overview of all cases presented in
   this special issue. In particular, we aim at exploring different
   convergence types and their depth as well as their consequences for
   regime efficacy. A cross-case analysis reveals reoccurring patterns: On
   average convergence is more often conceptual, technical, and formal than
   political or behavioral. It is also more often cosmetic or partial than
   extensive or full and in most cases impacts on efficacy only moderately.
   These mediocre results might best be explained by a combination of
   rational and social purpose prediction as proposed in the introductory
   chapter. While actors are aiming to extend their cooperation among one
   another, they at the same time aim at retaining their institutional
   autonomy, leading to processes of mediocre convergence.},

Title = {Michel Martelly: Haiti's New Caesar and the Prospects for Democracy},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {35},
Number = {2},
Pages = {161-181},
Abstract = {This article argues that Haiti's new president, Michel Martelly,
   represents a populist-authoritarian project that combines limited forms
   of inclusion with repression in an effort to stabilize Haiti's polarized
   social structure. Nearly a decade after a UN stabilization mission was
   deployed to resolve Haiti's perennial class conflict in the interests of
   its small elite, Michel Martelly's populist authoritarianism signifies a
   homegrown attempt to break through the class stalemate through a
   reconstructed security state, weak social policies, new mechanisms of
   co-optation, and a nationalist discourse that obfuscates the country's
   social conflicts. In this sense, Martelly has emerged as Haiti's Caesar
   in a general process of authoritarian regression within the longstanding
   struggle to create a more democratic society. The article adopts a
   neo-Gramscian perspective to understand the national and transnational
   dimensions of this struggle and its relationship to larger processes of
   democratization in Latin America and the Caribbean.},

Abstract = {This article examines the degree to which President Obama's public
   positions are congruent with mass opinion, and compares his
   position-taking behavior with that of recent administrations. We
   consider the impact of congressional agenda setting and the electoral
   cycle on the degree of congruence between Obama's positions and public
   opinion. Additionally we investigate whether positions that were only
   marginally popular early in the term have retained support. The findings
   indicate that Obama's presidency resembles other recent administrations
   in terms of policy congruence. First, blame-game politics between the
   president and opposition party have significantly reduced policy
   congruence. Second, for recurring issues, electoral proximity appears to
   be correlated with higher congruence. Finally, as in other recent
   administrations, the overall level of responsiveness is not
   significantly greater than one would expect by chance. Polity (2013) 45,

Abstract = {This article examines the dimensionality of black nationalism and its
   relationship to African-American political participation, focusing
   specifically on blacks' electoral and non-electoral involvement. An
   analysis of the 1993-94 National Black Politics Study confirms earlier
   findings that reveal two key strains of black nationalist thought,
   namely community and separatist nationalism. Most importantly, the
   analysis demonstrates that both versions drive distinct forms of
   political activity. Community nationalism increases electoral and
   non-electoral involvement among African Americans, while separatist
   nationalists tend to abstain from voting.},

   behaviour as a result of power struggles between partisan blocks within
   the institution can not explain cases like ours, in which the

   better explanation of the different outcomes.},

Abstract = {This chapter challenges the `conventional position' by putting forward
   the idea that democracy is innately fallible. Less an anomaly than a
   constitutive feature of democracy, this is a position which openly
   acknowledges that democracy is, at its peak, prone to being corrupted -
   by itself. Until now, this has not typically been a view shared by many
   supporters of democracy. Where democracies have suffered and collapsed
   as a result of ill-health, the tendency has largely been to see what
   extrinsic diseases has infected it. What very few have attended to is
   the prospect that that disease may just turn out to be democratic
   politics itself. And yet fewer still have chosen to remedy the maladies
   of democracy by first and foremost admitting to its constitutive
   failure. Laying the blame instead on other institutional, socioeconomic
   and political determinants, we have continued to misunderstand what ails
   democracy; thinking that it can, once removed of external impediments,
   be made perfect.},

Abstract = {This article studies the ideational underpinnings of the UK Coalition
   government's liberal conservative' foreign policy. It begins by
   suggesting that an Iraq-centric account of Blair's foreign policy
   suggests a grand vision on the prime minister's part that was lacking
   from his earlier foreign policy adventures, which relied on a more
   conventional form of British statecraft. The second section contends
   that the Gordon Brown years 200710 and, since the end of New Labour,
   Coalition foreign policy, can be seen as a response both to the
   substance and style of Blair's highly personalised stewardship of
   foreign policy post-9/11. The war on terror and the invasion of Iraq
   were accompanied by a seemingly open-ended democracy promotion around
   the globe which was quite out of character with past British practice.
   The article argues, therefore, thatunder Brown and Cameron cautious
   pragmatism has tended to win out over the proclamation of grand
   strategic ambition.},

Abstract = {The provincial elections in Belgium in 2012 provide a unique opportunity
   to measure the changes in vote shares that have occurred between the
   federal elections of 2010 and the federal, regional and European
   elections of 2014. The election results not only demonstrated
   significant differences between Flemish and Walloon provinces but also,
   and more importantly, the clear success of the Flemish nationalists
   (N-VA). In Flanders, almost all the other parties, including the
   extreme-right, lost significant vote shares. This victory of the Flemish
   nationalists increases the importance of the forthcoming elections of
   2014 and their impact on the future of Belgium.},

Abstract = {Next to their well-documented authoritarian cultural agenda,
   new-rightist populist parties have developed specific views on the
   welfare state: welfare chauvinism and welfare populism. This article
   studies the electoral relevance of these views for Dutch new-rightist
   populist parties by means of survey data representative of the Dutch
   population (N = 1972). The electorate of those parties shows high levels
   of both welfare chauvinism and welfare populism. However, only welfare
   populism underlies support for new-rightist populist parties in addition
   to well-known cultural motives. Based on these findings, ideological and
   electoral competition between political parties is discussed, and
   suggestions for further research are provided.},

   the cultural isolation and obscurantism in the American colonies before
   the eighteenth century through the analysis of the circulation of books

Abstract = {In this short response piece, I use the distinction, following Claude
   Lefort, between the political (le politique) and politics (la politique)
   to frame an evaluation of the retreating of the concept of authority as
   presented in this special edition. The piece takes up Jean-Luc Nancy's
   presentation of a different regime of thought for politics that takes
   the actuality of singular experience as that which keeps open the
   constitution of any political act, event or space in its infinite
   potential. Arguing that the concept of the event plays to the heart of
   our questioning of politics, I spotlight the disruptive and
   unpredictable space at the cusp of the (as yet) inconceivable threshold
   of conscious awareness which points towards the space of politics
   attuned to the molecular beat of habit, affect and plasticity.},

Abstract = {This special issue raised some points of interpretation that need
   developing. Everyone writes with a (more or less overt) set of
   assumptions, which is particularly true where the subject matter is as
   politically contentious as nationalism and that nationalism is still
   contested, as with Ireland. This was particularly true of this issue.
   This response aims to tease out some hidden assumptions and
   interpretations in those papers to further our understanding of the role
   of religion not just within the general framework of nationalism but
   also within our own assumptions of religious and ideological norms and
   values when studying nationalism.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to analyze the relations between the
   phenomenon of sport and politics in the Portuguese New State during the
   period 1933-45. What was the relationship established between the
   Salazar regime and sport? In what way did the government act with regard
   to sport and how did this relationship adapt to (and shape) the plans
   for social control that were put forward during the period of the New
   State? In seeking to obtain a better understanding of these
   relationships, I examine how sport was employed as a strategy for
   achieving a consensus and following this, to note how these same
   relationships were used as a part of Salazar's propaganda, as well as to
   boost his image. Finally, I undertake a case study that is concerned
   with the most significant occasion when Salazar's image was bound up
   with the Portuguese sports movement - the opening ceremony of the
   National Stadium.},

Pages = {94-114},
Abstract = {To date, most social network analyses (SNAs) of terrorist groups have
   used network data that provide snap-shots of the groups at a single
   point in time. Seldom have they used network data that take into account
   how the groups have changed over time. In this article, a unique
   longitudinal network data set, the Noordin Top terrorist network from
   2001 to 2010, is examined in order to explore whether a recently
   developed method - social network change detection (SNCD) can help
   analysts monitor a dark network's topography (e.g. centralization,
   density, degree of fragmentation) in order to detect significant changes
   in its structure and identify possible causes. The application of change
   detection to this historical data set illustrates the method's potential
   usefulness, including its ability to detect significant changes in the
   network in response to a series of exogenous factors, such as the
   acquisition of bombing materials, the capture of key leaders and groups,
   and the death of Noordin himself. The method's inability to detect other
   significant events, however, highlights important limitations when
   working with it. While SNCD should not be the only method analysts have
   at their disposal, the results detailed in this article suggest that it
   should be included in their toolkit.},

Abstract = {Political scientists have much to learn from the biology of play. The
   most important political activities of democracy, like discussion and
   debate, gathering new information, and even voting and elections, are
   perhaps best understood as forms of play. Play has both intrinsic
   attraction and a developmental function (i.e., it promotes skill
   acquisition). As such, democratic political activity can be conceived of
   as social and imaginative explorative play. This robust understanding of
   democracy and political behavior aligns with the American pragmatist
   John Dewey's (1916) conception of democracy as a ``mode of associated
   living, of conjoint communicated experience.'' In this article, I detail
   how the ``politics as play'' analogy can help enhance the study and
   pedagogy of political science.},

   nonhuman democracy. The chapter offers a table that surveys mammals,
   birds, fish, insects, slime-moulds and bacteria. Biologists argue that
   these different species have specific democratic practices. The chapter
   describes that physicists and mathematicians use the terms `democracy'
   and `democratic' in their works. It asks whether democracy or democratic
   things had a role to play in the origins of life.},

Abstract = {We inventory more than 150 studies of distributive politics in more than
   three dozen countries other than the United States. We organize existing
   studies under two theories: theories of democratic accountability and
   theories of government responsiveness. Studies that concern democratic
   accountability conceptualize distributive allocations as attempts by
   politicians to protect themselves electorally by targeting specific
   groups of voters. We identify four subsets: (a) studies of whether
   politicians target goods to core or swing voters; (b) studies of general
   political favoritism in targeting government goods; (c) studies of
   whether goods are disbursed according to the electoral cycle; and (d)
   studies of whether elected officials gain votes from the disbursement of
   government goods. We illustrate each with examples from the literature.
   We then discuss distributive politics as responsiveness to the median
   voter. This perspective entails a focus on the redistributive
   consequences of government policy and investigates whether special
   interests capture a disproportionate share of goods coming from
   government. To illustrate the utility of both perspectives, we analyze
   original data on electricity provision in India's largest state.},

Abstract = {The article is devoted to the analysis of the first constitutional
   justice project in the post-Soviet Russia. Resting upon the theory that
   links institutional characteristics of the Constitutional Court and its
   relationship with the government, with the configuration of elites
   initiating the formation of this body and the prospects of them holding
   grip onto power, I.Grigoryev considers a set of hypothetical scenarios
   of constitutional justice formation and shows that Russia failed to
   implement any of them. According to his assessment, such a turn of
   events can be explained by the fact that the Russian Constitutional
   Court was established even before the emergence of the political
   landscape of a new Russia. Its creation was driven by the desire to
   strengthen the national as opposed to the Union level of government
   rather than an aspiration to introduce an impartial arbiter into
   politics, which provoked the elites' suboptimal moves that reached
   catastrophic proportions resulting in the collapse of the whole project.},

Title = {Institutionalizations compared: Implementating the EU's 2008 wine reform},
Journal = {COMPARATIVE EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Pages = {119-142},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In 2008 the European Union adopted an apparently radical reform of its
   wine policy. However, whether this policy change actually
   reinstitutionalizes the regulation of this industry is dependent on how
   it is implemented and represented by both commercial operators and
   regulators located at national and intra-national scales. Using
   interview and documentary data generated on this process in France,
   Spain and Romania, this article sets out to compare and explain the
   differentiated institutionalization of the reform that has actually
   occurred to date. Its key empirical finding is that
   reinstitutionalization is dependent on the degree to which change has
   been legitimated within such regions. More precisely, durable change or
   maintenance of the status quo stems from how conflicts over different
   parts of the EU's reform have been framed and debated locally. This
   finding has two wider implications for institutionalist theories of
   political change. First, constructivist accounts of the framing of
   collective and public problems need to be brought to the fore. Second,
   at least when studying contemporary Europe, the question of scale and
   its institutional effects should be systematically built into research
   strategies and methodologies. Comparative European Polities (2013) 11,

Journal = {REVISTA ANDINA DE ESTUDIOS POLITICOS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {3},
Number = {1},
Pages = {204-229},
Abstract = {Internationally, the high and persistent level of social inequality is
   considered to be one of the main challenges for Guatemala. But analyses
   of the perception of social inequality within Guatemala are lacking.
   Therefore, the author of this article examines, firstly, the public
   opinion (as expressed in the Latinobarometro 2009 survey) on social
   inequality and the factors that shape it, with special attention to
   members of disadvantaged groups in society. The article shows that a
   majority of the Guatemalan electorate is aware of and criticizes social
   inequality in their country. But Guatemalans consider the phenomenon by
   far less important than the lack of public security. Furthermore, it
   turns out that there is obviously no group of society especially
   unsatisfied with the social situation. Thus, the issue of social
   inequality does not found a constituency. These two matters of fact make
   it easier for politicians to ignore or neglect the topic. This
   assumption is confirmed by the analysis of the election platforms of
   three of the 2011 presidential election candidates. Only the indigenous,
   female candidate attributes importance to social inequality in her
   manifesto. Additionally, the election platforms draw almost no
   connection between social inequality and the lack of public security.},

   dynamics of killing},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GENOCIDE RESEARCH},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-19},
Abstract = {This article investigates the challenging question of how to judge
   genocidal intent in a contextual and interdisciplinary perspective. With
   the case of Goran Jelisic as an example, the paper will discuss the
   problems involved in judging individual genocidal intent. Jelisic was
   not sentenced for genocide in his trial. The reasons given are assessed
   in light of other trials and the case of Josef Schwammberger, SS ghetto
   commander in Przemysl (Poland) in 1943-44, in particular. The article
   argues that the reasoning of the Trial Chamber in the Jelisic case
   regarding his `inconsistent' or `arbitrary' behaviour is not convincing
   since perpetrators of mass violence or genocide are hardly ever
   `consistent' in their actions. If-in theory similar arguments were made
   regarding perpetrators of the Holocaust, it would also prove very
   difficult to charge them with genocide - even though the Genocide
   Convention has its roots in the experience of the Holocaust. The
   different and sometimes contradicting interpretations of genocidal
   intent in international criminal law show a high level of uncertainty.
   The complexities of a genocidal process and perpetrator behaviour in
   particular are not always sufficiently recognized. This might call
   either for a reform of the Genocide Convention and the laws attached, a
   wider interpretation, or clearer guidelines on how specific genocidal
   intent has to be assessed.},

Title = {Test-firing the `new world order' in Somalia: the US/UN military
   humanitarian intervention of 1992-1995},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GENOCIDE RESEARCH},

Volume = {15},

Abstract = {The US/UN Military Humanitarian Intervention (MHI) in Somalia has given
   rise to a vast body of writing to which the MHI's relationships with
   Somalis and the devastating political and moral impact on them have
   often remained incidental. This article focuses on how the MHI in
   Somalia, taken as a whole, was unable to keep or enforce peace, failed
   to benefit the humanitarian wellbeing and human rights of ordinary
   Somalis and itself caused the latter new violence. With the benefit of
   hindsight and drawing on recent political and military memoirs, this
   article analyses how the US leadership of the MHI's first stage (UNITAF
   or United Task Force) used the discourse of a `politics-free'
   humanitarianism to pursue policies that empowered Somali perpetrators of
   crimes against humanity, undermined the wellbeing of common Somalis and
   set the UN up for failure in the MHI's second stage (UNOSOM or United
   Nations Operation in Somalia II). It further shows that, during this
   second stage, the MHI's military dimension came to overwhelm its
   humanitarian and peace-building focus so that even US/UN drawdown and
   troop withdrawal rewarded the very Somali perpetrators of crimes against
   humanity whose violence had provoked the MHI's military overreach and
   disaster. By evaluating the MHI's actions in and impact on Somalia, and
   assessing it as a stage in increasingly militarized global approaches to
   `First World' interventions into `Third World' lives, this article
   cautions against uncritical support for MHIs as tools for preventing and
   containing the large-scale violence and human suffering that
   characterize complex emergencies.},

Abstract = {Trust in exchanges is an important concept in business and has become of
   topic of some interest in e-commerce. Substantial work has been done on
   how institutional mechanisms, technology, word-of-mouth, and numerous
   other variables affect trust in a website and potential customers'
   willingness to conduct business there. This study continues that line of
   research by considering how the millennial generation perceives the
   trustworthiness of three types of online sites: a retailer, an auction
   site, and a social networking site. Little work has been done on whether
   social network sites have more or less trust than other types of
   websites and what aspects of trust are affected. Given the broad trend
   toward utilizing these social network sites for commercial purposes, it
   makes sense to assess how targeted users view and interact with them.
   This study presents preliminary data on all of these issues, suggesting
   that there do appear to be differences between social network sites and
   more traditional online vendors.},

Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE PEACE \& SECURITY},

Abstract = {The heavy direct or indirect reliance of liberal states on the military
   and security services of the private contractor in contemporary warfare
   is an undeniable reality. While the literature presents a wide array of
   different empirical explanations of why liberal states have come to
   increasingly rely on contractor support, this paper attempts to give a
   normative explanation to this development. This paper does not aim to
   refute the existing explanations but merely complement the most commonly
   stated reasons for outsourcing. It argues that the liberal state's
   hiring of private contractors can be understood against the backdrop of
   a wider trend whereby liberal states, increasingly operating in
   non-trinitarian operations, attempt to replace the soldier as a
   trinitarian servant with non-trinitarian means of warfare. This
   correlation between liberal state commitments in non-trinitarian warfare
   and a growing employment of non-trinitarian means of warfare can be
   explained by Social Contract theory and lays the foundation for a
   normative understanding of why liberal states resort to non-trinitarian
   contractor support amid non-trinitarian crises.},

Abstract = {The non-recurrence of war is mostly considered as the main indicator for
   successful peace processes. Nevertheless, even in these postwar
   contexts, other forms of violence - i.e. state repression or homicide -
   have the potential to endanger the larger process of peace-building.
   Hence, the analysis of variations in postwar violence is important for
   the broader peace processes. Three interdependent factors explain
   variations in postwar violence: the patterns of war termination,
   policies aiming at the mitigation of the conflict root causes and last
   but not least institutional reforms. The different experiences of
   Central American postwar societies show that violence reduction does not
   require the resolution of major grievances but at least their political
   recognition.},

Abstract = {The euphoria of celebrating South Sudan's independence and the
   completion of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, signed in 2005, must
   not undermine the significance of assessing and more importantly
   acknowledging the shortcomings of securing Sudan's stability and unity
   as a result of its exclusive nature. By all means, the responsibility
   was primarily that of the government of Sudan to ensure the country's
   territorial integrity. However, the regional and international mediators
   are not free of blame. By analysing the objectives and outcomes of the
   peace process, while considering the conflicting agendas of all involved
   parties, this article underlines the failures that led to Sudan's
   secession and left the country with yet another conflict: Darfur.},

Pages = {333-355},
Abstract = {The Porfiriato (1876-1911) is one of the key periods in the history of
   modern Mexico. During this time the government of Porfirio Diaz
   undertook a series of important historiographic and artistic projects
   which sought to consolidate the basis of a national identity. The
   incorporation of Mexico's prehispanic past, however, became a
   controversial element in the cultural politics of the Porfiriato. By
   looking at some examples of state-sponsored commissions, in monuments
   and architecture, this article considers the ways in which artistic
   production responded to the demands of nationhood and progress; and the
   difficulties of integrating the legacies of prehispanic Mexico into the
   modern discourse of the nation.},

Abstract = {This article examines the processes of formation and transformation of
   the property rights institution in the post-Soviet Russia. The analysis
   conducted by the author shows that the 1990s witnessed a real chance of
   creating an efficient institution of property. However, neither the
   ``power{''} nor the ``business{''} that prioritized short-term interests
   associated with the distribution of state property as opposed to
   long-term benefits from having a well-specified and well-secured system
   of property rights, made a request for its formation. The problem of
   isolating ``society{''} from defining rules of the game on this field
   was of no less importance. ``Business{''} did not view ``society{''} as
   a strategic partner, which ultimately left it one on one with the
   strengthening state and allowed the ``power{''} that relied on the
   coercive resource to unilaterally change the configuration of the
   functioning regime of institution of property.},

   and Herzegovina},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GENOCIDE RESEARCH},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Pages = {21-39},
Abstract = {This article surveys the use of the term `genocide' before, during and
   after the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina from 1992 to 1995. The article
   argues that although `genocide' remains an important legal and
   analytical concept, an excessive focus on this term represents a
   misguided and counterproductive approach to the analysis of mass
   violence. Discussions revolving around a `genocide or not' dichotomy do
   not further our understanding of the Bosnian war, and are in their
   essence more connected to desires for past and future international
   military interventions and to internal Bosnian political struggles than
   to a scholarly agenda. The ongoing obsession with the label of
   `genocide' has distortive effects on international criminal justice,
   because anything less than a genocide conviction is counted as a
   `failure.' Recent scholarly accusations that international legal
   findings of crimes other than genocide constitute `genocide denial' are
   particularly troubling. In Bosnia, the disproportionate attention on
   genocide helps to perpetuate the zero-sum approach that has informed
   Bosniak-Serb political negotiations since the end of the war, and more
   recently the issue of `genocide' has also aggravated relations within
   the Bosniak community. Ultimately, therefore, it may be more productive
   to move beyond what has become a myopic focus on genocide.},

   is treated. In due course, find their definition individual subject and
   collective subject of the political responsibility during the stage of
   conquering political power and the stage of its execution. Analyzed then
   are essential characteristics of the political responsibility as it is
   proper to politicians, to elected and appointed political functionaries
   within political power, and to electors, as well as to parties, to
   political institutions of public power, and to citizens' associations.
   Measures and mechanisms of compulsion to political responsibility are
   evaluated such, for instance, as appointment by election and
   removability - according to results of elections - of political
   functionaries of public power and civil control of the latter's
   activities.},

Abstract = {Economists and psychologists often disagree about the impact of rewards
   on prosocial behavior. Economists generally believe incentives promote
   effort and performance, while many psychologists warn they depress
   intrinsic motivation and impair performance. I conduct the first
   randomized field experiments of which I am aware to investigate the
   impact of extrinsic (monetary) rewards on voting in elections. In a
   pilot study, voters in Gilroy, California, were randomly assigned to
   receive a postcard mailing with either a simple reminder to vote or an
   offer to receive a financial reward (of varying levels) for
   participating in the November 2007 election. A large-scale replication
   study was conducted in Lancaster, California, in April 2010. The results
   of the experiments reveal nominal incentives failed to effectively raise
   turnout in elections, but nontrivial incentives elevated electoral
   participation. These findings yield insights relevant to disciplinary
   debates in economics and psychology as well as in political science.},

Abstract = {Purpose - This chapter uses evolutionary theory to determine if certain
   aspects of political thinkers' societal visions might comport with human
   nature.
   Design/methodology/approach - This chapter summarizes the political
   views of two thinkers and then applies our evolutionary understanding of
   altruism/cooperation to determine if their views can in any way be
   considered consistent with human nature.
   Findings - The chapter explores the underlying commonality between
   individualist anarchism and anarcho-communism. There is a subtle but
   credible relationship between these two libertarian perspectives through
   the evolution of cooperation in its several manifestations. It can be
   said that the key tenets of Max Stirner and Peter Kropotkin are
   underlain by evolutionary impulses, thus rendering their claims of
   cooperation and sociality plausible.},

Abstract = {The term ``resilience{''} has evolved to a key concept of security
   policy in recent years. This development is closely interrelated with
   the change in the perception of what actually is ``security{''}. The
   long search for clearly definable threats has been replaced by the
   management of relatively indefinite risk positions. Based on a
   qualitative analysis of security policy documents, this article
   illustrates the state of the art in the conceptual development of the
   term ``resilience{''}. Cumulatively, these documents allow us to segment
   the term around the constitutive elements of coping, adaptability and
   redundancy. Together, these form the basis of a resilience-based
   strategy of risk management.},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The cyclical crises in the 20th century, stemming primarily from the
   economic and financial sector and subsequently spreading into all of the
   social systems, have also influenced the military subsystem. In such
   circumstances the military subsystem as a major user of budgetary
   resources would be under a twofold pressure: the diminishing resources
   would call for profound or even radical changes of its dimension and
   quality, while on the other hand the crisis would usually involve an
   increased security risk, which would in turn involve the increasing
   demands being imposed on the military system. The Slovenian version of
   the global economic crisis, which broke out in 2008 as a financial
   crisis in the USA and Europe, resulted in a radical decrease of
   budgetary resources intended for the military system, which had been
   professionalised. One of the first economy interventions of the state
   involved a reduction of the military budget in the amount of 25 percent.
   The crisis hinders the stability and especially the development of the
   military system, and due to their size and lack of flexibility the
   military systems are not capable to adapt quickly. Nevertheless, in none
   of the cases can we discern any examples of increased aggressiveness
   towards the internal public, which demonstrates the traditional loyalty
   of the army in this space.},

Title = {Rethinking the value of families},
Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Pages = {130-150},
Abstract = {In the growing philosophical literature on the family and its value, the
   parents' fiduciary role often serves to explain why the family is
   valuable from a child-centred perspective. Recently it has been further
   argued that this fiduciary role also explains the distinctive value the
   family has for parents. By offering a critique of that argument, the
   paper advances an alternative parent-centred account of the value of the
   family. It points out the process in families whereby parents reproduce
   some of their characteristics in their children and thereby establish a
   powerful sense of interconnectedness and continuity between their own
   identity and the child's. The fact that the family provides quite a
   unique platform for developing this type of interpersonal bond may

Abstract = {The paper analyzes the structure and evolution of the political elite of
   Tatarstan. According to the authors' assessment, the regional elite
   includes groups varying in their recruitment character that can fight
   with each other and at the same time step up as a united front against
   the federal center. In the face of the central government pressure, it
   managed to preserve its own mechanisms of self-reproduction blocking
   appointees from outside to any significant positions, but still wielded
   the most-favored treatment in obtaining federal funding. Bringing back
   regional governors' elections opens up novel prospects for the Republic
   sub-elite groups leaders, but it is only real competition between the
   ruling and counter-elite that can improve qualification and moral level
   of regional elite.},

Series = {Palgrave Pivot},
Year = {2013},
Pages = {38-48},
Abstract = {A social and political prevention strategy is based on reducing the
   driving forces behind and motivation for adopting the use of terroristic
   violence, by trying to eliminate or reduce the root causes and sources
   of frustration and anger, and stopping radicalisation processes at as
   early a stage as possible. Measures may address processes and conditions
   at the (macro) level of society, state, international relations or
   trans-national developments, at the (meso) level of social movements,
   institutions, organisations, and groups, or at the (micro) level of
   individuals and face-to-face interaction. Many kinds of political and
   social actors have relevant measures at their disposal. The social and
   political crime prevention strategy goes to the root of the problem and
   may bring positive effects in more problem areas than just terrorism.
   However, some root causes are difficult to change and positive impact
   may take a long time to achieve.},

Abstract = {The federation is a complex model of State organization, inspired by
   American experience, rooted in the idea of power condominium. The
   Brazilian case - traditionally derided as cordial federalism - marked by
   paternalistic Portuguese heritage, presents imbalances in the relational
   links between federal entities, despite the reaffirmation of federal
   way, the consolidation of decentralization means and the skills sharing
   established by Constitutional Charter of 1988. This paper demonstrates
   that, although there have been significant advances in terms of
   federalism legitimacy in Brazil, the inverted pyramid emphasizes the
   model limitations and generates setbacks, defining the need to reread
   federal governance under the idea of democratic and efficient
   management, using qualitative tools, especially on Constitutional Law
   area, based on juridical-dogmatic way.},

   against representation and claims that they are consistent with his

   Disclaim of representation entailed also disclaim of public deliberation
   (as we know Rousseau thought a good assembly of citizens should vote in
   silence in order not to make room for rhetoric). Rousseau's critical
   arguments can be used to prove a contrario the endogenous link between

Title = {Unpacking the Russian doll: gendered and intersectionalized categories
   in European gender equality policies},
Journal = {POLITICS GROUPS AND IDENTITIES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {1},
Number = {3},
Pages = {417-432},
Abstract = {Both theoretically and normatively, the question of whether and how to
   generalize or specify gendered social actors in policy-making has been
   much debated. While some stress the need to specify and
   intersectionalize actors so that interfering power dynamics can be
   addressed, others highlight the dangers involved in any reification of
   social categories. This paper analyzes the actual gendered and
   intersectionalized category-making of social actors in gender equality
   policies across Europe, using a database of 2088 recent laws, policy
   plans, and civil society documents on gender equality from 29 countries
   plus the EU level. Analyzing four policy issues, we find that the
   generic category ``women{''} is often present, although less in laws.
   Intersectionalized categories, however, are rare, as is an articulation
   of these actors' specific problems or how policies could address their
   needs. Lastly, we find the category of minoritized women more often used
   in ways that are open to stigmatization.},

Journal = {PARTY POLITICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1},
Pages = {41-60},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Despite comprehensive reform (Political Parties, Elections and
   Referendums Act) and recent review (Phillips Review in 2007) of party
   finance in Britain, public opinion of party finance remains plagued by
   perceptions of corruption, undue influence from wealthy donors, carefree
   and wasteful spending and, more generally, from the perception that
   there is just `too much money' in politics. In this article we argue
   that knowledge of and attitudes to party finance matter, not least
   because advocates of reform have cited public opinion as evidence for
   reform. However, because attitudes to party finance are part of a
   broader attitudinal structure, opinion-led reforms are unlikely to
   succeed in increasing public confidence. Using data generated from
   YouGov's online panel (N=2,008), we demonstrate that the public know
   little of the key provisions regulating party finance and attitudes to
   party finance can be explained along two underlying dimensions -
   Anti-Party Finance and Reformers. As such, we consider whether parties
   and politicians should be freed from the constraints of public opinion
   in reforming party finance.},

Abstract = {The Nordic Region offers innovative interpretative approaches and models
   to overcome the ``dilemma between security and prosperity{''}. In this
   region, integration and fragmentation have been well-balanced and
   grounded on diversity. The first aim of this article is to explain the
   reasons for peace in Nordic Europe, a task sometimes more difficult than
   explaining wars. Historical cases of pacific resolution of disputes and
   the possible reasons for those policies are considered. Finally, the
   theoretical foundations of these approaches and how they influenced the
   political institutions are also analyzed.},

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {57},

Abstract = {Comparisons of individuals based on their selections from an ordinal
   scale traditionally assume that all respondents interpret subjective
   scale categories in exactly the same way. Anchoring vignettes have been
   proposed as a method to replace this homogeneity assumption with
   individual-specific data about how each respondent uses the ordinal
   scale. However, improving interpersonal comparisons with anchoring
   vignettes also requires a new set of assumptions. In this article, I
   derive the assumptions needed to make credible nonparametric comparisons
   using anchoring vignettes, and propose a new nonparametric scale that
   does not assume homogeneity among respondents. I also provide methods
   for evaluating empirically whether a set of anchoring objects can
   produce credible nonparametric interpersonal comparisons. Two empirical
   studies illustrate the importance of accounting for differences in the
   use of ordinal scales by showing how our inferences about interpersonal
   comparisons may change as a function of the assumptions we accept.},

Abstract = {Two decades after the Cold War, the political traditions of Left and
   Right were widely deemed to have fossilized. Many saw them as unable to
   express vital alternatives, and only distantly related to contemporary
   political life. This article examines how far this remains true in the
   light of more recent upheavals. It looks at the key divisions of opinion
   to have emerged from the economic crisis that broke in 2008, identifying
   important differences concerning in what sense it a crisis (the
   production of disorder vs. production of injustice) and how it can be
   explained (acts of moral or intellectual transgression vs. a pattern of
   adhesion to problematic doctrines and practices). It goes on to argue
   that these differences can be seen as extensions of older Left-Right
   dichotomies, albeit articulated with a second division between technical
   and normative reasoning. The article concludes with a discussion of the
   challenge political actors face in positioning themselves coherently
   according to these divisions.},

Abstract = {This paper locates the discussion on wearing niqab and burqa within the
   context of information acquisition and response formation among Muslims
   and non-Muslims in the contemporary world. The paper argues that,
   against the backdrop of varied opinions on Islam and Muslims around the
   world, the debate on wearing burqa represents the continuation - albeit
   up-scaling - of the focus on Muslim women as the signifiers of Islam and
   Muslim identities. Australia is influenced by, and dealing with, the
   debate on whether or not to ban the burqa and niqab. Opinions among both
   the wider community and Muslims have differed on the justification and
   advisability of such a ban. The Australian government at the federal and
   state levels has demonstrated cautious activism in dealing with the
   issue, thus protecting the rights of Australian Muslim minorities, and
   reducing the space in which a heightened sense of exclusion could
   develop among them.},

Abstract = {The trend of recurrence rape in our society today constitutes a serious
   phenomenal threat to the human existence and dignity. This paper
   examined the offence of rape holistically from definitional perspective
   with reference to related concepts such as sexual violence, and
   marital/spousal rape.
   This paper also examined selected statutes which prohibit rape. It
   further examined rape in the context of genocide, crime against
   humanity, torture, and war crimes. Also, some selected statistics of
   rape were examined. Also, examined are effects and aftermaths of rape.
   The aim of this paper is to show that rape is a monstrously dangerous to
   humanity and should not be underrated.
   This is a desk-based research which relies on both primary and secondary
   resources of data which have been subjected to contentual and contextual
   analysis.
   It is the findings of this author among others that issue of rape must
   be frontally attacked but also that the problem of rape cannot be solved
   by measures taken within the criminal justice sector alone.},

Abstract = {This paper aims at contributing a literature update by assessing the
   impact of policies focusing on defence-procurement spending on the
   growth rate of the Greek economy with special reference to the recent
   crisis environment using artificial neural networks. The main conclusion
   drawn in the case of the Greek economy in general and during austerity
   times in particular, is that defence-procurement policy is considerably
   inflexible concerning both increases and reductions. In fact any further
   decreases will have a direct impact on the security of the country given
   the dramatic reduction of the defence budget and the arms race against
   Turkey. By contrast, any increases will only burden the balance of
   payments without adding to the GDP, once the bulk of the defence
   equipment is imported due to the inefficiency of the domestic defence
   industrial base. A compromise, therefore, between security and austerity
   would call for a gradual shift towards domestic sources procurement,
   assuming, of course, considerable upgrading of the Hellenic defence
   industrial base.},

   tri-national University of Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland (UBLS). The
   paper makes two main points. First is that the three national campuses
   which made up UBLS were in academic terms in the 1970s and 1980s equal
   if not superior to the better known and better resourced campuses over
   the border in South Africa. Thus it is suggested was a product of the
   rich international and high-quality mix of the faculty, the diverse and
   politicized make-up of the student bodies and the innovative and
   progressive nature of the curriculum. Second is that the three campuses
   became in the course of the intensifying regional struggle against the
   apartheid regime significant sites of struggle involving both faculty
   and students, many of whom paid a heavy price for their involvement. It
   cost me my job in terms of a deportation; others paid a heavier price.},

Abstract = {The article explores the mothering work of a group of Kurdish women in
   London as enactments of citizenship. Rather than focusing on their
   integration, it foregrounds the migrant mothers' ability to disrupt
   hegemonic citizenship narratives and bring into being new political
   subjects. They co-construct diasporic citizenship, through their
   mothering work, producing their children's cultural identifications as
   both British and Kurdish. These identifications are contingent,
   involving intra-ethnic contestations of legitimate Kurdish culture.
   Kurdish migrant mothers' cultural work is not simply about making nation
   state citizens. By giving meaning to cultural continuity and change, the
   mothers reference multiple levels of belonging (local, national and
   diasporic) which challenge state boundaries. The article shows that
   although mothers play a key role in constructing their children's
   cultural identities and their articulation in ethnic and national terms,
   they also contest the meaning of ethnic minority cultural practices and
   group boundaries, potentially disrupting hegemonic narratives of good
   citizenship as ethno-national.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the significance of the treaty monitoring process
   that is routinely prescribed by international human rights treaties. The
   authors employ world society theory to claim that the monitoring process
   simultaneously reflects world cultural principles and promotes the
   diffusion of cultural scripts. To illustrate these claims, the paper
   integrates examples of the monitoring process of the United Nations
   Convention on the Rights of the Child and its application in the state
   of Cameroon. The convention is the most widely ratified human rights
   treaty in history and symbolizes the global commitment to protect and
   promote the rights of children, while Cameroon exhibits typical ongoing
   challenges of treaty implementation. The paper situates the monitoring
   process within world society as a manifestation and agent of its
   characteristic practices and values, shedding light on the
   taken-for-granted nature of the process, despite known problems of
   decoupling.},

Abstract = {Intolerance toward immigrants has recently reached noticeable highs in
   Switzerland. Referring to the conflict theory, the perception of a
   specific group as a threat tends to lead to intolerance toward that
   group. The expectation of a negative relationship between threat and
   tolerance is nevertheless not assumed to be universally valid for all
   members of society. In particular, the contact theory assumes that
   intercultural encounters should promote positive attitudes toward
   culturally different individuals and groups. Using a new and unique data
   set, our Heckman selection models reveal that Swiss who view rising
   immigration to mean a loss of economic privileges and an erosion of
   Swiss cultural values are less tolerant toward immigrants. Moreover, our
   results indicate that contact with immigrants may moderate this effect.
   However, not all group settings are able to reduce the perceived threats
   in a similar way, and not all sorts of social contact are able to foster
   tolerance toward immigrants.},

Abstract = {Voter registration in the United States changed after the 2000 election
   with a requirement that states adopt statewide voter registries.
   However, these registries vary in design in practice, with some states
   having state managed ``top-down{''} registries and other states having
   more decentralized ``bottom-up{''} registries. I compare the effect of
   moving to a top-down registry with the adoption of Election Day
   registration - where voters can register to vote the day of the election
   - on voters saying that they are not registered because of election
   management problems or not voting because of a voter registration issue.
   EDR had a pronounced effect on reducing voter registration problems but
   the adoption of new voter registries had minimal effect on the same
   problems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The article aims to counter the criticism of the inability to derive
   falsifiable hypotheses from the Multiple Streams Framework (MSF). Based
   on a summary of the main aspects of the MSF, the article shows that this
   criticism is not justified. However, the development of hypotheses
   requires researchers to clearly indicate what they seek to explain. It
   is therefore necessary to distinguish between the following factors:
   first of all, the timing and direction of change, and second, the policy
   process that is to be analyzed. In order to be able to derive suitable
   hypotheses for the stage of policy formulation and decision, a second
   coupling process is introduced. Furthermore, the article demonstrates
   how the MSF can be combined with other theories of comparative public
   policy analysis and outlines how this has a favorable effect on the
   generation of hypotheses.},

Abstract = {Much of what makes Hayek so controversial can be found in The Road to
   Serfdom, the theoretical basis of which is provided by The
   Counter-Revolution of Science. The first book, a polemic against the
   planning mentality, did not defend complete laissez faire, but argued
   that planning disrupts the coordination between prices and supply and
   demand; that effective planning is thus impossible in a modern
   industrial society; that it is coercive; and, of course, that it leads
   to totalitarianism. In The Counter-Revolution of Science, Hayek argued
   that the planning mentality is the result of the hubristic attempt to
   reconstruct society along scientific lines. But the likes of Edward
   Bellamy envisioned a planned but free society, while John Dewey
   contrasted planning, where people collectively choose their goals,
   against a planned economy that is coercively imposed. Hayek's welcome
   strictures against a scientistic society and an overly ambitious social
   science aside, his binary approach to intellectual history distorted
   through oversimplification.},

Abstract = {In Australia, the extent of the priest-penitent privilege has received
   much attention recently due to the appointment of a Royal commission
   into institutional responses to child sexual abuse in 2012. At present,
   only five (5) Australian jurisdictions provide statutes for some form of
   privilege to protect certain types of communications between clerics and
   individuals. The other jurisdictions rely on case law where it is deemed
   that the priest-penitent privilege does not apply, but this belief is
   yet to be tested. In an attempt to abide by their religious laws, and
   depending on the their particular denomination, clerics may be entitled,
   not obliged to refuse divulging subject matter from religious
   confessions, even if a confession was made or not.},

Abstract = {Why have the third wave of democratisation and concurrent economic
   liberalisation, contrary to many expectations, failed to lower global
   corruption? This article comparatively assesses systemic corruption and
   other features of personal rule in Argentina, Venezuela, Indonesia, the
   Philippines, Kenya, and Zambia. It finds that systemic corruption in
   these countries persists despite political transitions and economic
   liberalisation, and that democratisation as the most important factor
   has not been ``deep{''} enough to decisively influence the level of
   corruption. Moreover, systemic corruption does not work in isolation but
   goes hand-in-hand with clientelism, another feature of personal rule.},

Abstract = {In his insightful intellectual history' of the modern Irish troubles,
   Richard Bourke, reflecting upon the fated implosion of William Craig's
   Vanguard Unionist Party, identified a set of meticulously crafted
   ambiguities' (Bourke (2003) Peace in Ireland: The War of Ideas, p. 227
   (London: Random House)) as crucial factors in that movement's abortive
   attempt to capture the political soul of Protestant Ulster. Through a
   close reading of Vanguard's ideological development, from its origins as
   a Unionist ginger group' through to its marginalisation from the
   authoritative centre of Unionist politics in September 1975, this essay
   sets out to recover a sense of that internal dissonance which, from the
   movement's inception in February 1972, threatened to undermine the
   cohesion of the Vanguard project. Though it was to be Craig's inability
   to reconcile a majority of his party's elite to the idea of Nationalist
   participation in government that would prove decisive in precipitating
   his political downfall, as this article will attempt to demonstrate, a
   conspicuous failure to address these so-called meticulously crafted
   ambiguities' and resolve the numerous internal contradictions of
   Vanguard's post-Unionist' ideology tended to underscore the
   improbability of its acting as a unifying locus for the realignment of
   populist forces within contemporary Unionism.},

Abstract = {The main discussion in this paper is to determine the Indonesia-Malaysia
   relations during the period before and after 1965 and its impact on
   bilateral and regional stability in the South East Asian region. The
   bilateral relations during the period before 1965 was coloured by the
   conflict and hostilities. The bilateral relations of both countries had
   changed after 1965 from conflict and hostilities to cooperation and
   harmonious. The changes of the bilateral relations were strongly related
   to the role played by the American and Indonesian pro-democratic
   leaders, Suharto and his supporters. The improvement of the bilateral
   relations between Indonesia and Malaysia after 1965 was due to the
   strong support by American power which had paved the way to the
   formation of ASEAN in August 1967. The changes in the bilateral
   relations between Indonesia and Malaysia have contributed to enhance
   regional stability in the Southeast Asian region.},

Abstract = {The Arab Spring, which brought an end to the authoritarian regimes in
   Tunisia, Egypt and Libya, was greeted with so much expectation,
   especially as it gave hope for the expansion of democracy.
   Unfortunately, however, the Arab Spring has only helped to bring about a
   period of political uncertainty in the affected countries and created
   the opportunity for political instability in the Sahel and Sub-Saharan
   Africa. The fragility of states in Africa with the attendant governance
   deficits have also created the platform for non-state armed actors to
   penetrate the Sahel and Sub-Saharan Africa, which ultimately impacts
   negatively on the region. This study, therefore, seeks to investigate
   the implication of the Arab Spring for peace and development in the
   Sahel and SubSaharan Africa.},

Title = {The story of a North Sea bubble: the strange demise of the Anglo-liberal

Journal = {EUROPEAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {5},
Number = {3},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In the wake of the deepest and longest recession that the United Kingdom
   has experienced since the 1930s and the Irish Republic has experienced
   since the 1980s, this paper examines the origins, sustenance, and
   puncturing of the growth dynamic both economies have enjoyed since the
   early 1990s. It identifies, in both cases, elements of an `Anglo-liberal
   growth model'. For as long as it lasted, this took the form of a
   consumer boom fuelled by growing private indebtedness (typically secured
   against property in a rising housing market) and was itself dependent on
   the nurturing and sustenance of a low inflation-low interest rate
   equilibrium. Of the two cases, it is the United Kingdom that presents
   the purer form of Anglo-liberal growth; in Ireland, a hybrid growth
   model can be seen to have developed in which Anglo-liberal growth was
   allied to a more conventional (and ultimately more sustainable)
   export-oriented growth dynamic. The paper seeks to gauge the character,
   paradigmatic significance, and effectiveness of the interventions made
   in the attempt to shore up the Anglo-liberal growth model and the rather
   different prospects for the resumption of growth in the years ahead. It
   argues that the Anglo-liberal growth model is, indeed, fatally flawed.
   In such a context, it is difficult to see how sustained economic growth
   can be restored, in the UK case, in the absence of a completely new
   growth model and, in the Irish case, without the cleansing of the
   long-standing export-oriented growth model of the Anglo-liberal
   trappings it has acquired in recent years.},

Title = {Measuring political protest in Western Europe: assessing cross-national
   equivalence},
Journal = {EUROPEAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},

Abstract = {This article tests the cross-national equivalence of the political
   protest scale, as developed by Barnes and Kaase, in 20 Western European
   countries using a battery of items included in the fourth wave of the
   European Values Study. The scale measuring the concept of political
   protest is widely used, but no evidence of cross-country equivalence has
   yet been provided in the literature. The article illustrates the concept
   of political protest, the relationship between concept formation,
   operationalization, and measurement equivalence, and the possible
   consequences of a lack of equivalence. It is argued that comparative
   research may be threatened by a lack of measurement equivalence. The
   spread of international surveys eases comparative designs, but at the
   same time enlarges the chances that we compare what is not actually
   comparable. The article then outlines an empirical strategy to assess
   the political protest scale's measurement equivalence. To assess
   cross-country equivalence, Mokken Scale Analysis, a nonparametric
   scaling method within the family of Item Response Theory models, is
   used. This has been shown to work better than Confirmatory Factor
   Analysis when dealing with dichotomous and polytomous items forming
   ordinal scales. The results show that the cross-country equivalence of
   the political protest scale depends on the type of measure the scholar
   wishes to build and use.},

Abstract = {Many political science subfields use classroom simulations. Public law,
   however, suffers from a lack of such activities. Many mock trials exist,
   but these games focus on jurisprudence and not on the more institutional
   aspects of the subfield. This article presents the Settlement Game, an
   original simulation that takes 15 minutes to complete and helps teach
   important institutional theories such as adversarial legalism,
   ``bargaining in the shadow of the law,{''} and ``haves{''} versus
   ``have-nots{''} concepts heretofore overlooked by the simulations
   literature. I introduce relevant theories and describe how the
   simulation works, discussing preclass assignments, its operation, and
   debriefing about its connection to theory. I close with comments about
   assessment of students and explain why the Settlement Game is useful.},

Abstract = {Many scholars argue that retrospective voting is a powerful information
   shortcut that offsets widespread voter ignorance. Even deeply ignorant
   voters, it is claimed, can effectively punish incumbents for bad
   performance and reward them if things go well. But if voters'
   understanding of which officials are responsible for which outcomes is
   systematically biased, retrospective voting becomes an independent
   source of political failure rather than a cure for it. We design and
   administer a new survey of the general public and political experts to
   test for such biases. Our analysis reveals frequent, large, robust
   biases in voter attributions of responsibility for a variety of
   political actors and outcomes with a tendency for the public to

   also exist.},

Abstract = {This article suggests that commodity exchange mediated through the
   money-form is a fundamental moment in the process of forming the
   capitalist relations of exploitation and domination. Money is
   re-examined as a moment of social power to command living labour,
   enforcing the moment of alienation that gives rise to the fundamental
   commodity within capitalism - labour-power. This article argues that
   this power is not intrinsic to money, but exists via a socially
   constructed scarcity mediated through the dynamics of working class
   reproduction. The article finally suggests that this understanding of
   money as the power to command labour can be identified in economic
   theory from mercantilism to the marginal revolution and beyond.},

Abstract = {The publication of a White Paper, Recall of MPs, and a draft Bill for
   pre-legislative scrutiny, by the UK Government in December 2011 was
   greeted with almost universal antipathy. In bringing forward the draft
   Bill Cabinet Office ministers declared their intention to trigger a
   debate on what would be the best model for a recall mechanism and they
   expressed a willingness to consider alternative models or even to
   contemplate adopting a completely different approach. Yet, they made it
   clear any such proposals must work within our unique constitutional
   framework and be suitable for our system of representative democracy.
   The objective of this article, therefore, is to do precisely what
   Cabinet Office ministers asked: to examine comparative experience and to
   apply lessons from that experience to the UKs unique constitutional
   framework. Three questions guide the analysis: first, what is the
   problem to be addressed in introducing recall?; secondly, what does
   comparative experience reveal about the operation of recall? and thirdly
   how unique is the UKs constitutional framework?.},

Abstract = {This article examines the politics of ``passive voice{''} in U.S.
   Supreme Court opinions. We first recast the phenomenon of passive voice
   as a matter of strategic writing and subject it to political analysis.
   We then argue that a productive relationship between active and passive
   writing is required by the conventions of legal legitimacy, particularly
   as it requires distance from politics. To illustrate the politics of
   passive legal writing, we examine passages from key Supreme Court
   opinions. Through this analysis, we advocate a perspective shift for
   reading the political dynamics of Supreme Court opinions.},

   Development Act of 1968 and the Liberal Turn to Public-Private
   Partnerships},
Journal = {STUDIES IN AMERICAN POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT},

Abstract = {President Lyndon Johnson declared the Housing and Urban Development Act
   of 1968 to be ``the most farsighted, the most comprehensive, the most
   massive housing program in all American history.{''} To replace every
   slum dwelling in the country within ten years, the act turned from
   public housing, the government-run program started in the 1930s, toward
   private-sector programs using both nonprofit and for-profit companies.
   As a result, since its passage, for-profit businesses have developed the
   great majority of low-income residences in the United States. The law
   also helped popularize the idea of ``public-private partnerships,{''}
   collaborations of government agencies and non-government
   entities-including for-profit companies-for social and urban
   improvements. Remarkably, political liberals supported the idea that
   private enterprise carry out social-welfare programs. This article
   examines the reasons that Democratic officials, liberals, and housing
   industry leaders united to create a decentralized, ideologically
   pluralistic, and redundant system for low-income housing. It shows that
   frustrations with the public housing program, the response to widespread
   violence in the nation's cities, and the popularity of corporate America
   pushed the turn toward the private sector. The changes in housing and
   urban policy made in the late 1960s, the article concludes, helped
   further distinguish the American welfare state and encourage the rise of
   neoliberalism in the United States.},

Abstract = {An emerging pattern of governance in contemporary liberal democratic
   welfare states is a move away from interest group representation and a
   public sphere organized around demands for extensions of rights to
   something much more constrained. This article asks how such a profound
   shift in representation has occurred through governance spaces that are
   co-constructed by community organizations. It examines the case of
   Canadian immigrant settlement where beliefs about citizen
   representation, the role of the state and the nature of the public
   sphere have undergone profound change, leaving immigrant organizations
   as either marginal players or fully incorporated in state sanctioned
   immigrant service provision. Drawing on documentary evidence and
   interviews with immigrant organizations and public officials in Ottawa,
   it shows how immigrant organizations have actively interpreted their
   interests in the light of this changing web of beliefs to co-construct a
   new policy regime that favours organizational interests over citizen
   participation.},

Abstract = {European Muslim communities' views on foreign policy constitute a
   growing topic of research. This article presents a case study of the
   status of the Palestinian issue in France and focuses on one particular
   actor, namely the Union of Islamic Organizations of France (UOIF). The
   content analysis of several documents and press releases issued by the
   UOIF aims at characterizing how the UOIF frames the conflict and
   mobilizes on the issue. Then, the analysis replaces a range of actors,
   including the UOIF, in the context of the Israeli operation in Gaza,
   which took place between 27 December 2008 and 17 January 2009. The
   examination of press archives is meant to characterize different actors'
   behaviors, narratives and reactions to the crisis.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses government approval in Italy - which has become a
   key aspect for electoral support in the new party system of the Second
   Republic - exploring the influence that TV coverage exerts on approval
   net of traditional accounts of government support. Relying on both
   aggregate time series and pooled individual-level surveys analyses, it
   is shown that communication has a sizable impact on government approval.
   The popularity of Centre-Left and Centre-Right governments is affected
   evenly by the economy but differently by the news coverage of their
   activity. People with lower political interest are the most reactive to
   news coverage of government performance. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Degressive proportionality constitutes the main conceptual criterion to
   determine the composition of the European Parliament (EP). In reality,
   however, this concept entails serious practical problems as exemplified
   by the current distribution of seats in the EP. This article takes up
   the call and presents a new method for a better balanced seat allocation
   in the EP after the 2014 elections. Comparing with recent methods in the
   field, our results reveal that the method proposed yields a more
   balanced and juster parliamentary seat distribution among all European
   member states by joining the strengths of the existing methods and
   avoiding their weaknesses. In light of upcoming rounds of enlargement
   and possible amendments to the EP's internal rules of procedure and
   existing EU Treaties, we contend that our results are not only of
   interest to the academic world.},

Title = {Voter perceptions of agenda power and attribution of responsibility for
   economic performance},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {32},
Number = {3},
Pages = {512-516},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In two recent experiments (one in the lab and one over the internet)
   concerning collective decision making we determined that individuals
   mainly assign responsibility to the decision maker with agenda power and
   with the largest vote share (Duch et al., 2012). We found rather weak
   evidence that responsibility is assigned to decision makers with veto
   power or allocated proportional to weighted voting power. Our conjecture
   then is that individuals in our online experiment who recognized the
   importance of proposal power in the embedded experiment will be those
   more likely to exercise an economic vote for the Conservative PM Party
   (since they are the agenda setter in the governing coalition) and for
   the opposition Labour Party. The conjecture is confirmed. Essentially,
   the data show that economic voting at the individual level is confined
   to individuals who understand the value of proposal power. This in turn
   suggests that the economic vote itself is motivated by a coherent
   attempt to punish or reward parties that actually deserve it in the
   specific sense that they were mostly responsible for choosing the
   policies that were implemented. Further, the strong reliance on proposal
   power as the workhorse of this mechanism of accountability, tells us
   that simple heuristics can do a lot of the work that cold rationality
   and complex calculation have done in much of the previous discussion of
   economic voting. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {Foucault's concept of governmentality, and its attending modalities of
   biopower and disciplinary technologies, provides a useful conceptual
   schema for the analysis of the role of religious and quasi-religious
   institutions in contemporary society. This is particularly important in
   the study of those neoliberal democratic states where religious
   organizations constitute an important presence in the civil society. As
   religion is thoroughly involved in the reproduction of social structure
   in most societies, an appraisal of the social and political importance
   of religious institutions is needed to understand the articulation and
   exercise of governmentality. This is not just limited to partnerships
   between state agencies and faithbased organizations in providing for
   social services, but also in rituals and other religious group
   activities of these organizations that play a vital role in shaping and
   molding the social and political subjectivities of the adherents. We
   argue that synergy between the scholarship on governmentality, and
   sociology of religion would allow for a more nuanced understanding of
   the politics and culture of post-secular societies.},

Title = {Conclusions: Switzerland as a paradigmatic case of small-state peace
   policy?},

Abstract = {This concluding article looks at the findings of the special issue
   through the lens of the Swiss experience. It traces the development of
   Swiss peace promotion activities, emphasising the emergence of a fully
   institutionalized peace policy since the end of the Cold War. Drawing on
   role theory, it makes sense of this process by referring to changes in
   the structure of the international system, altered role expectations by
   external actors, as well as internal processes of role contestation. In
   comparison to other small states, the article argues that Switzerland
   can be seen as a paradigmatic case on some levels. Notably, Switzerland
   extended its peace promotion activities as part of a niche foreign
   policy, which emerged in response to the post-Cold War world order as
   well as a change in dominant foreign policy role conceptions. At the
   same time, there are a number of idiosyncrasies: Switzerland as a
   non-member of EU and NATO enjoys a higher degree of autonomy in crafting
   its peace policy and its peace promotion activities remain largely
   focused on civilian instruments.},

Abstract = {Despite being one of Europe's most significant destinations for
   migration, Germany has long wrestled with the notion that it may or may
   not be a country of immigration'. Approaching this question from a
   positive rather than a normative perspective, this article explores how
   Germany is changing in this respect, by examining changes over the past
   two decades in terms of migration flows, the policy framework and the
   degree of societal and institutional adaptation to migration. It argues
   that Germany has become much more diverse and also notes the major
   policy developments that have taken place after the change of government
   in 1998. While the dominant theme of migration policy has moved on from
   prevention to integration, Germany's impending demographic
   transformation poses a major new challenge, which will require
   governments to look once again to more active recruitment of labour
   migration.},

Abstract = {The theory of bounded rationality regards rational policy making as a
   process which fulfils certain requirements with regard to agenda
   setting, fact finding and analysis and decision making which fulfils
   minimum requirements. This perspective is here applied to the
   preparatory stage of public policy in four states, i.e. Iceland and the
   three Scandinavian states. An interesting pattern emerges. With regard
   to agenda setting Iceland deviates from the other countries in that
   coordination and the setting of priorities is less the responsibility of
   the cabinet and more that of individual ministers and parliament. The
   development and analysis of policy alternatives is also less systematic
   in Iceland as may be seen among other things in a smaller volume of
   research. The premises on which policy is based are therefore generally
   not as clear as in the other cases. At the decision stage departures
   from the conclusions reached during the preparatory phase are much more
   common in Iceland than in the other states. The main conclusion is that
   policy making in Iceland deviates more from the premises of the theory
   of bounded rationality than in Scandinavia.},

Abstract = {This article employs a largely feminist-institutional framework to
   explore the effects of the single transferable vote (STV) on women's
   representation in Ireland. Considering the 2011 elections, the research
   finds a mismatch' between formal and informal factors in influencing
   female candidacy and seat-holding in Dail Eireann and the Northern
   Ireland Legislative Assembly. While the workings of STV are mostly
   women-friendly', at least in comparison with a single-seat system,
   political parties well placed to win multiple constituency seats are
   slow to recruit female candidates in reasonable numbers. Conservative
   party norms, systems of party competition and voter preferences for
   incumbency all act to suppress the election of more women Teachtai Dala
   and Members of the Legislative Assembly. The key to achieving a critical
   mass' across the island lies in reforming internal party selection
   processes to accommodate better equality between the sexes.},

Abstract = {Direct protest actions by Indigenous peoples in Canada have rarely
   yielded the specific gains that were targeted. In the aftermath of
   conflict, Canadian governments have typically proven to be intransigent.
   An exception to this general tendency is the Anishinabek occupation of
   Ipperwash Provincial Park, which began in 1995. In 2007, the government
   of Ontario agreed to return the parkland to the First Nation, making it
   an unusually successful instance of direct action. It is argued here
   that this outcome can best be explained by drawing on the ``symbolic
   politics{''} theory of intergroup conflict. The Ipperwash inquiry,
   acting as a post-conflict truth commission, generated a micro-narrative
   shared by both groups, which altered the political incentive structure
   and enabled the outlier accommodative outcome.},

Abstract = {Vertical integration is an important concept for political parties. In
   multi-level or federal contexts, it is said to affect party strength,
   national integration and federal stability. Despite this, difficulties
   with the conceptualization and operationalization of vertical
   integration and a lack of cross-national data impede research. This
   article clarifies the concept of vertical integration, distinguishing it
   from related concepts of strength, centralization and autonomy and
   distinguishing the indicators of integration from the effects of
   integration. It introduces the measures of vertical integration and
   autonomy used in the Party Organization in Multi-Level Systems (POMLS)
   dataset comprising data from survey responses from 204 state-level
   parties in eight countries. The data confirm the theoretical
   distinctions among forms of vertical integration and between vertical
   integration and autonomy and show that not all forms of vertical
   integration are mutually reinforcing.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes ministerial profiles and the relation between
   expertise and type of ministry for the case of the four Concertacion de
   Partidos por la Democracia administrations in Chile between 1990 and
   2010. The objective is to improve empirical knowledge about these topics
   relating two different literatures: the one developed for the study of
   ministerial elites and the other related to technocratic studies. The
   argument is that there is a relationship between type of ministry
   (political, social, economic or mixed) and the expertise (formal
   education) of ministries. Statistical analysis confirms our hypothesis;
   there is a relation between doctoral formation in economics and the
   ministries defined as economic ones.},

Abstract = {Over nearly two years, between 2010 and 2011, we did anthropological
   fieldwork in various police dependences in the city of Rosario, wich
   belongs to the Police's Regional Unit N degrees 2 in the province of
   Santa Fe. There, in addition to observations, we interviewed police
   officers stationed in its two main groupings: ``Comando
   Radioelectrico{''} and ``comisarias{''}. Based on ethnographic material
   produced during that period and numerous parallel interviews with
   relatives of victims of police violence, in this article in particular
   we propose to reflect on the many meanings of citizenship that are
   expressed in a context marked by police practices that assume a
   territorial and discretional character.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {12},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {271-287},

Abstract = {The article will argue that, despite Will Kymlicka's claims to the
   contrary, the concept of `multicultural toleration' implicitly entails
   an essentialist concept of groups, which amounts to holding a negative
   `permission', power-loaded conception of toleration and not a positive
   liberal `respect' conception. This seems contradictory to the general
   goal of Kymlicka's multiculturalism. This article will then argue that
   multicultural toleration is not a satisfactory concept, neither from a
   conceptual point of view (it is incoherent) nor from a practical point
   of view (it disregards important aspects of political life).
   Nonetheless, multiculturalism poses the question of toleration at the
   correct level of group relations. This article will try to sustain the
   double requirement of, on one hand, trying to place toleration in a
   collective frame and, on the other, refusing the essentialist concept of
   groups used by multiculturalism. The way out of this difficulty can be
   found in a critical `non-domination' conception of toleration.},

Abstract = {The past few years have seen the advent and proliferation of Voting
   Advice (or Aid) Applications (VAAs), which offer voting advice on the
   basis of calculating the ideological congruence between citizens and
   political actors. Although VAA data have often been used to test many
   empirical questions regarding voting behaviour and political
   participation, we know little about the approaches used by VAAs to
   estimate the positions of political parties. This article presents the
   most common aspects of the VAA approach and examines some methodological
   issues regarding the phrasing of statements, the format of response
   scales, the reliability of coding statements into response scales and
   the reliability and validity of scaling items into dimensions. The
   article argues that VAAs have a lot of potential but there is also much
   space for methodological improvements, and therefore concludes with some
   recommendations for designing VAAs.},

Abstract = {Understanding how Thucydides and Kant contribute to the theorization of
   international politics is of more than historical interest. Kant is the
   most important resource for political theorists who envisage the
   reconstruction of international political institutions along
   constitutionally democratic lines. Yet this broadly Kantian perspective
   is challenged by critics who underscore the hostile and dangerous
   character of the world and who often use Thucydides' History as a
   counter-Kantian resource. In this article, I by to set their
   perspectives in conversation and move the discussion beyond a simple
   restaging of the quarrel between morality and power. I suggest that
   Thucydides represents politics in a way that is both demanded and
   frustrated by Kant's perspective. At the same time, Kant's project
   requires us to ask whether Thucydides' framework is too accommodating of
   political necessity, and whether the History is too dismissive of
   possibilities for political improvement.},

Abstract = {The main aim of this work is to show the relevance of political factors
   in the judicial enforcement of EU law by the Spanish Supreme Court. For
   that purpose we use original empirical evidence gathered from Supreme
   Court's decisions on EU law. The study finds to what extent the Spanish
   high court is concerned about the position and pledges of political
   institutions when assessing EU law application. That consideration is
   determined by the necessity of compliance of political institutions with
   its decisions. Nevertheless, the results show how the Supreme Court is
   less affected by the position and reservations alleged by political
   actors when it is able to legitimize and support the enforcement of EU
   law with decisions taken by the European Court of Justice.},

Abstract = {Almost all institutions within modern democracies depend on a mix of
   communication and competition. However, most formal theory and
   experimental evidence ignores one of these two features. We present a
   formal theory of communicative competition in which senders vary in
   their aversion to lying, and test hypotheses from this theory using a
   strategic communication experiment. To influence lying aversion, we
   compare a Context Condition, in which pre-play instructions are cast in
   political language, with a Baseline Condition, in which all language is
   abstract. We find that in early rounds of play, subjects in the Context
   Condition exaggerated more as a function of their biases than those in
   the Baseline Condition when we control for the past history of play.
   However, by the last round of play, subjects in both conditions
   converged on persistent exaggeration. This finding indicates that
   competition crowds outlying aversion in settings of strategic
   communication.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes how politics influences Latin American and
   Caribbean income inequality. Most studies view the distributional
   process in two phases with inequality shaped first by markets and then
   by state redistribution. Typically, cross-national analyses of
   inequality limit the influence of politics to the redistributive phase.
   But we argue that a full understanding of how government affects
   inequality must also consider how politics shapes the market. While
   redistribution is undoubtedly an important mechanism employed by
   government to influence distributional outcomes, we find that inequality
   produced by the market is more responsive to politics than is
   redistribution. Left partisan power and public investment in human
   capital significantly reduce inequality in the market phase. In
   addition, social spending on human capital conditions the effect of
   economic growth. As human capital investment increases, growth becomes
   more equality enhancing, providing further evidence of the market
   conditioning effect of policy.},

Abstract = {Does the removal of salient external threats foster democratization?
   Recent research proposes an affirmative answer but either fails to
   examine democratization at the monadic level, to consider small-scale
   democratization, or to account for factors known to influence the
   democratization process. The current study addresses this deficit by
   (re)examining democratization during the period 1919-2006. The findings
   suggest a strong relationship between border settlement and
   democratization. A state that settles all of its interstate borders
   democratizes; any outstanding unsettled borders, however, prevent
   significant democratization. Furthermore, although border settlement
   contributes to democratization, it does not significantly affect
   democratic regime change. This empirical evidence cumulatively specifies
   a more precise relationship between external threat and democratization
   than previous work and thereby contributes directly to the recent debate
   between the territorial and democratic peace theories. It also suggests
   that democratization may proceed more readily if states address
   unsettled borders first.},

Abstract = {The variance in electoral magnitude and in district malapportionment is
   relevant to understand the political consequences of the spanish
   electoral system. This paper proposes a threefold classification of
   districts into subsystems and validates it by its diverging results in
   fractionalization and proportionality. The inequality of electoral
   magnitudes places a special overrepresentation bonus on certain parties;
   and the same happens with malapportionment. Both things accumulate into
   a geographical electoral price which results in a conservative bias.},

Abstract = {The style of writing in international relations (IR) has evolved in
   recent decades. The lessons of ``vintage{''} IR, to which we return in
   this article, have been largely forgotten by those writing in the
   discipline today. A merit will be substantial, we argue, in drawing more
   heavily from works by previous masters. Several lessons in style follow.},

Abstract = {The discourse of development has been linked to political, economic and
   social change of the last 70 years. With the appearing of Information
   and Communication Technologies, the number of perceptions of an ideal
   way of development has increased, which are now directly linked to the
   interest of sustainability and the advertising of democracy. Development
   continues, and will continue, to be the ideological paradigm to suggest
   the public policies around the world, ignoring all the so-called
   democratic models, as it is evidenced by history. It is a concept
   dependent on the power, interests and socio-political behavioral
   premises, which are as wide as the available languages to interpret such
   a concept.},

Abstract = {Bill committees have long been a fundamental feature of legislative
   scrutiny in the British House of Commons. The recent introduction of
   oral evidence sessions as a standard bill committee procedure has
   further underlined their importance.(1) Yet despite their prominence in
   parliamentary life, bill committees have been somewhat under-studied. A
   comparison of bill committee activity in the first decade of the
   twenty-first century with the last comprehensive examination undertaken
   in 1974 shows that significant changes have taken place; bill committees
   appear to be working harder than ever before but this is not reflected
   in terms of the relative impact they are making on government
   legislation.},

Title = {The role of political trust in conditioning perceptions of corruption},
Journal = {EUROPEAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {5},
Number = {2},
Pages = {175-195},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Political trust and corruption have both elicited considerable academic
   and popular commentary in recent years. Much attention has been focused
   on the extent to which corruption has contributed to citizens'
   increasing distrust of their politicians. But little attention has been
   paid to the possibility that distrust may condition responses to alleged
   corruption, and no work has hitherto demonstrated the veracity of this
   relationship in a mature democracy. Drawing on data from the United
   Kingdom, this paper finds that less trusting individuals are
   consistently more censorious of politicians' misbehaviour and more
   likely to perceive the presence of corruption than are their more
   trusting peers. The paper further demonstrates that people who are less
   trusting become relatively more critical ( compared with the more
   trusting) as the generally perceived corruptness of a certain scenario
   declines. It also demonstrates how trust increases in importance as a
   predictor of ethical judgements when behaviour is generally reckoned to
   be less corrupt. Further analysis suggests that this effect is partly
   connected to uncertainty. Less obviously corrupt acts are associated
   with higher levels of uncertainty, which appears to open up a space for
   trust to play an even more significant role in shaping individual's
   judgements of politicians' behaviour.},

Abstract = {This article presents a framework for analysing party-organisational
   culture, with a special focus on the elite level. The framework is based
   on an interpretation of Mary Douglas' Grid/Group model, and is
   empirically supported by an extensive study of the seven party groups in
   the Swedish parliament. The model identifies two fundamental cultural
   dimensions: the level of submission by individual group members to the
   group as a collectivity; and the principle that dictates the
   distribution of status and prestige within the party (a distribution
   here correlating with views on knowledge). The study shows that the
   parties distribute themselves on the cultural map in ways that do not
   coincide in any straightforward way with other well-known variables of
   party politics, such as ideology, origin or size. The methodological
   innovations presented in this article pave the way for a new framework
   for analysing party politics in which hitherto neglected aspects of
   party organisation are highlighted.},

Abstract = {Australia has an unusual history with regards to the legalisation of
   voluntary euthanasia and assisted suicide. The first people to die
   through legalised physician aid in dying did so in the Northern
   Territory under the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act which was passed in
   1995. However, after intervention by the federal government, no
   territories in Australia are allowed to pass legislation legalising
   voluntary euthanasia or assisted suicide. No states have since succeeded
   in passing any acts either, despite a high level of public support for
   these end of life options. This paper looks at the process by which
   other jurisdictions have legalised either voluntary euthanasia or
   assisted suicide, to help understand the current Australian situation.},

Abstract = {Germany's CDU encapsulates the core dilemma facing all of continental
   European Christian Democracy. The religiously based brand of welfare
   capitalism that traditionally set these parties apart is being
   undermined by broad socio-economic and political trends. Yet resulting
   pressures to shift towards neoliberalism have run up against public
   ambivalence, partisan competition, and - above all - a consensual
   dynamic within Christian Democratic factionalism. In the CDU's case,
   cross-cutting external pressures on its social market model have
   undercut a long dominant internal factional coalition, which has made
   way for shifting, ad hoc internal alliances under a leadership only
   vaguely committed to the classic Christian Democratic welfare state, yet
   leery of fully abandoning it. Since 2000 the CDU has thus lurched
   towards neoliberalism, pulled back, and even embraced some social
   democratic recipes. This article examines this programmatic and policy
   experimentation in order to help assess whether Christian Democracy in
   Germany (and beyond) remains a distinct force, or is instead
   degenerating into mere opportunistic centrism.},

Abstract = {If one accepts the case for descriptive representation and the politics
   of presence - as so much of contemporary political discourse does - then
   the question of which groups deserve, or require, descriptive
   representation is far from trivial. Britain is a good case study for a
   discussion of this issue, both because the debate there is a politically
   live one and because that debate is increasingly diverse in terms of the
   range of characteristics it covers. This article examines the relative
   importance to Britons of a range of potential identities. It shows,
   first, that the public's concerns about descriptive representation
   operate at the collective level, not the individual, but, second, that
   this does not stop them wanting to see a more diverse parliament, across
   a range of different characteristics. However, third, the
   representational characteristics that matter most to the public are not
   the same ones that much of the academic literature has focussed on.
   Fourth, although there is some self-identification - with people
   disproportionately wanting more people `like them' - this desire was
   especially strong within certain groups - most notably among the Muslim,
   Asian, Black and gay and lesbian respondents. And fifth, views on the
   desirability of increased or decreased representation appear, to some
   extent, to be based on a lack of knowledge, with the study revealing
   large-scale ignorance about the composition of the British House of
   Commons.},

Abstract = {What effect does moving to all-mail elections have on participation? On
   one hand, all registered voters automatically receive a ballot to return
   by mail at their convenience. On the other hand, the social aspect of
   the polling place, and the focal point of election day, is lost. Current
   estimates of the effect of all-mail elections on turnout are ambiguous.
   This article offers an improved design and new estimates of the effect
   of moving to all-mail elections. Exploiting cross-sectional and temporal
   variation in county-level implementation of all-mail elections in
   Washington State, we find that the reform increased aggregate
   participation by two to four percentage points. Using individual
   observations from the state voter file, we also find that the reform
   increased turnout more for lower-participating registrants than for
   frequent voters, suggesting that all-mail voting reduces turnout
   disparities between these groups.},

Abstract = {Despite the UK trade union movement's avowedly secular nature, its
   antecedents show that religious beliefs greatly influenced many early
   trade unionists and, in some cases, contributed to the formation of a
   trade union consciousness. This paper considers the way trade union
   leaders in the 19th and 20th centuries drew upon religious teachings of
   social justice to organise their fellow workers. This context provides
   background for understanding how today a similar ideological commitment
   to collectivisation and social justice may be held by workers of faith;
   and how the adoption of a `militant secularism' by some trade unionists
   may result in the closing of these conceptual spaces.},

Abstract = {This article examines the unintended consequences of the 1975 Helsinki
   Final Act - a political agreement among the 35 participating states in
   the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). The primary
   objective of this article is to explain the unintended consequences of
   the CSCE security regime in terms of path emergence. `Path emergence' is
   presented as a conceptual apparatus to explain the emergent properties
   exhibited within a complex adaptive system. The path emergence theory
   highlights four explanatory metaphors: morphogenetic fields,
   self-organized criticality, social resonance, and co-evolution. These
   metaphors serve as conceptual linchpins for the case analysis of the
   unintended consequences of the CSCE security regime. This article
   suggests that the CSCE embedded within it the properties of path
   emergence, which in turn contributed to the end of the Cold War in
   Europe.},

Abstract = {In this article, I attempt to construct a normative framework of Korean
   multiculturalism in the Confucian public-societal context of Korean
   democracy by focusing on the political implications of the claim to
   cultural rights (so-called logic' of multiculturalism) and cultural
   pluralism that it is likely to entail for Korean democracy. After
   examining the logic of multiculturalism that often puts multiculturalism
   in tension with liberal democracy, I turn to Will Kymlicka's account of
   immigrant multiculturalism that resolves the potential tension between
   multiculturalism and liberal democracy in a liberal way. Then, I
   construct a normative framework of Korean multiculturalism in a way that
   a decent multicultural society can be established on the same
   public-cultural ground on which Korean democracy has matured in the past
   two decades.},

Abstract = {In this article, a comparative analysis is presented of two ethnographic
   case studies on mothering practices in Belgium. Interviews with, and
   participant observation among, both undocumented migrant mothers from
   the South and Belgian white adoptive mothers of black Ethiopian-born
   children provide an insight into the way in which mothering plays an
   important role in the pursuit of citizenship. In our analysis, we draw
   on critical theorizations of citizenship from feminist, multicultural
   and globalization perspectives, and of care, intimacy and the affective
   in order to show how mothering can be viewed as a citizenship practice
   that transcends boundaries of the private, public and the nation. In
   their carework' and culturework', both undocumented migrant and white
   adoptive mothers negotiate prevalent ideologies of mothering that are
   often exclusionary of their own and their children's sense of identity
   and belonging. Their mothering involves building new networks and
   strengthening their children's identities in culturally creative ways.
   We argue that although these mothering practices are embedded in a
   multiplicity of intersecting privileges and inequalities, within
   restraints imposed by the nation-state context, this carework attests to
   the agentic capacity of mothering and its potential to affect politics
   of inclusion, recognition and changing hegemonic understandings of
   citizenship and belonging.},

Abstract = {Agonistic theories of democratic practice lack an explicit model for
   ethical cultivation. Even as these theorists advocate sensibilities of
   ``ethical open-ness and receptivity,{''} so as to engage in the
   political work of `` maintenance, repair, and amendment,{''} they lack
   an account of how individuals ought be motivated to this task or how it
   should unfold. Toward theorizing such a model, I turn to Freud and
   clinical psychoanalytic practice. I argue that Freud's
   ``second-education{''} (Nacherziehung) offers an ethical cultivation
   framed around a ``combative collaboration{''} between analyst and
   patient that teaches tolerance of discomfort; endurance of uncertainty;
   and narrative capacity. This second-education suggests two lessons for
   politics. First, that we might do well to reproduce its relational form
   more broadly across politics. And second, that we cultivate those
   ``sacral spaces{''} capable of challenging the conditions for symbolic
   meaning as it stretches between personal and collective practices.},

Abstract = {This commentary tries to study the current socio-economic crisis in
   Spain and the end of the political era which began with transition to
   democracy in the second half of the 1970s. Following pages deal with the
   intense rise of the unemployment rate and the social drama caused by the
   increase of material inequalities in Spain. It also analyzes the
   political crisis that threatens to destroy the institutional model which
   was crafted after 40 years of harsh dictatorship. All these factors are
   provoking political suspicion and social despair among some sectors of
   Spanish society. But there are not only feelings of disappointment and
   defeat in Spain. The large-scale protests that have engulfed the country
   over the last two years represent a powerful social force for grass-root
   democratic regeneration in this part of the Iberian Peninsula.},

Title = {Governing as gardening: reflections on soft authoritarianism in

Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {17},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {339-352},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {The idea of soft authoritarianism', as a general description of many
   Asian societies, can be defined as a political system in which there are
   minimal components of democracy such as elections and political parties
   but, as a consequence of rapid modernisation, state control of the
   economy and an emphasis on export-driven growth, basic social and
   political rights are often compromised. Typically, these states govern
   in the name of constitutionalism but often use the law to suppress
   political activity on the part of citizens. These societies have often
   replaced the rule of law with neo-Confucian rule of virtue in which the
   duties of the citizen to the state are more important than the
   responsibilities of the state towards the citizen. In these
   authoritarian polities, the state constructs an educational system to
   discipline the electorate rather than to create an informed citizenry,
   simply because there is low trust between leaders and electorate. The
   duty of the passive citizen is merely to consent to the legitimacy of
   the regime; the duty of the state is to provide security by weeding out
   citizens who are troublesome. We argue that Singapore has, until the
   recent election in 2011, been the classic illustration of soft
   authoritarianism, but we conclude by asking whether Singapore is moving
   from governance based on a gardening metaphor of weeding out bad
   influences to a more mature and open democracy.},

Abstract = {In all human affairs, there has been established the need for a
   generally acceptable code of conduct and procedure in the administration
   of justice, civil or criminal which must be seriously observed by all in
   relationships with fellow human beings. This is particularly applicable
   to those who are saddled with the sacred responsibility of steering the
   ship of the State. In this wise, the place of natural justice is pivotal
   and has deservedly been elevated to the realm of great importance by all
   civilized communities. This article traces the origin of Natural Justice
   and discusses the two basic ideas in which Natural Justice is embodied
   i.e. audi alterem partem and nemo judex in causa sua. It also discusses
   the doctrine of Natural Justice under the Civil and Military rule in
   Nigeria and some other jurisdictions. The Article concluded by
   identifying some problems associated with the enforcement of Natural
   Justice and made recommendations.},

Abstract = {The EU's eastern neighbourhood with its considerable divergence in
   regime types is a more challenging testing ground for democracy
   promotion than Central and Eastern Europe. This article explores the
   diversity of the international linkages in the eastern neighbours
   (Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan) and the role these
   linkages play in domestic politics. International linkages are filtered
   and activated by domestic politics. If diverse linkages reinforce
   domestic political competition, they can contribute to the creation of
   democratic openings. Conversely, in the absence of domestic political
   competition, international linkages can insulate a regime from internal
   pressures for reform, in particular if the linkages are deep and
   undiversified. This article focuses on one causal mechanism, namely
   stateness issues acting as a filter for international linkages.},

   change occurred in October 2008, when as a response to the EU's sharp
   criticism of the Kremlin over the Georgian-Russian military conflict,
   Russia decided to re-orient its foreign economic and trade policy from
   the EU to China and partially also to India. At the same time
   Russian-Chinese military and energy cooperation started to grow. Russia
   sold China oil and gas at low price and supplied it with advanced
   weaponry, which has increased China's aggression toward its neighbours.
   Russia also started to politically and militarily support China's
   activities in Syria and Iran, which, in turn, worsened Russia's
   relations with several EU Member States, including Germany, France and
   Italy, with whom Russia was planning to cooperate in the developing of
   the Nord Stream gas pipeline project. However, Russian President
   Vladimir Putin still declares a great continuing friendship and
   solidarity with China and is hoping to see the worsening of China's
   conflict with the US, which, Putin claims, could avert China's direct
   conflict with Russia. Several leading Russian military and political
   experts describe this hope as unrealistic. At the same time, the volume
   of EU-Russian mutual trade was almost 395 billion US dollars in 2011,
   which exceeds in volume the Chinese-Russian trade volume by more than
   four times. It shows that Russia's trade reset from the EU to China has
   been negligible. Also, it is bad news for Russia and China that Iran
   today stifles cooperation with Georgia and Chinese separatist Uyghurs,
   and Syrian Bashar al-Assad's regime is developing cooperation with al
   Qaeda, and does not explain Russia's and China's current similar foreign
   policy toward Iran and Syria.},

Abstract = {This article analyses to what extent and why national parliaments have
   created oversight institutions to adapt to European integration.
   Employing data from 22 member states from 1984-2006, the analysis
   suggests that government-supporting parliamentary groups create
   oversight institutions to enhance policy participation as integration
   becomes more important. Moreover, parliamentarians improve their access
   to information about government policy if governing parties are
   internally divided over European integration. Finally, oversight
   institutions that constrain the government's discretion to act in
   European Union affairs exist in Eurosceptic countries, where they help
   parliamentarians to enhance electoral security.},

Abstract = {This article will present the impact that political theory has made and
   the opportunities for future contributions. It will consider the
   contributions made by leading political theorists to policy debates, the
   lessons learned from their successes, and how political theorists might
   further pursue existing and new opportunities to develop impact. The
   discussion will close with consideration of several potential threats
   that theorists should become more aware of in order to best avoid them.
   The growing importance of impact in British higher education policy
   represents important challenges that may help promote the field of
   political theory. Political theorists should welcome these developments.},

Title = {When good news is scarce and bad news is good: Government
   responsibilities and opposition possibilities in political
   agenda-setting},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {52},
Number = {3},
Pages = {364-389},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Recent studies have drawn attention to the political contingencies of
   the media's political agenda-setting influence, finding, for instance,
   that issues from the media agenda are more likely to attract attention
   if a party enjoys ownership of the issue. Supplementing the debate on
   why political parties respond to news, it is argued in this article that
   ownership is only part of the picture and that policy responsibility,
   together with news tone, constitutes a stronger explanation of news
   politicisation. Opposition parties respond to bad news because they
   reflect negative developments in social problems for which the
   government could be held responsible. The government responds to good
   news that reflects positive developments in social problems because this
   could politicise policy success, but is also forced to react when news
   explicitly address government responsibility and thereby threatens its
   image as responsive and competent. Furthermore, it is shown that news
   tone and policy responsibility condition the incentive to politicise
   owned issues from the media agenda. Thus, opposition parties will not
   politicise owned issues when news is good because this could draw
   attention to government success, while government is unable and
   unwilling to prioritise owned issues when news is bad and instead is
   likely to make use of its ownership strengths when news is good and the
   pressure to respond is low. The arguments are tested on a large-N sample
   of radio news stories from Denmark (20032004). Opposition response is
   measured through parliamentary questions spurred by the news stories,
   while government response is indicated by references to these stories in
   the prime minister's weekly press meeting. Results confirm the
   expectations, suggesting that parties care more about the tone of news
   stories and the type of attention they might produce, rather than what
   type of issues they could serve to politicise.},

Abstract = {In an era of increased secularism and religious diversity, the historic

   Anglican religious practices of the UK Parliament and the monarchy.
   Since devolution in 1999 the elected parliament and assemblies in
   Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have developed alternative, but
   still strictly controlled solutions to the inherent tensions between the
   spheres of the state and religionua multi-faith Time for Reflection in
   Scotland, secular norms with secondary recognition of diverse religion
   in Wales and silent contemplation in Northern Ireland. Each set of
   rituals symbolically express power relationships and divergent national
   self-understandings of the relationships between religions and
   parliaments and resolve inherent tensions between the two. The newer
   ones also now provide models for possible future change at Westminster
   even though current arrangements there seem deeply embedded.},

Abstract = {In Angola in the spring of 1988 the armed forces of apartheid South
   Africa and the US-backed mercenaries of Jonas Savimbi were defeated by
   the combined force of the Cuban military, the Angolan army, and the
   military units of the liberation movements of South Africa and Namibia.
   This led directly to the independence of Namibia and then to the fall of
   the apartheid regime in South Africa itself. Cuba's heroic role is the
   outstanding example of principled anti-imperialist internationalism in
   the last decades of the twentieth century.
   We celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of these events by reprinting
   the account by Horace Campbell that appeared in Monthly Review in April
   1989, with some pride at having published so sharp an analysis of
   current events-events largely ignored by the mass media then and since.
   We then present a military-focused historical analysis by Monthly Review
   Press author Ronnie Kasrils, who had the extraordinary fate to have
   headed ANC military intelligence in the battle alongside the Cubans, and
   then to have served for five years as Deputy Minister of Defense in the
   post-apartheid South African government-in regular contact with officers
   who had commanded the opposing forces. -The Editors},

Abstract = {Political campaigns increasingly micro-target. Given detailed knowledge
   of voters' identities, campaigns try to persuade voters by pandering to
   these identities. Through multiple survey experiments, we examine the
   persuasiveness of group-directed pandering. We ask: Do group members
   respond more favorably to appeals geared to them, or do they prefer
   broad-based appeals? Do voters not in a group penalize candidates who
   appeal to a group? Answers to these questions help us grapple with the
   evolving relationship between voters and candidates in a rapidly
   changing information environment. Our results suggest that voters rarely
   prefer targeted pandering to general messages and that ``mistargeted{''}
   voters penalize candidates enough to erase the positive returns to
   targeting. Theoretically, targeting may allow candidates to quietly
   promise particularistic benefits to narrow audiences, thereby altering
   the nature of political representation, but voters seem to prefer being
   solicited based on broad principles and collective benefits.},

Abstract = {Universal human rights occupy a contested role in the Middle East and
   North Africa. Governments claim in their constitutions to uphold the
   rights of every citizen, regardless of gender and race with respect to
   granting them dignity and representation that is in line with universal
   human rights and the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of
   Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). However Islamists within these
   countries do not acknowledge universal human rights discourse and
   consider it contrary to Islamic principles. One aim of this article is
   to reveal that the governments in Egypt and Algeria utilise the Shar'ah
   to suppress women in the respective societies. Two further arguments are
   first, that governments, in order to maintain authority and political
   control, comply with the restrictive demands of Islamists towards women
   because they are perceived as having popular support. Second, women
   centred- conventions and movements such as CEDAW and Musawah
   respectively argue that Muslim women's existence, should not be
   constrained by limited interpretations of the Shar'ah and restrictive
   cultural traditions as supported by Islamists and Islamic governments.},

Abstract = {Brandon Kendhammer, The Sharia Controversy in Northern Nigeria and the
   Politics of Islamic Law in New and Uncertain Democracies In recent
   years, scholars have struggled to explain high levels of support for
   both state-sponsored Islamic law (sharia) and democracy in many new
   Muslim-majority democracies. The origins of popular support for Islamic
   law in uncertain democratic environments can be considered using the
   case of Northern Nigeria, where twelve states implemented sharia through
   democratic institutions during the early 2000s. Sharia implementation
   movements gain popular support by framing problems common to new
   democracies (corruption, inequality, poor governance) as moral concerns
   to be addressed by the state's enforcement of ethical conduct. While
   sharia implementation has had a dubious effect on democratic governance
   in Nigeria and elsewhere, support for Islamic law is likely to endure
   within Muslim communities where governance remains poor.},

Abstract = {Denmark and Norway have experienced significant political changes during
   the past three decades, changes that affect the constraints and
   opportunities organized interests are facing. Corporatist representation
   in the policy-making process has declined, and changes in
   executive-legislative relations have increased the power of parliaments.
   Organized interests are expected to adapt to these changing
   circumstances to maintain their political influence. This article shows
   how Danish and Norwegian interest groups have coped with the decline of
   corporatism and the revival of parliaments. Representation in
   corporatist policy-making committees and lobbying toward civil servants
   in government ministries have been supplemented and in some cases
   substituted by political lobbyism directed toward elected
   representatives in the parliament and the government. The analysis is
   based on panel data from several surveys carried out among nationwide
   interest groups in Denmark and Norway.},

Abstract = {This article assesses the electoral performance of populist parties in
   three European countries: the Netherlands, Poland and the United
   Kingdom. In explaining the electoral performance of the populist parties
   in the three countries, the article considers the agency of political
   parties in particular. More specifically, it examines the responsiveness
   of established parties and the credibility of the populist parties.
   Whereas the agency of populist parties, or other radical outsiders, has
   often been overlooked in previous comparative studies, this article
   argues that the credibility of the populist parties themselves plays a
   crucial role in understanding their electoral success and failure.},

Abstract = {This article attempts to respond to the major critical themes in the
   commentaries by Jones, Hibbert and Lecce on the book Cosmopolitan
   Regard. The book's `statist' assumptions are acknowledged, and defended
   in light of the project that is undertaken. Its use of an
   un-sociological notion of legitimacy (in contrast to `justification') is
   explained. Its argument is characterized as one that seeks to constrain
   agency rather than to prescribe distributive outcomes of a strongly
   egalitarian kind. Finally, the argument's dependence on empirical
   assumptions is recognized.},

Abstract = {This article explores differences in the development of nuclear energy
   programs in France and Germany Despite many similarities in natural
   resource availability and energy consumption, France and Germany differ
   significantly in their approaches to nuclear power France treats nuclear
   energy as a primary power source; Germany relies much more on coal and
   other fossil fuels. This article argues that the difference in energy
   programs is best explained by differences in political opportunity
   structure and especially different institutional structures in the two
   countries. French views on nationalism and technology also have
   contributed to the higher use of nuclear power in that country. Polity

Abstract = {Public sector deficits are nowadays an important problem for both from
   the aspect of developed countries and developing countries. The impacts
   over the macroeconomic balance of country of these deficits have been a
   research topic in a quite wide field. Public sector deficits primarily
   apart from presenting obstacle of the countries' permanent price
   stability have caused many problems such as unsustainable growth, real
   high interest; extreme instability occurring in exchange rate, wide
   ranged foreign trade deficits. The aim of this study is the research of
   whether public sector deficits (budget deficits) had an impact over the
   general level of the prices in Turkey of 1980-2011 period. In the study,
   determination of long run affair and the way between variables have been
   tried to find respectively via the usage of Johansen cointegration test
   and Granger causality test. The results which have been obtained
   indicate that there is a long run affair between budget deficits and
   inflation and the existency of causality from budget deficits to
   inflation.},

Abstract = {This study is about public policy-making for people with dyslexia in
   Iceland. Pupils with dyslexia are as a group the biggest group inside
   the educational system dealing with learning difficulties at school. In
   order to make sense of the current situation in this policy sector, the
   paper traces the processes by which policies for pupils with dyslexia at
   primary and secondary school levels in Iceland are made in the period
   1990-2007. It identifies similarities and differences in the
   policy-making processes and compares the results with similarities and
   differences characterising the policy-making processes involved in
   merging the hospitals in Reykjavik in the 1990s. The aim is to bring out
   a better understanding about how public policies come about in general,
   but more specifically to bring new perspectives into the policy debate,
   in the hope it may encourage a new way of thinking about the ways
   policies for people with dyslexia are designed. The paper concludes that
   similar to the hospital reforms at the end of 1990s, the observed policy
   outcomes of educational policies for pupils with dyslexia in Iceland are
   a result of processes characterised by policy drift rather than stated
   public policy reforms. As a consequence, the growing fragmentation of
   the policy sector following the decentralisation in the 1990s, lack of
   coherent and cohesive community of professional expertise, and
   marketization of specialised services for pupils with dyslexia impede
   the formation of collective understanding inside the sector and the
   building up of a critical mass of experience and expertise in order to
   advance the scientific research and development necessary to effectively
   develop and design evidence-based policy responses to pupils with
   learning difficulties caused by dyslexia.},

Abstract = {Feedback practices have recently come under increasing scrutiny in
   British Universities, most notably because of the impact of the National
   Student Survey. This article draws on the work of a National Teaching
   Fellowship Scheme funded project ('It's Good to Talk: Feedback, Dialogue
   and Learning'.) that seeks to identify, evaluate, develop and promote
   ways to improve feedback to students within the discipline of Politics.
   The article contends that student dissatisfaction with assignment
   feedback, coupled with increased pressures on teaching time, calls for a
   new approach to feedback delivery in the teaching of Politics. At the
   centre of this is the issue of encouraging lecturer and student dialogue
   around learning by developing peer feedback. This means moving away from
   a `transmission' approach to feedback to techniques that involve
   discussion and reflection. In this article, we consider the literature
   on one approach by focusing on student-to-student peer feedback. Through
   an exploration of the literature, we argue that it offers an effective
   way to support student learning.},

Abstract = {Disagreement over how and between whom power should be shared has led to
   competing conceptions of federalism in Canada. The model of federalism
   adopted in the Constitution Act 1867 divides power between the provinces
   and the federal government to the exclusion of Aboriginal peoples.
   However, pre-Confederation documents such as the Royal Proclamation of
   1763 and the early treaties suggest that federalism is founded on the
   coexistence of self-governing nations. This paper presents a case study
   of how one Aboriginal people, the Metis, are reviving the
   pre-Confederation vision of federalism founded on mutual recognition by
   carving out a space for themselves in Canada's political and
   institutional landscape. We argue that by delivering an expanded array
   of programs and services to their citizens, creating innovative
   governance structures, adopting legislation in key areas of Metis
   interest and fostering economic self-sufficiency, the Metis are
   reshaping federalism from the bottom up.},

Abstract = {This study inquires as to the nature of racial regularities in residual
   voting that exist under post-Help America Vote Act conditions. Even with
   modern, optical scan voting machines, there were significant differences
   among black, Hispanic, and white residual vote rates in the city of
   Chicago during the Municipal Election of 2011 and the Illinois General
   Election of 2010. Moreover, these residual vote rates varied with the
   availability of, respectively, black, Hispanic, and white candidates for
   office. Hispanics often had the highest residual vote rates among the
   three major race groups in Chicago, and there were instances in the
   aforementioned 2011 and 2010 Chicago elections in which a group of
   voters chose not to vote for anyone rather than vote for a dominant
   candidate of a different race than the voters themselves. Thus, even
   holding constant electoral administration and voting technology, the
   role of race in residual voting remains prominent.},

Abstract = {It is often assumed that the problem of electoral participation in
   Australia has been solved with an entrenched regime of compulsion in
   enrolment and voting. In recent elections, however, one-fifth of
   eligible Australians failed to cast a valid vote. This study aims to
   identify those demographic groups which contribute to this substantial
   rate of abstention. The authors used Random Forests to model the effects
   of demographic factors on voter turnout in three Australian state
   general elections. Results suggest that resource barriers have been
   generally surmounted, but lower levels of population stability and
   interaction contribute to a decline in electoral participation. These
   findings have implications for electoral administration, urban form and
   compulsion itself.},

Abstract = {Whereas numerous recent studies have explored the structural and
   procedural ability of national parliaments to provide oversight of
   transnational issues such as European integration, the nature of
   individual parliamentarians' interest in foreign policy is a subject
   that has received little attention. The general assumption is that
   electoral incentives and informational deficiencies dissuade
   parliamentarians from actively engaging politics beyond the domestic
   realm. This paper suggests an analysis of parliamentary questions as a
   method for measuring individual parliamentarians' interests in foreign
   policy. Applying this technique to the Dail uncovers evidence that,
   contrary to theory-derived conventional expectations, some
   parliamentarians do seek to monitor the government's foreign policy
   agenda. While conventional explanations of legislative role-orientation
   only weakly predict variations in observed behaviour, elite interviews
   identify lobbying by interest groups and foreign governments as the
   motivation for some Irish parliamentarians' engagement in foreign
   affairs.},

Abstract = {Ghana's 55 years of nationhood have largely been lived under successions
   of undemocratic rule. There is the perception that the undemocratic
   governments, among others, excluded Ghanaians from the public
   policy-making process. However, many now believe the reintroduction of
   constitutional rule since 1993 has democratized policy decision making
   in ways that have engaged civil society actors via consultation and open
   public participation. The analysis of two cases (Ghana Poverty Reduction
   Strategy I and Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy II) enables this
   study to determine if this perception is correct. I conclude that
   although a gradual shift to participatory decision making has occurred
   and improved policy processes and outcomes, it is bedeviled by several
   structural challenges that place premium on elite preferences to the
   neglect of those of unorganized and marginalized rural folk. This
   finding leaves important question marks surrounding some of the
   fundamental principles of the good governance mantra.},

Abstract = {Though instances of party switching have been widely documented, there
   is little cross-national research on this phenomenon. The prevalence of
   switching is therefore unknown, and the factors influencing this
   behavior remain unclear. Using the most comprehensive dataset on party
   switching ever constructed, we illustrate both that interparty movement
   is more common than previously assumed and that there are substantial
   differences in its prevalence across parties. To explain this variation,
   we examine the relationship between legislators' motivations,
   institutional arrangements, and switching. We find that motivational
   explanations are correlated with interparty movement and that
   institutional arrangements exhibit only limited direct influence on
   switching.},

Title = {Towards cultural citizenship? Cultural rights and cultural policy in
   Taiwan},
Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},

Abstract = {This article reviews existing literature on the construction of cultural
   citizenship, and argues that cultural citizenship expands the concept of
   citizenship', promotes citizens' consciousness and ensures the
   protection of minority rights. Since the 1990s, three cultural policies
   have arisen related to cultural citizenship in Taiwan: Community
   Renaissance', Multicultural Policy' and the Announcement of Cultural
   Citizenship'. Cultural citizenship' has expanded the concept of
   citizenship in two ways. First, it has led to the consideration of the
   minority rights of Taiwanese indigenous peoples, the Hakkas, foreign
   brides and migrant workers in citizenship'; and second, it has placed
   emphasis on cultural rights' in addition to civil rights, political
   rights and social rights. This article begins by exploring what approach
   to cultural citizenship is used in cultural policy, and what approach is
   suitable for practising cultural citizenship in Taiwan. I argue that
   minority groups practise their cultural rights with the public
   participation of Community Renaissance. Taiwan's case bears out
   Stevenson's view: a society of actively engaged citizens requires both
   the protection offered by rights and opportunities to participate.
   Finally, this article shows the challenges and contradictions of
   cultural citizenship in Taiwan: the loss of autonomy and the
   continuation of cultural inequality.},

Title = {`We are not criminals, we are just victims of circumstances': An
   exploration of experiences of Nigerian immigrants' men that married
   South African women in Johannesburg},
Journal = {NATIONAL IDENTITIES},

Abstract = {The world is full of ethnic, racial and religious divisions and
   intermarriage between members of different groups can be seen as an
   indication that divisions are overcome. Marriage is a union between
   individuals that imply family ties and social sanctioning. Similarly,
   intermarriage is considered to be a major pointer of overcoming social
   distance among groups and cohesion of societies. In other words,
   intermarriage has been argued to be a channel through which members of
   different groups relate and interact with one another in a more positive
   way and see each group as being socially equal without any form of
   prejudice or discrimination. However, intermarriages between Nigerian
   men and South African women exist in South Africa amongst the
   institutionalised xenophobia and anti-Nigerian sentiments. It is on this
   note that this study examines how Nigerian-South African couples
   negotiate and adapt to the discriminations directed towards Nigerian
   husbands by their friends and families, and how this changed the
   perception of their friends and families over time. The study is based
   on data gathered from a four-month ethnographic fieldwork in
   Johannesburg and the data were collected through participant
   observations and in-depth interviews of 15 Nigerian-South African
   couples, friends and families. This study also uses Alba and Nee's
   `intermarriage and assimilation theory' in order to show how marriages
   between Nigerian men and South African women led to breakdown in
   xenophobic attitudes of wives' families and friends.},

Abstract = {The article by U.Beck and N.Sznaider, the Russian version of which we
   introduce to the reader, justifies the necessity of re-conceptualization
   of the social sciences through the cosmopolitan turn. The authors show
   that the methodological nationalism that equates societies with
   nation-state societies and views states and their governments as the
   primary focus of analysis deprives researchers of the opportunity to see
   the multidimensional process of changes that irreversibly transforms the
   very nature of the social world and the place of states in this world.
   According to their conclusion, the humanities and social sciences need
   to get ready for a transformation of their own positions - that is, to
   accept cosmopolitanism as a research agenda and raise some of the key
   conceptual, methodological, empirical and normative issues that
   cosmopolitanization of reality poses before the social sciences.},

Journal = {POLITICA \& SOCIETA},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {2},
Number = {1},
Pages = {53-78},

Abstract = {The contribution reconstructs the meaning and systematic function of the
   notion of Liebesakosmismus (Acosmistic Love) in Max Weber. Acosmistic
   love is the extreme and perfectly coherent form of love of neighbour
   -unconditional and unlimited duty to help the neighbour and radical
   rejection of violence: an absolute form of goodness which coincides with
   the inability to shape a world. This notion allows Weber to identify -ex
   negativo -the conditions of the social and political order. According to
   Weber the world is the space that arises when one begins to establish
   distinctions, when the absolute consistency with the principle of love
   of neighbour gives way to the articulation of the differences,
   exclusions, exceptions. Distinctions and differences are, however,
   elements that depend on a world image (Weltbild), the cognitive
   synthesis that takes the place of the unattainable experience of the
   world as a whole and that possesses the irreplaceable practical function
   of horizon within which the individuals understand themselves, interpret
   their needs, formulate their plans and define their expectations,
   articulate their evaluations. A transformation of the world image is
   also what explains the sudden reversals, ever possible, of the absolute
   ethics of the love of neighbour in the last violence of the
   revolutionary millenarianism.},

Abstract = {This article deals with a phenomenon of long-unconsolidated democracies,
   a distinct regime type found in a number of post-Soviet countries. It
   focuses on the case of Ukraine as one of the most striking within this
   particular political context. In course of its transition from
   Soviet-type one-party system to political pluralism, Ukraine passed
   through different types of political regimes. During this process, the
   country moved in-between a weak and insufficiently institutionalized
   democratic system, semi- and full-scale authoritarianism.
   The basic intention of the article is to contribute to a bettter
   understanding of the determinants of the Ukrainian political transition.
   In addition, it seeks to identify the mechanisms that make
   unconsolidated democracies last rather long as well as to show why
   different forms of authoritarianism have had troubles in their search
   for consolidation. Although there are many other similar examples of
   post-communist political transition, the author concentrates on the
   Ukrainian as one of the most interesting and the most actual.},

Abstract = {Studies of state administration have occupied a prominent place in
   social sciences. However, current literature offers little understanding
   of its functioning in states governed by violence. The article seeks to
   provide an analysis of the formation and practices of local
   administration in Chad. How does the local state govern the inter-war,
   i.e. the spaces and times which are affected by a violent mode of
   governing and where war remains on the horizon? The article shows how
   clientelism, state illegal practices and predation (as a result of
   impunity granted to local state officials) are a form of continuation of
   the war. State violence is all the more efficient that it is combined
   with the local state's firm grip on people's daily life. Such an
   administration is not simply dysfunctional; it is linked to a
   historically grounded mode of governing. Beyond the case of Chad, the
   article interrogates insidious forms of violence hidden by apparent
   stability or peace.},

Abstract = {Research on campaign dynamics and voting behaviour in direct democracy
   suggests that referendum campaigns can be seen as processes of learning.
   This finding stems from two assumptions: (1) information has mediating
   effects - the more voters know about the issue at stake, the stronger
   the effect of issue preferences in their decisionmaking; (2) campaign
   volatility and framing effects are linked to weak campaigning and
   voters' lack of information. The aim of this article is to suggest the
   limitations of this approach and discuss the effects of framing in
   referendum campaigning. It is argued that campaign volatility as well as
   framing effects are not always related to voter ignorance and
   information-weak campaigns but rather to qualitative shifts in the
   underlying value interpretation linked to referendum proposals. These
   shifts are possible no matter how well-informed voters are. The
   expectancy-value model, commonly used in psychological research, is used
   to make sense of framing effects in volatile as well as stable
   referendum campaigns.},

Abstract = {This paper begins from an examination of a very short and now largely
   forgotten article by John Plamenatz, entitled `The Use of Political
   Theory' (1960). Section 1 outlines Plamenatz's vision of the role of
   political theory, whilst Section 2 relates this vision to some themes of
   contemporary political philosophy: in particular, the `realist' critique
   of mainstream liberalism. Without unequivocally endorsing `realism'-in
   any case an extremely ill-defined category-I suggest that its central
   complaint pinpoints deficiencies in contemporary liberal theory which
   are especially clearly manifested in Plamenatz's earlier account of its
   `use': in particular, a tendency both to idealize and to idealize away
   from the political status quo. Finally, Section 3 explores how these
   deficiencies might be remedied by a closer attention to the Marxist
   notion of ideology: a notion which, I argue, is accorded insufficient
   credit by Plamenatz as well as by many contemporary political theorists.},

Year = {2013},
Volume = {6},

Abstract = {To contextualize peace as an objective of `social rule of law', it's
   necessary to start by understanding it as a path that goes beyond
   abandoning weapons and ending conflict. This is a path that is
   constantly under construction by society and its institutions, this path
   has elements that make it possible, such as: democracy, participation,
   citizenship and the construction of public policies oriented to an
   integral development of society, where the point of departure is the

Abstract = {Directive 52/2008 on mediation in civil and commercial matters has been
   recently transposed in Spain by the Law 5/2012, of July 6, of Mediation
   in Civil and Mercantile Matters. The normative text is mostly based on
   the unsuccessful Project of the previous Legislature. On the other hand,
   in different autonomous territories have implemented numerous and
   various legislative initiatives in the field of mediation that show the
   strong expansion of this institution. Finally, noting the situation of
   current practice, we see the gradual consolidation of mediation between
   legal operators, being reflected in decisions of judges and courts. All
   these elements invite reflection on the model adopted in our brand new
   rules of mediation in civil and commercial matters.},

   Voter Registration},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE EDUCATION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Pages = {379-402},
Abstract = {In a democracy, agents of political socialization, such as schools and
   parents, generally emphasize the importance of voting. While college
   students may be exposed briefly to voter registration as a barrier to
   participation, there is little evidence that the topic is given serious
   attention in the classroom. This research addresses how classroom
   experiences affect students' attitudes about voter registration by
   employing a quasi-experimental, pre-post survey design. The experimental
   stimulus was a course assignment in which students completed voter
   registration applications under four scenarios designed to simulate
   different circumstances frequently encountered by college students. The
   students in the experimental group became much less sanguine about the
   ease of registration and the ability of most citizens to correctly
   navigate the process, yet became more confident in the voter
   registration process in general. This raises interesting questions about
   how attitudes about the political process are shaped by students' course
   experiences.},

   undergoing urban renewal},
Journal = {POLITIX},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {26},
Number = {101},
Pages = {79+},
Abstract = {The growing differentiation within the working classes is expressed in
   particular by a divide between unstable populations on social-housing
   estates and stable homeowner populations in areas of private detached
   housing. By promoting access to home-ownership within social-housing
   estates, urban regeneration policy is likely to modify the processes at
   the origin of this residential divide. This article, based on a
   monograph of a neighbourhood in Lyon, France, highlights the fact that,
   instead of the expected arrival of the middle classes, the new
   homeowners taking advantage of access schemes come from stable
   working-class populations. Becoming homeowners on a social-housing
   estate enables them to enjoy a small degree of residential mobility
   while retaining the links with family, friends and local acquaintances
   that are essential to their domestic equilibrium. Their residential
   trajectory and the efforts that this new occupancy status demands leads
   them to invest heavily in their private sphere and distance themselves
   from the neighbourhood and its less ``respectable{''} residents. So,
   although urban renewal modifies the populating of social-housing estates
   by slowing down the centrifugal processes that, until now, led to the
   departure of stable population groups, the cohabitation of these groups
   with the most unstable population groups does not result in closer
   social relations between the two.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE EDUCATION},

Volume = {9},

Pages = {197-208},
Abstract = {An emerging assumption in undergraduate political science education is
   that role-playing simulations are an effective teaching tool. While
   previous studies have addressed the pedagogical advantages of
   simulations as compared to more traditional teaching techniques, less
   attention has been paid to student perceptions of these simulations.
   This study uses data collected from an introductory International
   Relations course that includes a 2-day Model United Nations Crisis
   Simulation. Students are given a presimulation and postsimulation survey
   in order to gauge the perceived educational value of classroom
   simulations. Do undergraduates perceive simulations to be a valuable
   learning tool? Do these perceptions change after they participate in a
   simulation? Gender, class rank, and previous interest in world politics
   are considered. Finally, the authors consider whether students'
   perceptions of the simulation experience correlate with the assumptions
   in the existing literature.},

Abstract = {The paper analyses the system of public funding of political parties in
   the Czech Republic in the framework of the cartelization theory. After a
   theoretical introduction, the paper presents an overview of the laws
   governing political party funding in a wider socioeconomic context. The
   second part of the paper contains empirical analyses of party funding,
   focusing primarily on the role that state funding plays in the overall
   political party income structure. Specific attention is paid to the
   differences between parliamentary and non-parliamentary political
   parties. The overall findings suggest that the system of state financing
   in the Czech Republic strengthens the status quo, rather than promoting
   higher inclusivity of the party system. State funding is the most
   important source of income for most parties included in the analysis. It
   is also disproportionally higher for parliamentary than for
   non-parliamentary parties and in the period under observation state
   funding did not help - with only one possible exception -
   non-parliamentary parties enter the parliament.},

Abstract = {In this article, we argue that international law can help state leaders
   reach a settlement in territorial disputes by suggesting a focal point
   for negotiations. International law is more likely to serve as a focal
   point when the legal principles relevant to the dispute are clear and
   well established and when one of the states in the dispute has a
   stronger legal claim to disputed territory. When these two conditions
   are present, we expect the state with a legal advantage to push for and
   receive favorable terms of settlement. In our analysis of all negotiated
   settlements in territorial disputes from 1945 to 2000, we find strong
   support for the importance of international law in influencing the terms
   of settlements. States with a strong legal advantage are more likely to
   secure favorable terms, whereas states lacking a strong legal claim are
   more likely to receive unfavorable terms.},

Abstract = {This article critically examines the normative, liberal assumptions that
   most frequently underlie scholarly, activist, and policy calls for
   reconciliation in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Rather than measuring how
   reconciliation is progressing, I suggest we ask ourselves whose
   reconciliation is being desired here: by whom, for whom, and for what?
   Which important alternative questions remain unasked and which latent
   answers are ignored or downplayed in the process? Particular attention
   is paid to the ways in which liberal reconciliation discourse tends to
   depoliticize questions of justice.},

Abstract = {This article examines how students' common-sense conceptualizations of
   ``nation,'' specifically the Swedish nation, operate in teaching
   situations in which a critical constructivist theory of ``nation'' is
   part of the curriculum. Taking its point of departure from discussions
   of conceptual change, this article examines how students negotiate
   common-sense notions and how these notions affect students' learning
   processes. We examine group discussions from two different undergraduate
   courses at a Swedish university. The article discusses obstacles and
   opportunities for students to understand the concept of ``nation'' from
   a constructivist perspective and to challenge the concept of ``nation''
   as a given and natural entity. We find several discursive repertoires in
   the material. Three of these repertoires are scrutinized to discover how
   common-sense notions work. The repertories are multifaceted and can
   function in ways that facilitate as well as block denaturalization. The
   results show that common-sense understandings remain with the students
   even if they learn to account for constructivist perspectives.
   Furthermore, the results demonstrate that students' understandings of
   scholarly discussions of ``nation'' are complex and that resisting the
   content of a specific theory may, in some cases, be productive in terms
   of learning.},

   analysis application for identifying ties between electoral and
   political cleavages as well as factors of social stratification of
   society. The use of this technique within the study of political and
   social content of the electoral cleavages in the post-Soviet Russia
   (1993-2011) allowed the author to obtain several nontrivial results
   concerning the structure of political space cleavages in the country. In
   contrast to the theory of problem dimensions, the proposed method
   provides an opportunity to study these cleavages in their natural unity,
   in which they exist within the political reality, rather than in the
   artificially ``decomposed{''} form.},

Abstract = {Majority cycling and related social choice paradoxes are often thought
   to threaten the meaningfulness of democracy. Deliberation can protect
   against majority cycles-not by inducing unanimity, which is unrealistic,
   but by bringing preferences closer to single-peakedness. We present the
   first empirical test of this hypothesis, using data from Deliberative
   Polls. Comparing preferences before and after deliberation, we find
   increases in proximity to single-peakedness. The increases are greater
   for lower-versus higher-salience issues and for individuals who seem to
   have deliberated more versus less effectively. They are not merely a
   by-product of increased substantive agreement ( which in fact does not
   generally increase). Our results are important, quite apart from their
   implications for majority cycling, because single-peakedness can be
   naturally interpreted in terms of an underlying issue dimension, which
   can both clarify the debate and allow a majority-winning alternative to
   be interpreted as a median choice and thus as an attractive
   ``compromise.''},

   Progress toward the criminal judicial cooperation in the EU},
Journal = {TEORIA Y REALIDAD CONSTITUCIONAL},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {32},
Pages = {179-204},
Abstract = {The European approximation and/or harmonization in both criminal matters
   and criminal procedure legislation got started not so long ago: As a
   matter of fact, until recently, it all seemed a voluntary exercise of
   wishful thinking, in as much as it was making on a field so far
   preserved within the traditional realm of States' sovereignty. The final
   incorporation of criminal law and criminal judicial cooperation to the
   sphere of European policy is an outstanding example of the european
   construction towards areas and competences that had been historically
   monopolised by national legislators. Indeed, the limitations in this
   matter of the intergovernmental cooperation in the Third Pillar that
   emerged with the entry into force of the TEU in 1992, after its
   conversion into the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice in the
   subsequent Treaty Amsterdam 1999, have been just recently overcome.
   Accordingly, some most important Framework Decisions (FD) meaning
   significant steps in the area of judicial cooperation were taken,
   through the implementation of specific measures on European security
   against serious cross-border crime by means of judicial cooperation in
   criminal matters. The conversion of the Area of Freedom, Security and
   Justice is a genuine European policy subject to the ordinary legislative
   procedure (with some specialties) after the Treaty of Lisbon in 2009,
   together with the projection of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the
   EU (i.e., of the principles of legal certainty, of ``proportionality{''}
   and ``necessity{''} and/or ``subsidiarity{''} in the articulation and
   application of criminal law) are now, in fact, the most visible
   expression of the EU's political ambition and constitutional dimension.},

Journal = {POLITIX},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {26},
Number = {103},
Pages = {99+},
Abstract = {In the fall of 2009, a wave of demonstrations by French farmers
   predominantly took the form of a milk strike. The destruction of a
   significant quantity of milk, spread over fields or dumped in slurry
   tanks, typified the strike and drew considerable media coverage. Beyond
   the sought-after effects of shock and attracting attention, such
   practices are in line with a long history of constructing a specific
   repertory of action within the agricultural world, observable over the
   three milk strikes of the last half-century. The forms of action
   deployed in 1964, 1972, and 2009 reflect the transformation of economic
   and union power relations and the necessity of taking actions of
   increasing visibility. The decisive importance of media access,
   television in particular, in implementing collective mobilizations leads
   us to highlight the changes that have taken place in systems of
   agricultural and farmer representation, and how they are used by
   professional and media actors.},

Abstract = {The internet is considered as an important forum to empower and engage
   groups outside the traditional political systems. However; the `digital
   divide `might imply several disparities and even reinforce exclusion of
   those with low economic and cultural capital. This article intends to
   question how democratic and inclusive this virtual public sphere is and
   in which terms the new dynamics in contemporary societies encourage
   mobility by excluded groups. Through quantitative methodology, we sought
   to analyse the differences between migrant (Angolans and Brazilians) and
   non-migrant groups in Portugal, as well as the e-participationforms
   adopted by them and the factors that could predict such participation.
   This is essential towards a wider knowledge about this field,
   strengthening the understanding concerning the ambivalence about the
   potential of the internet as a space for the inclusion of groups at risk
   of exclusion from participation and, consequently from real citizenship.},

Abstract = {Although the 1798 rebellion seldom figures prominently in histories of
   the Revolutionary Wars, it was probably the bloodiest political upheaval
   to occur in Ireland between the 1640s and the 1910s. The rebellion was
   largely inspired by the French Revolution, yet many had long anticipated
   such an event. They saw it as another round in a struggle that would
   only end with the extirpation of either Catholics or Protestants. Such
   beliefs lent ferocity to the fighting and encouraged massacre. Yet, at
   the same time, individuals on all sides sought to prevent or at least
   restrain bloodshed. Enlightenment and republican values and the ties of
   family and community were by no means submerged, and many marked for
   death were saved, although often deeply traumatized by their
   experiences. For, while the rebellion looked back to the sectarian
   massacres of the seventeenth century, it at the same time looked forward
   to the much less violent Irish nationalist struggles of the nineteenth
   century.},

Title = {Economic Democracy: The Left's Big Idea for the Twenty-First Century?},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {35},
Number = {1},
Pages = {84-108},
Abstract = {While the notion that parts of the economy should be subject to
   democratic oversight is not particularly new, it is only recently that
   the term ``economic democracy{''} has begun to emerge as a political
   label and a political project in its own right. Interest in economic
   democracy is at a historical high as more and more people search for a
   comprehensive alternative to neoliberal capitalism that is neither state
   socialism nor social democracy. In addition, the fact that mainstream
   concern with economic inequality is at a historical peak means that
   economic arrangements are on the political agenda in a way that they
   have not been for many years. The central argument of this article is
   that economic democracy has the potential to be the ``big idea{''} of
   the left this century for two main reasons. First, although economic
   democracy is usually thought to be concerned solely with workplaces, in
   fact it has implications far beyond this. Indeed, economic democracy is
   best understood as a comprehensive critique of the economy and a
   corresponding encompassing vision of an alternative. This article thus
   aims to offer a sympathetic overview of the main facets of economic
   democracy-the attempt to democratize workplaces, finance, investment,
   and the market system-as a holistic and integrative project. Second,
   economic democracy offers an important method for challenging
   inequality. The expansion of democratic accountability through
   representation, and particularly the expansion of opportunity for direct
   participation in economic decision making is a fundamentally important
   method of redressing the structural inequality that continues to be a
   defining dilemma of our societies.},

Abstract = {As the criticism of our current state of journalism and the current
   state of journalism education mounts, we ask a simple question: Could
   political science graduates do a better job of providing political
   reporting than graduates with journalism degrees? Although we do not
   test this question empirically, a review of the extant literature
   suggests that political science departments and curricula have the
   potential to foster graduates that have a high level of political
   knowledge, political judgment, and critical thinking skills. These
   skills are essential for political reporters if they are to wade through
   political spin, manipulation, and misdirection.
   Secondly, if political science graduates are indeed more qualified to
   provide political reporting to US citizens and to reenergize American
   democracy, would media executives be willing to hire such graduates
   absent a degree in journalism? This question we do examine empirically.
   With a survey of current media executives utilizing a battery of
   questions assessing their willingness to hire nonjournalism graduates,
   we are pleased to find an openness on the part of media executives to
   hire political science graduates to do their political reporting, even

   Central Europe. Next, the article analyzes development within the
   so-called ``theory of extremism,{''} including new concepts elaborated
   by scholars (soft and hard extremism, etc.) and developments dealing
   with the interconnection with terrorism research. Use of results of
   extremism research by governmental and international institutions is
   identified. Finally, criticism of the concept of extremism is presented,
   including criticism of the concept's politicization.},

Abstract = {Northern development policies in African countries affected by war are
   shaped by security concerns and have neoliberal and realist elements.
   The neoliberal economic policy purports to be inclusive, but when it
   meets noncompliance, realist ambitions are pursued through the use or
   strategic oversight of force. The liberalisation of mining in Katanga,
   Democratic Republic of Congo, was promoted through northern policy and
   was exclusive in strengthening unaccountable domestic governance. This
   marginalised the majority of the population politically and economically
   and reinforced the international political economy. Consequently,
   northern intervention has increased insecurity in Congo, and is
   potentially destabilising in contravening reciprocity in international
   relations.},

Abstract = {Under the generally pejorative term of Utopian socialism there can be
   found a number of thinkers and social reformers committed to the
   problems of the period after 1789, marked by instability and the
   emergence of a new structure of economic relations. The case of
   Saint-Simon and his school, Saint-Simonism, constitutes a clear example
   of one of these innovative movements that shook up and invigorated the
   social and political scene of the time. In this paper we shall analyze
   the two dimensions present within Saint-Simon's project. The more
   classic and well known side of his work is doctrinal, associated with
   the establishment of a future industrial society in France. A second
   dimension inspired a potentially critical discourse that addressed the
   existing social problems and, consequently, was considered more
   dangerous and threatening to the prevailing order.},

Abstract = {The crisis of ethical political leadership is responsible for Africa's
   underdevelopment and insecurity, and its social and structural
   injustices. Strengthening ethical political leadership is trepiditious,
   given the deeply engraved status quo that appeals to political elites
   who command power and benefit from the system through semi-democratic,
   semi-authoritarian and authoritarian regime types. Using an
   interdisciplinary approach of peace and conflict studies, the paper
   analyses the crisis and proposes a model for strengthening political
   leadership through African Ubuntu ethics and the involvement of local,
   national and international actors to achieve sustainable peace and
   social justice.},

Abstract = {Numerous researchers in comparative politics have pointed at non-linear
   J-shaped link between state capacity and democracy. This claim suggests
   that consolidated autocracies possess higher levels of state capacity
   than hybrid regimes. We test this conjecture using post-communist
   sample, 1989 - 2010, and do not find supporting evidence. The paper
   presents an original approach to measurement of state capacity and an
   informal model of the ``king of the hill{''} explaining low quality of
   institutions in post-communist autocracies.},

Journal = {BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES OF TERRORISM AND POLITICAL AGGRESSION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-19},
Abstract = {Since 11 September 2001, a significant portion of the public debate in
   the United States has focused upon the threat of terrorism. Previous
   scholarship has concluded that exposure to threatening information may
   result in significant alterations to individual decision-making and,
   ultimately, may influence support for expansive civil liberties. Since
   information may critically impact support for civil liberties, the
   current study investigates alterations in print and broadcast media
   content related to civil liberties before and after 11 September 2001.
   The content analyses utilized here focus upon the types of content (such
   as threatening information, group-specific information, and contextual
   information) that experimental research has suggested may influence
   individual decision-making concerning civil liberties. Results suggest
   that threatening information in the media coverage of civil liberties
   escalated following 9/11 until it peaked in the year 2003. Following
   2003, levels of threatening information gradually decreased, returning
   to pre-9/11 levels in 2006. In comparison to broadcast media, the print
   media seems to have experienced fewer changes following 9/11.},

Abstract = {Often approached through Giorgio Agamben's work, the camp-like spaces
   associated with asylum-seeking and refuge in Europe have been portrayed
   as sites of abjection to a predatory sovereign logic. In this article, I
   claim this reading overlooks the forms of authority in play at such
   sites. Through a theoretical interrogation of a politics of irregular
   migration and an empirical investigation of No Borders' practices, I
   emphasise the `experiential' forms of authority through which subjects
   are already taking and remaking the meaning of citizenship. Through
   Jacques Rancisre's philosophy of politics and sense, I argue that the
   task of discerning productions of experiential authority within new
   geographies of mobility is a critical political task of our time.},

Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Pages = {88-108},
Abstract = {Much of the debate concerning political obligation deals with the
   question of which, if any, moral principles could make obedience to the
   directives of the government a matter of obligation. What makes
   political obligation political has not received attention in the
   literature on the topic. In this article I argue that the lack of
   systematic reflection on what makes political obligation political is
   responsible for the failure of a number of influential theories of
   political obligation. I demonstrate this failure using the consent
   theory of political obligation as my major example. I conclude my
   analysis by formulating some positive conditions that a successful
   principle of political obligation should satisfy.},

   Confirming the validity of the hypothesis on the whole, the study

Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {35},
Number = {3},
Pages = {373-388},
Abstract = {This article is at once a critique, a challenge, and a risk, first in
   the form of instructive parody, moving on to engage more seriously with
   the critique of ``parsimonious{''} social science embedded within it,
   and finally suggesting ways to embrace and advance a legacy of new
   political science. Employing satire, the article begins by outlining the
   various methods within the field of mainstream political science
   currently being used to tackle the (impossible) empirical project of
   exploring an ``ideal world.{''} Next, although protocol cautions
   emerging political scientists to tread lightly with critiques of
   entrenched methods, established scholarship, and renowned journals, it
   argues that substantive analyses of this less than ``ideal world{''} are
   still urgently interwoven with provocative interrogation of this less
   than ideal discipline. Beyond critique however, the goal of this
   commentary is both to affirm the risk-taking trajectory of ``new{''}
   political science that has beckoned many into the field and to insist
   upon the continuation of this forward move(ment): opening up space for,
   and claiming as political responsibility, a stake in methodological
   creativity and a more robust set of political associations.},

Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {35},
Number = {1},
Pages = {109-135},
Abstract = {The danger posed by ``weapons of mass destruction{''} (WMD) was the Bush
   administration's chief justification for invading Iraq. Amid the din of
   the chorus that ceaselessly repeated this phrase in 2002-2003, hardly
   anyone stopped to ask: what is ``WMD{''} anyway? Is it not a mutable
   social construct rather than a timeless, self-evident concept? Guided by
   Nietzsche's view of the truth as a ``mobile army of metaphors {[}and]
   metonyms... which have been enhanced, transposed, and embellished
   poetically and rhetorically,{''}we present a history of the metonym WMD.
   We describe how it was coined by the Archbishop of Canterbury in 1937,
   and subsequently how its meaning was ``transposed{''} and ``enhanced{''}
   throughout Cold War arms negotiations, in the aftermath of the Iraqi
   invasion of Kuwait, and in US domestic law. We also discuss how, in the
   run-up to the Iraq war, ``WMD{''} did not merely describe an Iraqi
   threat; it was rather ``embellished poetically and rhetorically{''} in
   ways that produced and inflated the threat.},

Abstract = {The issue of remittances in a global context is not new, it has existed
   since our antiquity to the origin of migration of mankind, however
   nowadays with globalization and thanks to lack and crises that generally
   passes the world and some countries such as Mexico, India and China has
   been even more marked, as destination countries of these migrants as the
   United of States of America which is the main receptor have generated
   various problems, from the increase in informal employment, generating
   political problems in their constitutions reforms, social, economic,
   however, and if not, for countries which migrate these people, as in the
   case of Mexico becomes somewhat unbudgeted income for their internal
   economic states, Michoacan is the leading states in this largely depends
   on remittances sent by his countrymen, this I can see after the crisis
   of 2008, where the fall of the remittances to 2009 fell by an average of
   25\%, affecting the stability of the state itself, so it is essential to
   make a projection for the coming year, it is very important to analyze
   whether remittances to the state of Michoacan are down, since under this
   case the state may take the necessary measures to counter its lower
   public or otherwise properly channel their spending by Michoacan.},

Abstract = {The sea sets East Asia apart from other regional systems that influence
   international economic, political and military affairs. Alessio Patalano
   argues that in East Asia, the centrality of the maritime realm to
   economic and political matters is transforming it into a primary
   battleground for national ambitions. Meanwhile, the wide range of
   functions exercised by maritime forces puts them at the forefront of
   both competition and the management of security issues and regional
   stability. Maritime security issues are therefore likely to remain high
   on the regional agenda in East Asia, although the risk of escalation to
   war may not be as high as is often assumed.},

   on five levels and / or basic components of e-government: the presence,
   urban information, degree of interaction, type of transactions offered
   and the possible transformation of new vehicles of communication with
   the governed, called e-democracy for measuring elements applied a
   dichotomous instrument, ascending tabbed to stage or application level
   of the variable. From the results e-government is a tool with little
   application in municipal management of Zulia, where less than half of
   the councils have an Internet presence with official websites, they
   rarely reach levels of citizen participation and transformation because
   the sample is limited to news and information with little impact among
   the governed.},

Abstract = {Hanes Walton was a prolific scholar and a fine human being. In this
   article, I use his work to engage theories of Afrofuturism and explore
   their combined import for the future of black politics. I argue that
   Afrofuturism's concern with how past systems of oppression collude with
   ideas of post-raciality offer a caution to those studying the politics
   of black people. The most significant way this intersection impacts the
   field is in limiting both the subjects we study and our methods. Using
   the broad span of Hanes' works, I show how he represents a model of how
   to produce scholarship that is empirically sound and responsive to the
   concerns of the black community for years to come. I end with a
   discussion of Hanes' impact beyond the page and how, thanks to his
   guidance, I continue to do ``home work{''}.},

Abstract = {The transition from national to provincial territory, begun during the
   Peronism (1946-1955), its analyzed from a historical-sociological
   approach which emphasizes the continuities and ruptures of the
   transition, taking as a study case the late provincialization of the
   territories (1955): Formosa and Patagonia's governorships.
   From an approach based on figurational sociology (Elias) and
   three-dimensional characterization of power (Lukes) we propose a
   periodization that accounts the complexities that gets through a process
   initiated in a democratic government. the historic Peronism. but
   develops in the desperonizacion framework, prohibition and state control
   made by the self-styled ``Liberating Revolution{''}.
   The gestation of the new provinces was influenced by the guidance
   printed by the de facto government, as well as the difficulties
   evidenced in institutional and functional demands of the federal
   auditors. Asymmetrical power relations, conflicting objectives and claim
   of homogenization that ignores both regional and local identities, are
   the variables of a historical process of construction and whose legacy
   provincial differentiated on sociopolitical formation of new provinces
   still needs to be discussed and interpreted.},

Abstract = {The Italian Constitutional Court in its Judgments 106/2009 and 40/2012
   had to define its fole in the oversight of official secrets. In previous
   judgments the Italian Constitutional Court had pronounced itself upon
   the role of the ordinary courts on this field but not upon his own role.
   In the judgments 106/2009 and 40/2012 the Italian Constitutional Court
   also deals will the question of the collision between the right to
   denfece and the need to protect national security. It gives an entirely
   new solution to the problem. As to the oversight of official secrets,
   the Italian Constitutional Court is quite deferential towards the
   Executive.},

Abstract = {The UK's housing problem has become an economic one. Finding ways to
   boost the supply of housing across the UK is currently near the top of
   the Government's economic growth and jobs agenda. As a result of failed
   policies over the past 60 years - policymakers' unwillingness to tackle
   NIMBY interests, a complex national planning system, developers'
   unwillingness and inability to build housing at the volume required to
   maintain stable prices, changing preferences amongst the population -
   the scale of the problem is vast. However, for any hope of success for
   the Government's housing strategy, it is vital to understand the extent
   to which the housing landscape varies significantly across different
   parts of the country.},

Title = {Representative claims and beyond: a study of Muslim women's inclusion in
   the Flemish headscarf debate},
Journal = {POLITICS GROUPS AND IDENTITIES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {1},
Number = {3},
Pages = {433-450},
Abstract = {In this article, we take a stand against the relativism of contemporary
   ``claim-based{''} approaches to the study of the substantive
   representation of women (SRW), and argue for on-going evaluation of the
   responsiveness of actors' claims to speak for women. We advance the
   concept of responsiveness as a criterion for evaluating the quality of
   SRW. We define such quality in a relational manner; implying the
   inclusion of women's judgment in the representation process. We
   demonstrate the relevance of the concept of responsiveness by a study of
   Muslim women's substantive representation in the Flemish headscarf
   debate. Based upon Severs' {[}2010. `` Representation as Claims-Making:
   Quid Responsiveness?{''} Representation 46 (4): 411-423] work, we
   examine the congruence between the claims to speak for Muslim women
   formulated by, on the one hand, political parties and, on the other,
   Muslim women. The important incongruence found between the claims
   formulated by right-wing and liberal parties and those of Muslim women
   showcases that representative claims do not unequivocally serve to
   include Muslim women's voices in the representation process. Right-wing
   and liberal parties' claims served to exclude, delegitimize, and
   otherwise marginalize Muslim women's voices; evoking concerns for the
   gendered and racial inequalities in representative systems and Muslim
   women's capacity for democratic inclusion within them.},

   paradigmatic shift in the EU's approach to democracy, the conceptual
   structure of these documents maintains unaltered the substantively
   liberal model for both development and democratization. This is likely
   to leave the EU's pre-Uprisings reputational deficit concerning

Abstract = {The use of drones has increased exponentially in recent years, causing a
   mounting wave of concern amongst the media and public about the
   implications of using unmanned systems - often misunderstood in their
   nature - above all in terms of accountability, legitimacy and
   `fairness'. David Whetham explores the many facets of this question,
   delving into the often-overlooked nuances of the use of
   remote-controlled systems and its practical as well as moral
   implications.},

Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},

Volume = {50},

Pages = {553-579},
Abstract = {Norbert Elias's theory of civilising processes has been received only
   marginally in the USA, one of the obstacles being the absence of
   figurational or process studies of American society. In the first decade
   of this century this situation was changed by the publication of Stephen
   Mennell's The American Civilizing Process (2007) and Cas Wouters' Sex
   and Manners (2004) and Informalization (2007). By 2012, Randall Collins
   had reviewed the first and the third books in two essays (2009, 2011).
   His claims and criticism of civilising and informalisation theory are
   discussed in this paper by placing them in the context of the reception
   history of Elias's work since the 1960s, when a first round of
   discussion centred on criteria to be used for determining the direction
   of civilising processes. A second round was in the 1990s, and in this
   paper we contribute to a new round by presenting a summary of earlier
   critical discussions in an attempt to establish a more solid and subtler
   body of criteria for studying civilising processes. We use this in
   critically discussing Collins's contributions, linking them to symbolic
   interactionism, American National Ideology, and blind spots in American
   sociology.},

Abstract = {This article considers how partisanship conditions attitudes toward
   corruption. Stirred by the puzzle of why corruption does not seem to
   have the electoral consequences we would expect, it explores whether
   party supporters are more tolerant toward corruption cases when they
   affect their own party. The partisan-bias hypothesis is confirmed by a
   survey experiment carried out in Spain, a country where a number of
   corruption scandals have been recently visible. The results show that
   the same offense is judged differently depending on whether the
   responsible politician is a member of the respondent's party, of unknown
   partisan affiliation, or of a rival party. Furthermore, the degree of
   partisan bias depends on political sophistication. This suggests that
   although partisanship may induce tolerance to same-party corruption
   practices, the partisan bias disappears when political awareness is
   high.},

Abstract = {Why does personal income taxation (PIT) remain relatively low in many
   developing countries despite a period of democratic advancement and
   rapid economic growth? This stylized fact is hard to reconcile with
   standard political economy models of taxation that expect democratic
   regimes to bring about redistribution in countries that suffer from high
   inequality. This article argues that the details of political
   institutions are key to understand why PIT remains low in many
   developing and unequal countries. In particular, we show how legislative
   malapportionment may prevent the use of personal income taxes as a major
   revenue source by skewing the distribution of political power across
   groups. Malapportionment is usually not exogenous but the result of
   design by those with political power at the transition or reform moment.
   As such, it depends on the structure of political and economic power in
   society. Based on a sample of more than 50 countries between 1990 and
   2007, this article finds that (a) countries with historically more
   unequal distributions of wealth and income tend to systematically
   present higher levels of legislative malapportionment and (b) higher
   levels of malapportionment are associated with lower shares of personal
   income taxes in GDP.},

Abstract = {The paper compares political ideas and acts in the Soviet Union under
   Gorbachev and in Communist Vietnam. It argues that the Gorbachev group,
   committed to progressive change, concluded that power granted to them by
   their position in the Soviet system needed to be eliminated, creating a
   boot strap' problem. To secure progressive change they had first to
   destroy their own power base. By contrast, the ruling Vietnamese
   Communist Party (VCP) attempted, in the two decades after the emergence
   of a market economy in 1989-1991, to rule an increasingly open society
   through Soviet political institutions. By the late noughties' Vietnam
   faced a crisis of domestic sovereignty, with politics largely a matter
   of spoils, with policy largely irrelevant and unimplementable, and
   usually blocked by powerful interests. The paper argues that Hinsley's
   notion of the sovereignty issue makes this situation far easier to
   analyse. It argues that the Gorbachev group's analysis would have led to
   them predicting that the VCP's attempt to use Soviet institutions to
   rule over a globalising and increasingly open society with a market
   economy would lead to a crisis of political authority, and that they
   would have been correct. This leads to the counter-intuitive position
   that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was a success - in that it
   managed to solve a serious political problem, i.e. how to create the
   preconditions for a political system suited to a market economy in a
   relatively open society - and the VCP a failure.},

Abstract = {Publicity is central to terrorism, but demonstrating a link between
   press freedom and the targeting of attacks is challenging. There are
   several reasons for this: (1) studies do not distinguish between press
   freedom and press attention; (2) perpetrators use press freedom to weed
   out unacceptable targets rather than to determine which targets to
   attack; (3) only foreign, not domestic, perpetrators depend on press
   attention; and (4) foreign terrorists satisfy their desire for press
   attention by attacking powerful states. Our models confirm this argument
   about press freedom and national power even after controlling for
   executive constraints, polity, and foreign policy activity.},

Abstract = {A conflict between religious male soldiers and secular female soldiers
   has emerged since the 2000s within the Israel Defense Forces. This clash
   has gradually taken the form of religious rhetoric, articulated by
   rabbis and other religious activists, that has moved from refraining
   from publicly questioning the fitness of women as combatants to
   discourse that gradually delegitimized women's service. Based on the
   theoretical theme of the split labor market, I will argue that there is
   a link between the extent to which the growing introduction of women
   into field units threatens to devalue the religious youth's symbolic
   rewards and the escalation in anti-feminist rhetoric, whose ultimate
   goal is to exclude women from the military.},

Abstract = {In democracies, a constant tension exists between the stability and
   integrity of the community as a whole, and the desire to ensure
   minorities a voice in politics. Reserved seats and reduced thresholds
   are two common means by which ethnic minorities gain legislative seats,
   though little or no empirical work exists testing their efficacy in this
   regard. Combining multivariate analysis with in-depth case studies, this
   article shows that both reserved seats and lower thresholds increase
   minority representation, though reserved seats accomplish that goal more
   consistently. Reduced thresholds tend to increase the share of votes and
   seats won by ethnoregional parties but reserved seats do not.
   Additionally, Mauritius' unusual best-loser system aids both minorities
   and ethnoregional parties. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the dynamics of public opinion on cultural
   policy issues over the past four decades. We find collective opinions on
   many such issues follow the same path over time, driven by an underlying
   cultural policy mood (CPM). We use more than 2,000 survey marginals,
   nested in more than 200 time series, that reflect aggregate opinions in
   16 cultural policy domains, across 38 years. Using a dynamic principal
   components method, the results show that since the early 1970s, CPM has
   moved steadily and consistently in a liberal direction. Over this
   period, changes in CPM have been tightly linked to changes in aggregate
   religiosity. Opinion on two notable cultural issues-the death penalty
   and abortion-do not follow CPM. While public opinion has grown
   increasingly anti-death-penalty for more than a decade, over roughly the
   same period it has become as pro-life on abortion as at any time since
   Roe v. Wade. The measurement of CPM provides evidence of a macro
   construct of cultural issues that includes opinion toward many, but not
   all, morality policies.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to provide a perspective on the development
   of knowledge and the teaching of Political Science on Africa from a
   South African view point. The article sketches the historical context of
   the study of the politics of the continent in relation to various
   institutions. It also discusses the development of teachers and scholars
   who were involved in the emerging field of study as well as some of the
   controversy around the transformation of the higher education sector in
   the country. Publications on the politics of Africa suggest an initial
   focus on the core issues in the politics of South Africa, and only later
   on the continent itself. Some of the professional associations are also
   referred to. The conclusion is reached that the study of the politics of
   Africa in South Africa is more than an idea and is becoming more
   centrally located in the discipline as well as in allied
   multi-disciplinary approaches, and is poised for further growth as the
   countries of the continent become more integrated.},

Abstract = {Extant research in political science has demonstrated that citizens'
   opinions on policies are influenced by their attachment to the party
   sponsoring them. At the same time, little evidence exists illuminating
   the psychological processes through which such party cues are filtered.
   From the psychological literature on source cues, we derive two possible
   hypotheses: (1) party cues activate heuristic processing aimed at
   minimizing the processing effort during opinion formation, and (2) party
   cues activate group motivational processes that compel citizens to
   support the position of their party. As part of the latter processes,
   the presence of party cues would make individuals engage in effortful
   motivated reasoning to produce arguments for the correctness of their
   party's position. Following psychological research, we use response
   latency to measure processing effort and, in support of the motivated
   reasoning hypothesis, demonstrate that across student and nationally
   representative samples, the presence of party cues increases processing
   effort.},

Abstract = {This article evaluates the influence of corruption on how individuals
   assess the state of democracy in their country. Distinguishing between
   individual perceptions of small-scale corruption and macro-level
   corruption trends, we are interested in the question: which of the two
   indicators influences citizens' judgments of their regime? Controlling
   for ten micro-level factors (i.e. individuals' satisfaction with the
   government, economy, education system, their participation in social
   activities, their feeling of public safety, and their assessment on
   whether they are discriminated against, as well as the four demographics
   gender, age, education and income) and four contextual factors (i.e.
   development, economic growth, democratic stock, and income inequalities)
   our hierarchical linear model offers some nuanced results. First, we
   find that an individual's assessment of whether the police and the
   judges are corrupted influences his or her satisfaction with democracy.
   Second, our results indicate that the same finding does not apply for
   the broad macro-level corruption indicator; macro-level corruption is
   rather unrelated to how a person judges the quality of democracy in his
   or her country.},

Abstract = {In this paper I apply the model of dictatorship, developed in my 1998
   book, The Political Economy of Dictatorship, and elsewhere, to
   understand the workings of the North Korean regime. I argue that
   initially, under Kim II Sung it was a Soviet-style regime but the shocks
   of the 1990s-the fall of communism in Russia and Eastern Europe, the
   capitalist turn of China, the economic takeoff of South Korea and the
   succession crisis caused by Kim II Sung's death threatened the stability
   of that regime. Kim Jong II shored up the regime by marrying it to the
   military. However, military rule is typically unstable. Kim Jong II
   resolved this paradox essentially by militarizing the entire society.
   This is the distinctive feature of the regime. I analyze the stability
   of that regime, and ask whether engagement or isolation is the best way
   for the rest of the world to deal with North Korea.},

Abstract = {While Germany is generally considered one of the most important
   democracy promoters, there is still limited work on the German approach
   to promoting democracy. There is a general understanding that Germany -
   as a civilian power - should be guided by democratic values in its
   external affairs, but it is neither theoretically nor empirically very
   clear what this means for the actual practice of democracy promotion.
   The present paper contributes to filling this gap by (1) locating
   democracy promotion as a foreign policy aim and instrument in the role
   conception of civilian power, (2) summarising the fragmented state of
   the art on German democracy promotion, (3) presenting results of a
   qualitative content analysis in order to reconstruct the main features
   of the official outline of German democracy promotion, and (4)
   confronting these programmatic findings with a brief comparative view on
   the practice of German democracy promotion towards Bolivia, Turkey and
   Russia.},

Abstract = {We investigate the partisan foundations of political legitimacy. We
   argue that the goals parties pursue shape their supporters' views about
   the political system via the messages they communicate about the
   desirability of the political system. Combining public opinion survey
   data collected in 15 democracies with data on the goal orientations and
   policy positions of 116 political parties, we find that office-seeking
   parties take more positive positions toward the status quo of the
   political regime than policy-seeking parties. Moreover, we find that
   these positions have consequences. Specifically, supporters of parties
   with more positive positions toward the system report systematically
   higher levels of support than supporters of parties that communicate
   more negative views. Taken together, these findings suggest that
   political parties play an active role in shaping citizens' views of the
   political system and that office-seeking parties in particular mobilize
   consent among citizens in contemporary democracies.},

Title = {Opening up divides: centralization of decisions and online interaction

Abstract = {This paper aims to study the relationship between the centralization of
   decisions in three of the leading parties on today's Catalan political
   scene-CIU, ERC and PSC-and the interaction that they offer both on their
   websites and on Facebook. We have two working hypotheses. The first
   refers to the parties with greater centralization of decisions offering
   fewer opportunities for interaction on their website than the ones that
   have a lesser degree of centralization. The second hypothesis notes that
   the involvement of the public on the parties' social networks, in this
   case Facebook, does not necessarily have to match the party's degree of
   centralization. The reason for this lies in the channels of interaction
   of the websites being designed by the parties themselves whereas the
   structure of Facebook is pre-set and its use depends to a much greater
   extent on the web users who want to get involved and the issues that
   arise in the political sphere. The results show that the centralization
   of all of the parties is high, even though there is some variation, and
   that, in addition, there are few differences with regard to the channels
   of interaction offered by the parties on their websites. By contrast,
   there are significant differences between the parties in terms of the
   interaction found on the Facebook pages. This interaction appears to
   depend more on the predominant issues on the political scene than on the
   level of centralization of the decisions that may set the parties apart.
   This is an initial preliminary work that will subsequently be completed
   with the inclusion of the other parties in the Catalan political arena.},

Abstract = {Jurgen Habermas's theory of `discourse ethics' has been an important
   source of inspiration for theories of deliberative democracy and is
   typically contrasted with agonistic conceptions of democracy represented
   by theorists such as Chantal Mouffe. In this article I show that this
   contrast is overstated. By focusing on the different philosophical
   traditions that underpin Mouffe's and Habermas's respective approaches,
   commentators have generally overlooked the political similarities
   between these thinkers. I examine Habermas's and Mouffe's respective
   conceptions of democratic politics and argue that they cannot be so
   neatly distinguished from each other. I show that much of Mouffe's
   criticism of Habermas's theory does not hold up to careful scrutiny, and
   discourse ethics shares important points of similarity with her own
   democratic theory. By using critical republican theory to show the
   similarities in their work, I push beyond the agonistic versus
   deliberative debate, and show that at the heart of both of these
   approaches is a critical republican emphasis on the need for civic
   solidarity, on the constructive role of conflict in democratic politics
   and on the vital importance of self-government. These are crucial
   ingredients for the regeneration of democracy in contemporary
   pluralistic societies.},

Abstract = {What would happen if all parties competing in the electoral game were
   forced to hold open, binding, concurrent and obligatory primaries
   constrained by a Sore Loser Law? The answer to this question has not
   been explored, perhaps because there is only one democracy in the world
   that has applied such rules more than once: Uruguay. This country offers
   a fertile ground for testing some of the hypotheses developed by the
   literature. This research supports the hypotheses that (i) candidates
   selected in primary elections with more than one candidate are likely to
   be the ones located farthest away from the median voter, but closer to
   the partys constituents and (ii) there is an optimal level of
   competitiveness in primaries, beyond which either higher or lower
   competition can damage the party in the corresponding general elections.
   The implications of this study have relevant bearing on critical
   questions that academics, politicians and political reformers regularly
   ask about primaries, not only in the UK, but also elsewhere.},

Abstract = {The secret ballot is considered a central feature of free and fair
   elections all over the world. While the reasons to uphold it seem to be
   overwhelming, we argue that the secret ballot is only second-best at
   best and that a modified version of open voting might prove to be more
   democratic. Instead of denying the various problems and difficulties
   that an open system might encounter, we want to offer a genuine proposal
   that can avoid these numerous pitfalls. After rehearsing the various
   arguments pro and contra open voting, we draw attention to the role of
   shame, which has been neglected by both sides in the debate. While shame
   plays a pivotal role in the democratic argument pro open voting, it also
   brings out new problems that tell against opening up the vote. This
   means that, if we want to draw on the democratic potential of open
   voting, we will have to find a system that minimizes the undesirable
   effects of shame. In the third and final section, we will formulate a
   concrete proposal of open voting that we believe is more democratic than
   the current secret ballot and is able to avoid potential worries. Even
   if this proves to be highly speculative, it serves as an invitation for
   further empirical research.},

Title = {Coalition portfolios and interest group influence over the policy
   process},
Journal = {INTEREST GROUPS \& ADVOCACY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {2},
Number = {3},
Pages = {251-277},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {An interest group coalition exists whenever two or more interest groups
   collaborate in advocating their public policy agendas. Working together
   in coalition is one of the most common tactics that interest groups use
   to advance their interests in the policy process. The extant literature
   on coalitions emphasizes interest group decisions to participate or not
   in one coalition, or their strategy toward coalitions in general, but
   gives insufficient attention to interest group participation in multiple
   coalitions. To rectify this deficit, this article examines the
   implications of groups' participation in multiple coalitions for their
   ability to influence the policy process. In order to account for
   interest group involvement in multiple coalitions, we introduce the
   concept of the coalition portfolio, which is the set of all coalitions
   within a given area of public policy in which an interest group
   participates at a particular point in time. The portfolio concept
   recognizes that interest groups may have a wide variety of coalition
   strategies depending on the mix of coalitions that they join. Variations
   in the structure of these portfolios matter both to interest groups and
   to policymakers. Moreover, coalition portfolios evolve over time as
   coalitions form and dissolve, and as political conditions adjust over
   the course of the policy process. We develop and test hypotheses that
   the change in the composition of coalition portfolios increases the
   influence of interest groups over public policy when: (i) the number of
   coalitions in a group's portfolio gets larger; (ii) the average size of
   the coalitions in a group's portfolio gets larger or smaller; and (iii)
   a group's portfolio improves its position within the overall network of
   coalitions. Network position is measured based on the betweenness of
   interest groups in coalition networks, which gives higher scores to
   groups that lie on the shortest paths between other groups. We test
   these hypotheses while accounting for other explanations for interest
   group influence, including: (i) the group's position in communication
   networks; (ii) the group's number of registered lobbyists working on
   Medicare; (iii) whether or not the group has a Political Action
   Committee; (iv) the extent to which a group's lobbying contacts lean
   toward one political party; (v) whether or not the group endorsed the
   legislation in question; (vi) the organization's age in years; and (vii)
   whether the group is a citizens advocacy organization, a business
   advocacy organization or some other organizational type. We evaluate
   these hypotheses using a study of 115 interest groups involved in the
   enactment and implementation of the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003.
   This legislation established an outpatient prescription drug benefit in
   Medicare - a government health insurance program for the elderly and
   disabled in the United States - and made other significant changes to
   the program. We conducted personal interviews with representatives of
   102 of these groups. We analyzed data resulting from these interviews
   using negative binomial and ordinary least squares regression models.
   The results support Hypothesis (iii); groups gain influence over the
   policy process when their coalition portfolios increase the extent to
   which they are situated between other groups in the coalition network.
   However, interest groups are limited in the extent to which they can
   create portfolios that have desirable levels of betweenness because
   network position is also a function of membership decisions made by all
   other groups in the network.
   These results provide insight into how the composition of coalition
   portfolios affects the ability of interest groups to exert influence
   over the policy process. This analysis is most directly applicable to
   policy debates over complex pieces of legislation.},

   Pareto-enhancing nature of drafting vis-a-vis decentralized mechanisms
   of self-selection. I firstly derive the optimal size of a committee
   based on the assumption of informative voting and, then, I show that it
   is globally optimal amongst all voting equilibrium strategies. I
   subsequently compare it to the various symmetric equilibria that may
   arise in a complete information setting or a Bayesian environment with
   heterogeneous private costs. I finally sketch out an optimal transfer
   scheme that can ex ante implement the socially efficient committee size.},

Abstract = {This article tests several hypotheses about distributive politics by
   studying the distribution of federal spending across US states over the
   period 1978-2002. It improves on previous work by using survey data to
   measure the share of voters in each state that are Democrats,
   Republicans and Independents, or liberals, conservatives and moderates.
   No evidence is found that the allocation of federal spending to the
   states is distorted by strategic manipulation to win electoral support.
   States with many swing voters are not advantaged compared to states with
   more loyal voters, and `battleground states' are not advantaged compared
   to other states. Spending appears to have little or no effect on voters'
   choices, while partisanship and ideology have large effects.},

Abstract = {Political science instructors commonly emphasize the importance of
   effective writing. However, it is unclear that students either
   understand or share the norms about what this entails. A notable example
   is the appropriate use of voice. Prior literature has shown that
   academic writers often believe it is appropriate to use the pronoun
   ``I{''} for a variety of rhetorical purposes but suggests that students
   may be unaware of this reasoning. We examine this topic by determining
   more precisely how commonly ``I{''} is used in a major political science
   journal, conducting a survey of political science undergraduate students
   at a large comprehensive university, and interviewing political science
   faculty at the same university. Although each group's attitudes are
   complex, we find evidence that students' views commonly conflict with
   disciplinary norms. We close by considering the implications for
   teaching about writing in political science.},

Abstract = {The corroding impacts of anti-terrorism measures on citizenship have
   been much discussed in recent years. Drawing on qualitative research
   from the UK, this article argues that citizens do indeed frequently feel
   that aspects of citizenship - such as rights, duties, identity claims
   and the ability to participate in the public sphere - have been
   significantly dampened by developments in this policy area. At the same
   time, however, participants in our research also articulated a number of
   strategies through which they or others have sought to resist the
   logics, exercise and impacts of anti-terrorism powers. These included
   voicing explicit opposition to particular measures, resisting outsider'
   or victim' subject positions, and a refusal to withdraw from established
   forms of political engagement. Whilst such resistance should not be
   overstated, we argue that these strategies emphasise the co-constitutive
   rather than linear relationship between public policy and citizenship.
   Anti-terrorism powers do indeed impact upon citizenship claims, for
   instance in the curtailment of formal rights. Equally, the everyday,
   lived, experiences and practices of citizenship contribute to, and help
   shape, the perceptions and understandings of anti-terrorism policy from
   within the citizenry},

Abstract = {Critical infrastructures are ubiquitous in the modern world and include
   electrical power systems, water, gas, and other utilities, as well as
   trains and transportation systems including airports. This work is
   concerned with Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems
   that are at the heart of distributed critical infrastructures within
   airports. Modern airports are highly competitive cost driven operations
   that offer a range of public and private services. Many airport systems
   such as car parking and building control systems are SCADA controlled.
   This is achieved with sensors and controllers monitored over a large,
   geographically disperse area. To increase efficiency and to achieve cost
   savings, SCADA systems are now being connected to information technology
   system networks using TCP/IP. The merging of SCADA systems into the main
   IT network backbone is presenting new security problems for IT security
   managers. Historically, proprietary solutions, closed systems, ad-hoc
   design and implementation, and long system life cycles have led to
   significant challenges in assessing the true security posture of SCADA
   systems. To address this, this work seeks how SCADA systems are being
   integrated into the IT network within a modern airport. From this new
   standpoint we will be able to identify ways in which SCADA may be
   vulnerable to malicious attack via the IT network. The results of this
   work could offer solutions to increase security within airports.},

Abstract = {Although many think campaign donations buy influence from legislators,
   scholars have difficulty determining whether and how much influence
   contributions actually have in the legislative process. Many studies
   seek to identify the influence of donors on roll-call votes; after
   considerable debate, most scholars have concluded that donors have
   little influence on these votes. What voting studies cannot detect are
   the important but less observable opportunities to shape legislation
   that occur earlier in the legislative process. I describe and critique
   the various methods that have been used to discern donor influence in
   this legislative process. I argue that donor influence can be measured
   by combining several of these approaches, and I illustrate this
   technique using work of my own which studied the influence of
   contributions in the 99 state legislative chambers. Features of
   institutional design and politics prove to determine the amount of time
   legislators devote to fundraising and explain much of the variation in
   influence among the chambers. I also discuss the extent to which
   contributions work in tandem with lobbying to influence the legislative
   process: Is the ``access{''} or the ``informational{''} model of
   lobbying correct? Finally, I examine whether campaign finance laws can
   lessen the influence of contributions, and discuss an agenda for future
   research.},

Abstract = {This article argues that communism is currently emerging as a new mode
   of production, namely, peer production (PP), which produces commons
   instead of commodity. In PP, producers produce commons through voluntary
   participation in distributed network-based communities of production.
   Each volunteer chooses the tasks she performs, the amount of time she
   devotes to the collective production, and the place and time of her
   productive activity. In terms of distribution, the digital commons are
   available for free on the net. The rights to relatively scarce commons
   are still emerging, but they might be relatively restrictive compared
   with rights to digital commons. Analysing this new mode of production,
   the article attempts to show why and how it can replace capitalism.},

Abstract = {The Canadian model of the electoral competition regulation is, probably,
   one of the most interesting in the world, as it places the concern about
   equity or equality of chances between the electoral competitors in the
   center of the debate. In its first part, this article offers an overview
   of the model's construction, paying attention to the role of the
   dialogue between the legislature and the judiciary in that process. The
   second part deals with the most relevant judicial debates about
   questions like third party expenditures, electoral broadcasting
   regulation and thresholds to qualify for public financing, showing that
   these debates were really about a larger ideological question: namely,
   whether an egalitarian or libertarian model of election regulation would
   prevail in Canada. In the final part of the article, we can find some of
   the questions that remain open for debate, like the challenge of the
   public funding in the recent legislative reform.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {12},
Number = {4},
Pages = {347-367},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The central contention of this article is that contemporary liberal
   theory is without an account of what legitimates coercing those who
   reject liberalism that is consistent with its own stipulations of the
   conditions of political legitimacy. After exploring the nature of the
   liberal principle of legitimacy, and in particular how it is intended to
   function as a way of protecting individuals from domination and
   oppression by reconciling freedom and public law, the article considers
   four different possible accounts of what might legitimate coercing
   non-liberals. While some of them have independent plausibility, the
   article argues that none of them meets the requirements of liberal
   legitimacy. The final section of the article considers the implications
   of this theoretical gap for liberal theory more widely. The argument is
   made that liberalism must accept that even liberal politics will
   necessitate the oppressive use of coercive power, i.e. compelling people
   to live according to wills other than their own, and that insofar as
   this is a position central to the recent burgeoning literature on
   political realism, liberalism ought therefore to be more realist.},

Abstract = {In Timor-Leste, women lack a voice in customary governance processes.
   Since independence in 2002, the Timor-Leste government has adopted
   policies that provide equal rights for men and women and promote the
   inclusion of women in decision-making structures at national and local
   levels. Women's participation in democratic governance has been
   supported by international development agencies. This article draws on
   field research in Timor-Leste in 2011 to investigate the experiences of
   women leaders in national and local governance structures. It analyzes
   the strategies to promote a national women's agenda in national politics
   as well as the challenges for women representatives on community
   governance councils. A case study on domestic violence provides analysis
   of the inconsistencies between customary leadership and the
   constitutional right to equality. The article argues that greater
   integration of the customary and national governance systems would
   better support the human rights principles to which Timor-Leste is
   committed.},

Abstract = {Thomas Mann draws more and more the attention of philosophers and
   philosophy scholars. Indeed, his work shows a remarkable degree of
   conceptual intensity. The cultural refinement and richness of many of
   his writings are notewhorty and contribute to the discussion of themes
   and questions which traditionally are associated with philosophical
   studies. By reviewing and illustrating them, the present essay gives an
   account of some interpretative perspectives and traditions which over
   the last years have enriched the comprehension of Thomas Mann's works
   and have integrated them into larger intellectual debates: from cultural
   history and philosophy of culture (Kulturphilosophie) to music and
   musicology, from theories about the irony of art to political culture. A
   particular stress is put on the recent German critical edition of
   Betrachtungen eines Unpolitischen by Hermann Kurzke: his commentary and
   philological findings provide new interpretative perspectives and ideas
   which show how much that essay, written by Mann during the years of the
   First World War, can be of interest also for history of political
   thought scholars.},

Abstract = {This article examines the key attributes of members of parliament from
   Solomon Islands. Drawing on bio-data on MPs, interviews and election
   results, the authors' findings show that politicians are getting older,
   have atypical education levels and are from an increasingly diverse
   range of occupational backgrounds. The authors also find that, while
   Solomon Islands MPs are a political elite of sorts, they remain tightly
   tied to their communities. They consider the implications of these
   findings for research on developmental leadership, political
   professionalisation and elite theory. They argue that none of these
   three literatures adequately captures the political trajectories of
   politicians in Solomon Islands but that this case study contributes to
   research in these areas.},

Abstract = {This article explores the consequences for women's citizenship that
   arise from the Good Friday/Belfast Agreement. It argues that, despite
   the promises of inclusion and equality set out in the peace document,
   subsequent institutional arrangements and policy decisions have retained
   gendered exclusions and reasserted gender stereotypes. With the further
   institutionalisation of ethnonationalism as the dominant political
   discourse through the changes ratified in the St Andrews Agreement, the
   political settlement has failed to address fully the gendered legacy of
   conflict and fulfil the democratic promises of advancing women's
   citizenship claims. However, despite persisting constraints, women
   continue the pattern of active civic engagement in the community and
   voluntary sector and pursue lobbying strategies that strive to make
   their claims relevant in institutionalised policymaking spheres. At the
   same time, the article maintains that the emergence of new forms of
   feminist grass-roots activism, exemplified by the Belfast Feminist
   Network, contributes to enhancing women's citizenship claims in the
   broader cultural and social context of post-Agreement Northern Ireland.},

Abstract = {What determines state success when petitioning the U.S. Supreme Court
   for review? We suggest that states can improve the likelihood of
   securing Supreme Court review by coordinating litigation efforts. This
   coordination occurs in two ways. First, some states coordinate their
   appellate litigation efforts internally through the creation of state
   solicitors general offices. Second, external coordination occurs when
   states join amicus briefs at the agenda setting stage urging the Supreme
   Court to grant review in state-filed cases. Using new data on all
   state-filed certiorari petitions from the 2001-2009 terms, we find that
   internal and external coordination is associated with an increased
   likelihood of the Supreme Court granting review in state-filed cases.},

Abstract = {Distributive political theory is applied to whether politics versus risk
   determines government spending across four grant programs purposed for
   homeland security. A model of security funding is tested with data from
   U. S. states from 2004 to 2006. Findings support politics over risk when
   programs are designed to award universal benefits to elected officials,
   such as with fair-sharing policies. However, risk explains funding when
   programs award narrow, particularistic benefits, such as with urban
   security initiatives. A key conclusion is that fair-share strategies in
   grant politics can actually produce unfair allocation outcomes in the
   area of security. Also, protecting status quo formulas is in the
   interest of political actors, especially if they might otherwise lose
   opportunities to secure resources for constituents (state and local
   governments) in a distressed economy.},

Abstract = {A study on the value of volunteers as resources for non-profit
   organizations in welfare services in Iceland is described. The topic
   relates to an international academic discussion on the volunteer
   function within non-profit organizations. The discussion has until now
   focused more on the supply of volunteers than demand. This article is to
   meet the need for analysis of how non-profit organization use volunteers
   as resources. The study is based on the authors' database from 2011 on
   the majority of active non-profit organizations in welfare services in
   Iceland and an analysis of their respective web sites in 2013. It is
   concluded that even though volunteers exist within most non-profits,
   their role cannot be considered essential and is limited to governance
   boards and time-limited activities, such as fund raising. The level of
   activity of volunteers depends on the operational size and the role of
   the organization. Their input decreases with increased number of paid
   staff and their activity is less within non-profit service providers
   than member oriented and campaign organizations. The finding is in
   harmony with international research, for example on the effects of
   professionalization within the third sector. The research conclusion is
   noteworthy having in mind international research which indicates that
   the interest of the general public to become volunteers has essentially
   not changed in the past decades. The current findings raise the issue of
   how well traditional organizations of non-profits meet the needs of the
   public for volunteering.},

Abstract = {Thus far, recent protests in the Arab world have led to different
   political outcomes including regime change, civil war, and suppression
   by regime. The present paper explores the reasons behind these different
   outcomes. The research methodology is a comparative case study approach,
   and five countries of Tunisia, Egypt, Bahrain, Libya, and Syria are
   examined. The hypothesis is that the different political outcomes of the
   protests are due to a combination of factors, including the level of
   mobilization of anti-regime movements, the responses of national
   militaries, and finally the reaction of international powers. Different
   configurations of these components in the crisis-stricken countries have
   led to different political outcomes.},

Abstract = {Do perceptions of Muslim communities differ among receiving European
   societies? Are attitudes towards Euro-Turks more critical than other
   groups? Do Euro-Turks feel marginalized and recognize social distance
   from the majority? This paper presents data from cross-national research
   projects to assess the social distance between national majority and
   Muslim minorities, in particular Euro-Turks. It also considers the
   extent to which religion, ethnicity, and culture help shape Islamophobia
   and anti-Turkish attitudes. Social distance is not treated as a proxy
   variable for discrimination or exclusion, but it serves as an indicator
   of the possible marginalization of Euro-Turks. Further, increasing
   social distance between majority and minority Muslim groups may also
   serve as a reliable indicator of a Europe in crisis, confronting its
   multiple conflicting identities.},

Abstract = {The precipitous ascent of the All-Ukrainian Union Svoboda is not in
   itself remarkable; nor is the special role it has played in creating an
   ``uncivil society{''} in Galicia something extraordinary. But certain
   features of Svoboda's rise do distinguish it from the histories of
   ultraright parties in other countries: the existence of a real external
   danger to Ukraine from Russia; the tension between Svoboda's Galician
   historical discourse and its national ambitions; its close cooperation
   with Ukrainian democrats; and its voters' diverse motives. These factors
   make it an exceptional ultranationalist party.},

Abstract = {The nature of one's work, not just who one works for, is central to
   political and economic life. Yet models of trade policy preferences
   mostly ignore occupation, focusing exclusively on industries (perhaps
   because industries are the usual organizing dimension of economic
   policymaking). This article proposes new measures of how much risk trade
   imposes on different workers based on how diversified their occupation
   is across industries, thus considering both industry and occupation.
   Having a job specific to any sector appears to encourage protectionism,
   regardless of that sector's comparative advantage, supporting the idea
   that public opinion may treat trade policy as insurance.},

Abstract = {Drawing on classical Athens the paper explores the qualities and
   workings of direct democracy and provides a simple model of public
   choice to analyse policymaking with specific reference to war and peace.
   Given the cost and the benefits of defence and the public revenues at
   the time, it looks into the motives, processes and consequences of
   decision-making for war or peace in two historical situations (the
   Themistocles' Naval Law and the Eubulus' and Lycurgus' ``social
   contracts{''}) to ascertain that under direct democracy
   economically-motivated, bounded-rational individuals tend to designate
   policies that advance their personal welfare along with the overall
   welfare of the community. Moreover, such a policy course has not only
   economic, but also political and social implications: it entrenches
   direct democracy to the polity and reinforces equality, freedom,
   security and solidarity among the people.},

Abstract = {News about the European Union (EU) looks different in different
   countries at different points in time. This study investigates
   explanations for cross-national and over-time variation in news media
   coverage of EU affairs drawing on large-scale media content analyses of
   newspapers and television news in the EU-15 (1999), EU-25 (2004) and
   EU-27 (2009) in relation to European Parliament (EP) elections. The
   analyses focus in particular on explanatory factors pertaining to media
   characteristics and the political elites. Results show that national
   elites play an important role for the coverage of EU matters during EP
   election campaigns. The more strongly national parties are divided about
   the EU in combination with overall more negative positions towards the
   EU, the more visible the news. Also, increases in EU news visibility
   from one election to the next and the Europeanness of the news are
   determined by a country's elite positions. The findings are discussed in
   light of the EU's alleged communication deficit.},

Abstract = {This article examines the role of the Peace Corps in U.S. foreign policy
   and specifically explores the role of the Peace Corps in improving the
   popular image of the United States. I empirically test the hypothesis
   that the presence of a Peace Corps program enhances a positive of view
   of the United States held by the people of that country. Using logistic
   regression analysis, I show that the presence of Peace Corps Volunteers
   (PCVs) in a country positively influences individuals' views toward the
   United States. I analyze survey research from the region of Latin
   America using datasets from the Latinobarometer public opinion survey.
   Furthermore, I present a theoretical explanation to understand how the
   presence of PCVs can lead to an improved perception of the United
   States. This explanation draws from the contact hypothesis originally
   proposed by Gordon Allport.},

Abstract = {Few parts of Europe see as much religious observance as Northern
   Ireland, and fewer places in Europe have religion as one of the major
   cleavages on which politics seems to rest. In this article we argue that
   although religion is an important identifier, it acts as a reinforcer of
   ethno-national differences rather than as an intrinsically important
   difference itself. Religious differences while often symbolically
   important rarely emerge as points of real conflict in Northern Irish
   politics. It has had little impact on the ongoing process of
   democratization in Northern Ireland. We review an array of evidence
   which supports this conclusion. However, we find that religion still has
   a power to divide and so makes a political settlement less likely than
   an accommodation.},

Abstract = {Interpretations of Nietzsche, particularly about politics, cover an
   exceptionally wide range. Additionally, Nietzsche is often said to
   commit rhetorical excesses. I argue and show that Nietzsche consciously
   crafted his published works to allow this range of interpretations, that
   he did this for critical purposes, and that his so-called rhetoric is
   there to serve this purpose.},

   The present piece will explain the connection between this criticism and
   Oakeshoot's conservative attitude in politics, which implies a radical
   skepticism on rationalism-and theory-as a guide for political action. In
   order to do this analysis this article will focus on two facts: Michael
   Oakeshott's conservative philosophy and the evolution of British postwar
   politics, featured by the rise of Labour Party.},

Abstract = {Policy-sensitive models of judicial behaviour, whether attitudinal or
   strategic, have largely passed Britain by. This article argues that this
   neglect has been benign, because explanations of judicial decisions in
   terms of the positions of individual judges fare poorly in the British
   case. To support this argument, the non-unanimous opinions of British
   Law Lords between 1969 and 2009 are analysed. A hierarchical
   item-response model of individual judges' votes is estimated in order to
   identify judges' locations along a one-dimensional policy space. Such a
   model is found to be no better than a null model that predicts that
   every judge will vote with the majority with the same probability.
   Locations generated by the model do not represent judges' political
   attitudes, only their propensity to dissent. Consequently, judges'
   individual votes should not be used to describe them in political terms.},

Title = {Economic inequality and its asymmetric effect on civic engagement:
   evidence from post-communist countries},
Journal = {EUROPEAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},

Volume = {5},

Pages = {197-223},

Abstract = {The global increase in inequality raises concerns among scholars and
   policy-makers. However, limited evidence exists to identify how
   inequality affects citizens' behavior. This study explores the effects
   of economic inequality on participation in civil society associations by
   testing hypotheses derived from resource and conflict theories. Using a
   multilevel Poisson model in 18 post-communist countries, this study
   finds that inequality has a nonlinear effect on civil society. Economic
   inequality has a drastically demobilizing effect on associational
   participation in countries with lower income inequality; meanwhile high
   inequality has a slightly weak mobilizing effect on associational
   participation. Further tests show that the effect of inequality varies
   across different socioeconomic groups, but that the poor are most
   affected.},

Abstract = {To increase energy efficiency in Russia, subsidies should be cut and
   energy prices increased so as to create an incentive to save energy. It
   is widely believed that the Russian authorities shy away from increasing
   gas prices for private households, because they fear the political
   consequences. It is difficult to determine exactly how high gas
   consumption in private households is and the extent to which it is
   subsidized. However, in light of demographic and cultural changes and
   increases in household income, it is unlikely that the price of gas
   could become a conflict-laden issue.},

Abstract = {External shocks to democratic systems are likely to threaten the
   stability of relations between the executive and the representative
   assembly. This article investigates the impact of the so-called ``war on
   terror{''} on executive-assembly relations in comparative perspective.
   We analyze data from seven countries, which varied in terms of form of
   government, level of democracy, culture, social structure, and
   geographic location, to evaluate its effects. We find that whereas in
   some systems the ``war on terror{''} altered the balance of power
   between the executive and the assembly, in other cases the extant
   balance of power was preserved. We postulate various conditions under
   which the constitutionally sanctioned balance of power is most likely to
   be preserved in times of crisis.},

Abstract = {In May 2012, political scientists learned of efforts by representative
   Jeff Flake (R-AZ) to eliminate political science funding from the
   National Science Foundation (NSF) budget. The American Political Science
   Association (APSA) was caught off-guard, and concerned political
   scientists scrambled to contact their representatives and urge the
   amendment's defeat. Flake's initial effort to cut funds overall from the
   NSF was defeated, but a second measure, specifically to keep the NSF
   from funding political science, passed only hours later. This was the
   second time in three years that legislators targeted the NSF Political
   Science Program. Although these measures have been sponsored and widely
   supported by Republicans, some Democrats have supported these measures
   as well. This article examines the vote on the Flake Amendment to
   understand why individual representatives voted for or against cutting
   NSF funding for political science research.},

Title = {How to prevent abusive behaviour and technological crime at companies?
   An interdisciplinary study of the ICT use policies, and prevention and
   management of ``conflicts{''} in a sample of Spanish companies},
Journal = {IDP-INTERNET LAW AND POLITICS},
Year = {2013},

Abstract = {The study of improper behaviour of employees in the use of the computer
   resources that a company provides them (PC, email, mobile telephone,
   PDA, etc.) represents an area of research of growing interest, in great
   part due to the financial impact, both direct and indirect, it can have
   on profits. This article analyses the strategies for prevention and
   control of the use of new technologies by employees in a sample of
   Spanish companies.
   Governance and direction of people and the prevention of abusive
   behaviour requires, at the very least, management formulas that take
   into account the different ethical, motivational and legal aspects
   involved so that the necessary control does not impinge on the creation
   and maintenance of the climate of trust required at organizations.
   This study aims to contribute more knowledge on the reality of how
   different control mechanisms are introduced, in line with similar
   studies, though it focuses on the control activity itself and the
   company's reaction, rather than the disloyal or abusive acts of
   employees. In conclusion, certain practical guidelines for companies are
   suggested with regard to controlling the activities of employees when
   using ICTs.},

Abstract = {Der vorliegende Beitrag untersucht die weit verbreitete These, dass
   Deutschschweizer Kantone vor allem radikaldemokratische Merkmale
   aufweisen, wahrend die lateinischen Kantone starker
   liberal-reprasentative Demokratieformen besitzen. Die empirische und
   mehrdimensionale Messung der Demokratiequalitat in den Kantonen zeigt,
   dass die pauschale These der direktdemokratisch-partizipatorischen
   Deutschschweizer Kantone auf der einen Seite und der
   reprasentativdemokratischen Stande der lateinischen Schweiz auf der
   anderen Seite der Komplexitat der kantonalen Demokratien nicht gerecht
   wird. Als erklarungskraftige Alternative fur die Positionen der Kantone
   auf den Achsen liberaler und radikaler Demokratien an der Schwelle des
   21. Jahrhunderts erweist sich vielmehr die Starke der liberalen und
   demokratischen Verfassungsbewegungen in den Kantonen Mitte des 19.

Abstract = {This research note replicates Leigh's (2008) analysis of pork-barrelling
   in Australian politics and tests the validity of his findings using
   geographic techniques. Distributive politics is integral to nearly all
   theories of legislative politics because it is fundamental to the
   connection between legislators and constituents, and can be used to
   facilitate coalition-building. This note addresses an aspect of
   pork-barrelling that has been overlooked in most previous scholarship.
   It argues that distributive politics is, at its core, a geographic,
   constituency-centred process. It is therefore essential to reconsider
   the conventional models and take geography into account in both
   substantive and statistical terms. To that end, we replicate several of
   Leigh's results using a relatively new technique, Geographically
   Weighted Regression, and reveal substantial spatial heterogeneity in the
   coefficients. Our findings highlight the importance of political
   geography and have important implications for studies of legislative
   politics and elections.},

Abstract = {Although scholars of international security share a skepticism for the
   extent to which agreements can be externally enforced, much existing
   game-theoretic work involves strong forms of commitment. Building on the
   canonical model of crisis bargaining, this article analyzes the role of
   two forms of commitment in bargaining: the ability to commit to a
   settlement and the ability to commit to end negotiations and initiate
   war fighting. The findings show that, contrary to expectations, allowing
   a proposer to retract their offer after learning of its acceptance does
   not lead to greater demands. Instead, a rational actor can be best off
   if he or she honors the accepted agreement in crisis bargaining, even
   though the act of accepting an offer changes the proposer's beliefs
   about the probability that an offer is acceptable. However, allowing a
   proposer to continue bargaining in lieu of fighting does change the
   dynamics of bargaining, although this effect diminishes as players
   become more patient. Finally, when there is no commitment to offers (or
   fighting after a rejected proposal), the behavior is the same as that
   found in the model with only renegotiation of agreements, and thus
   mirrors the behavior in the model in which both forms of commitment are
   present.},

Abstract = {The standard explanation for increasing party polarization in Congress
   is based on factors that would affect all policy issues simultaneously.
   We show that this has not happened. We examine the dimensionality of
   legislative choice in the House of Representatives, scaling eighteen
   issues in each Congress from 1965 through 2004. We detect considerable
   variability in issue dimensionality, an evolution in the structure of
   choice over time, and changes in the relationship between party unity
   and issue dimensionality. Our findings suggest that polarization has
   occurred on an issue-by-issue basis, reinvigorating the debate over the
   role of policy substance in shaping congressional politics.},

Abstract = {Does professionalization vary across interest group type? Even though an
   empirical assessment of interest group professionalization is crucial to
   understand their potential for enhancing the democratic legitimacy of
   the European Union, little is known about the internal configuration of
   interest groups. Although some argue that professionalization differs
   systematically across interest group type, others suggest that
   institutional pressures lead to converging professionalization patterns,
   so that cause groups and sectional groups are similarly
   professionalized. However, these assertions are based on case studies
   focusing only on a small number of interest groups, which makes it
   difficult to draw general conclusions. To overcome this important
   shortcoming, we provide an empirical analysis of professionalization
   patterns that is based on a comprehensive survey conducted among a wide
   variety of interest groups. Our findings indicate that
   professionalization patterns do not vary systematically across interest
   group type. By contrast, cause groups and sectional groups are similarly
   professionalized.},

Abstract = {Criticisms of the system by which the American political parties select
   their candidates focus on issues of representativeness-how choices are
   dominated by relatively small numbers of ideologically extreme primary
   voters, or how residents of small states voting early in the process
   have disproportionate influence. This paper adds a different concern,
   albeit one that still addresses representativeness. How well do primary
   and caucus voters represent their own values and interests with their
   vote choices? Lau and Redlawsk's notion of ``correct voting{''} is
   applied to the 2008 U.S. nominating contests. Four reasons to expect
   levels of correct voting to be lower in caucus and primary elections
   than in general election campaigns are discussed. Results suggest that
   voters in U.S. nominating contests do much worse than voters in general
   election campaigns, often barely doing better than chance in selecting
   the candidate who best represents their own values and priorities.
   Discussion focuses on institutional reforms that should improve
   citizens' ability to make correct voting choices in caucuses and
   primaries.},

Abstract = {This article is principally concerned with the transnational and
   domestic governance regimes that oversee American-style universities in
   the Persian Gulf region. In the current context of globalization, social
   scientists have examined the mechanisms by which organizational
   practices are transferred when transnational corporations establish
   subsidiaries in other countries or when international nongovernmental
   organizations collaborate with partners in the developing world to
   create externally developed prescriptions translated into locally viable
   action. Comparatively little work, however, has been done on the
   challenges of exporting, from one cultural and political context to
   another, an institution of higher education or a particular model for
   how higher education should be practiced. Although a variety of actors
   feature in the process of conveying organizational practices and
   cultural scripts, this article focuses primarily on the role of
   accreditation agencies and the practice of accreditation. In theorizing
   the relationship between the following four actors, i.e., external
   accrediting agencies, locally based quality assurance organizations,
   ministries of higher education, and Western universities located in the
   Gulf, Noori argues that the New Medievalism provides an analytically
   useful explanatory framework for understanding issues of governance with
   respect to American-style universities in the Gulf region.},

Abstract = {This article documents and explains the surprising capacity of several
   Continental European countries to adapt to rapid, innovation-based
   competition. Critics and proponents alike suggest that these economies
   rely on incremental upmarket movement in low- and medium-technology
   industries. Several historically low-technology Nordic countries,
   however, have recently assumed leading positions in industries such as
   biotechnology, software, and telecommunications. The article resolves
   this puzzle by arguing that these countries have adapted
   institutionalized cooperation among organized economic actors to invest
   in new supply-side resources, including venture capital, skill
   formation, and research. This pattern of creative corporatism has very
   different implications for economic adjustment, facilitating movement
   into new high-technology industries. The article supports the argument
   by analyzing institutional change and economic restructuring in Finland,
   a critical case where high-technology competition is least likely. The
   article documents similar developments in Denmark and Sweden, situating
   all three cases in relation to literature on comparative political
   economy.},

Abstract = {The text develops a new theoretical model for the analysis of
   post-socialist media systems in European third wave democracies. The
   five-dimensional theoretical framework of Hallin and Mancini (2004) is
   expanded with the approach of historical institutionalism and path
   dependency in order to explain the convergence and divergence of media
   systems in three key time periods. The model distinguishes between three
   distinctive historical periods in the development of media systems,
   consequences of three key critical historical junctures-modernization
   and democratic revolutions in the 19th century, socialist period, and
   the post-socialist period of new democracies. Thus the analysis
   includes, in addition to the first period of modernization that is
   crucial in the development of media systems in Western Europe (Hallin
   and Mancini, 2004), for the first time and explicitly also the socialist
   period and the contemporary period of post-socialist democratic media
   systems.},

Abstract = {The United States has reached an unprecedented level of inequality in
   presidential elections. In 2012, only 10 states drew the major party
   presidential candidates for postconvention campaign events, and those
   same 10 states attracted 99.6\% of all general election television
   advertising spending by the campaigns and their allies. The remaining 41
   spectator states (counting the District of Columbia) included all 38
   states that had been similarly overlooked in 2008. This article details
   these inequalities and their roots in state statutes allocating
   electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis. It argues that states should
   end this inequality by enacting the National Popular Vote interstate
   compact, which would ensure that it is the popular vote in all 50 states
   and the District of Columbia that determines who becomes the president.},

Abstract = {Federal waivers to state governments from conditions attached to
   grants-in-aid and other programs have become a critical factor in U.S.
   intergovernmental relations, yet no systematic empirical analysis has
   considered which factors make some states more likely to receive
   waivers. This article presents results of model estimations of
   time-series panel data that use as dependent variables measures of
   waivers to federal Medicaid and education policy from 1991 to 2008.
   Different factors influence the waivers states receive to different
   federal programs, suggesting that the waiver process varies greatly from
   policy to policy. These results do suggest that scholars of future
   waiver processes look to the capacity of each state's government and the
   relative size of populations the federal program most affects.},

Abstract = {This article explores the strategic importance Turkey holds to the
   European Union and how Ankara could contribute to the EU's achieving the
   status of a veritable global power. It seeks to understand how the often
   contradictory threads (democratization vs. creeping authoritarianism) in
   the recent transformation of Turkish domestic politics affects its
   European credentials. The main argument of the paper is that it is in
   the core interest of both parties to align their policies in the
   neighboring regions, namely the Balkans, Caucasus, and the Middle East,
   especially in the post Arab Spring era. What hinders the genuine
   EU-Turkey partnership is often the political and tactical
   short-sightedness of both parties rather than the factual divergence of
   strategic interests.},

Abstract = {This paper develops a theoretical framework for analyzing the strategic
   interaction between Islamists - pragmatic and dogmatic - and the regime
   when Shari'a-based issues are negotiated. I advance the new notion that
   pragmatists might be responsive to the Islamist electorate. Within the
   framework I generate the hypothesis that, if the regime promotes
   substantive reforms and the Islamist electorate supports them, then the
   internal cohesiveness of Islamist parties is weakened. In the case of
   Family Code reforms in Morocco, empirical analysis confirms that
   Islamists' change of strategy in 2003 - from opposing to not opposing
   the reforms - was due to changed preferences within the electorate in
   favour of reform. This change in preferences was matched by deep
   divisions within the Islamists of the Parti de la Justice et du
   Developpement and had dramatic repercussions upon the internal
   cohesiveness of the party.},

Journal = {POLITICAL STUDIES REVIEW},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Pages = {149-167},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The `tyranny of relevance' captures a widespread sense of concern among
   social and political scientists that their academic freedom and
   professional autonomy is under threat from a changing social context in
   which scholars are increasingly expected to demonstrate some form of
   social `relevance', `impact' or `engagement' beyond academe. This
   article attempts to reframe the current debate by reflecting upon the
   history of the discipline and different forms of scholarship in order to
   craft an argument concerning the need for political scientists to
   rediscover `the art of translation'. This, in turn, facilitates a more
   sophisticated grasp of key concepts, emphasises the need for the
   discipline to engage with multiple publics in multiple ways, and
   suggests that engaging with non-academic audiences is likely to improve
   not simply the discipline's leverage in terms of funding, or scholarship
   in terms of quality, but also teaching in terms of energy and relevance.
   The simple argument of this article is not therefore that political
   science has become irrelevant, but that it has generally failed to
   promote and communicate the social value and benefit of the discipline
   in an accessible manner. Resolving this situation is likely to demand a
   little political imagination.},

   reawakens the quarrel between ancients and moderns concerning the

   natural right, Strauss holds the ancient view, arguing that the greatest
   happiness is provided by the philosophic life, and deriving therefore a
   conservative course of action. On the basis of Hegelian phenomenology,
   Kojeve holds the modern view, arguing that the active life provides the
   greatest satisfaction, and deriving therefore a revolutionary course of
   action, which culminates in the universal and homogeneous state.},

Volume = {36},
Number = {3},

Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {This article offers an institutional approach to accountability in
   representative democracies. Theorising accountability comprises both
   settled polities with well-entrenched institutions and unsettled
   polities with weak or contested institutions, and it is argued that
   agency theory and formal principal-agent models giving priority to
   compliance and control usually make assumptions that are unlikely to
   apply to the latter type of polity. An institutional approach challenges
   principal-agent assumptions regarding what accountability means and
   implies, what is involved in demanding, rendering, assessing and
   responding to accounts and assigning accountability, and how
   accountability institutions work and change. Accountability is related
   to fundamental issues in democratic politics and the paper treats
   distributions of information, normative standards of assessment,
   authority and power relations as endogenous to democratic politics. The
   paper also holds that institutions affect actors' identities and roles
   through socialisation, internalisation and habitualisation, as well as
   through external incentives. An aspiration is to take a modest step
   towards understanding areas of application for competing approaches to
   democratic accountability.},

Title = {In search of reliable results: Socialist values and political trust in
   unified Germany A comment on Campbell's analyses and conclusions},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {52},
Number = {3},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {In a recently published article in this journal, Ross Campbell argues
   that adherence to socialist values establishes a hitherto neglected
   factor when it comes to the explanation of differences in East and West
   German citizens' political trust. As the results of his study indicate,
   adherence to socialist values impacts negatively on citizens' political
   trust, this effect is more pronounced and more stable over time for East
   German as compared to West German citizens and is sufficiently strong to
   eliminate aggregate-level differences in political trust between East
   and West Germany. However, this research note suggests that Campbell's
   article contains several substantial inconsistencies and obscurities
   that question the reliability and validity of the empirical findings
   presented. It provides a re-analysis of Campbell's main arguments and
   shows to what extent his initial conclusions can be upheld after the
   shortcomings have been remedied. The results of this re-analysis suggest
   that socialist values indeed exhibit a negative impact on German
   citizens' political trust, which is relatively stronger for East as
   compared to West German citizens. However, contrary to Campbell's
   initial results, the negative effect of socialist values on political
   trust is robust over time for both East and West German citizens. What
   is more, there is no empirical evidence confirming that differences in
   adherence to socialist values between East and West German citizens are
   sufficiently strong to account for aggregate-level differences in
   political trust. In light of these findings, two of Campbell's three
   main conclusions are dubious and call for further examination.},

Title = {Leaders, footsoldiers and befrienders: The gendered nature of social
   capital and political participation in Britain},
Journal = {BRITISH POLITICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Pages = {28-50},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Feminist political scientists have had a two-track response to Robert
   Putnam's work on social capital. They have critiqued his original
   approach for failing to take gender into account, but they have also
   highlighted the potential of the concept for illuminating mechanisms
   that reproduce unequal gender relations. In the British case, Peter Hall
   and Vivien Lowndes have shown how key elements of Putnam's measures are
   highly gendered. Vivien Lowndes set out a research agenda for assessing
   the impact of men and women's group memberships upon political
   participation. This article tests Lowndes' research questions using
   British data from the Citizenship Survey 2007. Men and women in Britain
   do belong to different formal associational networks but these
   differences do not appear to have a strong impact upon whether they
   participate in politics. Lowndes' critique of the social capital
   literature's failure to incorporate women's informal child-care networks
   is supported; involvement in child-care networks is positively related
   to political participation in the form of signing petitions and
   negatively related to contacting Members of Parliament. Crucially, there
   are small but statistically significant divergences in the types of
   activities men and women undertake for organised groups and these roles
   are associated with variations in political participation. British

Abstract = {The 2000 U.S. presidential election resulted in states introducing new
   voting systems and election administration procedures. The election also
   raised concerns that poor experiences at the polls would produce lower
   levels of confidence in the electoral process or lower turnout. Drawing
   on theories used in organizational psychology and marketing and using an
   internet-administered panel survey, we assess the impact of voters'
   expectations on their satisfaction in the 2008 elections. The findings
   indicate that voters have different expectations about the voting
   process and that these expectations condition the ways in which voters
   assess their experience. Therefore, a complete explanation of voter
   satisfaction with the voting process must account for both the
   expectations voters bring to the polling place and the experiences
   voters have there.},

Abstract = {Maya Tudor, Explaining Democracy's Origins: Lessons from South Asia Why,
   upon the 1947 Partition of British India, was India able to establish a
   stable democracy while structurally similar Pakistan created an unstable
   autocracy? The differential strengths of India and Pakistan's
   independence movements directly account for their divergent
   democratization trajectories. These movements were initially constructed
   to pursue historically conditioned class interests. An examination of
   these movements leads to a broader theory of democratic origins, which
   qualifies the prevailing notion that a country's democratization
   prospects can be attributed to its levels of economic development or
   inequality.},

Abstract = {The 2010 British election resulted in what the British refer to as a
   ``hung Parliament{''} for the first time in over a generation. This
   result further heightened the debate over the fairness and utility of
   the nation's centuries-old first-past-the-post (FPTP) system. Survey
   data are used to simulate the election outcome under four different
   electoral systems beyond FPTP: round-robin pair-wise comparisons, the
   Borda count, the alternative vote, and Coombs' method. Results suggest
   that in 2010, the Liberal-Democrats were Condorcet preferred to all
   other parties and would have won a national election under every tested
   method except the alternative vote, the method supported by the
   Liberal-Democrats during the referendum in May 2011 and, of course, FPTP
   as actually used. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The Contemporary Relationship of `New Left' and `New Right' Parties with
   Interest Groups: Exceptional or Mainstream? The Case of Norway's

Abstract = {Allegedly, the new green and left parties that were established in
   Western Europe during or after the 1960s tend to be characterized by
   informal but significant links with social movement organizations. In
   contrast, weak links or virtual lack of such connections is often seen
   as one of the enduring characteristics of the new populist (radical)
   right parties. However, there are both empirical and theoretical reasons
   for examining these conventional wisdom(s) more closely. To date, only
   limited evidence is available on this aspect of new European parties in
   general. Examining Norway's successful new left and populist right
   party, and based on rich original data, this case study adds to our
   knowledge in several ways. The analysis reveals that the socialist left
   has even closer and more wide-ranging relationships with interest groups
   than traditionally suggested and that the Progress Party enjoys
   organized contact with various interest groups. Since these parties are
   only two, and not necessarily quintessential examples of the party
   families in question, the results cannot overturn the conventional
   wisdom, but they nonetheless question and supplement it by throwing
   light on the conditions favouring the development of stronger, and more
   varied, links to interest groups. Together with other presumably
   atypical' party examples mentioned in scholarly literature, the case of
   Norway calls for further empirical investigation. Finally, with an eye
   to future comparative research, the possible explanations for these
   findings are briefly discussed.},

   Among authoritarian regime types, one-party regimes have lower infant

Abstract = {The issue of son preference is another pernicious violence against women
   for which the need to protect the girl-child is necessary and desirable
   in most societies of the world. In Nigeria, the preference for sons is
   very prevalent and exists in several cultures as it dates back to
   pre-historic times and it is tied to inheritance, unfortunately it has
   not succumbed to societal changes but has remained sacrosanct because of
   the desire for a son to carry on the family name and guarantee the
   family lineage. On marriage because of the value placed on men under
   Igbo custom, there is usually immense pressure on wives to give birth to
   sons. This, in addition to placing women in a situation in which they
   inadvertently encourage the inferior position of women through the
   preference for male children, also directly affects them in taking
   reproductive decisions and also affects their psyche. The Igbos is an
   ethnic group in the South Eastern part of Nigeria with a strong penchant
   for patriarchy. Women who give birth to a girl-child in Igbo land are
   unhappy at their first delivery, because of the fear of rejection and
   disappointment by the husband. This research is based on the doctrinal
   analytical content method which is the organization of study around
   legal propositions and the use of primary sources, like books, legal
   Encyclopedia, Monograms, and Newspapers. It therefore examined son
   preference with particular emphasis on Igbo custom in Nigeria and
   discovered its deep rooted nature in the psyche of the people as well as
   the fact that it is a violation of the human rights of women and
   suggested measures to curb same.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the nature of contemporary anti-abortion discourse
   in Canada. Based on a rigorous qualitative and quantitative analysis of
   the public discourse of a wide variety of influential actors, this study
   shows that contemporary anti-abortion discourse in Canada is quite
   different than the portrait offered by traditional accounts.
   Specifically, our analysis demonstrates that the new anti-abortion
   discourse aims at changing cultural values more than legislation; is
   explicitly framed as `pro-woman'; largely avoids appealing to religious
   grounds; and relies on a new `abortion-harms- women' argument that has
   supplanted and transformed traditional fetal personhood arguments. The
   article argues that these findings are important as they provide a more
   accurate account of the political discourse surrounding one of the most
   contentious issues in politics today and because they illustrate broader
   ideological patterns that are increasingly characteristic of Canadian
   political discourse.},

Abstract = {Critically considering scholarship relating religiosity to ethical
   behaviour, we contend that religion is systematically related to levels
   of corruption, and that the nature of this relationship is contingent on
   the presence of democratic institutions. In democracies, where political
   institutions are designed to inhibit corrupt conduct, the morality
   provided by religion is related to attenuated corruption. Conversely, in
   systems lacking democratic institutions, moral behaviour is not
   tantamount to staying away from corrupt ways. Accordingly, in
   non-democratic contexts, religion would not be associated with decreased
   corruption. Time-series cross-sectional analyses of aggregate data for
   129 countries for 12 years, as well as individual level analyses of data
   from the World Values Surveys, strongly corroborate the predictions of
   our theory. The correlation of religion with reduced corruption is
   conditional on the extent to which political institutions are
   democratic.},

Abstract = {Scholars rank problems in economic performance among the most important
   reasons for the collapse of autocratic regimes. This study forms no
   exception and explores the effect of economic misfortune on autocratic
   regime failure using a sample of 160 authoritarian regimes between 1981
   and 2008. Moreover, this article introduces repression and co-optation
   as political variables which have the potential to mediate the adverse
   effects of economic misfortune. While the former shields authoritarian
   rule from vertical threats such as mass demonstrations, the latter
   addresses horizontal threats in the form of elite splits. As follows
   from the analysis, restrictions on political liberties (soft repression)
   serve autocrats better than infringements on personal integrity (hard
   repression) or co-optation. Furthermore, in contrast to other analyses,
   there is no evidence that co-optation in the form of quasi-democratic
   institutions prevents regime failure.},

Title = {The determinants of direct corporate lobbying in the EU: A
   multi-dimensional proxy of corporate lobbying},
Journal = {INTEREST GROUPS \& ADVOCACY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {2},
Number = {1},
Pages = {71-90},

Abstract = {This article argues for a more thorough analysis of the dynamics of
   corporate lobbying within the European Union (EU). Although there is
   broad consensus among scholars on the emergence of a new type of
   European lobbying, studies have not sufficiently addressed the
   underlying economic rationale. Indeed, many authors emphasise the shift
   towards a system based on direct lobbying; however, these concentre only
   on systemic and non-economic causes. Direct lobbying dynamics are
   perceived mainly in two ways: either as a consequence of a conscious
   political strategy of the European institutions in response to the
   `interest overload' of the mid-1990s or as a normal phase of the
   development of interest group populations. Advocating an economics-based
   analytical approach to European corporate lobbying, this contribution to
   the debate provides one of the very first attempts to uncover the
   influence of economic factors on direct corporate lobbying by building
   on the seminal work proposed by Bernhagen and Mitchell. These authors,
   very familiar with the American tradition of corporate lobbying studies,
   were the first to apply a `standard model of corporate political
   behaviour' to the European context by examining the various determinants
   of direct lobbying. This article goes further: it analyses the empirical
   database constructed by Bernhagen and Mitchell, with a multi-dimensional
   proxy of corporate lobbying. Indeed, the main contribution of this study
   is in its analysis, namely, the operationalisation of the dependent
   variable `direct lobbying'. It proposes a multistrategy/multi- venue
   operationalisation of the dependent variable aiming to overcome the
   pitfalls that characterise dichotomous and uni-dimensional operational
   definitions, in order to answer the research question: `What are the
   economic determinants of direct corporate lobbying in the EU?' Such a
   multi-dimensional operationalisation of the dependent variable has
   required the unpacking of some of the elements taken for granted in the
   discussion on corporate lobbying. This article argues that the
   researcher needs to take into consideration the various direct lobbying
   strategies and their relative weights (that is, the multi-strategy
   operationalisation). For example, accreditation to the EP is not equal
   to the establishment of a company representation office in Brussels.
   Furthermore, another possible level of action of a firm's strategy,
   namely, the industry one, should also be considered (that is, the
   multi-venue operationalisation): direct lobbying should be analysed as a
   preference over other lobbying approaches rather than in absolute terms.
   The findings show how such an expanded operationalisation casts light on
   the economic determinants of European corporate lobbying. First of all,
   the Olsonian argument finds empirical support: industry concentration
   determines lobbying strategies. Second, asset mobility/specificity
   influences a firm's preference to lobby directly vis-a-vis other venues.},

Abstract = {This article studies variation in conflict theater choice by Western
   jihadists in an effort to understand their motivations. Some militants
   attack at home, whereas others join insurgencies abroad, but few
   scholars have asked why they make these different choices. Using
   open-source data, I estimate recruit supply for each theater, foreign
   fighter return rates, and returnee impact on domestic terrorist
   activity. The tentative data indicate that jihadists prefer foreign
   fighting, but a minority attacks at home after being radicalized, most
   often through foreign fighting or contact with a veteran. Most foreign
   fighters do not return for domestic operations, but those who do return
   are more effective operatives than nonveterans. The findings have
   implications for our understanding of the motivations of jihadists, for
   assessments of the terrorist threat posed by foreign fighters, and for
   counterterrorism policy.},

Abstract = {Capitalist growth regimes are analysed drawing on Marx's insights into
   the fundamental contradictions of the capitalist mode of production,
   regulation theoretical arguments about the five basic structural forms
   of accumulation regimes and their modes of regulation, historical
   geographical materialism's emphasis on spatio-temporal fixes, and
   state-theoretical accounts of the `government + governance' of
   capitalist social formations in the shadow of hierarchy. This framework
   is then applied to four specific growth regimes and their crisis
   tendencies. These regimes are Atlantic Fordism, two (among many)
   alternative post-Fordist trajectories - the knowledge-based economy and
   finance-dominated capitalism - and a radical `no-growth' variant of the
   `Green New Deal'. The article highlights the crisis tendencies of the
   first three and assesses whether the Green New Deal represents an
   alternative route out of crisis or the capture of an eco-social project
   by the forces that brought us finance-dominated accumulation. It
   concludes with a future research agenda.},

Abstract = {The concept of `finance' or the `financial system' can be confusing. The
   assumption is that the financial system consists of related markets
   trading in a variety of financial instruments that are ultimately of a
   similar nature. In the late-19th century, however, financial assets have
   bifurcated into broadly two classes of property titles: incorporeal
   assets and intangible assets. This article argues that interrelations
   between the two classes of assets have generated pro-cyclical trends
   that are not dealt with by current regulation. It argues that these
   pro-cyclical trends can be even more confusing in the age of
   globalisation.},

Abstract = {The German Association for East European Studies, which was originally
   launched for the study of Russia, was born of science and politics. The
   way the Germans treat their eastern neighbours is reflected in East
   European Studies. It is marked by fascination and enmity, embracing
   rapprochement and establishing boundaries, scientific findings and
   empirical analysis, but also by participation in war and genocide. Only
   since 1989 has the east found its own voice again. East European
   Studies, which wants to keep up with conditions, remains as exciting as
   developments themselves: the field is incalculable and full of surprises
   - because history does not stick to plans or programmes.},

Pages = {613-629},
Abstract = {The article explores the role of regional party branches in a unitary
   state: Norway. The regional (county) party secretaries' capability for
   implementing national organizational strategies is explored, and their
   roles in bottom-up and top-down intra-party communication are mapped.
   The study confirms the important role of the county level in Norwegian
   parties: county branches co-ordinate local branches, assist the national
   party headquarters, and deal with regional issues and regional attempts
   to influence national policies. The structure of Norwegian parties
   mirrors the state structure, but the regional level has a stronger
   position in the party organizations than in public administration.},

Abstract = {This text presents an analysis of aggregated membership's dynamics for
   Spanish trade unions, using ECVT data, as well as union memberships'
   trajectories, or members' decisions about joining the organization,
   permanency and responsibilities, and subsequent attrition. For the
   analysis of trajectories we make use of information of the records of
   actual memberships and the record of quitting of CCOO, and of a
   survey-questionnaire to a sample of leavers of the same union. This
   study allows us to confirm a linkage between the decision and
   motivations to become union member, to participate in union activities,
   the time of permanency, and the motives to quit the organization. We
   also identify five types of union members' trajectories, indicating
   that, far from views that assert a monolithic structure, unions are
   complex organizations.},

Abstract = {Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture is one of the most popular Russian
   compositions. It is worth listening to not only because of the bombastic
   instrumentation and acoustic effects. The work is also an important
   historical source. However, it reveals more about the background of the
   period in which it was created than about the events of 1812. As a
   ``virtual war experience{''} written for the inauguration of the
   Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in 1882, it plays a special role in
   Russia's politics of memory.},

   regime history is the primary factor that predisposes a country toward
   repression. Yet three situational triggers also matter when accounting
   for the development and application of a state's provisions. First, the
   immediate aftermath of the transition to democracy can spark new laws
   and bans; second, ratifying UN provisions against racist organisations
   can prompt state action; and, third and most importantly in the
   contemporary era, spikes in high-profile racist events or steady
   increases in the influence of racist associations can generate the
   passage of new laws or the enforcement of existing legislation. Focusing
   on the combination of the one predisposing factor and the three
   situational triggers provides a systematic probabilistic explanation for
   cross-national variation in liberal democracies' stances toward racist
   associations.},

Abstract = {This paper seeks to critically reimagine the relationship between power
   and resistance. The aim is to better understand how resistance aids in
   the construction, exercise and often reproduction of power. These
   efforts open the space for a new perspective of power linked to the
   production of the resistance subject. Specifically, it is argued that
   hegemonic power relations create in their wake dominant forms of
   resistance, which ironically provide individuals with a stable social
   identity. Power operates, in turn, by creating a `safe' resistance that
   preserves the ontological security individuals' gain as resistance
   subjects within these dominant power relations. Yet, while all
   resistances are to an extent `safe', this does not mean they are
   necessarily `safe' to an existing hegemony.},

Abstract = {This study intends to analyze the challenges and opportunities presented
   to Venezuela as a full member of MERCOSUR, through a descriptive
   investigation and use of the analytical method. This regional
   integration scheme opens before the country the possibilities of an
   exporting era while it continues dependent on petroleum exports,
   reflecting the stagnation of production in the industrial and
   agricultural sectors. This represents a commercial disadvantage when
   facing the MERCOSUR countries, especially Brazil and Argentina. MERCOSUR
   offers Venezuela a huge market, eager for finished products, food and
   tourism alternatives as well as high technologies and financing to
   extend development projects. The principal challenge that faces
   Venezuela is to strengthen her productive capacities in the sectors for
   metallurgy, food processing and petro-chemistry in order to adapt to the
   high levels of competitiveness in the bloc. Conclusions are that
   Venezuela's entry to MERCOSUR is a transcendental and highly convenient
   occurrence for the nations' interests and that there is a need to review
   public strategies and policies in order to overcome the serious
   imbalances in the economy; for example, by calling on the different
   actors and social forces in the country to participate and stimulate the
   investment of national and foreign capital.},

   expression in France since the 1960s},
Journal = {POLITIX},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {26},
Number = {103},
Pages = {9+},
Abstract = {By way of introduction to this thematic issue, this article offers an
   analysis of the transformations of the space of agricultural
   representation in France over recent decades. While at the outset of the
   1980s the ``agricultural world{''} seemed to be a privileged site for
   studying the mechanisms contributing to the symbolic unification of
   social and professional groups, the studies analyzed in this issue were
   conducted in a markedly different context. Indeed, the power of
   representation the FNSEA and CNJA built over the 1960s and 1970s,
   legitimated by political leaders and institutions responsible for
   guiding agriculture, came to be weakened by a variety of corroborating
   processes. Accounting for this history requires putting these
   developments in relation, from political authorities' definitions of
   representativity to the reconstitution of the field of agricultural
   organizations and media coverage of collective actions.},

Title = {The Optional Preference? American Catholic Economic Advocacy and the
   Culture Wars},
Journal = {FORUM-A JOURNAL OF APPLIED RESEARCH IN CONTEMPORARY POLITICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {11},
Number = {4},
Pages = {641-669},
Abstract = {Has the Catholic preferential option for the poor become an optional
   preference in contemporary American Catholic advocacy? If so, why?
   Commentators on both the left and the right agree that the ``culture
   wars,{''}particularly over abortion access, have come to trump economic
   advocacy among American Catholics. In the following, I refine this
   claim, testing several mechanisms by which the culture wars could have
   influenced Catholic economic advocacy. Evidence is strongest that the
   culture wars have mattered in three ways: shaping organizational
   politics within the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops,
   driving polarization among Catholic civil society organizations, and
   generating blowback among Catholics in the pews to the infusion of
   religion into politics. However, the culture wars have not fundamentally
   changed Catholic theology of the economy or eliminated traditional
   Catholic advocates for progressive economic policy. After documenting
   evidence of these effects, the piece closes with implications for the
   likelihood of a ``Francis effect{''} on American Catholic economic
   advocacy.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to understand how and why states regulate the
   activities or affairs of religious communities. It does so through a
   case study of the Indonesian Draft Law on Inter-religious Harmony. The
   article draws out three general considerations to the study of the
   dynamics of state regulation of religious affairs: situating modern
   state approaches to the regulation of religion in historical context;
   recognizing the framework within which state and religion is structured;
   and acknowledging the influence of legal norms other than state law. The
   Indonesian Draft Law on Inter-religious Harmony addresses key debates
   between Muslims and Christians and within Islam, and it draws upon
   existing policies of the Ministry of Religion and also of the fatwa of
   the Indonesian Ulama Council. The shift in state attempts to regulate
   religion is therefore related to the dynamic and contested nature of the
   relationship between the branches of government and religious
   authorities in democratic Indonesia.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {18},
Number = {1},
Pages = {57-81},
Abstract = {This article reappraises the theoretical and political significance of
   the socialist humanism developed within the early British New Left
   between 1956 and 1962. Over-identified with the thought of E. P.
   Thompson, and too-readily assimilated to a polarizing narrative of
   theoretical development in British historiography, which pitted humanism
   and `culturalism' against Althusserian structuralism, the complexity and
   diversity of socialist humanist thought in this early period has not
   been adequately appreciated. A re-examination of debates around
   socialist humanism within the early New Left yields three main
   arguments. First, that these debates reveal a theoretical richness,
   especially around questions of the relationship of Marxism and socialism
   to morality and ethics, which has been unjustly neglected. Second, that
   the distinctive contribution of thinkers associated with Universities
   and Left Review amounted to an alternative conception of socialist
   humanism deserving greater recognition. Finally, it is argued that the
   activist politics of the early New Left represented an original effort
   to model and realize socialist humanist ideals in practice.},

Abstract = {The prospect for emerging powers to influence the international order
   depends, to a great extent, on their collective action capacity. It is
   imperative that these countries are capable of assuming cohesive
   positions in the scope of international regimes and organizations. In
   case they are unable to forge coordination, it is unlikely that they
   will be able to expand their bargaining power past of what they already
   possess individually. This article aims to analyse the weight of
   regional and global coalitions as conducive to behavioural cohesion in
   multilateral arenas. Brazil will be taken as a reference. The degree to
   which Brazil's positioning converges with three other groups of
   countries in the UN General Assembly (UNGA) is analysed: Mercosur BRICS
   and nuclear powers. This analysis covers the period between 1946 and
   2008. It intends to understand the specific weight of coalitions as
   inducing positioning convergence in the UNGA. Measuring the affinity
   between Brazil and nuclear powers serves as a control group, since both
   Mercosur-in the subregional arena-and BRICS-in the global arena-are
   coalitions motivated by the possibility of balancing the North American
   hegemonic power within the international order.},

Abstract = {National Elections determine the time horizons of politicians and may
   cause inter-temporal changes of their policy positions. In European
   constitutional policy this observation is contrasted by both the
   assumption of long term motives and the successful revisions of EU
   treaties. Thus, we analyse if national elections in Ireland and Austria
   had an impact on the positions of national parties in European
   constitutional policy. The findings of our case studies show that the
   parties' positions remained largely stable. However, we also identify
   three factors which may increase the politicisation of EU constitutional
   issues in the national arena and thereby shorten the time horizons of
   politicians: Eurosceptic parties, referenda, and issues carrying a
   symbolic meaning for the public. Finally, we observe that the resulting
   inter-temporal inconsistencies have caused only limited coordination
   problems in the EU treaty negotiations.},

Journal = {POLITICA \& SOCIETA},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {2},
Number = {1},
Pages = {79-98},
Month = {JAN-APR},
Abstract = {The article takes issue with traditional understandings of Max Weber's
   reflection on modernity by shedding light on a neglected category of his
   thought: subrogation. The meaning of subrogation is first outlined
   through a comparison with secularization and Blumenberg's concept of
   Umbesetzung. The conceptual status of subrogation is then further
   clarified by reviewing its presence (or its absence) in the Weberian
   diagnosis of modernity, and by distinguishing between two different
   typologies of subrogation. I will finally focus on the anthropological
   implications of the idea of subrogation, displaying its explanatory
   power in the analysis of contemporary societies. In particular, I intend
   to employ subrogation as the cornerstone of a more finely shaded
   -neither apocalyptic, nor apologetic -interpretation of consumption.},

   explored. This paper proposes much knowledge sort of internal groups,
   highlighting its main contributions and limitations. The text directs
   existing knowledge based on the cataloging of internal political groups
   are the perpetrators, ie whether conceived as pathological (because they
   are against the unit), from the other end as something positive (because
   they are the living expression of pluralism) or in an intermediate
   position. To achieve this we propose to show a brief state of the art on
   what has been written about political groups within parties that allow
   ordering existing knowledge by recording the findings and limitations.},

Abstract = {Article 20.2 of the Spanish Constitution categorically prohibits prior
   censorship. Nevertheless, despite the apparent clarity and forcefulness
   of this text, this provision brings about many theoretical and practical
   questions. The defining features of the technical and legal concept of
   censorship are strongly rooted in history, but technological advances
   challenge the idea that this category is useful on the Internet.
   Technological advances do not allow us to rule out the development of
   comparable forms of censorship; however, the technical and legal concept
   of censorship provides little protection in this new technological
   environment. The concept of censorship should be reformulated so that
   the constitutional prohibition of it also serves to protect an open
   communication process in the 21st century.},

Abstract = {Both the capability and the recognition approach are influential and
   substantial theories in social philosophy. In this contribution, we
   outline their main assumptions in their assessment of poverty. The two
   approaches are set in relation to each other, focusing mainly on (a)
   their moral evaluation of poverty, (b) issues of justification of their
   central normative claims, and (c) the role that is attributed to
   subjective experiences, feelings and emotions in these theories. This
   comparison reveals that in spite of significant differences, both lead
   to the claim that poverty can never be adequately assessed without
   putting it into the context of a comprehensive ethical theory about the
   nature and function of societies. Drawing on this result, we conclude
   that the critical function of social philosophy plays an irreducible
   role in the study and understanding of poverty.},

Abstract = {In this article, we analyse initiatives organized by groups outside of
   formal politics that involve political confrontation with elected
   officials, and the need for recourse to the courts. We show that a civic
   initiative submitted by a proposer gives the voter not only the option
   to constrain the mayor but also the possibility of learning the mayor's
   type from the signals conveyed in the legal contest over the validity of
   the initiative. We show that, ex ante, signalling in the context of
   legal uncertainty improves responsiveness. In addition, our setup
   identifies limits to empirical inference based on linear models: first,
   having a more adversarial mayor can lead to either the introduction or
   the withdrawal of an initiative; second, although initiatives
   effectively constrain incumbents, they do not necessarily imply
   increasing distrust in incumbents. Examples from Central European
   countries are used to illustrate how our model corresponds to real-world
   conditions.},

Abstract = {Works on the 1848 revolutions, 1989 collapse of European communism,
   1998-2005 postcommunist color revolutions, and 2011 Arab uprisings
   frequently cross-reference each other, implying what is called here the
   concept of a ``regime change cascade.{''} Research on these ``Big
   Four{''} events shows that cascading can occur in protest calling for
   regime change as well as revolution in the name of regime change, but
   these rarely lead to actual regime change. Regime change cascades can
   occur through demonstration effects and active mediation, although
   common external causes and contemporaneous domestic triggers can cause
   events outwardly resembling them. Regime change cascades tend to occur
   where (a) there exists a common frame of political reference, (b)
   unpopular leaderships are becoming lame ducks; (c) elites lack other
   focal points for coordinated defection, and (d) structural conditions
   supporting a new regime type are in place. Cascading to hybrid regimes
   or autocracy may be more likely than cascading to democracy.},

Abstract = {This paper explores debates about electoral patterns in post-civil war
   societies. In particular, we examine whether the ability of rebels to
   capture and control territory and the level of violence at the local
   level explains the electoral performance of former rebel political
   parties, focusing on the Islamic Renaissance Party of Tajikstan (IRPT)
   and the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) (CPN (M)). Using data from the
   2000 legislative election in Tajikistan and the 2008 Nepalese
   Constituent Assembly election, this paper finds that rebel control over
   districts did explain rebel party's electoral performance in Nepal.
   However, rebel control of districts in Tajikistan during the civil war
   did not predict the electoral performance in the first post-conflict
   election in that country. This is largely due to the disconnect between
   the IRPT and the constituencies that had supported it during the civil
   war, and because the level of control that the party exerted was far
   less than that of the CPN (M).},

Abstract = {High dynamics of changes in security environment, deepening
   globalization, and growth of current and new, predominantly asymmetric,
   threats make on international society permanently new demands and
   require new more complex approach towards the issue. One of the most
   significant tools of international community for keeping peace and
   security on the international level, restraining centres of tension,
   consolidation or stabilization of relations in crisis areas, and
   multilateral reconstruction and restoration of the countries after armed
   conflicts, represent peace operations within international crisis
   management. Peace operations have changed a lot throughout the last
   fifty years, and today, unlike the past, they represent highly complex,
   dynamic, demanding and multidimensional activities. Therefore, the main
   aim of an author is to point out the significance of theoretical and
   terminological basis for research in the field of peace operations.},

Abstract = {Using 18 national reports evaluating the state of the relation between
   money and politics in each country, this study shows how the regulatory
   capacity of Latin American states has evolved. To this end, the author
   proposes a classification of Latin American regulatory systems based on
   five ``models{''} that differ functionally in the relative weight of
   their public and private components (state financing, restrictions on
   private contributions, etc.). In the light of some US and German studies
   that are also cited in the article, it concludes with a warning about
   the possible perverse effects which some types of regulation could have.},

Abstract = {The workplace provides an exceptional outlet for citizens to encounter
   different viewpoints and discuss politics with people with whom they may
   disagree. In Washington, DC, however, many people work in partisan
   environments where like-minded coworkers rarely encounter alternate
   points of view. Group polarization theory suggests that these
   environments push individuals to the partisan and ideological extremes.
   This study tests this hypothesis by comparing opinion change among
   interns who worked in a partisan workplace with that of interns who were
   employed in less-partisan environments. The results suggest that
   partisan workplace environments foster opinion polarization, especially
   among Republicans.},

Abstract = {With the United States now considering the Asia-Pacific region as the
   future strategic zone of interest, the European Union appears liable to
   vanish from the picture. This slide into irrelevance, however,
   presupposes that the EU will not become a significant rival to the US in
   a multipolar world. It also assumes that the EU is no longer an
   indispensable partner for the US in dealing with international issues.
   Yet rivalry and partnership, which more or less correspond to the
   conceptual approaches of ``soft balancing{''} and ``security
   community{''}, are still widely used to describe the EU-US relationship.
   This contribution asks whether and to what extent these two opposing
   approaches are relevant. While the security community approach
   corresponds to current EU-US relations more than the idea of the EU
   acting as a soft balancing rival to the US, important tensions and
   contradictions are apparent in the partnership. This leads to the
   conclusion that the EU and the US being partners does not prevent a
   challenge to the former's ties with the latter.},

Abstract = {Guatemala is undergoing a process of political change. The democratic
   transition fails to consolidate as authoritarian features still survive
   and coexist with democratic rules, resulting in an apparent stability
   where political control is transferred from traditional actors
   (political parties, business community) to new emerging players. The
   authoritarian features rooted in the structures of power, local and
   national, together with a capitalist accumulation that combines illegal
   resources, a weak rule of law, and increasing wealth generated by doing
   business with the state, provide a scenario of permanent confrontation.
   This confrontation is not easily perceived, but it is revealed in
   specific areas where vital rights of people are violated, fear is used
   as a resource for collective inaction, and public institutions are
   controlled.},

Title = {New Media as a Tool of Political Campaigns in the Czech Republic: A Case
   Study of the 2012 Regional Council and Senate Elections},
Journal = {POLITOLOGICKY CASOPIS-CZECH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Abstract = {Political communication has been undergoing a profound transformation in
   recent years following the appearance and rapid spread of new media. The
   use of new media, such as social networking sites and other internet
   platforms, is increasingly being exploited by all types of political
   actors, but particularly by those involved in electoral campaigns.
   Attempting to explore the presence of these trends in the Czech
   Republic, this paper focuses on the Senate and Regional Council
   electoral campaigns that took place in October 2012 in the Czech
   Republic, with the primary aim of comparing the differences in new media
   usage between candidates. A comprehensive analysis was based on a
   dataset obtained by monitoring the use of various types of new media by
   candidates, namely traditional websites, blogs, and the online social
   networking sites Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. The results show that
   younger candidates in regional elections engage in online campaigning
   more intensely than older candidates. The findings also demonstrate that
   Senate candidates use new media more extensively than candidates for the
   Regional Council. The most commonly used new media in both types of
   elections were traditional websites and the online social networking
   site Facebook. Regarding the candidates' political affiliations, the
   analyses came to the conclusion that the usage of new media was
   generally similar for all major parties with one exception. The
   candidates from the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia used new
   media very sporadically and, moreover, most of them used no new media
   platforms at all in either type of election campaign.},

Abstract = {This paper addresses the question of whether social network analysis
   (SNA) measures of centrality might be useful as an investigative tool.
   It is often asserted that SNA can help to identify key players in a
   network who should be targeted in order to disrupt organizational
   activities. This is explored here by first considering various practical
   obstacles, followed by an empirical test of how centrality measures
   perform against known behavior of an actual terrorist network. The
   analysis suggests that measures of centrality were at least
   superficially able to identify individuals in key network positions
   (facilitators and group leaders) and also tended to highlight particular
   cells at times of operational importance. However, SNA measures
   otherwise failed to identify hierarchies, and results were heavily
   dictated by group size and intra-connectivity, rather than genuinely
   reacting to operational behavior. Along with other shortcomings, these
   limitations mean that smaller or less well-connected groups and
   individuals are more likely to be overlooked, despite the fact that they
   can make significant contributions to both network functioning and
   disruption.},

Abstract = {We introduce the possibilities that mediation offers when resolving the
   conflictive situations that people with special needs and their families
   live. It is necessary to create a cooperative spirit in order to
   transform into satisfaction the frustration and sorrow that people with
   special needs and their families experience, from the acknowledgement of
   their rights with the purpose to increase their participation in the
   society and their access to the decision-making.
   The theoretical root of mediation is negotiation, its success is
   intertwined in the process of mediation and in the profile of the
   mediator which helps the generation of agreement between the parties in
   dispute, with the objective to obtain the satisfaction of the interests
   of all the parties involved, creating a new relationship for the future.},

Journal = {REVISTA DE INVESTIGACIONES POLITICAS Y SOCIOLOGICAS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {The author presents an analysis to explain the changes occured in the
   Mapuche movement. In order to do this, he analizes the main political
   proposals by the Mapuche organizations from 1990 to 2010. He sustains
   that the most important for the Mapuche organizations, in the past two
   decades, has not been the power of a rhetoric, with political
   terminology associated to national movements, in the interpretative
   framework, but rather the kind of solution that the political players
   see for the Mapuche question. That is to say, a communitarian or a
   nationalistic solution. Territory is a key factor for all national
   projects, and the Mapuche nationalism is more linked to the dilemmas of
   the political strategies, than to the supposed processes of ethnic
   revitalization, reethnification or politicization of the etnicity.},

Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},

Volume = {16},
Number = {5},
Pages = {614-633},
Abstract = {Despite the variety of competing interpretations of domination, a common
   feature of the most influential analyses of the concept is their
   reliance on a normative criterion: the detrimental effect of domination
   on those subject to it. This article offers a non-evaluative,
   non-consequence-based definition of domination, in line with the
   perspective on power developed by the theory of the social exchange.
   Domination, it is argued, should be seen as a structural property of a
   power relation, and consists in an extreme inequality in the social
   distribution of power. It is contended, accordingly, that the
   postulation of a society in which domination is avoided (or minimized)
   should rely on the ideal of the minimization of inequality, and, more
   specifically, that it should be based on a distributional pattern of
   maximally equal social resources.},

Title = {Is the Effect of Education on Voter Turnout Absolute or Relative? A
   Multilevel Analysis of 37 Countries},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ELECTIONS PUBLIC OPINION AND PARTIES},

Abstract = {While it is well established that education is positively correlated
   with voter turnout at the individual level, the increased educational
   levels in most western countries have not caused increased voter turnout
   at the aggregate level. The relative education model suggests one
   explanation: education is only a proxy for social status and has no
   direct causal effect. The individual-level effect of education is
   conditional on the level of education in the environment. Whereas
   previous research on the relationship between relative education and
   voter turnout has largely focused on the U.S. case, this article uses
   comparative survey data on voter turnout to test the relative education
   model. It combines data from the CSES and ESS covering about 275,000
   individuals in 173 country-years in 37 countries. The analysis applies a
   definition of relative education operationalized as each individual's
   education rank position in relation to the level of education of those
   born in the same fiveyear cohort in the same country. The results show
   that relative education has a much larger effect on voter turnout than
   absolute education. Moreover, relative education has a stronger effect
   when aggregate turnout is low.},
