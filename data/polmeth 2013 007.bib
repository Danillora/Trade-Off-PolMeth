Abstract = {Not so long ago political science was departing from the paradigm of
   political subjects' self-existence, viewing political processes as
   self-regulating. Gradually, however, the idea installed itself, of the
   possibility of consciously exerting influence upon the behavior of
   political actors by means both of local use of regulatory technologies
   and of broad (up to total, as in Russia) purposeful organization of
   political space. Consequences of new correlation of ``policy{''} and
   ``regulation{''} can be observed both in the academic search and in the
   political practice. Failing to find any suitable equivalent in English
   for naming Russian realias, our home researchers are, for example,
   finding out differences between ``political management{''} and
   ``political regulation{''}. Meanwhile political colonization of the
   state and massed use of political technologies by Russian politicians
   have become bases for the formation of a system of ``regulated
   democracy{''}},

   somewhat more than a matter of getting the government to pass a new law.
   Perhaps he would have quoted the Bible: ``cast out first the beam out of

   of thy brother's eye.{''}},

Abstract = {Indian journalist P. Sainath is famous for his reports about the soaring
   number of suicides among Indian farmers, a trend that has not abated for
   more than a decade. The suicides seem to follow directly from policies
   that have jettisoned every last item of Gandhi's thinking. But many
   still pretend the deaths are just the result of some odd glitch in
   carrying out the ``infallible{''} Market Uber Alles fundamentalism.
   Asked by a visiting American clergyman what he most despaired about,
   Gandhi answered, ``The hardheartedness of the educated Indians.{''}
   Sainath doesn't quote Gandhi. But this chapter does.},

Abstract = {The article analyzes the current Brazilian party system under the
   conceptual lens of Katz and Mair's cartel party theory (1995, 2009),
   using some of its indicators, but without trying a systematic and
   comprehensive test of the thesis. Three sets of indicators are explored:
   a) the party linkages with society and state; b) competition and
   collusion among the major parties; c) organization and internal
   decision-making structure. The conclusions discuss the efficacy of
   cartelization model to understand the patterns and changes of the
   Brazilian political system, and point out the empirical difficulties and
   the theoretical and conceptual inconsistencies of the model, proposing a
   theoretical reelaboration which restricts it to its essential core.},

Journal = {POLITICAL STUDIES REVIEW},

Abstract = {Political development and decay is one of the most studied topics in
   political science. The issue continues to occupy many political
   scientists and is also highly empirically relevant - not least in light
   of the recent uprisings in the Middle East. The question is whether
   democracy can and will make headway in this region, as it has been
   resistant thus far to the emergence of democracy. These societies are
   deeply `patrimonialised'; that is, the practice of patron-client
   relationships structures the interaction between state and society. This
   review essay discusses two recent books that cast new light on how
   countries can overcome such fundamental obstacles to democratisation as
   patrimonialism. Most recently, Fukuyama has offered a comprehensive
   reinterpretation of human history with The Origins of Political Order,
   but one that is broadly in line with the basic understanding in North,
   Wallis and Weingast's Violence and Social Orders: A Conceptual Framework
   for Interpreting Recorded Human History. However, both contributions are
   difficult to apply to contemporary cases of democratisation. The
   objective of this review article is to sketch a starting point for such
   a contemporary analysis, which could also help us understand the
   prospects for democracy in the Middle East.

Abstract = {Scholars have begun to show how variations in the organization of
   rebellion in war can impact outcomes related to the violence used
   against civilians, military effectiveness of armed groups and the
   post-conflict transitions. This article suggests that existing
   approaches in this literature overlook sub-group variations in
   relationships between national-level leaders of armed movements and
   local commanders. Exogenous factors that explain organizational
   variation and organizational effects are generally argued to be group
   wide. By focusing on the local level, I argue that many of the presumed
   downstream effects of variation in rebel organization can also
   contribute to the organizational choices leaders make for controlling
   local actors. This article demonstrates this argument through the case
   of Bouna in north-eastern Cote d'Ivoire, where a tax revolt against the
   local Forces Nouvelles (FN) administration, led by local Lobi youth,
   forced a restructuring in the relationship between Soro and the local FN
   commander, Morou Ouattara.},

Abstract = {The conditions for the outbreak of the global economic crisis were
   created in the process of globalization significant aspect of which was
   de-socialization of the economy in the last third of the 19th and on the
   turn of the 20th and 21st century. The economic crisis is then also a
   social and a political crisis. A failure to get the social and political
   aspects of the global economic crisis in the 1930s under control led to
   World War II. The building of a social state (a welfare state) after
   World War II was motivated by an attempt to prevent the recurrence of
   this development. However, the process of globalization at the end of
   the 20th century created the same situation in which the economic crisis
   leads to social and political crisis. A global economic system built on
   a growth of production and population threatens also its basic
   assumption - a global environmental system. It is clear that exceeding
   the environmental limits of growth is reflected in a form of social,
   political as well as economic crisis. The result of the mismanagement of
   the global economic crisis would then also mean an economic crisis which
   would only intensify a conflict potential in social and political areas.},

   `pre-emptive security'},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE PEACE \& SECURITY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {25},
Number = {2},
Pages = {141-157},
Abstract = {This article critically considers what is at stake with the emergence of
   a `pre-emptive' politics of security based upon governing the future
   through anticipatory interventions in the present. It begins by
   developing a detailed account of how the idea of pre-emption has come to
   inform the global governance of (in) security in the post-9/11 era. It
   then turns to a discussion of the logic of pre-emptive security itself.
   Here it is argued that its focus upon the future implies a
   prioritization of the imagination in its decisional logic, which has the
   effect of enhancing the degree of discretionary subjectivity granted to
   state authorities under a pre-emptive approach. The article then expands
   upon this claim by considering how it suggests an important conceptual
   link between a politics of pre-emption and political exceptionalism. It
   then concludes that the very notion of pre-emptive security can be seen
   as conceptually incoherent, since this link serves to compromise its
   capacity to produce a condition congruent with the understanding of
   `security' presupposed by its own normative framework. Accordingly, the
   practical viability and political legitimacy of pre-emption as a
   rationality for (in) security governance can be seriously called into
   question.},

Journal = {RUSI JOURNAL},

Volume = {158},

Pages = {70-75},
Abstract = {As China rises, the popular wisdom is that the US is in inexorable
   relative economic decline. A rapid loss of US power would affect the
   national-security interests of its close allies, particularly the UK.
   However, Doug Stokes argues that America's decline is not as pronounced
   as is commonly assumed. Even after the crisis, it remains,
   fundamentally, economically sound and its strategic power in important
   parts of the world means it retains the tools to manage a potential
   `hegemonic transition'. Nonetheless, the financial crisis has quickened
   structural shifts in transatlantic relations, which will inevitably have
   an impact on European strategy.},

Volume = {54},

Pages = {403-414},
Abstract = {In fiscal policy-making, though not exclusively here, we come across a
   paradox, namely the assumption that the best strategy for making
   political decisions is to move these decisions into the territory of the
   apolitical. Neutral rules and procedures are supposed to protect the
   essence of politics against party political competition. There are
   numerous examples which illustrate this. One could mention the ``debt
   brake{''} or the EU fiscal pact. The conclusion of this comment is that
   the institutionalization of apolitical decision-making processes is only
   a detour which always leads right back into the heart of politics. There
   is no such thing as the politics of non-politics.},

Abstract = {Patrick Theuret, China's ways and mankind in the twenty-first century
   When analyzing Chinese political reforms it is necessary to begin with
   the historical context of the Chinese revolution, and the role that the
   Communist Party played. Considering these reforms in the context of
   current global changes, dominated by neoliberal capitalism in crisis.
   The current stage in China in which the political system is being
   perfected, a phenomenon denying the hypothesis of the ``end of
   History{''}, remains limited by global imperialist domination. But the
   twenty-first century is increasingly revealing the cracks in this
   domination and the possible beginning of its overthrow.},

   as a zone of indifference between politics and religion (the holy). Both
   the idea of zone and the idea of indifference itself will be critically
   analized. Moreover, the argument that a threshold separates politics and

Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this chapter is to show that because the
   evolutionary roots of many kinds of phenotypic social phenomena can be
   partly traced to genotypic factors, it would be useful for social
   sciences to adopt a socio-biological research formula, which combines
   the impacts of genotypic and environmental explanatory factors.
   Design/methodology/approach - The exclusion of evolutionary factors from
   social sciences and some previous studies using evolutionary factors is
   first reviewed, after which a socio-biological research formula (y = (a
   + b) + x) is introduced. It is hypothesized that national IQ as an
   important genotypic factor explains a significant part of the global
   variation in all kinds of phenotypic social phenomena. The hypothesis is
   tested and the use of the socio-biological research formula is
   illustrated by studies of democratization (ID-10) and human development
   (HDI-II).
   Findings - The results of correlation analysis support the hypothesis on
   the evolutionary variable's (national IQ) universal explanatory power.
   National IQ explains 33 percent of the variation in ID-10 and 68 percent
   of the variation in HDI-II. Environmental variables increase
   significantly the explained part of variation in a dependent variable in
   the case of ID-10 but less in the case of HDI-11. Practical implications
   Because it is evident that national IQ as an evolutionary variable
   explains a significant part of the variation in all kinds of phenotypic
   social phenomena, it would be sensible for social sciences to adopt the
   suggested socio-biological research formula based on the idea that
   intelligence constitutes an important common explanatory factor.
   Originality/value - The suggested socio-biological research formula
   provides for the social sciences a common theoretical starting point to
   study many kinds of social problems.},

Abstract = {The caricatures of Napoleon that emerged in 1812 are a prototype of the
   Russian political poster. They show a weak and cowardly enemy, as well
   as a heroic Russian people. Their folk imagery distinguishes them from
   British and German caricatures of the same era. Because the common
   people were depicted as noble and good in contrast to the enemy, the
   censors banned the caricatures after the war and the restoration of the
   old social order.},

Journal = {POLITICKA MISAO-CROATIAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {50},
Number = {5},
Pages = {54-73},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {South Slavs have been repeatedly used as precedents for international
   humanitarian law and consequently have affected global developments:
   from the international concern over positions of Christians in
   Bosnia-Herzegovina in the 1870s that led to the peaceful replacement of
   imperial rule to the late 20th century in the NATO intervention against
   Serbia and Montenegro over Kosovo Albanians, which led to the creation
   of the newest nation-state in Europe. In addition to internal factors,
   the very creation of the common South Slav state was a result of
   international interventions, as was the dissolution of the country. The
   League of Nations ruling in favour of the Yugoslav complaint against
   Hungary in 1934 aided in developing the UN Security Council resolutions
   against Afghanistan in September 2001. Bosnia-Herzegovina in 1995 was a
   precedent for the UN sanctioned intervention, while Kosovo was a
   precedent for the non-sanctioned American-led intervention. Afghanistan,
   East Timor, Iraq, Libya are all legal consequences of interventions in
   the Balkans. Therefore, local history of interventions can lead to a
   general understanding of the development of international humanitarian
   law.},

Abstract = {In this article I examine the participation of the earliest entrants in
   the War in Croatia (1991-1995). I address the greed/grievance debate
   within the conflict literature by demonstrating that measuring
   grievances at the macro level misses the micro level processes involved
   in mobilization. Using interviews with 21 Croatian war veterans, I look
   at who fought first, comparing the initial differences between early and
   later participants, those who joined before June 25, 1991, and those
   that joined after. I argue that early joiners belonged to a bounded
   community of those disaffected with Yugoslavia and Communism; however,
   these grievances alone do not explain their participation, rather it was
   an individual's inclusion in the dissident community and the social
   relationships within that community that clarify how the first
   participants were mobilized. The findings show that all but one of the
   earliest joiners who joined through a social connection belonged to
   Croatia's dissident community and were from families that supported NDH.
   The other joiners joined by themselves after encountering violence from
   the fighting first hand. The majority of the later joiners joined after
   experiencing violence as well. Two of the three who joined through a
   social connection were also part of the dissident community and from NDH
   associated families.},

Abstract = {Electoral fraud is a form of corrupt behaviour but it is also a form of
   electoral behaviour. Once the grosser forms of stuffing the ballot box
   have been eliminated, illegal campaigning often involves precisely the
   same activities as does legal campaigning. What makes it electoral fraud
   is stepping over the line', spending X+Y when the legal limit is X for
   example. In this study we analyse the determinants of legal and illegal
   campaign efforts as well as the impact of such efforts on voter turnout.
   We use the aggregate number of election law violations per district as a
   measure of Y, which is normally unobserved because it is illegal and
   thus unreported. We further distinguish between various types of
   election fraud such as vote-buying and canvassing and determine their
   effects on turnout. We find that electoral fraud is more common in close
   races and when there is intraparty competition. Similarly, illegal
   campaign effort in general mirrors legal efforts in increasing turnout
   although its effects depend on the type of violation in question.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the impact of restructuring processes on the
   organizational structure and lobbying strategies of women's movement
   organizations (WMOs) in Belgium (Flanders) and the UK (Scotland). We
   argue that devolution/federalization and the resultant creation of new,
   intermediary levels of governance offers a devolution/federalism
   advantage to WMOs. Multilevel governance multiplies access points,
   allowing for accumulation of funds, limited forms of venue shopping, and
   avoidance of veto players. Nevertheless, a set of push and pull factors
   draws WMOs towards the regional level thereby ``abandoning the
   center.{''} These changes are driven by centrifugal dynamics that
   characterize the processes of devolution and federalization in these
   cases. In the long run, these may erase the devolution/federalism
   advantage, and also pose questions about state-wide women's citizenship
   and gender solidarity.},

   reveal a conditional relationship. Religious people in states where
   marriage was voted on had lower affect for gays and lesbians after the
   campaign. Independent of policy outcomes, subjecting a minority group to

Abstract = {During the last decade, LGBT rights has transformed into an
   international issue, making it more urgent for Ankara to address issues
   of its own LGBT community. When placed in the domestic context, the LGBT
   struggle has followed the path of other communities demanding freedoms.
   However, on the international front, the issue becomes much more
   complex. Further, if checked in a historical context, the promotion of
   LGBT rights by international organizations and the U.S. State Department
   can be seen as an extension of European intervention in Ottoman affairs
   in the mid-19th-century, and the early years of the Turkish Republic.
   This fact could lead some to perceive their agenda as a type of Western
   exclusivism or cultural imperialism. Due to these reasons, it seems that
   if change is to come in Turkey, it will be a result of domestic activism
   and Turkey's choice to continue with EU reforms.},

Abstract = {The paper summarizes an empirical research entitled: Building the gender
   from afro: A proposal for double cultural change in women's
   organizations of the Colombian Caribbean. It examines a proposal made by
   women's organizations seeking to build the gender from the afro. It
   investigates the appropriation processes and resignification taking
   place in the incorporation of the gender category as ``practice{''}. It
   also asks how the project articulates ethnic (traditional practices
   related to their history, language and worldview) and gender (as the
   supposed quest for equity between men and women) in this context. How to
   adopt and adapt the use of the gender category in order to build it
   ``from the afro{''} in groups of men and women in the movement?},

   there is a significant tradition of systematic, quantitative research on
   South African society, politics, and democracy that has contributed a
   great deal to our understanding of these issues. Yet much of this
   research has actually been carried out by South African psychologists
   and sociologists, not political scientists. And amongst the political
   scientists, a great deal of the work has been done by scholars located
   outside the country, or by non-South Africans located at South African
   universities. Very little of it is done by local political scientists,
   and even less by black South Africans.},

Abstract = {The massive security assemblages surrounding major sporting events and
   political summits embody two layers of spectacle. On the one hand,
   security operations are central to the governance of entertainment and
   media imagery. Simultaneously these security measures are profoundly
   theatrical and calibrated for the maximum visual impact: the spectacle
   of security itself. Some critical thinkers have described this dual
   spectacle as indicative of a contemporary state-corporate obsession with
   image and perception management, an obsession which detracts from
   `valid' security concerns. By contrast I argue that spectacle and
   theatricality are in fact highly functional components of the
   pacification projects of state and capital. With reference to Guy
   Debord's conception of `spectacle', this article highlights how
   mega-events reveal, in highly dramatised form, the logic of
   pacification. Using the 2010 FIFA (Federation Internationale de Football
   Association) soccer World Cup as a case study, the article demonstrates
   how police and military power are mobilised to secure accumulation, to
   enforce social control and to extend the power and arsenal of the state
   security apparatus. What is truly spectacular about mega-event security
   is not just the incorporation of media templates into the working of
   state forces. Rather, the rhetoric and concept of security itself
   becomes a form of spectacular power as it serves to both obscure and
   justify how mega-events are ultimately projects of class power.},

Abstract = {Health and health care provision are one of the most important topics in
   public policy, and often a highly debated topic in the political arena.
   The importance of considering European Union accession's impact on the
   health care sector of new member countries is highlighted by studies
   showing that accession to the Union has significant impacts on the
   socio-economic indicators of the new members, while the impacts on the
   health care system are less known. This is particularly important for a
   Central and East European country such as Croatia, where a policy
   responsive government indicates a high level of quality of democracy
   (Roberts, 2009) and where issues in the health care system have been
   carried over from the previous regime.
   In this study, I summarize the current status of health care in the
   European Union and the reasons behind the failure to create a stronger
   legislative framework around health care issues and its consequences. I
   find that the absence of more meaningful hard laws has stimulated the
   creation of alternative soft law practices to harmonize health systems
   across the Union, with uncertainty about its impact on health outcomes
   in new member countries, including Croatia.},

Abstract = {This article explores how Goa's politics have evolved in conjunction
   with national politics. It finds that there has been an evolution from
   communal regional party government dominated by the Maharashtrawadi
   Gomantak Party (MGP) to the supremacy of two national parties-the Indian
   National Congress (INC) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-that now
   dominate the politics of the state, while the situation in New Delhi has
   moved from national party supremacy to the rise of regional parties at
   the expense of national institutions. In that sense Goa's politics
   continue to be at variance from the national pattern. However, its
   pattern of unstable coalitions and pervasive defections resembles the
   national pattern.},

Abstract = {This article assesses the outcome of state assembly elections in
   Karnataka held in 2013. Extensively using the Lokniti- Centre for the
   Study of Developing Societies (CSDS), Delhi Pre-Poll Survey data, the
   article concludes that the verdict was more an unequivocal indictment of
   the state government rather than a pro-Congress vote. A Congress victory
   in the state was essentially the channelizing of an anti-incumbency
   vote. The article also makes out the case that the vote for a party is
   often a function of the voter's perception of the organizational
   strength of the party. Mapping electoral developments in the state, the
   article concludes that a phase of authentic multi-party competition is
   clearly ushered in by the 2013 electoral verdict.},

Abstract = {This article explores the concept of normative power in Europe by
   assessing the democratic impact of the European Neighbourhood Policy
   (ENP) in Eastern Europe. By focusing on democratization as a normative
   objective of the ENP, the authors argued that the European Union (EU)
   should not be assumed to be a normative power in international politics.
   It is argued that the EU vision of creating a ring of friends through
   the ENP has failed. Although the number of EU member states has
   significantly increased, and the Western European norms and values have
   become consolidated in most of Europe, Europe remains divided between EU
   member states and the others. The democratic decline in Russia, the
   conflict in Georgia in 2008, and the growing authoritarianism in Belarus
   and Ukraine have had negative effects on the notion of a whole, free,
   and democratized Europe.},

Abstract = {In Germany, citizens are increasingly demanding an enhanced and easier
   use of direct democratic procedures. At the same time, there is a
   controversy whether these procedures actually induce ``more{''}
   democracy or whether the results of the votes are distorted by the
   unequal participation of people with different socio-structural
   backgrounds. The article provides an overview of the literature on
   policy effects of direct democracy in Switzerland and the U.S. and
   discusses in how far they can be applied to Germany. Then, we review
   additional relevant research results for Germany and discuss in how far
   these studies help to answer the research question outlined above with
   regard to the case of Germany. In conclusion, we define the research gap
   in detail.},

Abstract = {Whether and how developments and changes in welfare state policies are
   related with population heterogeneity has been a subject of contention.
   This article examines this relationship using data on welfare state
   provisions and practices, and ethno-racial, religious, and immigration
   heterogeneity, from 17 high-income Organisation for Economic
   Co-operation and Development countries between 1980 and 2005. Findings
   suggest that while religious diversity lacks a systematic association
   with welfare state policies, the relationship of ethno-racial and
   especially immigration diversity bifurcates between welfare state
   decommodification and expenditures. The welfare state
   expenditure-increasing and welfare-state-provision-decreasing roles of
   immigration, in particular, provide important insights into why welfare
   state policies may have been limited in some countries and lately scaled
   back in others.},

Abstract = {I provide evidence that the degree to which medieval Hindus and Muslims
   could provide complementary, nonreplicable services and a mechanism to
   share the gains from exchange has resulted in a sustained legacy of
   ethnic tolerance in South Asian towns. Due to Muslim-specific advantages
   in Indian Ocean shipping, interethnic complementarities were strongest
   in medieval trading ports, leading to the development of institutional
   mechanisms that further supported interethnic exchange. Using novel
   town-level data spanning South Asia's medieval and colonial history, I
   find that medieval ports, despite being more ethnically mixed, were five
   times less prone to Hindu-Muslim riots between 1850 and 1950, two
   centuries after Europeans disrupted Muslim overseas trade dominance, and
   remained half as prone between 1950 and 1995. Household-level evidence
   suggests that these differences reflect local institutions that emerged
   to support interethnic medieval trade, continue to influence modern
   occupational choices and organizations, and substitute for State
   political incentives in supporting interethnic trust.},

Abstract = {Concerns about endogeneity often complicate attempts to estimate a
   causal link between public opinion and the voting records of Members of
   the European Parliament (MEPs). In this article, I overcome this problem
   by exploiting a rare natural experimentthe surprising and exogenous
   revelation of Irish public opinion that resulted from Ireland's
   ratification of the Nice treaty. I find that the Irish electorate's
   rejection of Nice caused Ireland's European Parliament delegation to
   vote in a more conservative manner, while its subsequent ratification
   caused a partial reversal of this shift. My finding of an electoral
   connection on the Nice treaty casts doubt on the claim that MEPs are
   largely unconstrained by voter preferences on European issues, despite
   claims of a democratic deficit in European institutions.},

Abstract = {How do global sources of information such as mass media outlets, state
   propaganda, NGOs, and national party leadership affect aggregate
   behavior? Prior work on this question has insufficiently considered the
   complex interaction between social network and mass media influences on
   individual behavior. By explicitly modeling this interaction, I show
   that social network structure conditions media's impact. Empirical
   studies of media effects that fail to consider this risk bias. Further,
   social network interactions can amplify media bias, leading to large
   swings in aggregate behavior made more severe when individuals can
   select into media matching their preferences. Countervailing media
   outlets and social elites with unified preferences can mitigate the
   effect of bias; however, media outlets promulgating antistatus quo bias
   have an advantage. Theoretical results such as these generate numerous
   testable hypotheses; I provide guidelines for deriving and testing
   hypotheses from the model and discuss several such hypotheses.},

Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {20},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1036-1055},

Abstract = {This article focuses on student opposition to the Portuguese Estado Novo
   regime, examining the links between the dynamics of mobilization and
   radicalization and the emergence of new political actors before the fall
   of the Salazar dictatorship on the one hand, and the revolutionary
   process which characterized the Portuguese transition on the other. The
   25 April 1974 military coup d'etat that overthrew the Estado Novo
   triggered what later came to be known as the third wave' of
   democratization; but the Portuguese transition was characterized by
   elements of rupture that were much more significant than those observed
   in the subsequent democratization processes of Spain and Greece. This
   rupture was a result of the form of regime change - a military coup
   d'etat - and was sustained with the mass social mobilization that
   followed. While key studies have stressed that the political crisis
   after the fall of regime was the fundamental cause of this exceptional
   mobilization, the argument advanced in this article is that the
   pre-revolutionary cycle of protest also explains the particular
   characteristics of the Portuguese transition.},

   (2005)},
Journal = {BALTIC JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN STUDIES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {3},
Number = {2},
Pages = {96-119},

Abstract = {Explaining the withdrawal of his signature from the Estonian-Russian
   Border Agreement, the Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov
   announced on June 27, 2005 that ``they in the EU might have succumbed to
   the temptation of telling us to ratify it {[}...] on your side also,
   with some interpretations attached, so that the treaty can enter into
   force. To stop the EU from falling into this temptation, we have
   withdrawn our signature. There will be no treaty{''}. Thus, Moscow
   actually punished the European Union, which seems logical as with regard
   to geopolitics and geostrategy, the border negotiations were held in the
   buffer zone between the European Union and Russia.
   In 2004-2005 Russia held simultaneous and also interconnected border
   negotiations with Japan, China, Kazakhstan, Latvia and Estonia, with
   agreements eventually signed only with China and Kazakhstan. Failures
   with Japan, Latvia and Estonia derived from Moscow's position to keep
   all gains of World War II. At the same time Russia had related all its
   foreign affairs with the celebration of the 60th anniversary of the end
   of World War II held in Russia, which was curiously used by the young
   Georgian leader Mikheil Saakashvili, whose quick and clear manoeuvres
   approved by the West turned the ordinary Rimland country Georgia into a
   classic geopolitical pivot. And all this was done at the expense of
   Russia's influence. The highlight of the process was Saakashvili's
   statement that he will come to Moscow on May 9th only if Russia agrees
   to withdraw its military bases from Georgia. The Kremlin considered it
   best to agree, however, as the European Council aside the US, uniting
   the problems of Estonia, Latvia and the non-EU member Georgia, also
   began to praise the latter for overcoming Russia, Moscow decided to
   punish the nearest available EU member in the given situation by
   withdrawing its signature from the Russian-Estonian border treaty.},

Abstract = {This article is a study of the contradictions of conservatism. It shows
   that most modern writers since Oakeshott have defined conservatism in an
   abstract manner. Here I argue that their definition, although not wrong,
   is an incomplete definition which is only coherent because it is
   incomplete. It is only the first stage in understanding conservatism,
   which has to be understood also as a negation of rival ideologies and,
   further, as a political position which points to a tradition or truth
   outside itself and which can, in service of this tradition or truth, be
   radical. Since it is part of the standard definition of conservatism
   that it cannot be radical, this means conservatism, taken as a whole,
   contradicts itself.},

Abstract = {This article examines how pocketbook and sociotropic economic
   evaluations jointly affect economic voting behavior for those that have
   ``fallen behind{''} in their personal financial conditions relative to
   aggregate economic performance. According to reference-dependent and
   relative loss theories, those who have fallen behind should be less
   likely to support the incumbent president. Alternatively, attributing
   personal financial conditions to the incumbent is cognitively complex
   and can conflict with core values, and the sociotropic version of voting
   is typically stronger than the pocketbook version. These approaches are
   tested, and the results show that the sociotropic version of economic
   voting predominates even among those who have fallen behind. The results
   are robust to controls for nongovernmental sources of variation in
   personal financial conditions. These results have important implications
   for democratic accountability in an age of economic inequality.},

Abstract = {Homophobia is found in many parts of Russian society. It varies
   according to gender, age, education, place of residence, and political
   affiliation. The overwhelming majority of people have no contact with
   homosexuals and know nothing about homosexuality. Homophobia appeals
   especially to those who are fundamentally anti-democratic in attitude
   and make claims of national and religious exclusivity. Thus, homophobia
   is often accompanied by other forms of xenophobia. A specific feature of
   homophobia in Russia is that it expresses anti-Western attitudes.},

Title = {Ideology matters: Why decentralisation has a differentiated effect on

Volume = {52},

Abstract = {This article addresses the effects of decentralisation reforms on
   regionalist parties' electoral strength. It takes up the debate between
   accommodatists' (i.e., electoral loss due to policy accommodation) and
   institutionalists' (i.e., electoral gain due to institutional
   empowerment). These effects depend on the electoral venue considered -
   regional or national - and on the ideological radicalism of a given
   regionalist party - secessionist or autonomist. This study finds that
   increases in the level of decentralisation are positively associated
   with higher scores for autonomist parties in regional elections, while
   they are not statistically significantly correlated with secessionist
   parties' electoral performances. In contrast, in national elections,
   decentralisation reforms seem to penalise autonomist parties more than
   secessionist ones. These findings are based on the analysis of a novel
   dataset which includes regional and national vote shares for 77
   regionalist parties in 11 Western democracies from 1950 until 2010.},

Abstract = {Noel Pearson is one of Australia's most prominent and influential
   Indigenous intellectuals. This article examines a major idea in
   Pearson's writing, the quest for a radical centre'. It examines this
   idea from the perspective of both its usefulness in understanding the
   deficiencies in public conversation about Indigenous affairs, and its
   persuasiveness in legitimating the role that Pearson has played
   nationally as a champion of the Indigenous responsibility discourse. The
   article argues that conceptualising public debate as a quest for a
   radical centre resonates strongly with the theory of deliberative
   democracy. Similar to Dryzek and Niemeyer's work on discursive
   representation', the idea of the radical centre reveals the legitimacy
   possessed by unelected champions of discourses.},

Abstract = {In France, even though debates about Islam sometimes risk bordering
   racism, religious minorities are aware that secularism remains their
   best protection. In Turkey, the choice of secularism cannot simply be
   summed up as a confrontation between authoritarian secularists bullying
   democracy and Islamists using democracy to undermine secularism. If the
   recent allowing of the headscarf to be worn by Turkish university
   students, civil servants, and members of parliament is part of a trend
   towards a general reversal of secularism, driven by a political movement
   that is turning religious tenets into political norms, the results could
   be worrisome. Under such ``democratization{''}, not only secularism but
   democracy itself becomes threatened.},

Abstract = {In Mars 2013 the Icelandic Parliament decided upon the first formal
   ``Icelandic Cultural Policy{''}. In this article that document is
   examined in light of debates concerning the concept of deliberate
   cultural policy making. Two main themes stand out as central in the new
   policy: participation/access on the one hand, and the importance of
   rules and procedures on the other. It is also noteworthy that there is
   less emphasis on national identity and Icelandic cultural heritage than
   perhaps was suspected. Even if there is no one definition that can be
   considered the right one for ``cultural policy{''} (O. Bennett 2004; T.
   Bennett 2007; Frenander 2008; Gray 2010), it is important to understand
   and make clear those interpretations that may be dominant at a
   particular moment in time. For more in depth insight this study compares
   a few recent reviews and studies of cultural policies (Gestur
   Gudmundsson 2003; Haukur F. Hannessonar 2009; Bjarki Valtysson 2011;
   Agust Einarsson 2012) and all these threads spin the narrative of
   contemporary debates on cultural policy in Iceland.},

Abstract = {Social media websites are rapidly changing the way that Americans live
   and communicate with one another. Social media sites encourage
   individuals to constantly share information about one's self (and
   constantly seek information about others) that would have been private
   in the past. This experience can alter how an individual views the world
   in ways that political scientists have not been able to fully capture.
   In a cross-sectional survey of the American public I find a strong
   correlation between the use of Facebook and personal blogs and support
   for civil liberties. Individuals who spend more time self-publicizing on
   the Internet seem to value freedom of expression more, but also value
   the right to privacy less than individuals who use social media less
   often. This pattern suggests that technology may be altering American
   attitudes on basic democratic values and highlights the need for dynamic
   research designs that account for the causal effect Internet use may
   have on individual political development.},

Abstract = {Concepts such as ``quality of government{''} and ``good governance{''}
   refer to a desired character of the exercise of public authority.
   Recently the interest in good governance, the quality of government, and
   similar concepts has increased considerably. However, despite this
   increasing interest and use, an adequate definition of the concept of
   quality of government has proved difficult to find. This article
   criticizes recent attempts at such a definition and proposes an
   alternative, more complex definition that includes moral content and
   also encompasses a plurality of values and virtues at its core. An
   acceptable definition of the quality of governance must be consistent
   with the demands of a public ethos, the virtues of good decision making
   and reason giving, the rule of law, efficiency, stability, and a
   principle of beneficence. The article describes these components in
   detail and the relations among them.},

Abstract = {The study of presidential cabinets has mainly focused on coalitional
   formations, distinguishing individual ministers in terms of their party
   affiliation particularly at cabinet instauration and termination. This
   article moves the focus to single-party cabinets to study minister
   appointment in situations where the legislative support is less
   relevant. A model of analysis that observes extra-partisan affiliations,
   individual technical skills and personal liaison with the president is
   proposed and exploratory applied to the Argentinean case. The results
   suggest that well positioned presidents tend to apply closer strategies
   of portfolio distribution, with levels of institutionalization that
   depends on the president's party organization and the president's style
   of leadership.},

Abstract = {This study presents a novel approach to crisis prevention based on data
   on premonitory political and religious events and the international
   media coverage of publicly sensitive circumstances. We implement our
   method to the Israel-Palestine conflict. First we identify two main
   political scenarios associated with ``good{''} and ``bad{''} political
   times of low or high levels of political unrest using a hierarchical
   clustering technique. Then we construct a political alert index to
   predict the probability of occurrence of good and bad times. Bad times
   are positively and significantly associated with the number of Israeli
   victims at the checkpoints, the number of homeless or injured
   Palestinians and with the number of demolitions. The number of
   Palestinian prisoners and injured Israelis negatively affect the
   probability of occurrence of a bad time. Media coverage is positively
   and significantly associated with the transition to bad times. Our
   results show that our statistical tool can be a reliable method for
   early warning of social crisis and can be effectively replicated to
   other social crisis situations.},

Abstract = {The advocacy coalition framework (ACF) provides a means to explore
   complex policy issues and the dynamics of belief systems shared by
   multiple actors in the policy-making process. Using a single case study,
   this article expands the application of the ACF to the complex policy
   subsystem of the U.S. automobile industry during the 2009 auto bailout
   and subsequent bankruptcy of General Motors and Chrysler. We examine the
   development and actions of policy coalitions and further expand the ACF
   by exploring the role of policy brokers during the automobile crisis. We
   also examine whether policy brokers are politically neutral actors as
   previous research debates and what actions they take if compromise
   cannot be reached between competing coalitions.},

Title = {Do Term Limits Restrain State Fiscal Policy? Approaches for Causal
   Inference in Assessing the Effects of Legislative Institutions},
Journal = {LEGISLATIVE STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {38},

Abstract = {Scholars of state politics are often interested in the causal effects of
   legislative institutions on policy outcomes. For example, during the
   1990s a number of states adopted term limits for state legislators.
   Advocates of term limits argued that this institutional reform would
   alter state policy in a number of ways, including limiting state
   expenditures. We highlight a number of research design issues that
   complicate attempts to estimate the effect of institutions on state
   outcomes by addressing the question of term limits and spending. In
   particular, we focus on (1) treatment effect heterogeneity and (2) the
   suitability of nonterm-limit states as good counterfactuals for
   term-limit states. We compare two different identification strategies to
   deal with these issues: differences-in-differences (DID) estimation and
   conditioning on prior outcomes with an emphasis on synthetic case
   control. Using more rigorous methods of causal inference, we find little
   evidence that term limits affect state spending. Our analysis and
   results are informative for researchers seeking to assess the causal
   effects of state-level institutions.},

Abstract = {The values divide between materialists and postmaterialists, first
   identified by Ronald Inglehart, continues to define the evolution of
   partisan loyalties in the United States. Contemporary analysis of voting
   behavior within the White working-class incorporates the debate between
   a revisionist school that identifies a contemporary electoral
   battleground inverted from that of the New Deal era and a traditionalist
   school that maintains the class alignment established during the New
   Deal largely remains in effect. The following case study investigating
   voting behavior in Pennsylvania at the precinct level allows the
   application of empirical data to identify trends in partisan identity.
   The study concludes that there is significant evidence that the class
   loyalties as determinants of partisan attachment established by the New
   Deal have been superseded by values-driven imperatives. Accordingly,
   traditionally Democratic, materialist blue-collar constituencies in
   southwestern Pennsylvania have moved towards the Republican Party, while
   the opposite has occurred in the traditionally Republican
   postmaterialist white-collar constituencies of southeastern
   Pennsylvania. Given the underlying demographics, the Democratic Party
   has been the net winner from this transfer of allegiances.},

Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},

Volume = {36},

Abstract = {This article makes a contribution to the understanding of party
   organisation by examining one of the most successful West European
   communist parties, the Communist Party of Cyprus (AKEL). Defying the
   downward trend of its counterparts and the external shock of Soviet
   collapse, the AKEL has managed to sustain the support of nearly a third
   of the electorate. Using original archival evidence and interview data,
   the article attributes the electoral endurance of the AKEL to
   organisational continuity. Since its founding, the party has built a
   robust mass party structure, with an extensive network of auxiliary
   organisations and strong centralising mechanisms. During the crisis of
   the late 1980s, the party kept the basic features of this organisational
   model intact refusing to dismantle its Leninist organisational
   infrastructure. Organisational continuity has helped the AKEL sustain
   its electoral strength by signalling its ideological consistency.
   Organisational continuity might also account for the relative
   persistence of other communist parties in Western Europe.},

Abstract = {This article examines a highly influential intellectual image aimed at
   explaining the political process in Argentina. We name this image as
   ``regional unbalanced party fragmentation{''} (FDR).
   This image evokes a process of ``territorialization{''}, understood as a
   decentration of partisan forces that multiplies political centers in
   sub-national areas. According to this image, the argentinian party
   system confronts growing difficulties resulting from the coexistence of
   an expanded party fragmentation in central areas jointly with a highly
   concentrated party competition in the peripheral areas.
   After a brief presentation of the above mentioned image, the main
   theories proposed to explain it are put to test, namely, the
   decentralization of state expenditure, devaluation of party labels, the
   transfiguration of the political culture and the effect of district
   magnitude.
   A detailed review of these explanations proves that, relevant as these
   factors are, they are not enough to explain ``FDR{''}.},

Abstract = {This research note pays attention to the main indicators that the
   literature has proposed to measure the quality of local citizen
   participatory experiences. Next, a number of variables are suggested to
   measure this phenomenon and analyze their relationship with some
   features of the municipalities where they were developed. Last, a
   multivariate model is presented in order to estimate these participatory
   quality indicators on the basis of contextual variables. The analysis
   relies on a survey conducted during the fall of 2009 that was
   administered to 120 technicians from as many Andalusian municipalities.
   The survey gathers information on the existence and characteristics of
   this type of participatory processes since 2003. The study concludes
   that contextual factors are influential to a certain extent, and even
   critically important for some dimensions of quality, as deliberation.},

Abstract = {Throughout history, the USA government has set out a complex,
   subordinate and painful relationship upon the U.S' native habitants,
   which has meant for the indigenous population a significant loss of
   land, persecution, forced relocation, wars and physical and cultural
   annihilation. This article pretends to narrate the story of the
   subordination and resistance of the Native Americans, especially since
   the indigenous cultural renovation as a consequence of the increase of
   their political activism in the context of the 1970's social
   transformation, during the XX century. It shows how the American society
   tries to make a transition from a unilateral model of relations to a
   bilateral one, where the indigenous needs and expectations are taken
   into account for the design and implementation of a public policy
   addressed to them.},

Abstract = {The events of 9/11 along with the bombarding in Madrid and London forced
   governments to resort to new structures of privacy safeguarding and
   electronic surveillance under the common denominator of terrorism and
   transnational crime fighting. Legislation as US PATRIOT Act and EU Data
   Retention Directive altered fundamentally, the collection, processing
   and sharing methods of personal data, while it granted increased powers
   to police and law enforcement authorities concerning their jurisdiction
   in obtaining and processing personal information to an excessive degree.
   As an aftermath of the resulted opacity and the public outcry, a shift
   is recorded during the last years towards a more open governance by the
   implementation of open data and cloud computing practices in order to
   enhance transparency and accountability from the side of governments,
   restore the trust between the State and the citizens, and amplify the
   citizens' participation to the decision-making procedures. However;
   privacy and personal data protection are major issues in all occasions
   and, thus, must be safeguarded without sacrificing national security and
   public interest on one hand, but without crossing the thin line between
   protection and infringement on the other: Where this delicate balance
   stands, is the focal point of this paper trying to demonstrate that it
   is better to be cautious with open practices than hostage of clandestine
   practices.},

Abstract = {Threats in cyberspace can be classified in many ways. This is evident
   when you look at cyber security on a multinational level. One of the
   most common models is a threefold classification based on motivational
   factors. Most nations use this model as a foundation when creating a
   strategy to handle cyber security threats as it pertains to them. This
   paper will use the five level model: cyber activism, cybercrime, cyber
   espionage, cyber terrorism and cyber warfare. The National Cyber
   Security Strategy defines articulates the overall aim and objectives of
   the nation's cyber security policy and sets out the strategic priorities
   that the national government will pursue to achieve these objectives.
   The Cyber Security Strategy also describes the key objectives that will
   be undertaken through a comprehensive body of work across the nation to
   achieve these strategic priorities. Cyberspace underpins almost every
   facet of the national functions vital to society and provides critical
   support for areas like critical infrastructure, economy, public safety,
   and national security. National governments aim at making a substantial
   contribution to secure cyberspace and they have different focus areas in
   the cyber ecosystem. In this context the level of cyber security reached
   is the sum of all national and international measures taken to protect
   all activities in the cyber ecosystem. This paper will analyze the cyber
   security threats, vulnerabilities and cyber weaponry and the cyber
   security objectives of the Cyber Security Strategies made by Australia,
   Canada, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, the
   United Kingdom and the United States.},

Abstract = {We theorize that evaluations of leaders under terrorist and economic
   threat vary by both incumbency status and politician partisanship. This
   argument is based on insights from theories of rally effects, economic
   voting, and issue ownership, and we assess it with data from four
   national studies. The first two are experiments featuring hypothetical
   candidates; consistent with expectations based on issue ownership, the
   analyses show that Republican incumbents (Democratic challengers) are
   viewed comparatively better in times of terrorist (economic) threat.
   Then, with another experiment and with survey data, we consider
   evaluations of President Obama, whose image under terrorist threat
   should be helped by his incumbency but harmed by his partisanship, and
   the reverse for economic decline. We again find evidence supporting our
   argument and, further, individual-level evidence of issue ownership
   effects. We conclude that threats, incumbency status, and politician
   partisanship interact in important ways as they affect evaluations of
   political leaders.},

Abstract = {The main objective of this paper is to empirically test the variables of
   the theory of transaction costs and resource based view that influence
   on the decision of internationalization of production processes. A
   logistic regression with data from companies in 15 European countries

   likelihood that companies conduct international sourcing. In contrary,
   an increase in fiscal and financial aspects, increase the likelihood
   that companies conduct international sourcing.},

Abstract = {Academics and policy-makers have highlighted the increasing
   disconnection between citizens and electoral politics in Europe.
   Declining citizen involvement in traditional forms of politics has
   manifested itself in lower voter turnout and a dramatic shrinkage in the
   membership of political parties. Citizens have turned to alternative
   forms of civic and political engagement. These trends are most marked
   amongst young people. Whilst a number of studies have examined the
   nature of political participation in Europe, and the participation of
   young people in individual countries or specific political activities
   (such as voting), hardly any research has looked at patterns of
   engagement within' a generation of young people across different
   democracies. This article examines the political participation of young
   Europeans in national democracies in 15 European Union member states.
   Previous studies have shown that citizens are increasingly moving away
   from electoral forms of participation towards alternative forms of
   engagement that are (for the population as a whole) much less socially
   equal. Using data from the European Social Survey, this article finds
   that the social inequalities of participation are (with the major
   exception of voting) much less profound for young people. This latter
   finding has important implications for public efforts to promote greater
   youth participation in democracy.},

Abstract = {Why is the Korean welfare state underdeveloped? From the
   institutionalist point of view, it is evident that existing institutions
   influence the policy preferences of key actors of welfare politics:
   organized labor and employers on the demand side and politicians on the
   supply side. Distributive demands of organized labor have been satisfied
   by affluent big business (or chaebol) through an implicit or explicit
   cross-class alliance with parochial enterprise unions, and the nation's
   single-member-district electoral rules have induced politicians to sell
   geographically targeted benefits rather than promising social welfare
   for all beyond their district. As a result, despite the nation's
   successful economic growth and democratization, neither the supply nor
   the demand side has been conducive to significant welfare state
   expansion in Korea.},

Abstract = {In this article, I examine aspects of recent shifts in Pakistani
   citizenship norms and the implications for migrant populations. In doing
   so, I investigate how the coalescing of national security concerns with
   broader issues of immigration has brought illegal' migrants like the
   Burmese-Rohingya and Bangladeshis into the state's documented embrace.
   My purpose is threefold: to record the modalities of change through the
   discourse of illegality' which articulate the exigencies of the war on
   terror'; to explore the implications of such change on certain Muslim
   migrant populations resident in Pakistan for several decades; and,
   through these discussions, to show how citizenship and belonging have
   played out in a very different way for them. The subject of
   immigration/migration and illegality in Pakistan, especially in the
   post-9/11 frame, has remained largely below the threshold of academic
   attention.},

Abstract = {One of the distinctive features of the Indian sub-continent is its rich
   religious diversity. This article examines two political responses to
   religious diversity, one, in third century BCE and the other in the
   middle of the last century as India became independent from British
   colonial rule. In Ancient India, Emperor Asoka issued edicts that
   advised people of all religious faiths to live together and claimed that
   the condition of sociability are fulfilled by all religious perspectives
   as each values self-restraint and self-purification. In the public
   arena, this translates into restraint of speech and civility towards one
   another. Modern India presented an entirely different scenario. Here the
   state had to respond to well demarcated, often conflicting religious
   communities, each of whom, was at least partially committed to freedom
   and equality-oriented reforms. This necessitated that the state take a
   somewhat combative stance towards both inter and intra-religious
   domination. The article argues that the only way in which to undermine
   these forms of domination is that the state adopts a policy of
   principled distance towards all religions.},

Abstract = {Research undertaken on student feedback has pointed to the difficulties
   that students have in understanding written feedback. However, little
   attention has been given to understanding student views on verbal
   feedback. This article aims to fill this gap by reporting on the
   findings of verbal feedback practices among 114 History, Politics and
   International Relations students obtained from a questionnaire survey.
   These findings were supported by five in-depth semi-structured
   interviews. The findings show variance in student views with regard to
   different aspects of verbal feedback. The research outlines a number of
   suggestions that assist in developing verbal feedback opportunities
   further. It is argued that `feedback-dialogues' provide a mechanism for
   improving student understanding of feedback.},

Abstract = {This article considers the motivational supports that might be thought
   necessary and also possible for socialism. It does this by way of a
   critique of G.A. Cohen's Why not socialism? The article begins by
   briefly summarizing the argument of that book, then goes on to identify
   a logical tension in Cohen's presentation of the socialist at once
   egalitarian and communal ethos of the camping trip (as assessed against
   a sixfold typology of person-to-person relations), and from this
   tension, as well as from independent evidence, it calls into question
   Cohen's hope that people might come to regard and treat each other on a
   society-wide scale in the same way they regard and treat their
   camping-trip companions. The postscript asks whether the camping trip
   ideal would be desirable for society even if it were feasible, and then
   suggests why it might not.},

   Broader contextual explanations related to the alteration of the Court's

Abstract = {Political science is far behind the other social science disciplines in
   incorporating neurobiological concepts, techniques, and theory. In
   recent years progress has been made in closing this gap but many in the
   political science mainstream view the movement with concern or even
   horror. Though a healthy dose of skepticism is appropriate and
   beneficial to the scientific endeavor, negative reactions to viewing
   politics through a neurobiological lens are often based on fundamental
   misconceptions regarding both neurobiology and politics. In this
   Reflections essay, I address ten of these misconceptions, including the
   beliefs that biology is deterministic, reductionist, unnecessary,
   irrelevant, normatively dangerous, and ideologically biased. The goal is
   to encourage a constructive dialogue on the relevance of neurobiology to
   political life-a dialogue that would in turn improve research in the
   fledgling subfield and lead to innovations in political science by
   encouraging new ways of conceptualizing and analyzing the variables at
   the discipline's core.},

Abstract = {Although pacifism and nonviolence bear a close relationship to one
   another historically, pacifism is the ideological assertion that war and
   violence should be rejected in political and personal life, whereas
   nonviolence refers to a distinct set of political practices. Unlike
   other modern ideologies such as liberalism and socialism, pacifism has
   never gained widespread acceptance among a significant portion of
   humanity and seems to remain a minority position among most of the
   peoples of the world. Even among those who use nonviolent techniques,
   the conventional wisdom that physical violence is necessary under
   certain circumstances often prevails. However, a growing body of
   empirical evidence shows that the methods of nonviolence are more likely
   to succeed than methods of violence across a wide variety of
   circumstances and that more people are using nonviolence around the
   world. At the same time, both the effectiveness of military and material
   superiority in achieving political ends and the incidence of warfare and
   violence appear to be waning. In a remarkable example of convergence
   between empirical social science and political theory, explanations for
   the effectiveness of nonviolence relative to violence point to a
   people-centered understanding of power. This research can provide a
   basis for a reinvigorated and pragmatic brand of pacifism that refocuses
   the attention of political scientists on the organization, actions, and
   loyalties of people as opposed to technologies of domination and
   destruction.},

Abstract = {The Canadian party system exhibits both ``stable dealignment,{''}
   defined as directionless volatility and relative stability. But the
   boundary between the system's orderly and disorderly parts is not that
   clear in conventional wisdom, which contrasts big, inclusive parties
   with small parties representing ideas or interests. In fact, the
   relatively stable parties have been the NDP and the Liberals, in
   contrast to the Conservatives and a rotating cast of province- or
   region-specific insurgents. Volatility is a feature mainly of Quebec and
   the West and is greater in federal than in provincial elections. But
   geographic divergence is greater in provincial elections. The paper
   proposes a research program to account for Canada's coexistence of
   opposites.},

Abstract = {The UK's second nationwide referendum, held in May 2011, offers rich
   opportunities for analysing the dynamics of a referendum campaign. The
   articles gathered together in this symposium address three themes. The
   first concerns the determinants and dynamics of public opinion during a
   referendum campaign, the second relates to the potential for interaction
   between the referendum and simultaneous elections, and the third focuses
   on coverage of the referendum in the media. Following a brief outline of
   the background to the referendum, this paper introduces the contribution
   that each article makes to these themes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {The norms of international ``soft law{''} (ISL) have explicitly gained a
   certain importance in the legal system of the Russian Federation.
   Although soft law does not have legal force, its norms have become
   widespread within the framework of domestic jurisdiction.
   The present article reflects the outcome of the holistic legal analysis
   of the impact of ISL as a regulatory instrument on different component
   parts of the domestic legal system, such as positive law,
   law-enforcement practice, legal theory, legal consciousness of non-state
   actors.
   A conclusion has been formulated about the development of a definite
   tendency that the international component part of the Russian legal
   system is not only limited to ``the universally-recognized norms of
   international law and international treaties and agreements{''}, as it
   is stated in part 4 of article 15 of the Constitution of the Russian
   Federation. An increasingly important role is played by international
   norms of a non-legal nature. This appears outstanding in view of the
   peculiarities of ``soft law{''}.},

Abstract = {This analysis of criminal behaviour in the use and abuse of social
   networks focuses, firstly, on the crimes that this behaviour can lead to
   (epigraphs 3 to 6) - some of which have been introduced recently, such
   as child grooming - where users of these networks can be both the
   offender or victim in the violation of the fundamental rights affected
   by such behaviour (epigraph 2). Secondly, it looks at the question of
   the possible criminal responsibility of social network managers - who
   are taking on an increasingly incisive role and becoming more important
   agents in the system's evolution, and, thus, also in the strategies for
   preventing and controlling criminal activities on the web (epigraph 7).
   The main critical aspects arising from this research highlight initial
   indications for how to adapt the criminal law regulating this area to
   the current needs.},

   implications the public presence of the collective's demonstrations in
   favor of the legalization of marijuana in current discussion on the
   relevance of the war against illegal drugs. The text's central
   conjecture asserts that these demonstrations express a form of

Abstract = {This essay reclaims a political proceduralist vision of democracy as the
   best normative defense of democracy in contemporary politics. We
   distinguish this vision from three main approaches that are

   of democracy as a process of truth seeking; the populist defense of
   democracy as a mobilizing politics that defies procedures; and the
   classical minimalist or Schumpeterian definition of democracy as a
   competitive method for selecting leaders.},

Abstract = {In a globalized world where trans- and supranational networks,
   communication and the exchange of information gain in importance,
   national political decision making processes do not occur independently
   from each other. Policy diffusion is assumed to become more and more
   relevant also for welfare state development. This paper explicitly
   focuses on the policy diffusion among 21 OECD countries in the period
   between 1980 and 2007 looking at social spending dynamics. The empirical
   findings of the spatial regressions clearly indicate that spatial
   patterns in social spending dynamics are driven by policy diffusion
   processes. In fact, economic interdependencies define the pathways of
   diffusion. Trading partners move in the same direction regarding social
   policy behavior. Surprisingly, cultural and geographical proximity are
   less relevant for the diffusion processes, at least in terms of social
   spending dynamics.},

Abstract = {The 11 March 2011 earthquake and tsunami damaged the nuclear reactors in
   Fukushima. Prime Minister Naoto Kan took this crisis seriously, and made
   himself personally involved with damage control, especially during the
   first week. This study examines the responses to the incident by the
   prime minister's office.
   Universal wisdom is that crises are better handled at the level closest
   to which they occur. Shifting the decision making to the higher
   authority is needed when a crisis spills over the local boundary or when
   the local authority fails to deal with the situation. This is called
   `upscaling'.
   Frustrated by the lack of communication coming from the bureaucracy and
   Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), Kan upscaled the decision making
   and began micromanaging damage control. The upscaling, however, did not
   contribute to improvement in the accident situation in most cases. Even
   in one case, it exacerbated it.
   On the other hand, upscaling made a significant difference when the
   TEPCO officials considered withdrawing from the accident. By upscaling
   to the higher authority, Kan stopped their withdrawal. After the
   establishment of a joint headquarters with TEPCO, the political leaders,
   instead of upscaling, moved down to a closer level to the accident and
   successfully coordinated the recovery work.},

Title = {How has Indian Federalism Done?},
Journal = {STUDIES IN INDIAN POLITICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {1},
Number = {1},
Pages = {43-63},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Two tropes have dominated discussions of Indian federalism: fiscal and
   constitutional. Isolated exceptions aside, scholars have not linked
   India's federalism to comparative theories of nationalism, or to a
   comparative exploration of national identities. To examine how India's
   federalism has done, we may also need to ask what kind of nation India
   is. Once we answer that question, the oft-assumed binary-that the
   stronger the states are, the weaker the centre will be-loses its edge.
   Both can be simultaneously strong. The new exception may be the problem
   of cross-border terrorism, which indeed generates a binary for the new
   age. Secessionism also creates centre-state binaries, but that may be
   more on account of how the basic ideational principles of Indian
   nationhood have been violated, not followed, or about how far the
   historical process of nation-building penetrated the rebellious regions.
   Such problems have not been about the basic flaws of Indian federalism.},

Abstract = {Ideological labels are theoretically useful tools with which individuals
   comprehend, discuss, and engage in politics. Their actual significance,
   however, varies. We assess how select individual and contextual factors
   systematically affect individuals' use and understandings of the classic
   left-right dimension in Latin America. Using data from the 2010
   AmericasBarometer survey, we show that although education, political
   interest, and political sophistication help citizens place themselves on
   the ideological continuum, context also matters such that polarization
   (positively), fragmentation (negatively), and volatility (negatively)
   affect left-right response. Our analyses further demonstrate that,
   generally speaking, placements on the left-right scale are linked to
   individuals' stances on economic, democratic, religious, and social
   issues, but context matters in important ways here as well. In short,
   ideological labels in Latin America hold important potential for
   orienting citizens within the political arena, but their utility is
   constrained in important ways at both the individual and contextual
   levels.},

Abstract = {The central aim of this work is to tackle the problem of the relation
   between the official cultural policies of the PCA and the Communist
   Party of the Soviet Union from the appropriation of the Soviet
   guidelines for the Communist Party of Argentina during the first years
   of the decade of 1930. We will analyse the cultural publications related
   or controlled by the Argentine communist direction. Firstly, wee will
   recover the discussion originated around the autonomy of culture and the
   role of the intellectual led by Rodolfo Ghioldi and Roberto Arlt, and
   which was continued and resignified by Carlos Moog and Ral Gonzalez
   Tunon.},

Abstract = {The ``father{''} of Argentinian Marxism was a German immigrant: the land
   surveyor and mining engineer German Ave-Lallemant (1835-1910). Lallemant
   wrote in 1890 a pioneering materialist analysis of Argentine history
   that sought to understand the causes of Argentinian backwardness. The
   reasons for national stagnation would go back to the retrograde
   inheritance of Spanish colonization and their perpetuation in the local
   ruling class. This critical edition of that document, which so far
   remained untranslated, is intended to contribute to the overcoming of
   stereotyped visions of Lallemant's and the Second International's
   Marxism.},

Abstract = {Models of electoral agency address the levels of discipline and
   selection that voters can achieve in elections. The models are demanding
   in terms of individual belief formation and consistency of behavior. We
   investigate a baseline model of electoral agency in a controlled
   laboratory environment. This baseline model, although simple, forms the
   central plank of more complex electoral agency models. Our design seeks
   to limit the behavioral impact of social preferences. We find little
   support for the baseline model in our data. However, simple
   (non-rational) learning rules explain behavioral patterns well.
   Simulations indicate that non-rational learning drives behavior most
   forcefully towards equilibrium in situations that are favorable to
   Bayesian updating.},

Abstract = {In studying the correlates of job satisfaction among political science
   faculty we confirm some findings from other disciplines, such as the
   relationship between institutional type and satisfaction. We demonstrate
   that those working in top-ranked departments or in private institutions
   tend to have higher levels of satisfaction with their jobs and with
   their contributions to the profession. Both job satisfaction and
   professional satisfaction tend to be highest among full professors; and
   greater productivity in terms of publishing is independently linked to
   greater levels of professional satisfaction. In contrast, comparatively
   higher undergraduate teaching loads undermine professional satisfaction.
   We also determine that men and women do not differ systematically from
   one another in their satisfaction levels. We do, however, document
   significantly lower levels of satisfaction among racial minorities in
   political science departments. In exploring this finding, we uncover
   reports of discrimination and dramatic differences in levels of
   collegiality experienced by different subgroups of faculty members.
   Experiences with discrimination undermine job satisfaction and are more
   frequently reported by women than men and are more common among minority
   faculty than nonminorities.},

Abstract = {The Initiative of Aid for Trade, launched in 2005 during the Sixth
   Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization, aims to
   articulate a coherent strategy to support trade as an engine of growth
   and poverty reduction in developing countries. It has expanded both the
   conceptual scope of this type of interventions (going beyond the limits
   of the classic technical assistance) and the coverage of beneficiary
   countries (taking into account not only the least developed countries,
   but also the middle income countries -among them, the Latin American
   ones-). The goal of this article is to identify and analyze the main
   characteristics of the aid for trade flows in the case of 17 Latin
   American countries, assessing to what extent these characteristics adapt
   to the needs and priorities of recipient countries.},

Title = {Explaining Left-Right Party Congruence Across European Party Systems: A
   Test of Micro-, Meso-, and Macro-Level Models},
Journal = {COMPARATIVE POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {46},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {Empirical studies on representation have been based mainly on the
   descriptive analysis of levels of political or ideological congruence
   between MPs and voters. Very few studies focus on explaining congruence,
   and those that have done so do not explore all the explanatory
   dimensions. This article contributes to filling this gap by testing
   whether three theoretical models can explain left-right congruence among
   European parties. These models explore causality at the micro or
   individual level (the characteristics of voters and MPs), the meso level
   (party characteristics), and the macro or system level (party system and
   institutional characteristics). Based on data from the PIREDEU project,
   the study examines the party systems of the 27 countries of the European
   Union with reference to the 2009 European Parliament elections. The
   findings reveal that MP-voter congruence is best explained at the party
   level and by key MP candidate characteristics.},

Abstract = {Institutions figure prominently in explanations for why radical parties
   forego their agendas and subject themselves to democratic principles
   when included in politics. Analyzing the Prosperous Justice Party's
   political trajectory across Indonesia's multi-level government
   structures between 1999 and 2009, I show that the Islamist party has
   gradually adopted more moderate behavior not only in national politics,
   where institutional incentives are conducive to moderation, but also in
   local politics, where institutional incentives for moderation are
   weaker. The absence of a strong pattern of invariant association between
   institutional incentives and the moderation of party behavior points to
   the importance of party internal mechanisms in moderation processes.
   Based on primary sources and in-depth interviews with party members, I
   argue that socio-structural factors shape a party's internal power
   dynamics and thereby its long-term capacity to adopt more moderate
   behavior.},

Abstract = {In the aftermath of the 2009 national elections in India a number of
   commentators observed that Indian party politics is a dynastic affair.
   Why is this the case? This paper claims that absence of a party
   organization, independent civil society associations that mobilize
   support for the party, and centralized financing of elections has led to
   the emergence and sustenance of dynastic parties in India. The paper
   assesses the impact of dynastic parties and shows that not only are
   party systems more volatile when parties are dynastic but more
   important, dynastic parties serve to make the political system less
   representative.},

Abstract = {Theoretical economics and empirical results indicate that people respond
   to incentives. However, the magnitude of those responses differs
   according to behavior and context. We investigated the effect of
   contracts for ambulatory-care services temporarily in effect at
   Landspitali - The National University Hospital of Iceland on physicians'
   practices. The relative risk of endoscopy referrals was calculated after
   per-referral compensations were eliminated, versus when they were in
   effect. The frequency of endoscopies during the years of 2000-2002 was
   compared to the frequency of endoscopies in the years 2003-2005. Data
   was collected from the University Hospital at Hringbraut
   (LSH-Hringbraut) along with the University Hospital in Fossvogur
   (LSH-Fossvogi). Data was also collected from The Icelandic Health
   Insurance (Sjukratryggingar Islands) on endoscopies preformed at
   physicians' private clinics. For comparison, analogous data was
   collected from Akureyri Hospital where no change in physician
   compensations occurred over the time period. The results showed a 185\%
   increased chance of referrals to an endoscopy at private physicians'
   offices after the contracts on ambulatory care services were eliminated.
   At the University Hospital however, these chances decreased by 38.2\%.
   The overall relative risk of being referred to an endoscopy in the
   capital region increased by 3.57\% after the contracts were eliminated.
   The assessed relationship between changes in payment schedules to
   physicians and the frequency rate of endoscopies is statistically, as

Abstract = {This article explores the determinants of U.S. Supreme Court justices'
   voting behavior in cases involving constitutional challenges to state
   statutes, with a particular focus on the degree to which majoritarian
   influences-as reflected in state participation and congressional
   preferences-affect the justices' votes. We find that the scope of the
   Court's decision-in terms of its impact on similar state laws and the
   expressed interest of states as amicus-strongly affects the justices'
   willingness to vote to invalidate a state statute. Moreover, at least in
   the Burger Court, the justices were constrained by congressional
   preferences over the ideological direction of the constitutional
   challenge. Justices on the Rehnquist Court, however, appear to have been
   more impervious to congressional preferences when evaluating the
   constitutionality of state legislation.},

   errors, random errors, calibration errors, and deviant case errors.
   These strategies are the comparative inspection of complex,

   factor, the use of probabilistic criteria, the test of the robustness of
   calibration parameters, and the use of a frequency threshold for
   observed combinations of conditions. The strategies are systematically
   reviewed, assessed, and evaluated as regards their applicability,
   advantages, limitations, and complementarities.},

Volume = {32},

Abstract = {This article uses fine-grained data to demonstrate that, since 1996, the
   State of Texas has undergone a process of `secular geographical
   polarization' - a continuous divergence in the geographical bases of its
   political parties. It is suggested that this process exemplifies a new
   era of partisan politics in the American South. Analyses of spatial
   regression models show that the geographical polarization can be
   partially explained by a tighter link between demographic
   characteristics and aggregate voting patterns, but that growth in
   spatial clustering cannot be attributed entirely to demographics. The
   possibility that spatially-bounded social contexts are affecting
   partisan change is thus explored. Finally, the article's findings are
   considered in light of the growing debate about geographical
   polarization in the American electorate. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Most modern economists can be classified as liberals who believe that
   the state should not enforce preferences since preferences are not
   rational. In contrast, the father of modern economics, Adam Smith, was a
   liberal perfectionist: He believed that some ends are better than
   others. This position follows from Smith's contention that economic
   institutions, such as the division of labor, create different characters
   and preferences among what would otherwise be a homogeneous population.
   If one wishes to evaluate these institutions, then, it cannot be on the
   basis of whether they satisfy the very preferences they create.
   Education was a case in point. There did not seem to be a market for
   educating the poor, but such an education would have been valuable
   because it would, Smith thought, counteract the torpor created among
   workers by the minute division of labor. Therefore, he argued,
   government provision of education may be called for. The rationale here
   is paternalistic, yet liberal in the sense that the type of character
   that was to be formed by education was not passive and thoughtless, but
   was, rather, autonomous.},

Abstract = {In this article, I discuss what I term ``Jewface{''} minstrelsy
   performance and ``Jewfacade{''} display in three contemporary contexts
   with highly divergent historical backgrounds: East-Central Europe, the
   Iberian Peninsula, and the Jewish Autonomous Republic, a
   fictitious-sounding but real colony established by Stalin in far eastern
   Russia near China and still extant today. Jewface encompasses music,
   dance, theater, and extra-theatrical modes of performance, in which
   non-Jews dress up and act like ``Jews,{''} as historically imagined;
   Jewfacade encompasses museum-type installations, as well as
   architectural and decorative constructions, depicting imagined
   ``Jewish{''} life. These ``Diaspora Disneys{''} vary from the
   education-and tolerance-oriented to the crassly exploitative and
   commercial to the bizarrely confused. None have much to do with actual
   Jews, but all convey a tremendous amount regarding dominant ``host{''}
   cultures' anxieties over not only their roles in past persecution and
   genocide but also their own present cultures, politics, and positions in
   the wider world today. Further, they present a wide array of models of
   memoriological projection and desire, in what I explicate as spectra of
   ``plethoric{''} to ``voidic{''} memoriological scenarios and ``
   negotiatory{''} to ``constitutory{''} memoriological strategies.},

Abstract = {Compulsory rules are known to have far-reaching effects beyond boosting
   electoral participation rates. This article examines the relationship
   between compulsory voting and partisan attachments. A theory of
   attachment formation and strength is engaged that argues that compulsory
   voting boosts the likelihood that one will identify with a party and, in
   turn, the strength of party attachments among identifiers. The
   statistical model accounts for both the hierarchical structure of the
   data (individuals in elections) and the dual nature of the dependent
   variable (individuals report a strength of attachment only for the party
   with which they identify). Using data from the Comparative Study of
   Electoral Systems, it is demonstrated that compulsory voting does indeed
   increase both the incidence and the strength of partisanship.},

Abstract = {Through a discussion of the 2008 mortgage crisis and its similarities to
   the Great Depression of the 1930's and the Great Recession of 2007-09, I
   argue that the very notions of economic ``crisis{''} and ``recovery{''}
   are politically and ideologically constructed, and that conditions of
   vulnerability, often simply taken for granted as part of the normal
   social landscape when they affect marginalized populations, become
   regarded as crises when they affect dominant groups. Each of these
   crises, I argue, reveals different facets of the ways in which the
   power, normativity, and privilege of those perceived to be affected by
   economic hard times serve (1) to construct some economic troubles as
   ``normal{''} and others as ``crises;' (2) to prevent economic problems
   related to structural inequalities from being treated as crises by
   dominant political actors and institutions; and (3) to shape ideas about
   the ostensible solutions and ends to economic crises. By calling
   attention to these features of economic ``crisis,{''} I aim to
   demonstrate the relevance of scholarship on race, class, gender, and
   intersectionality to the understanding of fundamental questions of
   contemporary political economy not often viewed from this perspective.},

Abstract = {This article argues that historical context can be a strong force for
   the origins of an ideologically and behaviourally moderate religious
   political party. It explores the origins of Italian Christian Democracy,
   following the trajectory of the Partito Popolare Italiano and Democrazia
   Cristiana in order to highlight a path to religious party moderation
   that excludes extremism and violence at all stages. That path includes
   the development of a moderate ideology prior to inclusion in the
   democratic system, influenced by efforts to reconcile Catholicism with
   democracy. Extremist alternatives are eliminated not through the
   moderating tendencies of a democratic political system but by historical
   events and by efforts of the moderate religious party to ensure that the
   democratic system does not collapse. Ideological and behavioural
   moderation are understood as acceptance of democracy and promotion of
   civil liberties, not as the notion that a party becomes in some way less
   religious.},

Journal = {IRISH POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2013},

Abstract = {Whereas there is an obvious ethnic explanation for the deep divisions
   between the nationalist and unionist communities in Northern Ireland,
   Ulster Protestants are often treated as a uniform group. It has been
   noted that there are more than two ethnic traditions in Northern
   Ireland; academics have distinguished between British Unionists and
   Ulster Loyalists. This is also linked to a divide in party support
   within the Protestant community. These two groups, it has been
   suggested, may have ethnic or religious bases derived from different
   migrations to Ulster in the last 400 years. The proposition is tested on
   surname data that have been shown elsewhere to allow us to see through
   the fog of history. Evidence is found to support the ethnic explanation
   for divisions between the nationalist and unionist communities, but the
   ethnic explanation for the divisions within unionism is rejected. This
   leaves a continuing puzzle for scholars as to what explains the two
   traditions in Northern Ireland's Protestant community.},

Abstract = {This article differentiates between three approaches to methodological
   diversity: monism, pluralism, and eclecticism. It suggests that in
   advancing a set-theoretic understanding of qualitative research, A Tale
   of Two Cultures makes an unusually strong argument for robust pluralism.
   The article anticipates three types of critiques that are likely to be
   made of the book: Monists will argue that pluralism is an illusion;
   quantitative researchers will suggest that Goertz and Mahoney
   inaccurately describe quantitative methods; and qualitative researchers
   will express doubts as to whether their tradition can be best understood
   using set theory. The article mainly focuses on the third of these
   responses, and suggests that even if A Tale of Two Cultures is not
   always convincing as a descriptive account of current practices, it
   holds considerable promise as a prescriptive agenda.},

Abstract = {East European History as a part of the larger field of history is a
   peculiarity of German-speaking Central Europe. It originated around the
   turn of the 20th century and was used by domestic politicians and
   diplomats as ``enemy studies{''}. As it became a science, it developed
   the concept of ``historical meso-regions{''} as an analytical framework
   for transnational comparative research. The end of the East-West
   conflict entailed the short term risk that the subdiscipline would lose
   its university pillar. Today, the discipline is stably anchored. It uses
   the new research opportunities that have arisen since 1989 and
   influences other disciplines and the public.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to present an association of the concepts
   of conflict, in the sense proposed by Machiavelli, in freedom as non-
   domination, according to the definition of contemporary neo-
   republicanism, and especially Philip Pettit, and in categorical
   inequality as defined by Charles Tilly. The intention is to formulate a
   theory that can be used as a guide for the State in situations of
   inequality that are intolerable for democracy - particularly those in
   which practiced by groups of people with special traits in detriment of
   others. This theoretical formulation will be denominated rep ublican
   democracy as it combines the formulations of democratic theory proposed
   by Tilly with the contributions of the leading contemporary
   theoreticians of republicanism.},

Abstract = {This study investigates circumstances that affect individuals decisions
   of whether or not to flee their homes during civilian conflicts.
   Building on the choice-centered approach to studying forced migration, I
   test the argument that people make a decision to flee or stay even under
   highly dangerous circumstances. Using primary data collected through a
   public opinion survey in Nepal, I test a number of hypotheses regarding
   the impact of factors such as violence, economic opportunity, physical
   infrastructure or geographical terrain, and social networks on forced
   migration, providing an individual-level test of the choice-centered
   approach to studying forced migration. The empirical results are
   consistent with the major hypotheses developed in aggregate-level
   studies and provide better insights into the factors that affect
   individual-level behavior. Beyond conflict, there are a number of
   significant economic, social, physical, and political factors that
   affect individuals choice to flee.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the German Federal Constitutional Court case-law
   about the European integration process. Both concepts of sovereignty and
   democracy, base of its reasoning, have been constructed as related to a
   national legal system. Therefore, the nature, functions and limits of
   the EU has been determined by the BVerfG in relation to state
   categories. This paper tries to show how since Lisbon's ruling (2009),
   the bases for a definition of sovereignty and democracy from the point
   of view of the common constitutional tradition of Member States may have
   been established. That's to say, what modern Schools for Scientific
   Thought call iuspublicum europaeum. The German Federal Constitutional
   Court makes this methodological transformation returning to the material
   concept of democracy established during the 50's and 60's. If it was
   then used in order to construct a militant democracy ad intra against
   the enemies of democracy, it may be now used to the militant defense ad
   extra of democracy. The respect for German political identity imposed by
   Lisbon's ruling supports this idea.},

Abstract = {Terms usurped and capitalised upon by Al-Qaeda and other similar
   terrorist and extremist organisations have a special place in Islamic
   culture and a particular resonance with Muslim populations. The
   aforementioned terrorist groups normally utilise these terms in order to
   further their objectives and gain, first, the support of larger
   audiences and, ultimately, legitimacy for their actions. At the same
   time, Western policy makers, security agencies and, crucially, the media
   have also used and regurgitated the same terminology in an uncritical
   fashion. This article explains the semantic nuances behind terms like
   ``Islamic{''}, ``Islamist{''}, ``fundamentalist{''}, ``Salafi{''},
   ``Wahhabi{''} and ``jihadi terrorism{''}, and the potential that such
   use has for the alienation of moderate segments of the Muslim creed and
   the obstacles it raises for intercultural counter-radicalisation
   efforts. The article then suggests the adoption of a more-nuanced term
   by Western circles-one that is equally embedded in Islamic culture and
   its value system and one that is not as negligent or power-related as
   the ones that are currently used.},

Abstract = {Since 2001, the Taleban insurgency in Afghanistan is gaining momentum in
   a context of civil war, characterized by the growing politicization of
   private conflicts. The author shows that the Taleban have managed to
   stay unaffected by the resulting social divides thanks to the
   objectivization of the armed movement through its judiciary
   institutions. Taleban courts, combining social exteriority,
   accessibility and coercion have allowed the insurgency to enlarge its
   social base across ethnic and tribal boundaries. The Taleban case
   suggests that in a situation of civil war, judging is decisive for an
   insurgency to establish itself as the political authority.},

Abstract = {A prevalent feature of political competition in postcolonial Africa has
   been the occurrence of coups and the threat of politically powerful
   militaries. Yet as scholars of civil-military relations on the African
   continent have attempted to make sense of military coups, perhaps their
   most obvious component-the military-has received little critical
   attention. Indeed, most analyses characterize the military as a
   dependent factor in explaining coups. This article examines Joseph
   Mobutu's rise to power in the Congo during the Congo Crisis by analyzing
   the history of the Congolese military, first from its inception as the
   Force Publique in 1888 then as the Armee National Congolais (ANC)
   between independence and Mobutu's seizure of power in 1965. By examining
   the Congolese military through Huntington's definition of military
   professionalism, this article argues that Mobutu ascended to power by
   exploiting his leadership position within a fragmented, ill-disciplined
   military. It shows that the structure, functions, and behavior of the
   military are key factors in understanding the development of conditions
   that allow for military seizures of power.},

   on the importance of activating a South/South dialogue in order to
   analyze both the genealogies and legacies of colonialism and the violent
   tensions that cross the contemporary colonies. Inside this perspective,
   a fundamental place is dedicated to feminist reflection, from the
   critique of a western << salvationist >> feminism to the idea of a <<
   third feminism >> or border feminism: new conceptual instruments and new
   theoretical practices through which we can re-write the relations
   between race, gender and class in the Global South as well as in the

Abstract = {The literature holds that coalition-building parties prefer the policy
   distance of coalition partners to be as small as possible. In light of
   continued importance of religion in electoral politics cross-nationally,
   the distance argument is worrisome for minorities seeking political
   access because many minorities are of different religion than the
   majority representatives forming coalitions. The authors suggest
   plurality parties' objectives to demonstrate inclusiveness outweigh the
   concern over policy distance. They test their hypotheses on a sample of
   all electorally active ethnic minorities in democracies from 1945 to
   2004. The authors find support for their hypothesis that ethnic parties
   representing minorities that diverge in religious family from the
   majority are more likely to be included in governing coalitions than are
   ethnic minorities at large. It is interesting, however, that they also
   find that minority parties representing ethnic groups that differ in
   denomination from the majority are less likely to be included in
   governing coalitions.},

Abstract = {This study depicts the biography of a young communist (Ion Calin) who
   volunteered for the International Brigades in Spain, and thus it
   features - within the historiography of the topic - the destinies of the
   antifascist Romanian combatants. Since the vast majority of these
   combatants was composed of members and supporters of PCdR, the regime of
   popular democracy honored and glorified them after March 6, 1945, in the
   same vein as those Communist inlanders who were repressed by the
   ``bourgeois regime{''}. The Romanian Communists who fought in the French
   Resistance received a similar treatment. After 1989, the names of the
   Romanian volunteers who had joined the cause of the Spanish Republicans
   went in the shadow due to their political affiliation to a party utterly
   compromised in the eye of the public. This study also deals with a
   broader context, including international politics, the reasons behind
   such an enthusiasm binding young people to go abroad to a front at over
   2.000 km, the social strata they derived from, PCdR's efforts to
   organize and send combatants across the borders, Ion Calin's clandestine
   journey to the Iberian peninsula (via Czechoslovakia, Austria,
   Switzerland and France), as well as details of the fights of which he
   was a part of during the war.},

Abstract = {Although civilian immunity is among the most widely agreed-upon norms of
   war, civilians are often attacked in contemporary conflicts. To some
   extent, the harm may be mitigated by programs to compensate the victims
   of wars. This article explores the three legal statutes and two forms of
   direct payment that the United States uses to compensate civilians
   harmed in wars and argues that although these are improvements in the
   treatment of civilians, they are inadequate. We argue that an individual
   cause of action in international law would provide a much better means
   of allowing civilians harmed by wars to seek compensation.},

Abstract = {Critics of Louis Althusser ask why an interpellated individual turns
   around. With this question, Mladen Dolar, among others, tries to
   establish the intermediary stage of ``belief before belief'' or
   ``subject before subject.'' However, Althusser's position is that such a
   circularity of ``X before X'' is not the cause but the retroactive
   effect of interpellation: the subject teleologically projects the
   imposed identity to its eternal past, thereby falling into the illusion
   of causa sui (the subject before itself). In this regard, Althusser's
   position is not so different from Jacques Lacan's. Applying a double
   standard to them, Dolar betrays Lacan's own logic of retroaction and
   regresses into the logic of inception. Judith Butler clearly recognizes
   the ontological impossibility of positing subject before subject, but
   she wants to reserve the tropological possibility of designating one and
   attempts to turn this possibility into the source of resistance. This
   article investigates why Althusser did not choose to go this way.},

Abstract = {This article analyses state counterterrorism (CT) policy on two
   dimensions: its effectiveness and its efficiency. It points out that CT
   is likely to be effective but inefficient. The material weakness of
   terrorist groups in relation to their state opponents, and different
   organisational dilemmas, increases the probability of an effective CT
   policy. However, states frequently overreact to terrorist attacks, which
   are valued in normative instead of strategic terms. Hence, they spend
   more resources on CT than justified by the threat posed by the terrorist
   groups. The article concludes that CT should be framed as an allocation
   of scarce resources that could be used in other important contexts.},

Abstract = {Britain has participated in several military interventions of varying
   duration, extent and political controversy in recent years. This article
   analyses public opinion towards the most recent intervention in Libya in
   2011, looking at three different aspects of the topic. First, it
   examines differences in cross-national attitudes towards military action
   in Libya amongst NATO countries. Secondly, it then looks in detail at
   which social groups were more or less likely to approve of British
   involvement, comparing this with group attitudes towards Britain's role
   in Afghanistan and Iraq. Thirdly, it assesses how public opinion shifted
   during the course of the action in Libya, looking at three key
   indicators of the popular mood: whether Britain was right or wrong to
   take military action; how well the war is going; and assessments of
   David Cameron's handling of the conflict. Broader reflections are then
   made about public opinion towards British involvement in future military
   action.},

   attempts to encourage the British far right to bury two of its ``sacred

   how Nouvelle Droite thought influenced the ideology and discourse of the

Abstract = {Assessment, as an institutional practice, has been designed for the
   sphere of higher education in response to the conflicts that prevail in
   the discourses that seek dominance in this field. Assessment is a
   discourse that clarifies the meanings, beliefs and values of both people
   and institutions with regard to conflicts and states of tension, as well
   as disputes and authority. Understanding assessment as being a discourse
   creates a need to follow an analytical path that places us in a realm
   beyond mere words and takes account of contexts, people, and meanings
   that are established through social practices. Thus, the Dicourse Theory
   provides theoretical and methodological categories that can assist us in
   conducting an analysis of the meanings surrounding the discourses of
   (and within) assessment. The reason for this is that in the Dicourse
   Theory, language is not regarded as the core of analysis but rather as
   one of the dimensions of social practices, and involves the inclusion of
   people and their relationships within a social domain that is
   constituted and being transformed.},

Abstract = {This article argues that the low levels of descriptive representation of
   women in local political office in Mexico and Latin America is much more
   than a problem of the purported patriarchal cultures of indigenous and
   rural communities. We claim, based on a comprehensive survey of 466
   municipal governments in the indigenous state of Oaxaca, that the
   underrepresentation of women is a function of institutions limiting
   female candidates. We test this ``candidate supply{''} hypothesis,
   adapted from US-based studies, against the hypothesis that culture - as
   measured by indigenous ethnicity - has an independent effect on women's
   representation. We disconfirm that patriarchal, traditionalist cultures
   of indigenous communities cause underrepresentation in the election of
   women and instead find that a particular set of local institutions,
   which are more prevalent in indigenous municipalities, blocks the supply
   of potential women candidates. We conclude by considering the normative
   implications for women's representation in local politics in Mexico and
   Latin America.},

Abstract = {Ethnolinguistic political mobilization has spread throughout the
   post-communist area. However, it is unclear whether it has been
   accompanied by a strengthening of group boundaries. This paper examines
   the nation-building process of unrecognized Silesians in Poland. It
   explores the mobilization strategies used by Silesian ethnopolitical
   entrepreneurs in their quest for regional autonomy and recognition of
   their language and group. I argue that the increase in the number of
   self-declared Silesians and the successful institutionalization of a
   Silesian national category have not led to mass national consciousness.
   Due to structural transformations and transnational processes, Silesians
   display multidimensional fluctuating identifications, which suggest the
   absence of a sense of national groupness.},

Abstract = {In February 2006, the Spanish Supreme Court modified its case-law
   regarding some provisions of the abrogated Criminal Code of 1973 that
   allowed the early release of prisoners if they worked while serving
   their sentence and they demonstrated good conduct. This change in the
   Spanish Supreme Court case-law had relevant consequences for some
   convicted prisoners as it meant an important extension of imprisonment
   years. Many of the prisoners affected by this new case-law appealed
   against the decisions extending their time in prison before the Spanish
   Constitutional Court and, after that, before the European Court of Human
   Rights. In this context, the main aim of this paper is to analyse the
   decisions adopted by these Courts while reviewing the Spanish Supreme
   Court case law, and to determine what the Spanish authorities must do
   after the European Court decision in ``Del Rio Prada{''} , the sole case
   in which the European Court has examined the Spanish Supreme Court
   case-law.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF GENOCIDE RESEARCH},

Pages = {117-131},
Abstract = {Violence and the French Revolution has generated a considerable body of
   work, much of which focuses on the processes leading toward the Terror,
   or aspects of the Terror and Counter-Revolution. In contrast, the
   violence committed by French troops abroad during the French
   Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars has largely been neglected, treated as
   something peripheral to the dynamics of conquest or as something
   peculiar to the nature of mass revolutionary armies. This article argues
   that far from being peripheral, massacre was on the contrary a method
   used by the French state in an effort to impose rule on conquered
   territories and to assimilate them into the empire. The territorial
   expansion of the French empire and the subjugation of neighbouring
   states should consequently be seen as part of a colonizing enterprise.
   To that extent, the methods used by the French Revolutionary and
   Napoleonic armies to subdue recalcitrant populations were no more
   violent than earlier periods. However, the purpose of the subjugation
   differed radically from previous eighteenth-century European wars.
   French troops, imbued with a sense of their own cultural and political
   superiority, were bringing enlightenment and civilization to the rest of
   Europe.},

Journal = {FORO INTERNO-ANUARIO DE TEORIA POLITICA},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {13},
Pages = {139-160},
Abstract = {This paper seeks to critically examine John Keane's monitory democracy
   proposal. The concept of democracy has recently become an indisputable
   trending topic, not only in the 2.0 space, but in the public sphere as a
   whole. In a period marked by an increased distance between citizens and
   the political class, resulting from citizen mobilisation and a climate
   of uncertainty, monitory democracy is put forward as a concept that can
   explain some of the transformations that are currently taking place.
   These changes are linked to the new and expanding dynamics of citizens'
   political monitoring, due in part to the possibilities opened up by the
   new media galaxy. Hence the importance of reflecting on the
   possibilities and limits of this new model of democracy, within the
   context of political theory's attempts to address questions about the
   current or future state of democracy.},

   Detention in a Democratic Setting},
Journal = {POLITIX},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {26},
Number = {104},
Pages = {181+},
Abstract = {This contribution combines a theoretical reflexion and an empirical
   survey to reconsider recent research on ``camps{''} as social forms, and
   on their problematic relationship with the political order. The article
   opens with a theoretical critic of a vision of camps as politically
   ``abandoned{''} devices: in this perspective, camps are seen as mostly
   managed by street-level, empirically-defined-and-enforced ``policemen's
   policies{''} policies which, as such, generally avoid political
   supervision or judicial review. In that sense, camps are a blind point
   inside democratic polities. The second part of the article however
   challenges this vision, basing itself on empirical research performed by
   the author on immigration detention centres in France. In this case, the
   original informality, opacity and precariousness of administrative
   detention was publicly denounced, with two essential consequences:
   first, immigration detention was institutionalized. Second, it was
   strongly connected to its political and legal environment through the
   organization of an independent control (performed by non-state Human
   Rights organizations) inside the centres, a measure that gave detention
   a public visibility.},

Abstract = {This work analizes the principle of private autonomy in the affective
   relations context. It approaches the legal fundaments of the
   contemporary family, which is essencialy based in cooperation and takes
   on new characteristics. In this context, the human dignities' promotion
   will be acomplished in the core of the family by the full
   acknowledgement of the individual choices, be it in the constitution way
   of the familiar unity by the recognition of the homosexual union rights.
   The private autonomy is associated with the concepts of freedom,
   autonomy and volition to aloud the legal protection to the homosexual
   family. Through this point of view, we'll analise the marriage as
   proposed in the Civil Code, verifying if the legal discipline matches
   with the constitutional principology. The marriage will be analized in
   the contemporary society's historical and social context to demonstrate
   that its means of procreation, heritage protection and of
   indissolubility caracteristichs change and is becoming an environmet to
   safeguard plurarity, human dignity promotion, equality preservation and
   the non-discrimination. We will sustain the possibility of homosexual
   marriage achievement by the implementation of the principles above
   mentioned. We sustain the the most appropriate mean of promoting
   homosexual and heterosexual couples equality is, precisely, aloud them
   to safeguard the same rights. We advocate that the mariage concession
   must be done by the contitucional comand force of equality,
   independently of considerations on the gender.},

Abstract = {In this final chapter we zoom out from the material introduced in
   Chapters 1 to 3. The argument that basic democracy is not a human
   invention is first offered. We then move to answer a number of questions
   raised throughout the book: `where did democracy come from?', `how did
   its complexity arise?' and `what, in the end, is democratic?' These are
   our main questions. It is a look to the future. It is a critical
   consideration of what the theory of evolutionary basic democracy and its
   model can bring to politics and society.},

Pages = {193-211},
Abstract = {In the Western Sahara conflict have been numerous the public and private
   actors involved, Spanish and Sahrawi. There are different actors, in
   some cases, they have become a citizen movement with specific
   characteristics and also have been maintained over time. For over three
   decades they have carried out various actions which have resulted in
   projects of development cooperation, awareness projects, twinning
   between municipalities, holiday program for children, etc. Likewise
   there have been initiatives to support the protest demands for
   self-determination raised by the Sahrawi people.
   This article aims to analyze the evolution of the role of these actors
   and points out some perspectives for the future in a context of major
   political and economic uncertainties. In this regard, it should be noted
   that two events can influence this issue, the economic crisis affecting
   Europe, and particularly Spain, and the so-called ``Arab Spring{''}.},

Volume = {25},

Pages = {85-127},
Month = {JAN-JUN},
Abstract = {The article aims to reach the following objectives: a) analize within
   the context of the development strategies implemented by Venezuela and
   Colombia the evolution, achievements and troubles that has had the
   economic integration between both countries; b) balance the state of the
   bi-national economic integration, with emphasis on the period started at
   Santa Marta-Colombia, on August 2010, when presidents Hugo Chavez Frias
   and Juan Manuel Santos had a meeting; and c) introduce to discuss some
   of the stages, perspectives and challenges that will face the economic
   integration between Colombia and Venezuela.
   The article concludes there was a comeback in the degree of bi-national
   economic integration since in 2012 come in force a partial preferential
   trade agreement while before both countries were members of the Andean
   Community, an imperfect customs union. The article remarks that
   divergences of the development strategies, ideology, geopolitical vision
   between Colombia and Venezuela are an obstacle to reach a deeper
   economic integration.},

Number = {2},
Pages = {129-149},
Abstract = {Drawing on what Norval describes as Laclau's `grammar of political
   analysis', this article explores the neoliberalization of citizenship in
   New Zealand. The analysis focuses on how, during the 1990s, pre-existing
   moral standards of social justice, popular cultural ideals of fairness
   and equality of opportunity policy discourse were re-articulated to the
   neoliberal discourse of the citizen as taxpayer. Furthermore, this
   article illustrates the paradoxical role of contestation in distilling
   this consensus by exploring how the strategies of New Zealand's major
   Centre Left and Centre Right Parties to define themselves as distinct
   from each other in moral terms consolidated a new `inclusive middle'
   with Left and Right dialects.},

Journal = {CANADIAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},

Pages = {59-64},
Abstract = {Based on the varying views of power under neoliberalism, the literature
   draws divergent conclusions regarding its quality as a policy approach.
   Neoliberal economic restructuring is generally regarded as positive by
   the conservative public choice school, as positive by some Weberians and
   negative by others, and as overwhelmingly negative by Marxians and
   feminists. Critics usually present restructuring as something that is
   happening ``to{''}us, that is presented to us as a fait accompli, handed
   down by bureaucrats and elected officials influenced by international
   business. This view obscures the role of the average citizen in pushing
   restructuring forward, not only in allowing it to happen, but also in
   actively performing it. In response, this paper suggests a focus on
   individual actors at the local level that locates the expansion of
   neoliberalism in intersecting global and institutional, as well as in
   individual sites, without obscuring the various oppressions generated by
   restructuring.},

Abstract = {This essay answers the question, ``How well did President Obama choose
   from among the available means of persuasion in the early years of his
   presidency?{''} by probing the ways in which his pre-inaugural speech at
   the Lincoln Memorial blurred the rhetorical roles of nominee and
   president-elect; the absence of a digestive statement in his inaugural;
   the failure of his nationally telecast BP oil spill address to respond
   to the expectations created by his campaign rhetoric and by the speech
   itself; the ways in which the setting of his speech after the Tucson
   tragedy sabotaged an otherwise powerful speech; and the insurmountable
   challenges posed by the decision to address the nation as the DOW
   tumbled in the wake of the S and P downgrade. Polity (2013) 45, 153-168.

Pages = {157-175},
Abstract = {This paper explores the social psychological aspects of British national
   identification among British South Asians, which constitutes the largest
   ethnic minority group in Britain. Identity process theory can elucidate
   the social and psychological `functions' of Britishness for social
   actors, offering a holistic account of national identification within
   this population. The paper provides a discussion of nationhood and the
   construction of national identity, temporal factors in national
   identification, its cognitive and affective aspects, the psychological
   `functionality' of Britishness, and its social representations. It is
   argued that a civic, instrumental conception of Britishness might
   facilitate access to this identity among British South Asians.},

   the only way to resolve Sudan's long-standing national crisis, this
   article points out, at the same time, that it left unresolved the issue
   of self-determination for the peoples of the northern Sudan who joined
   the Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army and brought new problems,
   particularly to the newly created international border area between
   Sudan and South Sudan.},

Abstract = {This paper focuses on the convergence of the positions of Wittgenstein
   and Althusser. The discussion on the political implications of
   Wittgenstein's thought has revolved around the possibility (or
   impossibility) of taking his ideas as standpoints for a critical view of
   the social dimension, its legitimacy, reach, and strength. However,
   translating Wittgenstein's thoughts into an Althusserian materialistic
   position leads to an understanding of the critiques within the former's
   work that does not hinge on their warranty as a point of view but on the
   effects of deconstructing the philosophical discourse, which seeks to
   unify and to arrange hierarchically the evidences (certainties)
   constitutive of the different language games in which the social is
   displayed. The paper concludes with some remarks on the
   distinction-borrowed from Wittgenstein and Althusser-between philosophy
   as an ideological-theoretical practice and as a critical-theoretical
   practice},

Abstract = {We examine the potential of highly structured intergovernmental
   organizations (HSIGOs) to prevent the escalation of low-level, domestic
   armed conflicts in member states to civil wars. A state's membership in
   HSIGOs alters the bargaining game between the government and rebels by
   increasing the costs of escalation (e. g., via sanctions) and decreasing
   the amount of benefits the state hoped to receive from future
   international cooperation. The anticipation of such consequences
   provides the government with an increased interest in settling the
   conflict before it escalates. This in turn also mitigates an important
   aspect of uncertainty associated with bargaining failure, including
   enhancing the credibility of commitments. Empirical analyses and
   follow-up tests of all domestic armed conflicts from 1945 to 2000
   provide robust support for the hypothesized conflict-management function
   of HSIGO memberships.},

Title = {POLITICAL ASPECTS OF FINANCING OF MUNICIPALITIES IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC},
Journal = {POLITICKE VEDY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {16},
Number = {2},
Pages = {31-57},
Abstract = {In 2000 and 2003, respectively, the Czech Republic finished the first
   and the second stage of public administration reform, which is closely
   linked with the issue of public financing, especially the financing of
   municipalities. The position of municipalities in the decentralization
   cannot be assessed without dealing with the issue of funding. The main
   goals of this article are to introduce the basic principles of financing
   of municipalities in the Czech Republic, and the stages of their
   development. It also analyses the political context of the financing and
   the main pillars of the financing of municipalities and its problematic
   aspects (tax revenue, the grant and transfer system, respectively
   financial contribution to the delegated powers, local taxes,
   respectively local fees) so that it clarifies the attitudes of political
   actors, key players and stakeholders, way of negotiations and final
   political cleavage and their characteristics. Solution strategy of this
   work is based on the use of a unique case study that aims to provide a
   deep understanding and causal explanation of the case combined with the
   qualitative method of case study, specifically the so-called
   ``dimensional sampling{''} used in own research conducted among the
   mayors of municipalities in the Czech Republic.},

Journal = {POLITOLOGICKY CASOPIS-CZECH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Number = {2},
Pages = {117-138},
Abstract = {In the last two decades, turnout research has disintegrated into a
   plethora of studies which focus on partial aspects of turnout. The
   overall idea of why people vote has been lost. Despite extensive
   research on turnout, we know relatively little about why people vote.
   The aim of this text is to present and critically discuss basic theories
   that explain voter turnout at the individual level. Overall, six
   theories are presented: the theory of socio-economic status and
   resources, the theory of civic orientations, the theory of mobilization
   and involvement in society, the theory of rational choice, the theory of
   valence politics, and the theory of habitual voting. These theories are
   discussed mainly from three aspects: (1) the causal mechanisms
   explaining why people vote; (2) the extent to which each theory links
   the decision to participate in an election with the decision about which
   party or candidate to vote for, as well as the sequence of these
   decisions; and (3) the timing of voters' decisions to participate in an
   election. The author argues that because of the heterogeneity of voters
   and the nature of the decision whether or not to vote, it is necessary
   to understand individual theories not as competitive, but rather as
   complementary.},

Abstract = {To what extent does the government selection process practised in public
   consultations promote or hinder pluralism in the policy-making process?
   This article addresses this question by exploring and analysing the
   characteristics of voluntary organizations invited to public
   consultations. Evidence is drawn from the formerly corporatist
   Scandinavian country of Sweden and the policy-making process referred to
   as the `remiss procedure'. The article shows that the government
   selection process encourages a multitude of organizations to
   participate. Consistent with recent studies on Scandinavian corporatism,
   this study provides weak support of corporatist practices in the Swedish
   policy process. However, and without challenging the seemingly
   pluralistic nature of the remiss procedure, voluntary organizations with
   `insider status' in the policy process are more frequently invited to
   formal decision-making arenas such as the remiss procedure. It is argued
   that the policy network literature and the theory of political
   opportunity structures may further the understanding of the government
   selection process practised in public consultations.},

Abstract = {Even though right-wing populist parties have grown to become
   considerably relevant electoral forces in Western Europe, hardly
   anything is known about their political advertising strategies. This
   study is the first to address the political content prominent in
   right-wing populist poster advertising of the Austrian FPO from a
   longitudinal perspective. Results reveal that the construction of
   inclusionary elements is a relevant advertising strategy for the Freedom
   Party, whilst issues of migration and crime are of minor relevance but
   growing in importance since the turn of the century.},

Abstract = {Since the 1950s, theories of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) have
   developed alongside the increasing power of globalised business.
   International stakeholders, from the United Nations to everyday
   consumers, have identified business ethics as a way to mitigate the
   destructive commercial practices that exacerbate conflict in the
   developing world. Ethical business initiatives have peacebuilding
   potential; however, the discussion should cede that poor governance
   constrains this private sector ability. Information communication
   technology (ICT) companies have perpetuated conflict in the Democratic
   Republic of the Congo (DRC) and its surrounding areas by purchasing
   minerals that finance armed groups. Ultimately, predominant lobbies who
   claim that CSR policies and ethical boycotts will cut rebel funding and
   therefore bring an end to the turmoil in the Great Lakes region of
   Africa are overlooking the conflict's complex roots. The success of CSR
   peacebuilding in the DRC is predicated on good governance and
   cross-sector collaboration.},

Abstract = {In this article, we focus on manifest interparty conflict over policy
   issues and the role of coalition agreements in solving these conflicts.
   We present empirical findings on the characteristics of coalition
   agreements including deals over policy controversy and on inter-party
   conflict occurring during the lifetime of governments in Germany,
   Belgium, Italy and the Netherlands. We analyze the ways in which parties
   in government were or were not constrained by written deals over
   disputed issues. Coalition agreements from all four countries include
   specific policy deals, one third of which are precisely defined. These
   policy deals concern both consensual and controversial issues. Our
   central finding is that, in the case of intra-party conflict, parties
   almost always fall back on the initial policy deals when these exist. As
   such, policy statements of the coalition agreement facilitate decision
   making in each of the countries studied.},

Journal = {DEMOCRACY \& SECURITY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Pages = {360-382},
Abstract = {This article examines the quality and rigor of the academic literature
   on radicalization. Drawing on a sample of 260 publications that make
   claims for empirical research and were published between 1980 and 2010,
   it shows that qualitative approaches dominate, and that a significant
   number of publications relies on secondary sources-not primary
   research-to support their conclusions. Methodologies tend to be stronger
   and more rigorous in the social sciences than the humanities. Overall,
   it finds that research on radicalization contains clusters of excellence
   that meet the highest scholarly standards, but that it also suffers from
   some of the same problems that afflict the wider field of terrorism
   studies: 34 percent of the items in our sample were either
   methodologically or empirically poor, whereas 11 percent were both. The
   article argues that this situation may have resulted from an
   overreliance on (poorly controlled) government money, the nature of the
   subject itself; and the absence of a unified academic ``field{''}
   through which tougher academic standards could be enforced.},

Abstract = {This essay explores the power relations inherent to the contemporary
   practice of celebration of author production and present relations of
   governing. I explore such practices of celebration as a lens for
   understanding the role of valorization of the author in knowledge
   production, arguing that celebration can act as an ascetic technology
   that governs potentially transformative critical subjectivities. I begin
   with an exploration of the relationship between celebration and
   governing. Next, I consider the production of the author within this
   regime of governing as a production of celebration, focusing on the ways
   in which contemporary knowledge production prizes visibility as a source
   of valorization. Finally, I conclude that the valorization of visibility
   achieved through celebration discourages critical thought about the
   underlying assumption that productivity and quantification manifest in
   visibility are the exclusive foundations of judgment about contemporary
   knowledge production and its contribution to human well-being.},

Abstract = {This study approaches the Spanish parliamentary arena as potential
   intentional actor in the foreign action policymaking towards Western
   Sahara. It exposes the main interventions developed, and the issues
   debated, since the last decade. The case-studies are the Congress of
   Deputies and the Andalusia Parliament. The findings show the parliament
   space is not a determinant actor in this policy. The national arena
   moves in a difficult balance between the good relations with Morocco, as
   privilege partner in the Spanish and European Union Mediterranean
   policy, and the recognition of the situation of the Sahrawi people. On
   the other hand, the Andalusia Parliament has discovered itself as a
   mirror which reflects the regional governmental activity and the
   Congress position and rhythms.},

Abstract = {Is it right to wage war to export democracy, or - as Kant would have
   said - to forcibly interfere in the constitution and in the government
   of another state with the goal of transforming it into a republic? The
   answer of Kant, contained in the fifth preliminary article of the
   Perpetual Peace, leans towards non-interventionism: a bad constitution
   can never justify a war, because it may be the root only of a scandalum
   acceptum. To understand the meaning of scandalum acceptum we have to
   become aware that it is a term originating from moral theology, which we
   should translate into the language of international law. The scandal, as
   it was still clear to Kant's contemporaries, is the sin of advertising a
   sinful behavior: but it is just a scandalum acceptum if the act that
   inspired others to sin has been done without the intention to give them
   a bad example. A flawed constitution can be only the occasion of a
   scandalum acceptum because its legal power does not spread its influence
   beyond the border of its state. If a nation chooses to imitate the
   allegedly wrong constitution of another state, its choice depends only
   on its sovereignty, because it is a matter of internal constitutional
   law. On the other hand, waging war against another country because of
   its allegedly flawed constitution is a worse kind of scandal, the
   scandalum datum, because it involves an international law principle of
   limited sovereignty according to which every state has the right to
   assault another state because of its constitution.},

Abstract = {Taking an approach that avoids comprehending power and trust as entities
   to be studied apart, the article insists on elucidating trust and power
   as they are enacted in their intimate and delicate relationship to each
   other and to other human and social phenomena of similar importance,
   such as knowledge and experience, gift-giving, hope, freedom and agency.
   To permit us to understand power and trust as interdependent dimensions,
   the article confronts the notions of power as command, coercion, control
   and calculation and develops a conception of power as a capacity. This
   permits us to consider trusting as an exercise of power and an
   anticipatory affect. Trust is a resolve to bear an experienced risk by
   confiding in the new and unknown.},

Abstract = {The privatization of the apartments for the benefit of their legal
   occupants has made the once Soviet residential buildings into
   multi-owners properties (or condominiums). This article explores the
   appropriation of a new legal and economic model of building management
   by ordinary people living in Moscow. In line of literature that places
   the emphasis on the historical and social forces driving the economic
   exchanges, we note that some individuals are more likely to seize the
   new model. To show this, we start off from an in-depth, comparative case
   study of two women hailing from different social milieu that got
   involved in their building's affairs. In turn, these extreme cases
   function as a magnifying prism of ordinary situations, and help us shed
   light on intermediate cases as well. They underline how social and
   residential trajectories shape the ordinary interpretation and uses of
   law. We take them as an original way to study social construction of
   condominiums in post-communist Russia.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE EDUCATION},

Pages = {345-361},
Abstract = {One of the cornerstones of teaching is the evaluation of student
   performance. Traditionally, such evaluations are performed through the
   administration of exams, quizzes, research papers, and group projects.
   Although faculty are accustomed to evaluating students, rarely do they
   evaluate the quality of the aforementioned methods used to assess
   student knowledge. The present study will illustrate how certain
   measurement theory techniques (i.e., item difficulty, index of
   discrimination, Cronbach's alpha, and point biserial correlation) can be
   utilized to investigate the reliability and validity of student
   performance and what their impact is on grade distribution.
   Additionally, a new method for performing item analysis is proposed. To
   demonstrate the applicability of measurement theory in estimating the
   reliability and validity of student performance, we draw from one of the
   author's experiences in teaching an introductory course in political
   behavior.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to address the questions of possibilities of radical
   change in the contemporary global south under neoliberalism. We are
   particularly concerned with examining the conditions under which radical
   movements can help realize what contemporary European Neostructuralists
   call the ``Communist Idea{''} in practice. One of the key sites where
   such a struggle is ongoing today is under the contemporary Maoist
   movement in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh in its battle
   against neoliberal primitive accumulation. We argue that central India
   has been a primary site of systematic, state-supported imperialist
   resource exploitation and human displacement for over a century, which
   has created objective conditions favorable for radical popular
   organization. Yet we contend that the Maoist movement has somewhat
   mechanically applied Maoist ideology to conditions to which it may be
   ill-suited, something that has helped it attract and empower millions of
   the dispossessed, while also leading them into a long-term political
   cul-de-sac.},

Title = {Moral panics as civilising and decivilising processes? A comparative
   discussion},
Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {50},
Number = {2},
Pages = {483-500},
Abstract = {This paper draws from a variety of case study examples of `moral panic
   analyses', in combination with figurational analyses of the same topics,
   to comparatively explore the variant forms `moral panics' take and how
   they develop, thereby analysing the multiple forms civilising processes
   can take. Using `moral panic' as an illustrative example, this paper
   will discuss how and to what extent civilising processes can give rise
   to decivilising trends (in the form of moral panics) yet, at the same
   time, these moral panics can also bring about integrative `civilising'
   effects in the form of civilising offensives that reflect possible
   long-term civilising trends (in the form of accelerated campaigns; a
   civilising `spurt'). Throughout this comparative discussion, I aim to
   highlight not only the complexity of civilising processes, but also the
   complex civilising and decivilising aspects of moral panics, thereby
   overcoming the dichotomous normative conceptualization of moral panics
   as being either `good' or `bad' panics. The paper then moves onto a
   discussion of the paradoxical idea of viewing moral panics as civilising
   and decivilising processes. Drawing from Foucault, Elias, and moral
   panic, the paper concludes with a discussion of a rethinking of
   civilising and decivilising processes, intended and unintended
   developments, short-term and long-term processes, and the role of
   knowledge in civilising processes.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF GENOCIDE RESEARCH},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {15},

Abstract = {The Australian frontier wars have only recently emerged as an accepted
   part of the history of Australia. But there is still a reluctance to
   accept that settler massacre was widespread across the frontier and that
   it made deep inroads into the Aboriginal population. This article
   reviews the debate about settler massacre in relation to Aboriginal
   resistance and finds that the punitive expedition is most likely a
   euphemism for massacre. It then establishes a new framework, which
   combines both aspects of frontier violence to explore a variety of
   published sources about Australia's first frontier at the Hawkesbury
   River in New South Wales 1794-1810. The article finds that as an
   agricultural frontier where the settlers' produce was vital to the
   colony's survival, the British deployed large numbers of troops to
   disperse the Bediagal Aborigines from the region, when they resisted the
   invasion of the agricultural settlers. It cites numerous examples of the
   punitive expedition and how it operated to force a rapid Aboriginal
   population decline and concludes that the dynamic of resistance and
   massacre was a defining feature of the Australian frontier.},

Journal = {REGIONAL AND FEDERAL STUDIES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {23},

Pages = {631-642},
Abstract = {County elections 2012 in the Czech Republic displayed a mixture of
   continuity and novelties. Since 2000 four county elections have been
   mid-term elections and their results have supported second-order
   elections theory. The Civic Democratic Party of Vaclav Klaus, who was
   one of the biggest opponents of the introduction of decentralization,
   won the first county elections in 2000. After a dozen years, in 2012,

Abstract = {This study analyzes the impact of politics on governmental efforts to
   promote social policies, more specifically Education and Culture, and
   Health and Sanitation policies. The paper aims to explain the variation
   in Brazilian states' standards of social policy provision during the
   five governmental administrations following re-democratization. Our
   explanation focuses on political and institutional factors during the
   1987-2006 period. Our aim is to assess the impact of political
   competition, the party system, the legacy of public policy, and economic
   and institutional constraints on social policy provision since the end
   of the military dictatorship. Our empirical analysis is conducted
   through estimates of Prais-Winsten regression models with panel
   corrected standard error model (PCSE-AR1). The results of this analysis
   show that the majority of parties in government do not differ in their
   social expenditures and that political competition loses its predictive
   capacity when faced with institutional constraints arising from the
   central government.},

Abstract = {The article presents the data of a qualitative politico-psychological

   within a year after the 2012 presidential elections. One can see that
   along with a general growth of citizens' critical attitudes toward the
   authorities, the perception of V.Putin improved in many aspects. For all
   that, some negative traits are pronounced regarding his image, too (both
   the very same that had been marked before the elections, and quite new
   ones), but the gap between V.Putin and the other former candidates
   continues to widen.},

Abstract = {In line with public sphere theory, media in federal political systems
   can be expected to provide a forum for federal debate on federal issues.
   However, as media in Belgium are organized at the level of the language
   communities this is not necessarily the case. This contribution analyses
   how political TV debates of the two public broadcasters in Belgium
   represented the issue of the split of the electoral district
   `Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde' (BHV), on which politicians of both language
   communities were divided. Results show that Dutchspeaking and
   French-speaking media in Belgium do not serve as a platform for federal
   debate where the contrasting viewpoints can be expressed, but rather
   echo and amplify the political consensus of their own language
   community.},

Abstract = {On the basis of the analysis of the evolution of the EU right and
   center-right parties' programs tenets under the conditions of the
   European integration project crisis A. Smirnov comes to the conclusion
   about the ideological and political degeneration of the forces that
   position themselves as conservatives. According to his assessment,
   desperate euroscepticism as well as equally desperate euro-optimism
   evenly characterize the diseased state of the European conservatism that
   is identified with so many different moods and vectors of political
   activity. Although the ideology of conservatism retains its relevance in
   modern Europe and a significant number of European citizens are
   interested in the expeditious development of the social world order
   model with the historically rooted system of values and development
   guiding principles, this ``social request{''} that is in fact formed in
   the framework of the conservative discourse remains unrealized since
   there are no forces that are ready to take on its implementation.},

Abstract = {Rancorous dialogue among political opponents is nothing new in the
   American political system. However, in the past two decades or so,
   pundits and scholars have noted an increase in the overall intensity and
   frequency of incivility among elected officials and citizens. At the
   collegiate level, many universities have undertaken some form of
   civility initiative to help students learn how to address political
   conversation in a civil manner. However, these initiatives are
   problematic in that they may tend to attract those already predisposed
   to such civility goals and lack in external validity. In this article,
   we investigate how university communities may be able to use online
   discussions, particularly spontaneous ones, to address controversial
   political issues. Using the asynchronous online postings at one liberal
   arts university, Furman University, in response to a campus visit by
   George W. Bush, we investigate the nature of political discourse in
   these unstructured political conversations. Through content analysis, we
   assess the level of democratic incivility versus impoliteness in the
   discussion, the role of anonymity in facilitating incivility, and the
   potential of such online exchanges for use by colleges to help socialize
   young people into how to engage in effective and civil political
   discourse.},

   socio-political views in the works by I.Aksakov on the basis of the
   broad range of sources including the archive materials that have been
   never published before. After analyzing political implications of
   Aksakov's abandoning binary opposition of ``state{''} and ``the
   people{''}, ``the people{''} and ``the public{''}, A. Teslya shows that
   Aksakov created a rather consistent conception of ``non-political
   liberalism{''} and that he was able to permanently point out its
   ``non-political character{''} only due to the extremely narrowed
   interpretation of the notion ``political{''}, thereby providing space
   for political society to be established as a space of formed public

Volume = {16},

Pages = {83-96},
Abstract = {The genesis of the development of the strategic culture in the United
   States is different than the one in European countries. The territorial
   threats coming from neighbours during the process of formation of the
   United States cannot be compared with the quest for power taking place
   in other continents, they were much smaller. The strategic culture
   developed primarily from the strategic positioning of the country; the
   future state bordered two oceans that did not represented a threat, on
   the contrary they were perceived as a tool for communication and future
   trade relations. The paper focuses on the analysis of the strategic
   culture of the United States and its formation from the late 18th
   century to the present. The second part of the paper is devoted to the
   current definition of security policy and strategic culture, as
   presented in the National Security Strategy of the United States. Thus,
   the United States also represent an example of a major shift from the
   strategic culture of the Cold War strategy that was built only on the
   military and political instruments to the strategies especially in other
   non-military aspects of security.},

Abstract = {This paper takes a close look at Berlin's claim that the emergence of
   Counter-Enlightenment pluralism marks a momentous historical watershed.
   It concludes that Berlin is right to draw our attention to the
   importance of this event, but that he seriously misinterprets its
   significance. He has good reason, in particular, to treat Herder as `the
   most formidable adversary of the French philosophes and their German
   disciples', but not because Herder put a stop to the ancient creed of
   monism on which they relied. For Berlin's monistic interpretation of the
   French Enlightenment, I shall show, badly misrepresents that
   intellectual movement and its impact on the world. The great
   significance of Herder's pluralist critique of the Enlightenment lies,
   instead, in the way in which it rehabilitates prejudice as a source of
   human virtue and creativity, a critique that directly attacks the core
   mission of the philosophes: to remove the obstacles to the gathering,
   preservation and dissemination of useful knowledge.},

Abstract = {Trust is not usually considered a Hobbesian concept, which is odd since
   it is central to the definition of a covenant. The key to understanding
   Hobbes's concept of trust is to be found in his account of conquest
   sovereignty by acquisitionwhich is a heavily revised adaptation of the
   Roman justification of slavery. Hobbes introduces a distinction between
   servants, who are trusted with liberty, and imprisoned slaves. The
   servant/master relationship involves mutual trust, an ongoing exchange
   of benefits (protection for service and obedience), and performance
   monitoring. In contrast to Quentin Skinner's and Philip Pettit's shared
   concentration on the contrast between slavery and freedom, I argue that
   the salient analogy is between servants and subjects.The trust
   relationship between subjects and the sovereign involves defined roles,
   limited absolutism, and accountability in the early-modern form of
   licensing subjects to switch political allegiance should a regime fail.},

   2012, this article investigates the social rationales at work in the
   constitution of French cabinets: social specificities mentioned by the
   media (parity, `diversity', generational change), but also less often
   mentioned social specificities (social and political trajectories).
   French ministers hold the most legitimate educational, social and
   political resources. The importance of political and electoral resources
   underlines the autonomization and the relative closure of the political
   field. A qualitative analysis on some ministers clarifies the
   limitations of change in the ruling political class: ministers often
   heralded as symbols of a newly opened political recruitment are in fact
   experienced professionals of politics.},

Abstract = {Autocrats face a fundamental tension: how to make elections appear
   credible (maintaining legitimacy) without losing control over outcomes
   (losing power). In this context, we claim that incumbents choose the
   timing and targets of state repression strategically. We expect that
   before elections, regimes will moderate their use of violence against
   ordinary citizens, while simultaneously directing state-sponsored
   repression towards opposition elites. Ordinary citizens are likely to
   experience greater repression after the election. We test these
   expectations using unique events-based repression data, conducting
   cross-national analysis of all presidential elections in authoritarian
   regimes from 1990 to 2008 to understand the timing and targeting of
   repression around elections under authoritarian regimes. In keeping with
   our expectations, we find that in the months prior and during the
   election, opposition leaders experience greater rates of repression than
   voters. We suspect that incumbents find it more effective to repress
   electoral challengers, since these pose a direct threat to their
   victory. Conversely, incumbents resist repressing voters whose support
   they need at the polls to win and to legitimize the election itself. (C)

Abstract = {Hayek argued that the central question of economics is the coordination
   problem: How does the spontaneous interaction of many purposeful
   individuals, each having dispersed bits of subjective knowledge,
   generate an order in which the actors' subjective data are coordinated
   in a way that enables them to dovetail their plans and activities
   successfully? In attempting to solve this problem, Hayek outlined an
   approach to economic theorizing that takes seriously the limited,
   subjective nature of human knowledge. Despite purporting to have
   appropriated Hayek's thought by acknowledging the
   information-transmitting role of prices, mainstream economists have
   missed Hayek's point. The predominant tool of formal
   economicsequilibrium analysisbegins by assuming the data held by actors
   to have been pre-reconciled, and so evades the problem to be solved.
   Even the more advanced tools for modeling knowledge in economic
   analysis, such as the economics of information, assume away either the
   subjectivism of knowledge and expectations (rendering the coordination
   of beliefs and plans a trivial matter) or the frictions and
   imperfections of reality (rendering the coordination problem
   indeterminate).},

Title = {Reconsidering individual-level heterogeneity in economic voting},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {32},
Number = {4},
Pages = {718-728},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This paper proposes a general theory of individual-level heterogeneity
   in economic voting based on the perspective that the strength of the
   relationship varies with factors that influence the relevance of the
   economic evaluation to the vote choice. We posit that the electoral
   relevance of the economic evaluation increases with the strength of
   partisanship as well as political sophistication. Given the strong
   correlation between partisanship and sophistication, this theoretical
   perspective casts doubt on extant evidence that more sophisticated
   voters are more likely to hold the incumbent party electorally
   accountable for macroeconomic performance since this result might be an
   artifact of failing to control for the economic evaluation being more
   relevant to the vote choice of stronger partisans. Our statistical
   investigation of this question finds no significant evidence that
   sophistication conditions the economic voting relationship once the
   conditioning effect of partisanship is included in the model. This
   finding suggests that individual-level heterogeneity in the strength of
   the economic voting relationship is largely due to stronger partisans
   voting more consistently with their national economic evaluation than to
   more sophisticated voters being more policy-oriented by holding the
   incumbent party more electorally accountable for macroeconomic
   performance. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This article compares the electoral significance, causes, and processes
   associated with presidential versus vice presidential home state
   advantages. Our analysis of presidential election returns from 1884
   through 2008 demonstrates that presidential candidates generally receive
   a large, statistically significant home state advantage. However, vice
   presidential home state advantages are statistically negligible and
   conditioned on the interactive effect of political experience and state
   population. Furthermore, the results indicate that the mobilization of
   new voters primarily accounts for presidential home state advantage,
   while vice presidential home state advantage is mainly due to the
   conversion of existing voters. Although home state advantages do occur
   in presidential elections, according to our analysis, a presidential or
   vice presidential home state advantage has not changed the outcome of
   any presidential election since 1884.},

Abstract = {Opinion about U.S. foreign intervention depends on both one's belief
   about how the world works and those cognitively available value
   conceptions about how it should work. Consistent with social identity
   theory, we argue that values can shape social group boundaries and that
   these boundaries are analogous to the position of the U.S. in the world.
   Thus, the religious values we explore neatly map onto opinion about
   whether U.S. intervention should be qualified in its scope and
   rationale. In this investigation, we first provide experimental tests of
   religious value priming conducted on Christians, Muslims, and Jews. We
   then assess the degree to which American Protestant clergy communicate
   these values. The results of both investigations support the efficacy of
   considering the communication of religious values in shaping public
   opinion on U.S. foreign intervention.},

Abstract = {A robust market for subnational bonds can provide emerging economies
   with additional tools to accelerate their economic growth. This article
   seeks to trigger a reflection on the factors that emerging nations such
   as Mexico would need to take into account if the aim is to issue bond
   instruments that are attractive to investors. This study assesses the
   factors affecting the yield spread of a sample of Mexican bonds known as
   Cebures. The analysis shows that only variables associated with the
   structure of the bond affect such yield spreads, not factors reflecting
   the financial strength of the issuing entity. Government policies aimed
   at modifying the implicit risk of this type of bonds may not be
   sufficient to alter bond buyer's risk perceptions.},

Abstract = {We examine the extent to which governments consider the role of
   bicameral conflict resolution procedures in legislative agenda-setting.
   We argue that governments may use these institutions to promote policy
   change in the event of bicameral conflict, especially when facing
   uncertainty over bicameral policy preferences. We test our arguments
   using comprehensive original data on forty years of German legislation
   and find that bicameral conflict resolution committees play a more
   sophisticated role in governmental policy making than previously
   suspected.},

Abstract = {While the importance of individual candidates in British elections has
   long been minimized, this article argues that early day motions
   (EDMs)-formal, non-binding expressions of opinion-allow backbench MPs to
   cultivate reputations with constituents. First, this article
   demonstrates that greater sponsorship of EDMs is associated with better
   electoral outcomes, which suggests that EDMs could help vulnerable MPs
   improve their electoral prospects. Secondly, a Bayesian hierarchical
   negative binomial hurdle model, which accounts for specific features of
   EDM sponsorship and is novel in political science, shows that members
   from electorally competitive constituencies are more likely to introduce
   EDMs, and introduce them more often, than members from less competitive
   constituencies. Moreover, this relationship has increased over the past
   20 years.},

Volume = {4},

Abstract = {Over the past decade, Latin American public employment services have
   been investing in improving and transforming rudimentary employment
   services into more comprehensive labor intermediation services.
   Intermediation services connect workers to jobs, training, and social
   services. They are of particular importance in Latin America where the
   tradition of listing jobs openly is more limited and large pools of
   disadvantaged workers search for work inefficiently through equally
   disadvantaged informal sector contacts. This article analyzes job
   searches in the Americas and the evolution and progress of Latin
   American versions of labor intermediation services. It classifies
   countries in the region as developing in stages, those in early
   development (stage one) and those with advancing coverage and efficiency
   (stage two). It argues that the most advanced of these services in the
   region are evolving toward a third future stage, to integrate and more
   efficiently connect diffused social, antipoverty and labor programs, to
   be positioned to serve key development challenges in Latin America.},

Volume = {9},

Month = {WIN},
Abstract = {In this paper we operationalize and empirically test six core tenets of
   pacification theory derived from Marxian political economy using time
   series data for the USA from 1972-2009. Our analysis confirms that
   rising inequality is statistically significantly correlated to increased
   public and private policing over time and that increased public and
   private policing is also statistically significantly correlated to
   increased industrial exploitation as measured through
   ``surplus-value{''}. While unionization correlates to strikes and
   lock-outs which suggests that unions have an important mobilizing role
   for the industrial reserve army, unionization also inversely correlates
   to total policing employment. As union membership decreases, policing
   employment increases, which gives credence to the notion that unions may
   also act as policing agents for capital. We conclude that when these
   findings are coupled with our previous international research of 45
   countries for the snapshot year of 2004 (Rigakos and Ergul 2011) that
   produced almost identical results, there appears to be significant
   empirical support for pacification theory. The relationships we have
   discovered recur both across time and international contexts despite the
   fact that variations in legal norms and institutional histories of
   policing are varied and complex.},

Abstract = {Does nationalism continue to determine elections in consociational
   political arrangements even long after the conflict? To examine the
   presumed reduction of nationalism in divided societies through
   consociationalism, this article tests the impact of ethnicity on the
   relative success of non-nationalist political parties. Using an original
   dataset from the local elections of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as
   in-depth studies of Bosnian voting from 1996 to 2010, this article
   demonstrates that consociational policies produce mixed results. The
   effect of social welfare on Bosnian voters points to the emergence of
   social cleavages other than ethnicity. However, the movement toward
   non-nationalist parties remains limited. The divisive differentiation
   between ethnic groups persists since the rigid structures of
   consociationalism help sustain peace but solidify the ethnic tensions.},

Abstract = {Examining the systematic and private records of a former D.C. Circuit
   Court Judge, we examine the process by which federal circuit court
   judges craft legal opinions. We discover that private and contextual
   factors influence legal outcomes. More specifically, we find that
   workload considerations strongly influence circuit opinions, that some
   visiting and senior judges effect the process differently than do active
   circuit court judges, and that panel effects play but a minimal role in
   the creation of opinions. In short, we move the literature on circuit
   court decision making forward by employing private archival material
   that illuminates how private and contextual features influence opinion
   writing and legal policy.},

Abstract = {The European Union's system of delegated powers, comitology', underwent
   significant changes after the Lisbon Treaty entered into force. This
   paper assesses the impact of these changes on the European Parliament,
   European Commission and Council. It distinguishes between the changes
   that occurred at the level of treaty reform (which generally favoured
   the EP in assuming a greater role in the process of
   policy-implementation) and subsequent legislative reforms and
   developments in soft law (through which the Council and the European
   Commission have reasserted their powers). While the system of delegated
   powers has significantly changed through the Lisbon reforms, it falls
   short of the expectations and intentions that led to these changes. The
   key objectives behind the reform - a simplification of a highly complex
   system of centralised policy implementation and greater democratic
   accountability through an upgrading of the EP's role - have only
   partially been achieved. To some extent recent developments indicate a
   step back.},

Abstract = {Mark Blyth's book makes a very compelling case that austerity is a
   `dangerous idea'. Instead of focusing on the book's central argument,
   this article reflects on why austerity policies keep coming back. It
   argues that the power of austerity is ideological in a complementary yet
   somewhat broader sense than envisioned in the book. Austerity is not
   only a conservative way of thinking, or `blueprint', it is also an
   excuse for decision makers to avoid thinking, and it typically aims at
   many goals, not all of them politically conservative. The eurozone
   crisis is offered as an illustration.},

Abstract = {Health-care goods are goods with peculiar properties, and where they are
   scarce, societies face potentially explosive distributional conflicts.
   Animated public and academic debates on the necessity and possible
   justice of limit-setting in health care have taken place in the last
   decades and have recently taken a turn toward procedural rather than
   substantial criteria for justice. This article argues that the most
   influential account of procedural justice in health-care rationing,
   presented by Daniels and Sabin, is indeterminate where concrete
   properties of rationing institutions are concerned. Such properties
   inscribe substantial norms into institutions. These norms can derive
   validity only from democratic majority decisions, which must be seen as
   an instance of pure procedural justice. We therefore have to move the
   discussion to a meta-level and ask how concrete properties of
   institutions are being chosen. I suggest four criteria for sufficiently
   democratic institutional design choice and conclude that as
   institutional properties are likely to have effects on the resulting
   distribution of health care, design choices should be empirically
   informed and taken both democratically and deliberately.},

Volume = {12},
Number = {4},
Pages = {255-276},

Abstract = {This article reconstructs a pragmatist conception of political
   conviction from the works of William James. Pragmatism is often
   criticized for failing to account for the force of moral convictions to
   motivate risky and confrontational political action. This article argues
   that such criticisms presume a conception of conviction as an experience
   of moral command that pragmatism rejects. In its place, pragmatism
   portrays the experience of conviction as acting on faith. Drawing on
   Gilles Deleuze's notion of the stutter, I argue that this experience of
   faith is neither a deliberative justification nor a form of decisionism
   but rather a style of moral deliberation that is experimental, social
   and affective. I consider the sole piece of political oratory in James'
   corpus, his 1897 oration to Robert Gould Shaw and the Massachusetts 54th
   Regiment, as a significant example of stuttering conviction. James'
   oration seeks to demonstrate the ways that convictions can take hold of
   actors without relying on deep philosophical foundations or
   justifications. Although James places his argument squarely within the
   context of the politics of race, he himself does not attend to the ways
   his celebration of Shaw obscures the moral experiences of the African
   American soldiers of the 54th. In response to this blindness, the final
   section considers whether or not the martyrdom of John Brown provides a
   more appropriate conception of conviction than James' Shaw.},

Abstract = {Federalist democracies often hold concurrent elections for multiple
   offices. A potential consequence of simultaneously voting for multiple
   offices that vary with respect to scope and scale is that the personal
   appeal of candidates in a high-profile race may affect electoral
   outcomes in less salient races. In this article I estimate the magnitude
   of such coattail effects from governors onto other concurrently elected
   statewide executive officers using a unique dataset of county election
   returns for all statewide executive office elections in the United
   States from 1987 to 2010. I exploit the disproportionate support that
   candidates receive from geographically proximate voters, which is often
   referred to as the friends-and-neighbors vote, to isolate variation in
   the personal appeal of candidates. I find that a one-percentage-point
   increase in the personal vote received by a gubernatorial candidate
   increases the vote share of their party's secretary of state and
   attorney general candidates by 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points. In
   contrast, personal votes for a secretary of state or attorney general
   candidate have no effect on the performance of their party's
   gubernatorial candidate or other down-ballot candidates.},

Journal = {IDP-INTERNET LAW AND POLITICS},

Pages = {77-96},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The relationship between human rights and intellectual property rights
   has received special attention in the last fifteen years. This attention
   has focused on the substantive domain of these links while not paying
   enough attention to intellectual property enforcement. The proliferation
   of detailed and demanding obligations regarding enforcement makes the
   systematization of such links necessary, if not urgent. This article
   analyses the right to appeal, measures for preservation of evidence and
   the criminal remedies in the event of intellectual property rights
   infringement. It describes how the links between human rights and
   enforcement with intellectual property rights may be positive, ambiguous
   or negative and proposes resorting to the secondary rules of
   international public law to tackle the interactions described},

Abstract = {Blyth shows convincingly that `Austerity does not work'. But he seems to
   imply that financial repression, higher taxes and monetary expansion
   would. Are they really compatible, however? Financial repression
   requires growth, real or nominal. Real growth is widely believed to
   require lower, not higher taxes. Nominal growth, that is inflation, is
   difficult to contain as well as to bring about, given trade union
   weakness and widespread dependence on fixed transfer incomes. Monetary
   expansion, finally, may simply add to general indebtedness, as it has
   since the late 1970s when real growth embarked on a long-term decline.},

Abstract = {Can an insecure regime use nuclear diversion to address its eroding
   domestic legitimacy? This article argues that facing a domestic
   legitimacy crisis, a regime might opt to ``rally round the nuclear
   flag{''} to survive. Theoretically, I argue that, compared with
   conventional diversion, nuclear diversion is less susceptible to
   structural restraints, has a unique symbolic value that could aid in
   coping with an acute legitimacy crisis, and spans a host of diversionary
   strategies as it ascends the escalation ladder, both before and after
   acquiring the bomb. The theory is examined empirically via Iranian
   nuclear policy. I argue that facing a deepening legitimacy crisis, the
   Iranian regime, throughout Ahmadinejad's tenure, has been increasingly
   drawing on nuclear diversion to boost public support and that, if the
   legitimacy crisis lingers, the regime may opt to further employ
   diversionary nuclear strategies, most of which require a viable
   ``nuclear latency,{''} rather than actual military nuclear capability.},

Abstract = {One of the most momentous shifts in twentieth-century party politics was
   the Democratic Party's embrace of civil rights. Recent scholarship finds
   that this realignment began as early as the 1940s and traces it to
   pressure groups, especially organized labor. But such scholarship does
   not explain why labor, which was traditionally hostile to African
   Americans, began to work with them. Nor does it ascribe agency to the
   efforts of African American pressure groups. Focusing on the National
   Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and the
   Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), this article attempts to
   fill these gaps in the literature. It explains why civil rights and
   labor leaders reassessed their traditional animosities and began to work
   as allies in the Democratic Party. It further shows how pressure from
   the new black-blue alliance forced the national Democratic Party to stop
   straddling civil rights issues and to become instead the vehicle for
   promoting civil rights. NAACP and CIO leaders consciously sought to
   remake the Democratic Party by marginalizing conservative Southerners,
   and eventually succeeded.},

Abstract = {In today's media environment, news of crisis can reach the outside world
   within minutes.
   The moment at which a crisis becomes widely known is the most vulnerable
   moment for an organization. In the absence of information, rumours will
   fill the void. Uncontrollable rumours can be devastating. The same
   applies to speculations or assumptions by company spokespersons who are
   not well prepared. Therefore it is extremely important that the media do
   not get a distorted picture or the wrong idea. The initial picture forms
   the basis for all future elaboration and adjusting this picture is
   extremely difficult. Good communication is therefore essential to retain
   the existing customers and ensure reputation of company is affected as
   minimum as possible.
   This is the success story about an unusual week at Vodafone Netherlands
   in April 2012, dealing with fire in Rotterdam switch building which was
   serving 3,5 million customers, using effective Social Media \& Crisis
   Communication Strategies - as a result: preventing churn.},

Abstract = {In our increasingly diverse society, most Americans identify with more
   than one group. These multiple identities often align with conflicting
   policy choices, such as when a Democratic parent may support increased
   social services spending from a partisan perspective but may also worry
   about the increasing national debt as a parent. Given the significance
   of identity, political elites often work to prime identities that will
   win over the most supporters. A large literature documents the
   substantial role such identity priming can play in shaping preferences,
   but virtually no work considers the reality that identity primes often
   compete with one another. That is, different groups simultaneously prime
   different identities that align with their interests. In this article, I
   explore what makes one identity prime more effective than another. I do
   so by offering a theory of what types of rhetoric makes for a stronger
   identity prime (relative to other types of rhetoric). I test my
   expectations with a unique survey experiment addressing three issues. I
   find that, in a competitive setting, certain rhetorical techniques
   dominate and drive the identities people rely on when forming
   preferences. The results have implications for public opinion and
   identity in the ever-changing demographic world in which we live.},

Abstract = {What sustains stability in legislative party systems between elections?
   This question commands attention given the potential for change
   highlighted in recent work on legislative party switching. In addressing
   the question, this article echoes a prominent theme in research on
   legislatures, parties, and party systems: the importance of the party
   label. The novelty here is the treatment of the individual legislator's
   need for manifest loyalty to the status quo party label as the chief
   constraint that deters incumbents from switching and underpins stability
   in legislative party systems. Our theory focuses on the value of stable
   party affiliations to voters and thus to incumbents as well. We extract
   testable implications and assess hypotheses against an original
   cross-national dataset of over 4,300 monthly observations of MP behavior
   in 116 legislative terms. We find that the temporal proximity to
   elections deters MPs' moves. This electoral deterrent acquires
   particular force under candidate-centered electoral systems.},

Abstract = {There is a long-standing scholarly literature on the electoral effects
   of campaign spending. Nevertheless, the academic research offers only
   limited guidance for policy makers interested in campaign finance
   reform. In part, this is because existing studies have focused narrowly
   on some vexing statistical issues. But it is also because political
   scientists have not devoted enough effort to conducting evaluation
   studies of how regulatory policies impact the intermediate goal of
   competition, let alone the ultimate policy goals of reduced corruption,
   increased citizen participation, and improved public policy.
   Consequently, there is a great need for updated and improved analyses of
   the treatment effect of campaign spending on political competition in a
   variety of electoral contexts, but an even greater need for the
   application of modern evaluation methods to the more basic question of
   whether campaign finance reforms ``work{''} as advertised.},

Abstract = {A clear development goal is to provide the poor with the benefits
   essential to human dignity without rendering them vulnerable to
   patronage politics. This is difficult to accomplish, especially in large
   federal countries where public policy requires cooperation between
   national and local authorities. Brazil's Bolsa Familia (Family Grant)
   confronts such a challenge. Have federal authorities managed to
   administer this complex and large-scale anti-poverty program while
   avoiding local ``politics as usual?{''} The findings, based on survey
   data and focus group evidence from Northeast Brazil, a regional bastion
   of clientelism, suggest that municipal politicians do not use the Bolsa
   Familia for vote buying. The success of the Bolsa Familia in remaining
   insulated from clientelistic networks yields lessons that go well beyond
   Brazil.},

Abstract = {This article empirically examines the ``Big Sort hypothesis{''}-the
   notion that, in recent years, liberal and conservative Americans have
   become increasingly spatially isolated from one another. Using block
   group-, tract-, and county-level party registration data and
   presidential election returns, I construct two formal indices of
   segregation for 19922010 in California and evaluate those indices for
   evidence of growth in the segregation of Californians along ideological
   lines. Evidence of rising geographic segregation between Democrats and
   Republicans for measures generated from both party registration and
   presidential vote data is found. This growth is statistically
   significant for 10 of the 12 segregation measures analyzed. In addition,
   many of the increases are practically significant, with estimates of
   growth in segregation during the observation period ranging from 2\% to
   23\%.},

Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {17},
Number = {6-7},
Pages = {803-816},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {In the period of state formation (1991-1992), the Slovene Ministry of
   the Interior erased, that is, excluded from legal status, those
   immigrants from other parts of the former Yugoslavia who did not become
   Slovene citizens when citizenship was available under initial simplified
   criteria. Compared with the processes of independence in Estonia and
   elsewhere, exclusion in the form of erasure from the register of
   permanent residents in Slovenia extended beyond the creation of
   foreigners within the country (i.e. foreign citizens with the right to
   remain and support themselves); this exclusion created outlaws, legal
   freaks (Arendt) or homines sacres (Agamben) - bare human beings who were
   expunged from society and deprived of all former rights and roles. This
   article discusses the citizenship practices of the victims of the
   erasure and interprets these practices as emancipation processes: the
   erased used grass roots and legal means to attempt to obtain the right
   to dignity, the right to stay and the right to compensation for their
   lost years'. The effects of their struggle went beyond matters of mere
   utility: by publicly defining themselves as the erased' and acting upon
   injustice; the erased challenged the boundaries of citizenship in terms
   of membership and content.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to solve the puzzle of what explains Irish peace
   policy norm consistency for over three centuries and the recent reversal
   of these norms. The methodology analyses values and identities in Irish
   leaders' foreign policy discourses and practices, producing evidence
   that Irish peace policy norms are consistently: independence and
   neutrality for Ireland in the cause of peace and security;
   self-determination; anti-imperialism; third world solidarity; and
   resistance to famine and slavery. In the early 1900s, after Ireland
   gained statehood, the addition of: institutional cooperation; a
   constitutional commitment to peaceful resolution of disputes; armed
   neutrality; UN peacekeeping; and an explicit subordination of material
   interests for moral, justice-based norms, made this small postcolonial
   state an historically-driven Natural Born Peacemaker. Elite-led norm
   reversals consolidated in the 2000s suggests a vital explanatory
   relationship with elite corruption and associated specific personality
   characteristics, and the need to revise elite socialisation theory to
   incorporate these variables.},

Abstract = {This article takes a new approach to the study of federal-provincial
   relations by arguing that in the conduct of intergovernmental relations
   in Canada, whether on major constitutional issues or the mundane,
   ordinary intergovernmental negotiations, partisanship has an effect. An
   examination of the Meech Lake Accord constitutional negotiations
   (1987-1990) and the Child Care Agreements (2004-2005) reveals that where
   traditional factors fail to provide a reason for conflict or cooperation
   between governments, the partisan variable offers valuable explanatory
   power. The impact is found in the process of federal-state bargaining
   and not in the substance of agreements themselves-in other words,
   partisanship can influence how an agreement is reached and whether it is
   kept.},

Abstract = {Economic voting studies remain contentious in Spain. The notion is
   widely-held that there is no economic vote in that country, due to the
   pervasive and effacing influences of left-right ideology. Still, a
   growing number of investigations show a significant impact of economic
   evaluation on the vote choice in Spanish national elections. At least
   one possible exception here is the 2008 election, where the question has
   received no systematic treatment. In this study, we explore the impact
   of economic voting in that contest. We find, first, the presence of
   strong economic voting of the valence kind. Second, we find that two
   hitherto unstudied dimensions of economic voting - position and
   patrimony - have their own independent effect. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {Re-thinking Myanmar's political regime: military rule in Myanmar and
   implications for current reforms},

Abstract = {The Myanmar military has long dominated national politics as well as the
   state apparatus since first coming into power in 1958. Despite a series
   of challenges to its rule, the military has been able to constantly
   re-invent itself while re-asserting its dominance over society. Cycles
   of popular protests and dissatisfaction with military rule have not led
   to regime change nor weakened the military as a unified institution. The
   latest incarnation of the nominally civilian government has introduced a
   series of liberalising reforms that have dramatically opened more
   socio-political space for opposition and non-state actors to participate
   in national politics. Despite the somewhat optimistic outlook of a more
   liberalised Myanmar in the future, the institutional design and
   historical legacy of the military's role in state-building have ensured
   that it has enough `reserve domains' to maintain its prominent role
   within any foreseeable future governments in Myanmar. By tracing the
   historical development of the Myanmar military regime, this paper argues
   that current reforms were introduced as a strategy for the military to
   ensure its continued survival as the primary political actor in Myanmar.},

Abstract = {Research shows that foreign aid promotes economic development in
   democracies but not in autocracies. Although explanations for this
   phenomenon vary, a common theme is that autocracies are more likely to
   misuse aid. We provide evidence of such misuse, showing that autocracies
   are more likely than democracies to divert development aid to the
   military. Theoretically, we build on ``selectorate{''} models in which
   autocrats respond to aid by contracting civil liberties. Because this
   strategy requires military capacity, autocracies but not democracies
   should spend aid on the military. We support this hypothesis
   empirically, providing further evidence that autocracies misuse foreign
   aid.},

Abstract = {Questions regarding the problem-solving capacity of the state have been
   long-standing. The financial crisis as well as future demographic and
   environmental challenges have raised the spectre of the depleted state,
   a state that lacks legitimacy and resources to steer social, economic
   and political developments. This article considers how a perspective
   that centres on executive politics can illuminate key debates
   surrounding the depleted state. It does so in three steps. First, it
   considers whether the earlier literature on the crisis of the state' of
   the 1970s contributes to contemporary debates. Second, it questions
   whether the age of governance' has come to the rescue, and not just of
   the challenges outlined by the earlier literature. Third, it discusses
   the contribution of executive politics to the study of the contemporary
   state's problem-solving capacity and draws wider implications of the age
   of the depleted state for executive politics.},

Abstract = {Indexation of financial liabilities was introduced in Iceland in face of
   an almost total collapse of the islands monetary system. The demise of
   the financial system was caused by long lasting and high episode of
   price inflation in the late 1960' s and the 1970' s. The article traces
   some of the negative consequences of inflation for the economy. The
   paper also presents a theoretical setting where a simple game-
   theoritical model is used to explain how the invention of indexation of
   financial liabilities changed the landscape of collective bargaining.
   Before the invention of indexation the actors in the bargaining game
   were more likely to gain from inflation compared to a situation with
   stable prices. Indexation changed that slowly but steadily. Indexation
   has thus been an stabilizing institution in Icelandic economic live.},

Abstract = {Studies demonstrate that the public is generally poorly informed about

   representative survey to examine levels of familiarity and satisfaction
   with redistricting institutions. I also investigate the popular claim
   that citizens will perceive greater fairness in redistricting when the
   process is conducted by independent, nonpartisan commissions rather than
   by state legislatures. Using a survey experimental approach, I show that
   perceptions of fairness in redistricting differ little when subjects are
   informed redistricting will be conducted by a nonpartisan commission

Abstract = {The central role of corrective justice in shaping private law has
   vigorously been challenged by the law and economics movement, and its
   concept of optimal deterrence. The fierce rivalry between the two
   competing theories seems to be at a dead end since scholars on each side
   appear to be deaf to the arguments raised by their counterparts.
   However, building on Kantian notion of conceptually sequenced ideas, it
   is suggested that the two theories are not only perfectly compatible,
   but also necessary complements of each other. Law needs justice, justice
   needs deterrence, and deterrence without justice is an empty and
   incoherent exercise.},

Abstract = {How do fiscal institutions, partisanship, and governance affect federal
   transfers to municipalities? We address this question using a novel
   research design and data set for Mexico. We compare the state-level
   obligations for federal transfers to municipalities with the
   distribution of these funds as reported by municipalities. This strategy
   allows us to know whether state-level formulas are binding, whether
   there are partisan skews in the formula, and how and why governors
   reallocate funds. We find that state-level fiscal institutions are quite
   binding; even so, deviations from the formula total approximately
   US\$300-500 million annually. Whereas Partido Revolucionario
   Institucional governors appear to reallocate to municipalities when they
   are governed by their co-partisans, Partido Accion Nacional and Partido
   de la Revolucion Democratica governors appear to reallocate funds to
   municipalities for equity, stabilization, and disasters (with no
   detectable partisan bias).},

Abstract = {The Australian Labor Party, following its election to government in
   2007, has implemented an ambitious social policy agenda with spending on
   hospitals, pensions and community workers, as well as programs for
   parental leave and disability. It has also reformed taxes, in part to
   finance these reforms, implementing the mining and carbon taxes in 2012.
   Labor, however, has difficulty avoiding deficits because tax revenues
   are too low to finance expanded welfare. This article explores the
   political constraints and opportunities involved in financing welfare by
   examining voter responses to the ANU Poll of September 2011. Spending on
   welfare is supported by low-income earners, while taxing big industries
   finds greater support among university-educated voters. The article
   advances an explanation for this mismatch and for why tax resistance has
   hindered Labor's efforts to finance welfare expansion.},

Abstract = {In societies with widespread gender discrimination, development programs
   with gender quotas are considered a way to improve women's economic,
   political, and social status. Using a randomized field experiment across
   500 Afghan villages, we examine the effects of a development program
   that mandates female participation. We find that even in a highly
   conservative context like Afghanistan, such initiatives improve outcomes
   specific to female participation in some economic, social, and political
   activities, including increased mobility and income generation. They,
   however, produce no change in more entrenched female roles linked to
   family decision-making or in attitudes toward the general role of women
   in society.},

Abstract = {The European Union has become an important leader in international
   environmental affairs - particularly through the negotiation of
   multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) with favourable terms. In
   this article, EU environmental leadership is studied from a new
   perspective, focusing on the ratification stage of environmental regime
   formation. Specifically, it investigates whether the EU is also capable
   of motivating third states to join its preferred MEAs. It is argued that
   third states join the EU's preferred MEAs to signal their compliance
   with EU environmental standards in an effort to become eligible for
   various rewards that the EU could potentially offer, including a
   credible membership perspective, access to its lucrative markets, and
   aid and assistance. The argument is tested by examining the ratification
   behaviour of 25 non-EU Member States with regard to all 21 MEAs
   negotiated under the auspices of the United Nations Economic Commission
   for Europe (UNECE). The results provide robust support for the theory
   that EU rewards motivate third states to ratify these treaties. The
   results withstand a number of statistical tests, even when alternative
   explanatory factors such as trade intensities, transnational
   communication and geographic proximity are controlled for. The study is
   the first large-scale demonstration of the EU's external influence at
   the ratification stage of environmental regime formation. By identifying
   three different channels of EU influence, the research permits a more
   refined understanding of the EU's role as a promoter of environmental
   protection standards.},

Abstract = {Despite the increasing attention devoted to the theme of political
   judgment, the question of how to theorize judgment as specifically
   democratic remains elusive. This article shows the promise of Spinoza
   for approaching such a vexing issue. Through a combined reading of his
   major political and metaphysical texts, I develop a new concept of
   political judgment that I call `citizen jurisprudence'. Citizen
   jurisprudence is at once a right (jus) and a power (potentia) that is
   internally related to the `power of the people'. Put another way,
   citizen jurisprudence is the figure and effect of democracy understood
   in an expansive sense: not solely as a state form but as an activity of
   equally free (sui juris) individuals determining the sense and the scope
   of common affairs. An account of this concept simultaneously nuances
   Spinoza's current profile as a political thinker and contributes to
   efforts within contemporary political theory to recuperate the radical
   potential of judgment as a mode of democratic agency.},

Abstract = {This article explores ideas of citizenship in Latin America, arguing
   that this very western idea plays a key role in configuring and
   embedding the Occidental project in empirical reality and in academic
   theorizing. Drawing inspiration from coloniality of power' scholarship,
   it explores the way in which citizenship is conventionally configured
   and goes on to demonstrate the role of citizenship in the task of
   epistemological colonization in the case of Argentina. I discuss
   processes of coloniality/modernity, including the Conquest of the
   Desert, and assimilation initiatives during the nineteenth and twentieth
   centuries, including the more recent phase of multiculturalism. I
   conclude by outlining a strategy for decolonial citizenship and advocate
   a shift in emphasis from (liberal) rights to dignity, and from
   (Occidental) universality to diversality.},

Abstract = {The enduring electoral success of populist parties across Europe and the
   increasing opportunities they have gained to access government in recent
   years bring once more into relief the question of whether populism and
   democracy are fully compatible. In this article we show how, despite
   playing different roles in government within very different political
   systems, and despite the numerous constraints placed upon them (for
   instance, EU membership, international law and domestic checks and
   balances), populist parties consistently pursued policies that clashed
   with fundamental tenets of liberal democracy. In particular, the idea
   that the power of the majority must be limited and restrained, the
   sanctity of individual rights and the principle of the division of
   powers have all come under threat in contemporary Europe. This has
   contributed to the continuing erosion of the liberal consensus, which
   has provided one of the fundamental foundations of the European project
   from its start.},

Abstract = {The contemporary world assists to a group of different and significant
   transformations, which start a new wave of conceptual revision to feed
   the already classic categories in the context of the new events. This
   article focuses mainly in one of these categories: the concept of
   ideology suggested by Karl Marx. On the basis of a literary phenomenon
   which captures the attention of the attendees to the Feria del Libro de
   Bogota, a close relationship between ideology and belief is at issue in
   the theoretical discussion around the concept of ideology suggested by
   Althuser, Eaglenton, Gramci, Taussing, Zizek, among other authors. Under
   these conceptual premises and the empirical object of the denominated
   new age literature, the phenomenon which will allow a mystic capitalism
   as one of those contemporary manifestations of the social-economical
   system in which we live in, is analyzed.},

Abstract = {Deliberative democracy, as a rationalized discourse, is a valuable
   alternative which offers discursive and analytical tools in order to
   understand the rules that the State should follow in the task of
   guarantying the inclusion of the others, as well as in offering a group
   of subjective rights of action which facilitates the participation of
   the citizens. Thus, nowadays society requires deliberative democracy,
   provided that it means supporting the normative and vindicating the
   participation of the citizens, which is guided on the common rules and
   proceedings. This paper aims to rebuilt the core aspects of deliberative
   democracy in Jurgen Habermas. That reconstruction will allow understand
   the rationality of the deliberative democracy state model, and also
   understanding the right inclusion model, in equality of right, of the
   several ways of cultural life.},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {We propose a framework for analysing party elite perceptions of voting
   behaviour based on four party competition and voting behaviour models:
   the Downsian proximity, saliency, competence and directional models. We
   analyse whether and to what extent party elite perceptions support these
   theories of party competition and voting behaviour. Empirical analysis
   is based solely on internal party documents from two Swedish parties,
   the Social Democrats and the Conservatives, from 1964 to 1988/1991. We
   demonstrate that elements of all four party competition models have
   characterized Swedish party elite thinking and reasoning about voting
   behaviour in recent decades. Discussion in the Social Democratic elite
   was most in line with Downs' model. Until the mid-1970s, Downs' model
   tended to be combined with the competence model and thereafter with the
   saliency model. The Conservative elite clearly favoured the salience and
   competence models until the early 1970s and the saliency and Downs'
   models since then.},

Abstract = {The more closely the ``Putin system{''} resembles an authoritarian
   political order, the more urgent the question of what kind of Russia
   policy is adequate becomes. The detente of the 1970s is inadequate. The
   international framework, the political system, and the elite's logic, of
   action in today's Russia have changed fundamentally. German politicians
   should abandon the idea of transforming Russia from the outside.
   Instead, it is important to concentrate on what is possible: cooperation
   in security policy in regional conflicts, disarmament and arms control,
   confidence-building measures. Human-rights violations may not go
   unmentioned. Those who stand up for democratic change in Russia and are
   then persecuted deserve support, right to the granting of asylum.},

Abstract = {We marshal discoveries about human behavior and learning from social
   science research and show how these can be used to improve teaching and
   learning. The discoveries are easily stated as three social science
   generalizations: (1) social connections motivate, (2) teaching teaches
   the teacher, and (3) instant feedback improves learning. We show how to
   apply these generalizations via innovations in modern information
   technology inside, outside, and across university classrooms. We also
   give concrete examples of these ideas from innovations we have
   experimented with in our own teaching.},

Abstract = {Electoral democracy rests on a straightforward idea: citizens elect
   their fellow citizens to represent their interests. However, the
   explanation of voting behaviour is more complex than a probabilistic
   association between X and Y. A proper understanding demands a close
   examination of the three links of the causal chain of electoral
   behavior: parties' entry decisions, campaign strategies and voter
   predispositions. Without providing the causal mechanisms, regression
   coefficients are a black box. The goal of this paper is to examine these
   factors in Spain.},

Abstract = {The recent increase in partisan media has generated interest in whether
   such outlets polarize viewers. I draw on theories of motivated reasoning
   to explain why partisan media polarize viewers, why these programs
   affect some viewers much more strongly than others, and how long these
   effects endure. Using a series of original experiments, I find strong
   support for my theoretical expectations, including the argument that
   these effects can still be detected several days postexposure. My
   results demonstrate that partisan media polarize the electorate by
   taking relatively extreme citizens and making them even more extreme.
   Though only a narrow segment of the public watches partisan media
   programs, partisan media's effects extend much more broadly throughout
   the political arena.},

   communities and victims want to claim their right to remember through
   the construction of alternative ways of memory. The reflection is

Abstract = {Since Watergate, more than two hundred fifty members of the House of
   Representatives have been involved in various scandals. The author finds
   that roughly 40 percent of incumbents did not ``survive{''} their
   scandal. Incumbents who stood for reelection lost 5 percent of the
   general election vote share, on average, but the electoral repercussions
   vary across types of scandals and could be magnified in the presence of
   a quality challenger. A scandal-tainted incumbent defending his or her
   seat does not necessarily fare better than an untainted open-seat
   candidate, a finding that provides a justification for stronger ethics
   rules.},

Abstract = {Diana Mutz's individual-level data show that participation and
   deliberation are often inversely related. This, according to Mutz,
   undermines many claims made by deliberative-democratic theory. However,
   a systemic approach to deliberative democracy challenges the
   significance of this finding. Although it is true that some citizens are
   political activists not open to hearing the other side and other
   citizens are less active but more open minded, both types of citizens
   make equally important and positive contributions to deliberative
   politics when it is viewed as a system that deploys a division of labor.},

Abstract = {Turkish foreign policy has changed substantially within the last decade.
   Even though its relationship with the West still has significance,
   relations with neighboring countries and other countries in Africa, the
   Middle East, and Asia have improved. This new foreign policy
   incorporates Turkey's political and economic aspirations. Its aim is to
   utilize the country's economic strength in order to reach political
   goals while simultaneously using political tools to obtain economic
   benefits. This study analyzes the effects of the recent change in
   foreign policy on Turkey's international trade. Specifically, we
   investigate the influence of Turkish Prime Minister Erdogan's foreign
   visits on international trade by using a standard trade gravity model.
   Statistical analyses imply that Erdogan's visits help increase Turkish
   international trade.},

Abstract = {This article assesses the voters' support for the multiple-mandate
   holding (cumul des mandats) of their representatives using an
   alternative method of measurement based neither on polls nor on
   electoral results. Voters' financial contributions to candidates allow
   for the measuring of, among other things, the public's perception of the
   situation of multiple-mandate holding while overcoming the principle
   problems posed by habitual measurements. The study of electoral
   contributions to the incumbent candidates at the 2007 legislative
   elections shows that the accumulation of local offices is neither valued
   nor sanctioned by voters. Yet, the function of mayor, and thus of the MP
   who is the mayor, is positively perceived. This result contradicts the
   arguments based on electoral results that are more favorable to
   candidates holding multiple mandates and those based on polls that claim
   a voter's rejection of this practice.},

Abstract = {Within the literature on the relation between membership in voluntary
   associations and tolerance, three theoretical perspectives can be
   distinguished. The socialization perspective assumes that the
   interaction within association leads to higher levels of tolerance; the
   self-selection perspective suggests that tolerant actors are more likely
   to join associations; while the selection and adaption model predicts
   that the group culture within an association will have a specific effect
   on members' attitudes. We use a two-year panel study among Belgian
   adolescents to ascertain the empirical merits of these three approaches.
   Results show that not all associations have an effect on the reduction
   of prejudice, but that this effect is limited to specific associations.
   A structural equation model furthermore suggests that socialization
   effects are significantly stronger than self-selection effects. As such,
   this analysis of panel data lends support to the selection and
   adaptation model.},

Abstract = {Do citizens have the information they need to hold state politicians
   accountable? We consider what people know about state politics and
   whether knowledge of state government is rooted in the same factors that
   explain knowledge of national matters. We argue that while knowledge of
   national politics is rooted within individual dispositions like
   education and political interest, knowledge of state politics depends on
   the political climate of the state. When state political environments
   provide more information and greater incentives to become informed,
   people are more knowledgeable about state matters. Even if citizens are
   not always well versed in matters of state politics, they appear to
   monitor the business of the states. Citizens are most knowledgeable
   about state politics in the cases where information is arguably most
   important-when state governments are underperforming, when political
   competition is high, and when the political parties in the state are
   ideologically divided.},

   conceptual tissue criterion assumes the global political and historical
   context, which enable the construction of spaces and education projects
   in democratic contexts, peaceful and inclusive. In that sense, the
   citizen of the society is one that, through the development and

   able to re-meet the cultural, social, political and economic within
   which co-constructs its meaning and its political action.},

Abstract = {One of the most significant changes in American law was the application
   of the Bill of Rights to the states. Some members of the U.S. Supreme
   Court enthusiastically supported the doctrine of incorporation, while
   others actively opposed it. Why? Evolutionary psychology posits that
   birth order can explain support for radical change; older siblings
   identify with authority and resist changes in the rules, while
   laterborns defy authority and are willing to alter the status quo.
   Applying the birth order hypothesis to the Court, the author finds that
   the incorporation revolution was led by laterborns, even after taking
   account of justices' political preferences.},

Abstract = {The evolution of the Israeli academy approach to the foundation and
   essence of the state of Israel has deep political and social
   ramifications. One of the main impacts is the introduction in the public
   discourse of previously unknown or unaccepted concepts.
   We will try to understand and explain how a small group of people is
   struggling to promote a different narrative about the creation of the
   state of Israel into its own society, in order to shape a different
   social and political future for the people of Palestine/Israel.
   So the main focus will be on the activity of an Israeli NGO called
   Zochrot, whose goal is ``to introduce the Palestinian Nakba to the
   Israeli-Jewish public, to express the Nakba in Hebrew, to enable a place
   for the Nakba in the language and in the environment{''}.
   There will be an introduction to the history ad objectives of the
   organization, followed by a deeper insight into the tools used to raise
   awareness and change the perspective from which the vast majority of the
   Israeli Jewish society looks at the events of 1948, which led to the
   creation of ``their{''} state and the transformation of the majority of
   the Palestinian indigenous community into refugees.
   The very different activities of Zochrot will offer us the opportunity
   to observe various theoretical and practical methodologies for education
   and intervention in the public debate. As a conclusion we will propose a
   reflection on the relation between academy, education and peace
   activism, underlining the great potential for conflict transformation
   that resides in challenging the official views and narratives.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {From the middle of the 1990' s, an abundant scientific literature has
   been developed concerning the concept of social capital. There exists a
   plurality of perspectives that decline this notion that goes from the
   resources that an individual can mobilize as consequence of his
   belonging to a group, to the reciprocity, the solidarity or the
   confidence between the members of a group and passing by the
   institutional and even cultural characteristics of a society. It is the
   reason why, the aim of this article is to analyze the originality and
   the failures of the theory of social capital of Robert Putnam. More
   precisely, if this author reveals the empirical entail of networks and
   norms, and the influence of associations and civic participation in the
   economic development and the social cohesion of a society, his theory is
   characterized by certain slides, the weakness of his principal thesis,
   the confusion and circularity of the concept of social capital, the
   ambiguity of the discourse and the rhetorical temptation; without
   forgetting his questionable use of certain indicators. Putnam tries to
   answer to these critiques realizing some adequacies of his theoretical
   approach and, especially, developing a wide campaign of communication to
   spread his ideas and to isolate these critiques.},

Abstract = {Lobbying in general - but business lobbying in particular - has changed
   a lot in the past two decades with the transformations in technology,
   the continued polarization of Washington, and the fragmentation of the
   media. In this new world, business lobbying - both strategically and
   tactically - is beginning to look a lot like electoral campaigns. And
   this raises a host of questions about what's the most effective means of
   advocacy in this new world. The use of research, media (both earned and
   paid), grassroots and elite mobilization, are playing more prominent
   roles in the advocacy world. But just like political campaigns are
   asking new questions about the effectiveness of various tactics business
   groups need to start doing the same. The fact that the growth in the
   size of the lobbying industry is both a direct result of the growth of
   government but also a facilitator of government growth - is also
   explored in this article. Finally, all of the changes in the tactics of
   lobbying raise serious questions about whether the current legal
   framework and even the popular or academic understanding of advocacy
   accurately captures who is really engaged in the influence business.},

Abstract = {Recently in this journal, Charney and English (2012) presented an
   extensive critique of candidate gene association studies using the
   widely noted Fowler and Dawes (2008) article on the relationship between
   self-reported voter turnout and both 5-HTT (serotonin transporter) and
   MAOA (monoamine oxidase A) as the driving example of their evaluation.
   Reanalysis of the Fowler and Dawes data by Charney and English, based on
   four critiques of candidate gene studies, led to the conclusion that
   neither polymorphism is related to variations in turnout. We add to this
   empirical debate by conducting an independent test using an original
   dataset containing 5-HTT data and two separate participation variables:
   self-reported participation and actual voting records. Our results
   confirm the original conclusions by Fowler and Dawes on 5-HTT, but also
   support several of the critiques suggested by Charney and English. We
   conclude by offering suggestions for the way candidate gene association
   studies should be interpreted by the discipline and processed by journal
   editors.},

Abstract = {Legislative performance can be understood in terms of results (the
   quality of the laws enacted) or in terms of the literal performativity
   of legislators (the quality of their appearances on the public stage).
   This article examines two different ethical frameworks for evaluating
   legislative performance in this latter, performative sense: a
   deliberative model, which restricts just political performances to
   deliberative exchanges among citizens, and a plebeian model, which
   expands just political performances to include those where political and
   economic elites endure special burdens as a condition of their elevated
   status. Given certain drawbacks of the deliberative model and parallel
   advantages of the plebeian model, I endorse the plebeian approach to
   political performativity. The article concludes by elaborating one of
   the key contrasts between the two models with regard to political
   communication, namely the plebeian model's embrace of a distinct form of
   legislative disruption. Beyond the way deliberation itself disrupts
   non-communicative forms of power and beyond the way protests physically
   disrupt governmental processes, plebeianism invokes a third kind of
   disruption non-deliberative speech intended to rebuke and humble leaders
   rather than reach mutual understanding about issues.},

Abstract = {Few studies have directly addressed constituent conceptions of the
   representative relationship. The assumption is that constituents have
   different preferences for elected representatives to be `good
   constituency members' and that these preferences are plausibly related
   to their `empowerment', their organizational capacity and parties'
   behaviour. Combining data from the 2009 PARTIREP Election Study (at the
   individual level) and the 2006 Local Politics Study (at the level of the
   local party organization) in Belgium, it is demonstrated that the
   representative relationship is interactive: although constituents'
   preferences and expectations ultimately shape the incentive structures
   for parties, they are in turn shaped by and large in reaction to what
   parties and politicians do. Acta Politica (2013) 48, 167-191.

Abstract = {Africa is largely agrarian, and the performance of agriculture shapes
   the performance of its economies. It has long been argued that economic
   development in Africa is strongly conditioned by politics. Recent
   changes in Africa's political systems enables us to test this argument
   and, by extension, broader claims about the impact of political
   institutions on economic development. Building on a recent analysis of
   total factor productivity growth in African agriculture, we find that
   the introduction of competitive presidential elections in the last
   decades of the twentieth century appears to have altered political
   incentives, resulting in policy reforms that have enhanced the
   performance of farmers.},

Abstract = {This article examines organized efforts by citizens to provide medical
   aid to unauthorized migrants in Germany. A case study of an activist
   organization in Berlin highlights how prevailing forms of governance
   through citizenship are disrupted. Three major themes are explored.
   First, historical contingencies and policy realities explain why, given
   examples of grassroots protest by migrants in other settings, efforts in
   Germany have been driven primarily by citizens. Second, migrants'
   biolegitimacy shapes specific ideas of relative deservingness. As a
   result, advocacy for some groups, such as survivors of torture or
   refugees from specific geopolitical settings, is more highly valued than
   that which addresses needs of unauthorized labor migrants. Finally,
   although their sustained efforts have resulted in challenges to policy
   and called into question prevailing notions of citizenship, medical
   activist organizations have become increasingly institutionalized, which
   may jeopardize their goals. As this case illustrates, the distinctive
   ethics associated with providing medical care has the ability to disrupt
   the scaling of citizenship by the state by treating noncitizens
   especially illegal' noncitizens ostensibly as citizens, thus protesting
   citizenship as the exclusive organizing principle of German society.},

Abstract = {This article unravels the perceived dichotomy between universal human
   and women's rights and apparently misogynist cultural claims and
   practices. It does so by mainly focusing on the universal' side of the
   dichotomy. In pursuing this argument, it first describes how recent
   feminist work has gone beyond a critique and transformation of the
   content of universals and suggested the transformation of both the
   status and structure of universals. At the same time, feminists find it
   useful to retain universals, not because they are in fact universal, but
   rather because of the political utility of their universalising thrust.
   This radical feminist critique of Western universal ideals is further
   fleshed out with the help of Aristotle's notion of phronesis.
   Thereafter, the culture side of the perceived dichotomy is briefly
   considered and it is suggested that cultural claims often function much
   like universalist claims, only on a smaller scale, and that the same
   conditions apply to their invocation in any specific concrete situation
   that should apply in the case of Western universals, as indicated in the
   first part of the article. The theoretical considerations are throughout
   demonstrated using mostly South African examples.},

Abstract = {What explains variation in individuals' opposition to immigration? While
   scholars have consistently shown cultural concerns to be strong
   predictors of opposition, findings regarding the labor-market
   competition hypothesis are highly contested. To help understand these
   divergent results, we distinguish between the prevalence and conditional
   impact of determinants of immigration attitudes. Leveraging a targeted
   sampling strategy of high-technology counties, we conduct a study of
   Americans' attitudes toward H-1B visas. The plurality of these visas are
   occupied by Indian immigrants, who are skilled but ethnically distinct,
   enabling us to measure a specific skill set (high technology) that is
   threatened by a particular type of immigrant (H-1B visa holders). Unlike
   recent aggregate studies, our targeted approach reveals that the
   conditional impact of the relationship in the high-technology sector
   between economic threat and immigration attitudes is sizable. However,
   labor-market competition is not a prevalent source of threat and
   therefore is generally not detected in aggregate analyses.},

Abstract = {While `political theology' has attracted widespread attention for
   decades, it is often taken to be too fideist for orthodox Christianity
   and too illiberal for secular politics. But in the work of Jacques
   Maritain one finds a defence of a certain political theology, one whose
   character is key to grasping Maritain's justification of another
   controversial concept: `Christian philosophy'. In this study I draw out
   Maritain's distinction between Christian philosophy and theology, paying
   particular attention to the relevance of their differences in the realm
   of practical thought. To illustrate what Maritain has in mind by these
   claims, I further consider his intriguing classification of the
   political works of Thomas Aquinas. I argue that distinguishing between
   rival notions of political theology clarifies the opportunities for
   dialogue between believing and secular citizens.},

Abstract = {The authors envision a scenario for security of wireless networks that
   include and integrate nodes of all different capabilities, including
   tiny sensors or similarly battery-powered, resource-constrained tiny
   nodes. However, the existing Wireless Protected Access (WPA) protocol
   that supports security services for wireless networks today may not be
   suitable for such resource-constrained, low-end nodes since its existing
   authentication and privacy mechanisms are complex and computationally
   intensive. In this work, the authors propose an efficient protocol for
   authentication and privacy in wireless networks using identity-based
   encryption (IBE) techniques. Specifically, the authors propose an
   enhanced and extended version of the WPA protocol by incorporating IBE
   based authentication methods in the existing WPA protocol at the link
   layer level. The enhanced WPA protocol can be used for small and
   resource-constrained wireless devices to integrate them in existing
   wireless networks. Their proposed protocol is proven to be secure
   against common attacks and vulnerabilities in wireless networks. Also,
   the authors' analysis of the protocol shows that it is feasible and
   efficient in terms of computation, communication, and storage overheads
   to support many resource-constrained devices.},

Journal = {STUDIES IN AMERICAN POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {27},
Number = {1},
Pages = {36-50},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Thomas Jefferson is often invoked as an advocate of limited government
   and a defender of individual rights. This article argues that rights
   were Jefferson's starting place. Jefferson also believed that American
   citizens should have opportunities to develop the capabilities necessary
   to enjoy the full use of their rights. Rather than thinking about
   Jefferson as progovernment or antigovernment, this article concludes
   that we must understand the particular kind of government Jefferson
   desired, the ends he had in mind, and why and how those ends differed
   from his Federalist predecessors. A better understanding of Jefferson's
   statecraft not only offers a new perspective on the relationship between
   government and rights in Jefferson's thought but also how and why
   Jeffersonians in power used the state to promote individual freedom.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the relevance of the autonomy of migration approach
   for understanding the role of citizenship in the sovereign control of
   mobility. There is an insurgent configuration of ordinary experiences of
   mobility emerging against this regime of control. At its core is the
   sharing of knowledge and infrastructures of connectivity, affective
   cooperation, mutual support and care among people on the move. The
   sovereign regime of mobility control is displaced on the level on which
   it attempts to take hold: the everyday movements of migrants. The
   frenetic fixation with security is challenged by the creation of common
   worlds of existence; the obsession with governance is replaced by
   inhabiting social spaces below the radar of existing political
   structures. This paper attempts to contribute to a reconstruction of
   this mundane ontology of transmigration, an ontology which we will
   describe as the mobile commons of migration.},

Title = {Does voting rights affect the political maturity of 16-and 17-year-olds?
   Findings from the 2011 Norwegian voting-age trial},

Abstract = {A key question in an ongoing debate about voting age is whether people
   below the age of 18 are politically mature enough to take part in
   elections. Previous research indicate that 16- and 17-year-olds are not
   as mature as other voters when the voting age is at 18 (Chan and
   Clayton, 2006), but that such age-differences are evened out when
   16-year olds are given the right to vote (Wagner et al., 2012).
   This paper tests that hypothesis by utilizing data from a Norwegian
   trial in which the voting age was lowered from 18 to 16 in some
   municipalities. The results are that there is a significant gap in
   maturity between 16- and 17- year olds and older voters. There is no
   evidence to indicate that adolescent maturity levels go up when the
   voting age is lowered. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Under the premise of considering the motives and actions of all levels
   of governments, this paper empirically studies the mechanism and
   economic consequences of the law and order regulating inefficient
   investments on a sample of 3201 firm-year observations of listed
   companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchange in China over the
   period from 2007 to 2009. Using investment-cash flow sensitivities to
   proxy for inefficient investment of a company, I provide evidence that
   the degree of inefficient investments of listed companies controlled by
   local governments is much higher than that of other companies controlled
   by central government or non-governments. Furthermore, I find that the
   level of law and order of a region with high quality can reduce
   significantly the sensitivity of investment of Chinese listed companies
   to cash flows, the effect of which is much stronger for listed companies
   controlled by local governments. According to the conventional
   interpretations, a lower investment cash flow sensitivity means less
   investment distortions. However, the improvement of investment
   efficiency aising from the law and order are not ultimately transferred
   to the increase in the company's future operating performances,
   suggesting that the roles of the level of law and order of a region
   across China playing in controlling company's inefficient investment are
   limited.},

Abstract = {Many studies have focused on the relationship between political
   information and the use of ideology. Here, we argue that two
   ``evaluative motivations{''}aEuro{''}general investment of the self in
   politics and extremity of partisanship-serve as moderators of this
   relationship. Specifically, we use data from two recent national surveys
   to test whether the possession of information is more strongly
   associated with a tendency to approach politics in an ideological
   fashion among individuals high in both types of evaluative motivation.
   Results supported this hypothesis, revealing that information was more
   strongly associated with ideological constraint and with a tendency to
   give polarized evaluations of conservatives and liberals among those who
   highly invest the self in politics and those with more extreme
   partisanship. As such, this study suggests that information and
   involvement interact to shape the use of ideology.},

Journal = {PARTY POLITICS},

Volume = {19},

Abstract = {Compared to its West European counterparts, post-communist Christian
   Democracy is notable for its lack of success. Even in the most religious
   of post-communist democracies, no Christian Democratic (CD) party has
   claimed a plurality of the electorate. At the same time, there is a
   considerable range in average electoral support from 1990 to 2010, i.e.
   from 0.7 percent in Estonia to as high as 18.4 percent in Slovakia. The
   most successful CD parties have arisen in Slovakia, the Czech Republic,
   Slovenia and Lithuania, and (with qualifications) in Macedonia. The
   reasons for this success lie not in popular religiosity, state-church
   conflict or alliances between CD parties and churches. Instead, where
   parties can point to a history of nation and state-building in the
   inter-war period, they receive an initial electoral boost from this
   historical legacy. Yet even these favourable historical reputations have
   transitory effects: by the second or third elections, the impact of
   inter-war support rapidly faded.},

Abstract = {Policy implications aside, assessing the EU's involvement in the
   Mediterranean region necessitates a reconsideration of the impact and
   limits of the so-called `normative power' upon which its approach has
   been based, implicitly or explicitly. This paper does so by examining
   the EU's engagement with Egypt and the Israel-Palestine conflict; it
   sets out to challenge the notion that EU-style normative power alone is
   well-suited to promote democracy and regional cooperation, particularly
   in regions with diverging dynamics where the promotion of EU-associated
   norms may stumble upon European trade- and diplomacy-related interests.
   In this sense, it aims to enrich and inform the debates on `normative
   power Europe' and Euro-Mediterranean relations.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the development of private consumption, public
   consumption, national and domestic product in Iceland from 1870 to
   present times and projects likely changes for the next 50 years. It is
   established that the later people are born during this period the
   greater will their consumption be on average. The difference from one
   generation to the next is very large in the early part of the period
   analyzed here. It has since shrunk but is still substantial. Children
   born in the year 2010 can expect that their lifetime private consumption
   will be 22\% larger than their parents and their consumption of public
   goods 78\% larger. Both private and public consumption have increased
   substantially from one generation to the next but public consumption has
   grown faster. The article also estimates the value of the Icelandic
   economy based on its ability to create goods and services and finds that
   it was 51.100 billion ISK in the year 2011. That is sixty times greater
   than in the year 1870.},

Abstract = {Democratic theory assumes that successful democratic representation will
   create close ideological congruence between citizens and their
   governments. The success of different types of election rules in
   creating such congruence is an ongoing target of political science
   research. As often in political science, a widely demonstrated empirical
   finding, the greater congruence associated with proportional
   representation election rules, has ceased to hold. I suggest that
   systematically taking account in our theories of conditional effects of
   local context can often provide a remedy. The systematic incorporation
   of levels of political party polarization into theory of election laws
   and ideological congruence extended the temporal and spatial range of
   the theory. Data from the Comparative Manifesto research program and the
   Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES) research program are used
   to test the revised theory empirically. Suggestions for generalizing our
   theories of political context are offered. The results of this research
   continue the interactions between substantive research, ongoing
   political events, and the great normative issues of representation and
   democracy.},

Abstract = {This article introduces a modified and updated version of the
   authoritarian regime type dataset first introduced by Hadenius and
   Teorell. The basic logic and merits of this dataset is presented,
   previously published criticism of the index is addressed and practical
   advice for potential users is provided. The dataset is also compared
   theoretically and empirically with the datasets provided by Cheibub et
   al., and Geddes et al. It is argued that the choice of dataset is likely
   to have a substantial effect on the results of empirical research. The
   different datasets all have their respective strengths and weaknesses.
   However, our typology of authoritarianism distinguishes itself from the
   alternative categorisations in that it recognises the heterogeneous
   character of electoral regimes and provides a category corresponding to
   the theoretically interesting class of `electoral authoritarian'
   regimes.},

   advantage over McCain had a significant and positive relationship with

Abstract = {Little is known about comparative innovations in question time procedure
   in Northern Ireland. This research provides an exploratory analysis of
   1,999 oral questions to the First Minister and Deputy First Minister,
   and 31,664 questions posed to other ministers in the four legislative
   sessions from 2007 to 2011. The theoretical framework focuses on how the
   practice of parliamentary questions reflects the consociational model of
   governance taking shape in the Stormont Assembly. The study accentuates
   a decline in the number of questions posed to the dual executive and
   other ministers over time a dynamic that represents a purposeful effort
   on the part of the Assembly to decrease the number of questions through
   procedural reform, with the objective of obtaining more substantive
   answers. The findings also show that parliamentary questions on economic
   issues increased, but community issues remained a dominant policy
   concern across time. Finally, the analysis shows substantive responses
   were the norm among both the First Minister and Deputy First Minister.
   Responses by ministers with portfolio were more variable.},

Abstract = {``The Rite of Spring{''} is a key work in the history of music and
   dance. Directed by Sergei Diaghilev, the impresario of the Ballets
   Russes, a small group of exceedingly talented and progressive Russians
   revolutionised the conventional art forms. The polytonal dissonance of
   the music of Igor Stravinsky, Vaslav Nijinsky's bold choreography, and
   the set designed by Slavic folk art specialist Nicholas Roerich
   anticipated much of what ultimately prevailed only towards the end of
   the 20th century. Nevertheless, at its premiere in the Theatre des
   Champs-Elys es on 29 May 1913, the ballet was a scandal. What was the
   source of this eclat?},

Abstract = {During the East-West conflict, representatives of the theory of
   totalitarianism and supporters of development and modernisation theories
   were irreconcilable. For various reasons, both overrated the ability of

   theories were supposed to explain the consolidation of democratic
   systems. However, these did not consolidate. Today, political science
   research on Eastern Europe is seeking suitable concepts in order to
   determine the typical characteristics of such different forms of
   government and types of regime as the Czech Republic and Turkmenistan.},

Abstract = {The article discusses the development of Goebbels' Russophile views
   emerged from his fascination with the Russian literature, especially the
   works by F.Dostoevsky. Relying on the diaries of the future Nazi
   propaganda chief, S.Allenov traces the transformation of Goebbels' ideas
   borrowed from the religious and ethical preach of Dostoevsky's
   ``Christian socialism{''} into the political ideology of national
   socialism demonstrating the pattern of similarity between the system of
   masses manipulation constructed by Goebbels thereafter with the utopias
   that were well-known to him, i.e. Shigalevschina and the Grand
   Inquisitor's Kingdom. According to the author's conclusion, the young
   Goebbels' initial hatred for the liberal West facilitated not only his
   perception of Russia's image borrowed from the literature as an antipode
   of the ``demising{''} Europe, but also his comprehension in the
   Germanized form of the Russian myth about the spiritually revived people
   that is soldered together by the bonds of the highest order and destined
   for the world leadership.},

Title = {The March 22, 2012 Coup in Mali: Lessons and Implications for Democracy
   in the West Africa Subregion in the Wave of Transnational Terrorism},
Journal = {DEMOCRACY \& SECURITY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Pages = {383-397},
Abstract = {This article does not justify or sanction ascension to political power
   through coup d'etat. Neither does it rationalize the March 22, 2012
   action of the coup-makers in Mali. It subscribes to the popular notion
   that military regimes are an aberration and an anachronistic system of
   government. It argues, however, that beyond the unpopularity of military
   regimes, the coup in Mali should be looked at holistically, taking into
   cognizance the chain of events that ultimately culminated in the action
   by the Captain Amadou Sanogo-led Committee for the Re-establishment of
   Democracy and the Restoration of the State. It submits that looking at
   the problem merely from the point of view of the doctrine of military
   subordination to civil political authorities will obstruct an
   opportunity to address the salient and underlying factors that caused
   the crisis in Mali as well as other countries of the subregion grappling
   with similar problems. It notes the reality of political Islam in the
   Maghreb and Sahel regions and its insidious growth into the West Africa
   subregion and contends that the event in Mali exposes the vulnerability
   of the West Africa subregion to Islamic fundamentalism-and signals a
   major threat not only to the stability of the countries of the subregion
   but also its democratization process as it poses great danger not only
   for democracy in the subregion but its consolidation.},

Abstract = {The text wants to study how the political parity between men and women
   is adopted in some of the main democratic systems. In order to it, we
   will follow a classic structure, the one that divides those in
   common-law models, and continental-law models, paying special attention
   to the United States of America, the United Kingdom, Belgium, France,
   Italy, Sweden, Norway and Denmark. To accomplish the issue, it will be
   shown some data of the feminine presence in Parliaments, the principal
   reasons of it, and the constitutional debates produced due to the
   promotional measures given. It finishes with a core-conclusion, which
   sets out that the political parties are the main factor of the change,
   but maybe also of the backwards steps observed.},

   countries failed to reach a consensus on building a cooperative security

   for taking into account the new dimension of risks along with the
   traditional dimension of threats, the article reviews the insecurity
   factors of the Mediterranean region and the lesson learned in the
   security dialogue of the Barcelona Process. Some proposals about
   rehearsing that dialogue are advanced in the concluding section.},

Abstract = {This article proposes a new approach to hegemony, recast as a tool to
   capture the power of ideas at the systemic level. Hegemony is
   conceptualized as a condition in which a set of ideas is accepted by
   political actors with conflicting interests and as the outcome of a
   process of discursive interaction. Three types of ideational
   contestation are distinguished-confrontation, configuration and
   consistency: hegemony emerges as contestation shifts between these
   forms. This approach is elaborated through an analysis of key
   affirmative action policy debates in Malaysia between 1955 and 2010. We
   show that hegemony depends in part upon the content of ideas; that once
   ideas become hegemonic they are less liable to radical change; and that
   ideational hegemony constrains not just `subaltern' groups but also
   powerful actors. In Malaysia we show the establishment of a hegemonic
   set of ideas effectively `locked in' dominant elites, even as they
   sought to change affirmative action policy.},

Abstract = {In the premises, the author analyses how the different historiographical
   trends concerning the Atlantic world have reduced the centrality of the
   State, and recent researches which focused on the processes of
   State-building and on the financial revolutions between the Seventeenth
   and the Nineteenth centuries. Within this frame, the essay outlines an
   Atlantic history of the foundation of the U.S. through a reading of the
   Report on Public Credit (1782) of Robert Morris, Superintendent of
   Finances, and some writings of Alexander Hamilton, Secretary of the
   Treasury. The author argues that the institution of public debt and the
   foundation of the national bank constituted an adequate response not
   only to the need of State which characterized European history, but also
   to the capitalistic practices which marked European economies. The
   author underlines the continuity between the processes of State-building
   and the transition to capitalism in Europe and America in the age of the
   democratic revolutions.},

Abstract = {This essay argues that the recurrent controversies surrounding the
   violation of user privacy on social networks are better understood as
   instances of struggle against exploitation. To make this argument the
   author revisits Marx's concept of ``so-called primitive accumulation,''
   offers a more nuanced interpretation of the political economy of Web
   2.0, and applies Hardt and Negri's concept of biopolitical exploitation
   to a form of labor never considered by the original authors. Drawing on
   interviews with members of the photo-sharing website Flickr.com, the
   article argues that privacy and social networks are conceptually
   oxymoronic in that adherence to the principles of the former would
   render pointless the purposes and functionality of the latter. The
   privacy discourse has thus far dominated explanations of ``user''
   uproar. The main purpose of this article, then, is to open new cognitive
   spaces untainted by the privacy debate so as to encourage further
   reflection, argumentation, and political action},

Abstract = {Do institutions of citizenship shape public opinion among Muslims in the
   West? Pitched debates about the future of multiculturalism give strong
   theoretical reason to think that institutions would cause cross-national
   variation in minority opinion. Institutions set rules for national
   integration and communal recognition and send signals regarding social
   views of diversity. Testing these theorised links, however, requires two
   steps. First, careful conceptualisation of citizenship, both in
   individual and communal dimensions, categorises states' citizenship
   regimes. Second, unique cross-national polling of Muslim minorities in
   France, Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States permits
   analysis of the relationship between institutions and minority political
   attitudes. Findings demonstrate strong institutional effects on
   attitudes. However, these effects vary depending on the question asked.
   Institutions impact on cross-national variation in opinion regarding
   national identification and women's place in society. There is no
   evidence of institutional roots of support for suicide terrorism.},

Abstract = {This article aims to describe the identity forms in the Tachira
   (Venezuela) - North Santander (Colombia) border region. The research
   design comes from the qualitative methodology and adopts the Grounded
   Theory as method to be followed. It uses sampling theory in combination
   with the saturated theory to analyze the interviews of a series of
   informants located at both sides of the international border. A review
   of the literature on identity and identity forms was carried out,
   contemplating the contributions of various scientific disciplines. The
   data are analyzed in following theoretical coding (open, axial and
   selective) and analytic induction, to reveal emerging concepts and
   reveal their links. The results show commonalities and divergent forms
   of identity: personal identity (self-perception elements, relationships,
   double identity and identity differentiation), border identity (the
   region is perceived as different from the rest) and national identity
   (History, awareness of the border line, and symbols) coexist in the
   inhabitants of border. The attitudinal aspects show the acceptance and
   rejection of the performance of the major institutions in the border
   dynamics. The identity forms found in the region confirm the findings of
   studies on identity and borders, although it should be noted that the
   experience of the international boundary fails to blur national
   stereotyped perceptions of the other.},

Title = {National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme of India: Some Conceptual
   Problems},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL CRITICAL THOUGHT},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {3},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-19},
Abstract = {The need for containment of ``surplus population,{''} deployment of
   untapped resources and ensuring ``right to work{''} have induced the
   developing world to take up programmes like the National Rural
   Employment Guarantee Scheme in India. However, contrary to the proposed
   target of short-and long-run employment generation outside the circuit
   of big capital, the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, in fact,
   could act as an instrument for capital accumulation itself by helping in
   direct transfer of resources or in diversification towards
   ``market-oriented{''} resource use. Labour would be used in the initial
   rounds, but later on a process of accumulation and displacement could be
   engendered. Researchers also criticize the National Rural Employment
   Guarantee Scheme from the perspective of government budget management.
   However, we argue that government budget constraint and consequently,
   demand-side conflict between the National Rural Employment Guarantee
   Scheme and the non-National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme employment
   is not so important; there is rather a significant supply-side
   trade-off. Furthermore, political mobilization of people is the key for
   effective pro-poor utilization of the National Rural Employment
   Guarantee Scheme in the short and long run, consistent with local
   traits, needs and resources. But bureaucracy and the so called state
   institutions of decentralization are practising a variety of
   patron-client relationships vis-a-vis the commoners and there is no
   serious attempt by the established political parties-be it left or
   right-to mobilize people's voice.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CIVIL SOCIETY},

Volume = {9},
Number = {2},
Pages = {212-224},
Abstract = {Within the context of the ecological crisis and technocratic drift of
   western nations whose overarching goal is economic growth, a plea for
   degrowth is emerging. In this essay, the concept of degrowth is adopted
   as an interpretative frame to describe a variety of forms of grassroots
   activism, mainly across crisis-ridden Europe. Particular attention is
   devoted to the distinction between forms of alternative activism that
   respect conventional societal norms and forms of resistance that
   fundamentally reject some of the key tenets of contemporary market
   economies. These two forms of grassroots mobilization, whose actors we
   define, respectively, as `civil' and `uncivil', constitute different
   (albeit perhaps complementary) imaginaries emerging out of the civil
   society arena, thus likely to lead to a profound reconsideration of
   authority (and legitimacy). The integration of both dimensions may
   contribute to the construction of a new degrowth society.},

Title = {The rhetoric of `terrorism' and the evolution of a counterterrorist
   state in Nepal},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE PEACE \& SECURITY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {25},
Number = {2},
Pages = {159-174},
Abstract = {This paper examines the global `war on terror' (WOT) and the case of
   Nepal. Nepal shifted in its identity from being neutral and uninvolved
   in global affairs prior to 2001, to being part of the global WOT.
   Nepal's enactment of anti-terrorism legislation in 2001 helped establish
   its new `counterterrorist' identity, while affixing the `terrorist'
   label to Maoist rebels that the state was fighting. This allowed
   regional and global actors to view the Nepali state's actions against
   Maoist rebels as `counterterrorist'. The period of November 2001 when
   the first Nepali antiterrorism legislation was established and the
   February 2005 takeover of the state by the (then) king are the main
   focus of this paper. The goal here is not to discuss whether the Maoists
   were (or were not) `really' terrorist; instead, the task is to note how
   the label of `terrorism' was used in Nepal to legitimate
   `counterterrorism' operations by the state. The article argues that the
   state's use of the `war on terror' rhetoric specifically during these
   two events legitimated repressive actions against its own citizens as
   countering `terrorism'. This had the effect of legitimating different
   types of states-an elected democracy and a monarchist state. At the same
   time, however, the use of `terrorism' rhetoric by the state in 2005 was
   challenged by local actors, thus indicating the instability of the
   meanings of `terrorism' and `counterterrorism'.},

Abstract = {In his novel War and Peace (1868/69), Leo Tolstoy showed how the events
   of the War of 1812 illuminated the social contradictions within Russia
   and the epochal break throughout Europe, something he vividly depicted
   on the basis of four families. In his television adaptation of Tolstoy's
   novel (2007), Robert Dornhelm was less concerned with the tension
   between personal destinies and great history than with the
   transformation of the novel into a (globalised) melodrama, in which the
   private realm takes centre stage and with it completely commonplace
   feelings such as love, hope, or sadness.},

Abstract = {Among political scientists, not only is it uncontroversial to say that
   judges seek to etch their political values into law; it would be near
   heresy to suggest otherwise. And yet this article does just that because
   research conducted by scholars (mostly outside of political science) has
   demonstrated that the policy goal is not the only motivation; it may not
   even be dominant for many judges. The evidence is now so strong that it
   poses a serious challenge to the extremely (un) realist(ic) conception
   of judicial behavior that has dominated the study of law and legal
   institutions for generations. In addition to reviewing this evidence, we
   offer a more realistic conception of judicial motivations and suggest
   how different approaches to the study of courts can contribute to this
   new avenue of research.},

Abstract = {Analyses of voting in European Union referendums typically distinguish
   between second-order effects and the impact of substantive issues. In
   order to explain change in referendum outcome, two types of substantive
   issues are distinguished in this article. Focusing on Irish voting in
   the Lisbon Treaty referendums and using data from post-referendum
   surveys, it is found that perceptions of treaty implications outperform
   underlying attitudes to EU integration in predicting vote choice at both
   referendums, and perceptions of treaty implications are strong
   predictors of vote change between the referendums. The findings have
   broadly positive implications for normative assessments of the
   usefulness of direct democracy as a tool for legitimising regional
   integration advance.},

Title = {Time: Initial Approaches between Physics and the Sociological Thought of

Abstract = {The fundamental concept of time used by Physics was built by Galileo,
   through the observation of the apparent pendulum isochronism and
   establishing the possibility of using an instrument as a generator of
   temporal intervals to investigate natural phenomena occurring around
   them. At that time, a religious conception of time was dominant:
   according to this, the celestial objects, infallible and without the
   imperfections of the common world, dictated the temporal evolution of
   every phenomena. Thanks to Galileo, we are able to measure time and,
   consequently, we started to measure the world. With Newton, we return to
   a divine conception of time: evolution is an absolute space and time
   which can be understood as a divine sensation. The absolute time
   permeates everything that happens in our universe; it does not matter
   where the clock is because it is always capable of measuring uniformly
   time intervals. The three-dimensional space is Euclidean, meanwhile time
   is completely independent. For Elias, beyond the three physical and
   classical dimensions, it is needed to add are two other dimensions which
   are built in the context of human interdependency, namely, time and
   symbol. Time is an relevant dimension of Elias thought, time as an
   experience of duration, reference, and as a measurable change; time,
   simultaneously, as a physical and social entity. Clocks play a key role
   in the way we investigate the world and as instruments of time
   measurement produce a new time dimensions. But they are not built just
   for this purpose; their accuracy is closely related to the great
   voyages. Accuracy in time measurement provides a more exact position of
   a ship's longitude on the globe. With Einstein, this absolute
   synchronicity of two clocks loses its meaning: from this moment, clocks
   measure different time intervals according to their location and spatial
   movement. The time is ``spatialized{''} and space-time is now a locating
   system of any event in our universe. The purpose of this article is to
   explore the possibilities of a dialogue on concepts of time, between a
   natural science, Physics, and the multiple faces offered by figurational
   approach.},

Title = {The three pillars of stability: legitimation, repression, and

Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},

Abstract = {Why do some autocracies remain stable while others collapse? This
   article presents a theoretical framework that seeks to explain the
   longevity of autocracies by referring to three pillars of stability:
   legitimation, repression, and co-optation. These three causal factors
   are derived by distilling and synthesizing the main arguments of classic
   and more recent research efforts. Particular emphasis is paid to
   re-incorporate legitimation in the explanation of stable autocracies.
   The article conceptionalizes the three pillars and discusses methods of
   concrete measurement. It then moves on to explain the stabilization
   process. How do these pillars develop their stabilizing effect? It is
   argued that reinforcement processes take place both within and between
   the pillars. They take the form of exogenous reinforcement,
   self-reinforcement, and reciprocal reinforcement. To illustrate the
   inner logic of these processes, I draw on empirical examples. I also
   state what we would need to observe empirically and how we can approach
   the three pillars methodically. A theoretical framework of this nature
   has two advantages: it is able to take the complexity of autocratic
   regimes into account while remaining parsimonious enough to be
   applicable to all autocratic regimes, irrespective of their subtype; and
   it integrates a static view to explain stability, with the emphasis on
   the underlying stabilization mechanisms and facilitates within-case and
   cross-case comparisons.},

Abstract = {The crises and decline of liberal institutions left a political vacuum,
   which provided the opportunity for political Islam to organize and
   mobilize the population. Once in power, the forces of Islam formulated a
   new ideology, velayat-e faqih, which claimed that every individual
   required religious guardianship. Following this ideology, the new regime
   structured government in such a way that it emphasized the divine
   clerical-rights of the religious leaders, and the people's authority and
   rights (the latter becoming increasingly symbolic). Although the new
   constitution established a unicameral parliament, presided by an elected
   president, the overwhelming power was situated in the office of the
   Supreme Leader. Merely a decade after the revolution, Iran's political
   system began experiencing a disintegration of popular sovereignty and
   ongoing crises of legitimacy.},

Abstract = {The EU has been gradually increasing its emphasis on a common approach
   to energy security among its members in the last couple of years, and
   these member states have had to take this tendency into account when
   developing their own approach to energy policy. Additionally, both EU
   and its members have been forced to react to several challenges
   regarding energy security. Reactions and tendencies within energy
   policies can be assessed on the basis of theoretical approaches that can
   not only clarify reasons for implementing specific tools and procedures,
   but also can help to anticipate future development.
   This article is focused on the energy policy of the Czech Republic and
   the European Union from the perspectives of strategic as well as
   market-oriented approaches, which are the two dominant theoretical
   approaches in this field of study. The aim is to identify how these
   approaches are reflected in policy documents on both levels during the
   selected period of time (2004-2012) and what it means in terms of energy
   policy coordination within the EU.},

Abstract = {This article examines a particular side of the logics that may have
   contributed to the broken allegiances to the established order that
   characterized critical social engagements in the 1968 era in France.
   Through the lens of a historically rooted sociology of commitment
   attentive to the protagonists' emotions, the article analyses the role
   of anger and the desire for revenge felt by a particular fraction of the
   French post-war generation to shed light on the logics that gave way to
   their ``communist revolutionary{''} affiliation. Personal histories, and
   particularly the vast presence within their ranks of persons from Jewish
   background whose families were directly affected by the genocide of the
   Second World War, was especially crucial. Based upon oral, written and
   iconographic sources, the paper studies the politicization process and
   the conditions that led to such commitment. The research demonstrates
   that the conversion of anger into agency is the result of a peculiar mix
   of embodied dispositions to anger and desire for retaliation, a context
   favourable to the externalization of the violence suffered by the group,
   and a politically organized structure.},

Abstract = {Britain began to plan for the occupation and reconstruction of Germany
   following the end of the Second World War as early as 1944. However,
   such was the devastation as a result of intensive fighting that went all
   the way to Berlin that these plans were unsuited to the reality on the
   ground in May 1945. Christopher Knowles explores the first four years of
   ` benevolent occupation' in the British zone under the leadership of
   Field Marshal Montgomery and his successors, noting that positive effect
   was more likely where they created the conditions for the German people
   to act for themselves, rather than imposing solutions by force or
   decree.},

Abstract = {The analysis of regional cooperation in the non-Western world is
   attracting increasing attention of IR scholars. The SCO in this respect
   represents a unique case. It unites two major powers in Eurasia - Russia
   and China - and four Central Asian states within one regional
   cooperation framework. All the members share common concerns about
   traditional and non-traditional security threats. This perception
   defines a reasonable necessity to cooperate. However the assessments of
   the cooperation's practical dimension vary significantly among
   researchers in Russia, China, India and Western countries. Therefore the
   paper seeks to analyze the key diverging lines in the SCO research
   discourse. The paper argues that the differences in the research
   positions are mainly driven by the previous experience of regional or
   quasi-regional cooperation of the mentioned actors (Russia, China,
   India, the USA and the EU) and their current political, economic and
   security aims in cooperation with Central Asian states.},

Abstract = {This study is an attempt to outline some initial insights into the
   practice of PA professionals in the Czech Republic. The main goal of our
   research study was to describe and analyze the state of the field of
   public affairs (PA).
   Our main research focus thus was to describe the current situation and
   build a solid background of the profession and emerging field for
   further research: first, we characterize professionals working in the
   field (their professional background, education, income and goals).
   Next, we attempt to define the main issues they deal with professionally
   (such as politics, lobbying, the energy sector, etc.). This is followed
   by a description of the market itself and the level to which it is
   institutionalized. Finally, we attempt to analyze how PA as a field is
   understood and perceived by domestic and foreign professionals working
   in the Czech Republic. In our conclusion, we also state openly a few
   challenges we encountered during our research and set goals for future
   research.},

Abstract = {We investigate whether uranium, similar to other resources, is
   associated with armed conflicts. The analysis uses grid cells in Africa
   to test this hypothesis. Results from logistic regressions reveal that
   uranium operations are not an independent conflict risk; however, it is
   significantly linked to local conflict events when interacting with
   ethnic exclusion. The analysis is supplemented by process tracing in
   four countries, where armed conflict broke out after uranium operations
   started (DR Congo, Central African Republic, Niger and South Africa). We
   find substantial evidence for a link only in the case of Niger. Our
   results suggest that uranium promotes intrastate conflict only under
   specific circumstances.},

Abstract = {The Netherlands epitomizes a parliamentary regime with a fragmented
   party system thus raising issues of stability and effectiveness. These
   issues have been exacerbated by the pillarization of Dutch society unity
   into five mutually isolated sub-cultures each with one or more political
   parties. The Dutch electoral scheme of a form of proportional
   representation permitted the development of a fragmented party system
   rendering the formation of a governing coalition a daunting task. The
   pillarization of Dutch society has weakened leading to the emergence of
   a new set of parties concerned with issues of identity. A Muslim
   sub-culture that resisted assimilation was perceived to be an
   existential threat. This weakened the social and political tolerance for
   which the Dutch are famed.},

Title = {`Devoir de memoire': The post-colonial path of a post-national memory in
   France A study of the development of the `Taubira law'},
Journal = {NATIONAL IDENTITIES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Pages = {239-256},
Abstract = {The expression `devoir de memoire' ('duty to remember') started to be
   commonly used in the French political discourse in the French political
   discourse in the 1990s, thanks to a reconfiguration of the `national
   narrative'. It implied two new obligations for the French state: to
   commemorate the memory of the victims for which France was acknowledging
   its responsibility (Jewish deportees during the Vichy Regime), and the
   recognition of a community (the Jewish one) victim of genocide. This new
   political contract also offers one paradigm for post-colonial memories
   as people sought, at the end of the 1990s, an official recognition of
   crimes against humanity such as slavery or colonization. These demands
   were elaborated and negotiated by new actors, carriers of these
   memories, by means of socialization with the expression `devoir de
   memoire'. Through an exploration of this ritual of apology in France,
   specifically on how the `Taubira law' on slavery was created and passed
   (1998-2001), this text intends to show how the use of the `devoir de
   memoire' led to interactions between different collectivities, mentioned
   as a `speech act' meant to modify social relations through the official
   understanding of the national past.},

Pages = {201-217},
Abstract = {This article will examine irrationality in relation to the concept of
   resistance. Is there such a thing as an irrational resistance? While one
   tendency has been to irrationalise the `other' and their resistance in
   order to construct a subaltern identity position, within the social
   sciences, an opposing tendency can also be identified; there is a trend
   to try to rationalise what seems to be people's irrational behaviours.
   In this article, however, we will take a different stance by arguing
   that resistance is generally both irrational and rational depending on
   its relation to power.},

Title = {Panebianco's Organizational Model and its Applicability on the
   Transformation of Communist Parties in the West Europe},
Journal = {POLITOLOGICKY CASOPIS-CZECH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Number = {3},
Pages = {282-298},
Abstract = {The paper deals with the organizational model of political parties
   created by Italian political scientist Angelo Panebianco. For
   presentation of this, outside Italian academic discourse, an
   ``unknown{''} model is necessary to briefly describe the whole
   organizational theory and to introduce the review of this model. After
   that we examine the applicability of Panebianco's scheme on the
   structural transformation of communist political parties at the end of
   1980s. This suitability will be measured on the case example of the
   Italian Communist Party (PCI). The PCI was historically the strongest
   and most influential communist party outside the Soviet bloc and that is
   why it is convenient to apply the organizational model to the
   organizational changes of the PCI during its transformation. We also
   define five main criteria of these changes and their compatibility with
   the Panebianco's model. Thus the main aim of this paper is to prove the
   suitability of the organizational model not only to the structural
   transformation of the Italian communists but using this case example
   also to the universal transformation of the communist parties in the
   western world.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the conflict-fuelling effects of counterinsurgency
   on civil war in Peru (1980-1995) and Syria (2011-2012). Despite
   different escalation onsets, in both cases the state's response to the
   increasingly armed opposition intensified and protracted the conflict.
   The comparative analysis reveals five interdependent factors that were
   particularly influential in that regard: the state's denial of demands
   by certain segments of society; indiscriminate police and military
   repression; the impunity of state forces; and the expansion of non-state
   armed groups driven by radical agendas. The research has implications
   that connect research on terrorism with peace and conflict studies:
   first, the more the opposition's demands were responded to by
   disproportionate repression, the more likely became the option of armed
   insurgency. Second, due to the state's superior military resources, the
   insurgent groups increasingly applied terrorist operations. Third, at
   least in the case of Peru, the terrorist tactics put the state on the
   edge of defeat. However, the adjustment of the counterinsurgency
   strategy to a more bottom-up approach eventually gained the state the
   upper hand. The article ends with controversial reflection on how far
   the recent violence intensification by Syrian insurgents justifies the
   end; that is, regime change.},

Abstract = {The contemporary New Zealand environmental movement emerged in the 1960s
   to challenge large-scale development projects, represented by the `Save
   Manapouri' campaign. The movement grew in the 1970s and 1980s before
   subsequently declining in scale, reflecting partial success with the
   institutionalization of environmental issues. Concurrent with
   institutionalization and declining levels of activism has been growth in
   the number and range of community-based environmental groups. This
   article draws on interviews conducted with activists and officials to
   develop an understanding of the relationship between these trends. The
   aim is to (1) outline the factors that have shaped the character of the
   New Zealand environmental movement and (2) determine how the movement
   has evolved in relation to external pressures. The findings suggest that
   although the environmental movement is less visible than in earlier
   periods, it retains an important position, with latent potential for
   future mobilization.},

Abstract = {Carbon offsets produced from terrestrial (land-based) emissions
   reduction projects are a contested frontier of carbon market expansion.
   Experiments in legislating for and producing terrestrial offsets that
   come under the title REDD+ have met heated opposition. However, a
   political consensus about the desirability and feasibility of carbon
   offsets from avoided deforestation and various land-management practices
   has slowly emerged. How do terrestrial carbon offsets gain legitimacy in
   the face of contestation and compelling evidence that creating carbon
   commodities from land ecosystems is an elusive commodity fiction? It
   seems that a quiet compromise is emerging over the (re-)commodification
   of land through carbon trading vis-a-vis the broader process of
   legitimating marketized climate policy. This paper offers a
   political-economic analysis of state-led efforts to legitimate a market
   for land carbon sinks in Australia and the Asia-Pacific region. The
   dynamics of legitimation and contestation play out as an iterative
   `double movement'.},

Abstract = {This paper studies the causal effect of electoral systems on the
   performance of clientelistic vs. programmatic parties. We argue that,
   contrary to majoritarian systems, proportional systems disfavor
   clientelistic parties as voters can hardly be pivotal for electing their
   local patron. We test this insight using data from local elections in
   Morocco from 2003 and 2009. We use a regression discontinuity approach
   exploiting the fact that the law stipulates a population threshold below
   which the system is majoritarian and above which it is proportional.
   Results show a differential causal effect of proportional systems on
   programmatic and clientelistic parties: Clientelistic parties halve
   their seats and the programmatic party doubles them when crossing the
   threshold of proportionality. An important caveat is that the sample
   size around the threshold being relatively small, some coefficients are
   estimated relatively imprecisely. Fixed effects estimates exploiting a
   change in threshold from 2003 to 2009 yield similar results.},

Abstract = {Non voting has been a problem of concern for political life in
   Argentina, as well as for the international studies on the subject. In
   early stages of Argentina political history, the press and the political
   leadership were worried about the possibility that the ``best people{''}
   presumably away from civic life-would not go to the ballot places. For
   earlier stages of our electoral history, Canton and Jorrat rejected the
   impressionist view that in the city of Buenos Aires ``the best
   people{''} did not vote. Lijphart was equally worried about this type of
   problems, pointing out that empirical eviden-ce showed positive
   correlations between socioeconomic levels and turnout. Some of these
   concerns might have led to introduce compulsory voting in Argentina. In
   the present work we extend our research using individual level data,
   from a 2007 national survey of 3300 cases, 18 years and older. Based on
   logistic regression equations, we explore the relationship between non
   voting and classical socio- demographic variables (sex, age, education),
   for the 1995, 1999, and 2003 presidential elections. As well, we explore
   the comparative explanatory importance of strategic variables in the non
   voting literature, such as electoral tradition, ideological self-
   position, social values (materialism), social class, etc. An additional
   final look is offered, using aggregate data from the 2009 representative
   elections in Buenos Aires City. Our results, either from descriptive
   analyzes and logistic regressions from national survey data, or from
   cero order correlations and multiple regressions from aggregate data of
   Buenos Aires City, seem to show the absence of clear, systematic social
   clivages, by the end of the xx century and beginnings of the xxi
   century. This might support Lijphart position, in the sense that
   compulsory voting could be a mechanism to promote an almost universal
   right to suffrage.},

   played the role of an agent, M. Sakaeva shows that, although state and
   private business were extremely interested in the balanced interaction,
   the internal instability of the positions reconciliation system
   exacerbated by the steps of one of the strongest business players that
   put the ruling elite in danger, led to the state re-orientation towards
   dominance strategy.},

Abstract = {Moral barriers against inflicting death and suffering on other people is
   probably what keeps most people from engaging in terrorism, even if they
   may hold serious grievances. Basic upbringing, socialisation and
   education are the principal ways such norms are internalised among
   children and young people. Parents, teachers and other moral authorities
   are main preventive actors but peers and other role models may
   increasingly play leading roles in forming attitudes. Although norms and
   moral values is probably the most effective barrier against
   participation in terrorism and violence, some individuals have few
   scruples against causing suffering to others. Even among ``normal
   people{''} morality is a fragile barrier which may crumble under certain
   circumstances. Nevertheless, building and maintaining such norms is one
   of the most important strategies for preventing terrorism.},

Abstract = {This essay argues that Stephen Resnick and Richard Wolff have conflated
   two distinct definitions of ``overdetermination.'' In the first,
   overdetermination describes a worldview wherein all entities and
   processes (including ``theory'') are constituted by all other processes.
   In the second, ``overdetermination'' describes a worldview wherein all
   entities and processes (again, including ``theory'') are caused by all
   other processes. An implication of the former view is that the essence
   of an entity cannot simply be read off of its individual existence, but
   is a function of its relations with all other entities. An implication
   of the latter view is that outcomes cannot be predicted in advance,
   regardless of the information given ex ante. The present essay argues
   that the second view does not necessarily follow from the first. Failure
   to distinguish between the two results from a confusion between an
   ability we (sometimes) have-the ability to predict events-and a
   metaphysical interpretation of that ability-the claim that entities have
   essences independently of one another},

   many components of the project (idea of universal solidarity, change of
   women social status, etc.) might have looked attractive for a
   representative of the early industrial society, its historical task was
   different - it was intended to create a social mechanism for isolating
   an individual from other equal actors, depriving him/her of the prospect
   of personal autonomy and subordinating him/her to the vertical
   structures of totalitarian control.},

   active Internet users, young German East Europeans are rather hesitant
   about using the Internet for political purposes. Statistical models show
   that young German Turks `political Internet use is motivated by
   grievances, while young German East Europeans' political Internet use is
   motivated by sentimental pessimism and world-weariness.},

Title = {The end of the flexicurity model in front of the resilience of national

Journal = {POLITIQUE EUROPEENNE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {42},

Pages = {72-95},
Abstract = {Since the 1990s, under the influence of the Organisation for Economic
   Cooperation and Development (OECD) and strategies developed at the EU
   level, the idea of ``flexicurity{''} had become the dominant paradigm of
   labour market policies. However, the crisis has led to question the
   appropriateness of this policy paradigm in times of economic recession.
   Since 2008, social partners and policy-makers have been facing a new
   agenda of fighting the employment crisis all across Europe. The
   comparative study of negotiated policies in Germany, France and Italy
   shows the limited scope of europeanisation and the resilience of
   national models in this domain. We look into the stances of trade unions
   and employers organisations, their practice of social dialogue and
   collective bargaining and the use of relevant policy instruments. This
   article thereby outlines three paths of reconfiguration of industrial
   relations in the face of the crisis, and provides evidence of three
   different ways in which domestic actors adapt the idea of flexicurity to
   the context of the crisis.},

   to reap political credit for themselves. However, a window is open in
   2013 for continuing development in Taiwan, provided all political forces
   work together.},

Abstract = {Is democracy a requirement of justice or an instrument for realizing it?
   This article argues that the correct answer to this question depends on
   the background circumstances against which democracy is defended. In the
   presence of thin reasonable disagreement about justice, we should value
   democracy only instrumentally ( if at all); in the presence of thick
   reasonable disagreement about justice, we should value it also
   intrinsically, as a necessary demand of justice. Since the latter type
   of disagreement is pervasive in real-world politics, the conclusion is
   that theories of justice designed for our world should be centrally
   concerned with democracy.},

Abstract = {As the first African-American nominee for president of a major political
   party, Barack Obama's campaign and ultimate victory reminded voters,
   scholars, pundits, and the press of the centrality of race in American
   political life. Speculation by observers of all types centered around
   the potential impact of race as an individual psychological prejudice
   and/or as a geographic/contextual factor. These two themes parallel
   different leading scholarly treatments of race and racism in the USA.
   Rather than choose one theme or the other, in this paper, we bring both
   traditions together in a unified analysis of white voter response to
   Obama. We find strong evidence that the level of prejudice toward
   African-Americans held by whites affected their evaluations of Obama as
   well as their probability of voting for him. In contrast, we find little
   evidence that whites responded to the racial context of their immediate
   geographic environment.},

Title = {``Union Regimes{''}:Discipline and Punish in Three Indian Maritime Trade
   Unions},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL CRITICAL THOUGHT},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {3},
Number = {1},
Pages = {43-58},
Abstract = {This critical study stands at the intersection of two prominent themes
   within the studies of industrial relations and the sociology of labour
   respectively, namely, the decline, renewal, and transformation of trade
   unionism in the context of neoliberal globalization on the one hand, and
   labour process theories pertaining specifically to labour
   discipline/control on the other. Illustrated with ethnographic snapshots
   of three prominent maritime trade unions in India, this paper
   conceptualizes the ``union regime{''}-a labour disciplinary regime based
   on the trade union's perceptual and attitudinal conditioning of its
   members, which ends chiefly in benefiting the employers and the unions.
   Furthermore, the paper describes the specific mechanisms of union
   disciplining from a Foucauldian theoretical perspective. The complicity
   of trade unions in the ``discipline and punish{''} of the very workers
   that they represent leads to the alarming speculation that, at the
   perplexing crossroads of transformation, trade unionism is at the risk
   of becoming an extension of the ideological arsenal of global
   capitalism.},

Journal = {ASIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {21},
Number = {2},
Pages = {126-147},
Abstract = {The mass media in democracies plays an important role in portraying key
   policy debates and viewpoints, ultimately shaping how citizens and
   political actors understand policy problems. How diverse are the policy
   perspectives represented in the news? Research in comparative political
   communication typically points to two ways through which pluralism is
   maintained in the news coverage of policy debates-internally and
   externally. Using 1,341 Dong-A and 1,205 Hankyoreh Daily front-page
   newspaper stories published in Korea in the year 2008, this article
   examines the circumstances under which internal and external pluralism
   in the news is limited in a democratic media system. Specifically, the
   article argues that a unique newsgathering process relying heavily on
   government sources for policy-relevant information, as well as
   relatively weak and unstable ties between news outlets and
   political/social organizations significantly restrict the diversity of
   voices appearing in the news in Korea. Such attention patterns offer a
   partial explanation for rapidly declining trust in print newspapers
   among the Korean public, and raise concerns about whose views are
   actually reflected in public policy debates in the news.},

   Mussolini's knowledge of more or less classic authors in literature
   becomes an essential part in the construction of the rhetoric of the
   leader both in public discourses and in his well-known slogans. At the
   same time, Mussolini's attempt to become a renowned author was

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES},

Abstract = {This article focuses on two cases of the European Union (EU)' s efforts
   to promote its values and norms in its immediate neighbourhood, first in
   central and eastern Europe after the fall of communism, and then in
   North Africa and the Middle East after the fall of oppressive regimes
   there. These two neighbourhoods are seen as the EU's peripheries that
   need to be taken care of lest they become a source of political or
   economic instability. This explains the use of the imperial paradigm for
   analysing the content of the EU's normative power discourse. The article
   shows numerous parallels between the rhetoric of EU officials and the
   writings of leading philosophers in the Enlightenment period. While
   there is little doubt that the imperial discourse helped the EU to
   legitimize its enlargement project in central and eastern Europe, the
   Arab world seems less eager to `import' European norms for a variety of
   reasons analysed in the article.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to address the lack of academic knowledge
   about public services in post-Soviet Georgia. Its attention is focused
   on the practices of career progression in public institutions in the
   context of meritocratic principles. In the new, ever-changing
   environment, with the inherited general mistrust of Soviet-type
   institutions, and at the time when formal democratic social institutions
   (formal and moral criteria of success) are still in the process of
   development, informal factors (protectionism, nepotism, etc.) still
   largely determine social-economic success. This article claims the
   prevalence of informal relationships over meritocratic principles in the
   Georgian public service management system, which hinders the process of
   making public service more effective, productive and transparent.},

Abstract = {Front-line police operations are deeply entwined with less visible
   activities - or practices not commonly identified as policing - that are
   carried out by a wide range of participants as strategies of
   settler-colonial pacification operating through the organizing logics of
   security and liberal legalism. Using open source texts and records
   obtained through access to information requests, this article unmaps
   some of the contemporary strategies employed by Canadian institutions to
   pacify Indigenous resistance. As a contribution to the body of work
   seeking to develop the politics of anti-security, the analysis disrupts
   the binary categories that animate security logic by examining the
   public order policing approach of the Ontario Provincial Police, the
   framing of Indigenous resistance as a security threat, and the integral
   role of Indian Affairs in securing the settler-state.},

Abstract = {This article aims to investigate under which circumstances policy
   representation can exist in terms of agreement in voters' perceptions of
   parties' left-right positions. The focal point in the study is on how
   voters' perceptions are affected not only by individual characteristics
   but also by various contextual factors related to the political parties
   and the political systems. With data from the CSES on individual voters
   and various system characteristics from election surveys in 32
   countries, this article shows that what in earlier findings have
   appeared as national context effects rather are party effects when being
   decomposed. System related variables have only a small impact on voters'
   perceptions while the party-followed by the individually related
   variables exerted the greatest impact. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {This article analyzes the president's leadership predicament in light of
   purely partisan considerations in Congress, meaning members' interests
   in winning and holding control of national institutions. I examine
   congressional votes to raise the debt limit, which are highly dependent
   upon patterns of institutional party control. I also examine
   high-profile congressional charges of administration misdoing, another
   arena in which members of the president's party behave starkly
   differently from members of the president's opposition. These
   differences have consequences for presidential leadership, no matter the
   configuration of party control of national institutions.},

Abstract = {This memoir opens with a discussion of the author's recruitment as a
   junior lecturer in African government at Wits in 1978, exploring his
   motivations in leaving Britain to work in South Africa. Politics was
   taught in ways at Wits that were distinctive for their theoretical
   orientation and empirical content as one of the major concerns was to
   consider how people without power act politically. Teaching was shaped
   by the wider background of national insurgent politics in which many
   students arrived at Wits with a deep distrust of pedagogic authority. In
   other ways academic work was shaped by this politics and the second part
   of this article explores the author's engagement as an expert witness
   working for defence lawyers in political trials. A concluding section
   addresses the degree to which these experiences were typical or
   exceptional at South African universities during the decade.},

Abstract = {This article provides an overview and assessment of Comparative Politics
   in South Africa. In mapping the state of the sub-discipline, attention
   is paid to its prevalence in the curricula of universities, the extent
   to which comparison of political phenomena in more than one country
   features in completed master's dissertations and doctoral theses in the
   period 1950-2011 and whether South African comparativists publish in
   their Political Studies journal Politikon, which has been in existence
   for 40 years. The scope and direction of Comparative Politics and its
   methods have shifted dramatically over the years and so has the South
   African political landscape since the early 1990s. The manner in which
   these changes have affected the teaching and research interest of
   scholars, the curricula and the substantive focus of master's and
   doctoral studies is of particular interest here.},

Journal = {SOCIALIST STUDIES},

Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {78-93},

Abstract = {An exploration of the link between pacification and global apartheid in
   the context of the racialized effects of neoliberal labour migration is
   undertaken. Drawing on the general layout of Canada's temporary labour
   migration regime, the legal regulation of migrant labour is taken as a
   project of pacification that enforces apartheid conditions. Juxtaposed
   against the construction of migrant labour as menace or threat to `host'
   communities in Canada, the growing need for ``armies of offshore
   labour{''} presents an especially acute challenge for capital and
   national states. Despite certain perceptions that it is freed from
   national state constraints owing to the hyper-competitiveness of
   contemporary migration, capital remains deeply beholden to the
   politico-legal interventions of states, both sending and receiving.
   Situated within the hierarchical and uneven logic of the nation-state
   system and global capitalist development, pacification becomes a way in
   which capital and states attempt to mediate contradictions and govern
   not ``insecurities{''} surrounding human mobility but rather the need to
   fabricate productive labour, a need contingent upon the complex
   transnational legal regulatory dynamic of unfree migrant labour which
   itself relies upon and perpetuates apartheid.},

Abstract = {Despite numerous published writings on China's regional role, the world
   still knows very little about Beijing's perception and strategy. This
   article seeks to make an intellectual contribution in understanding
   China's foreign policy and its efforts to participate in East Asian
   integration. This article argues that under the rhetoric of peaceful
   development and community building, China's foreign policy is pragmatic
   and changes with the tide of events in international relations. China's
   participation in regional integration serves as a good case for
   examining changes in Beijing's strategy. In the past two decades, China
   has moved from a reluctant participant of regional affairs to an active
   participant and potential future leader. China's adjusting role is a
   consequence of Beijing's pragmatism in policy and its growing economic
   confidence. Pragmatism has led China to `hide its light under a bushel'
   and wait for the proper timing to step onto the world stage.},

Abstract = {Due to its geopolitical situation, Korea started its relationship with
   the EU quite later than with the US, China, Japan and Russia. However,
   the EU-Korea relationship has grown ``slowly but steadily{''}. The
   studies on the perception of the EU have been conducted since the 2000s.
   Korean scholars have been interested in finding out the Korean
   perception of the EU and have participated in the multiannual
   international research projects from the beginning. Their extensive data
   on Korean media coverage on the EU and public opinion surveys present
   the nature and characteristics of the EU imagery in Korea. EU-Korea
   relationship has seen a turning point by the signing of a Free Trade
   Agreement (FTA) between the two parties. The EU became more exposed to
   the Korean media on this occasion, and accordingly, the Korean public
   now considers the EU as a more important partner than before. Through
   the detailed explanation and analysis of the existing perception studies
   in this paper, one can understand how the EU perception has been shaped
   and changed in Korea over time. One of the major findings is that the
   visibility of the EU has been enhanced in Korea for sure, but the images
   have been still seriously prejudiced as an `economic powerhouse'.
   Further studies are necessary to examine how to widen the scope of
   mutual understanding in different fields.},

Abstract = {Drawing on extended ethnographic fieldwork in the Islamic Republic of
   Mauritania (between 2001 and 2012), this article investigates how the
   intensifying regional insecurity is perceived and (re) acted upon by
   people inhabiting the frontier provinces of south-eastern Mauritania. It
   is argued that armed insurgencies and the emergence of nebulous
   assemblages such as the AQIM (Al-Qaeda Organisation in the Islamic
   Maghreb), must be analysed as constitutive elements in a complex
   convergent crisis which is currently undermining local livelihoods in
   multiple ways. In Mauritania and much of the Saharan and Sahelian
   regions, crisis has become chronic, and while people exhibit tremendous
   capacities to anticipate the uncertain and navigate a disequilibrated
   natural and political environment in general, a new kind of protracted
   fear is spreading. This article establishes how the AQIM is enacted
   locally as a phantom menace, which asserts itself through a form of
   omnipresent fear, nurtured by an inherent opaqueness. As this
   fundamental fear progressively permeates the nomadic landscape, it
   engenders a recasting of mobile strategies among the nomadic pastoralist
   groups who inhabit the interstitial desert spaces.},

Abstract = {This paper focuses on the public diplomacy (PD) practices of the EU-a
   supranational regional organisation confronted with two distinct
   challenges. First, the EU aims to reform its external action in order to
   become a global power and leader in the changing multipolar world.
   Second, it purports to fight the ongoing economic crisis that not only
   weakens the actual global capabilities of the EU, but damages its
   international image and reputation as a power and a leader. The paper
   assumes the potential of EU PD tools in meeting these challenges and
   tests this assumption in one case study of international public opinion
   on the EU in its immediate neighbourhood (Ukraine). Importantly, the
   study confronts an additional challenge: EU PD is described in the
   relevant literature to be a disjointed, under-resourced and overlooked
   policy area.},

Abstract = {This article takes the naturalisation process as a vantage point to
   consider how citizenship constitutes a site of emotional investment not
   only on the part of applicants and new' citizens but also on the part of
   the state. The premise of this article is that naturalisation is more
   than solely the admission of foreigners to the position and rights of
   citizenship, and it approaches naturalisation as a state practice that
   needs to be understood within a politics of desire. The article asks
   three questions: what makes naturalisation a thinkable and desirable
   means of acquiring citizenship? Second, what do practices of
   naturalisation tell us about the state's attachment to particular
   embodiments of desirable citizens' (S. Somerville, 2005, Notes toward a
   queer history of naturalization. American quarterly, 7 (3), 661)? Third,
   who may desire the state's desire' (J. Butler, 2002. Is kinship always
   already heterosexual? Differences, 13 (1), 22)? Using policy documents
   and auto-ethnographic material, the article examines practices through
   which the state selects its own objects of desire and produces them as
   citizens, while it also produces itself as desirable. The article
   concludes that naturalisation distinguishes desirable from less
   desirable citizens through fantasies of English proficiency and
   birthright citizenship. In addition, the staged performance of the
   citizenship ceremony assures the state of its desirability by subsuming
   as if' enactments of citizenship.},

Abstract = {Does United Nations peacekeeping protect civilians in civil war?
   Civilian protection is a primary purpose of UN peacekeeping, yet there
   is little systematic evidence for whether peacekeeping prevents civilian
   deaths. We propose that UN peacekeeping can protect civilians if
   missions are adequately composed of military troops and police in large
   numbers. Using unique monthly data on the number and type of UN
   personnel contributed to peacekeeping operations, along with monthly
   data on civilian deaths from 1991 to 2008 in armed conflicts in Africa,
   we find that as the UN commits more military and police forces to a
   peacekeeping mission, fewer civilians are targeted with violence. The
   effect is substantialthe analyses show that, on average, deploying
   several thousand troops and several hundred police dramatically reduces
   civilian killings. We conclude that although the UN is often criticized
   for its failures, UN peacekeeping is an effective mechanism of civilian
   protection.},

Abstract = {The remarkable transformation of Turkish civil-military relations since
   the AK Party's rise to power has not led to total democratization in
   this area. Although EU reforms reduced the military's formal and
   informal powers and trials about contemporary and historic coup cases
   might indicate that the military has been subordinated to civilian
   authority, achieving democratic civil-military relations would require a
   balance of power between civilians and the military: While the military
   must relinquish its role as the country's guardians, civilians must work
   to regain the trust of military officers that they lost through the
   Ergenekon and Balyoz cases. Perhaps then Turkish civil-military
   relations can reach a democratic level, promoting democratic
   consolidation in the country.},

Abstract = {Party platforms from 1993 through 2008 show a positive approach to
   immigration policy. Presidential rhetoric, however, does not match the
   tone of the platforms. There are negative frames (illegality,
   criminality, terrorism, and economic threats) in nearly 50\% of
   immigration speeches. We argue that social context motivates presidents
   to talk about immigration negatively. This analysis provides insight
   into rhetoric as responsive to context rather than a mechanism of power.
   We coded each speech on immigration from Presidents Bill Clinton, George
   W. Bush, and Barack Obama, and found statistically significant results
   that show that immigration rhetoric is more negative when certain social
   conditions are present.},

Abstract = {Despite the nationalization of politics in established democracies, the
   study of local dynamics remains fundamental to our understanding of
   electoral politics, especially in plurality contests. In plurality
   systems, local competition indeed has important consequences for the
   distribution of seats in parliaments and cabinets. While a plethora of
   measures exists to assess electoral competitiveness, none adequately
   captures the dynamic nature of party support at the local level. Making
   use of the Canadian case as an illustration, we propose a new
   classification of electoral districts that aims at filling this gap.
   Districts are divided into two categories, strongholds and
   battlegrounds, depending on the successive performances of parties. We
   argue that such a classification should be utilized in addition to
   static measures of competitiveness, notably in the study of political
   participation.},

Abstract = {Recent studies of voting behavior in Anglo-American elections have
   demonstrated the clear superiority of the valence model over its rivals
   for explaining how people cast their ballots. In this paper we test the
   portability of the valence model in a particularly challenging setting
   the 2009 German Parliamentary elections. Although there are reasons to
   think that a spatial model might outperform the valence model, we find
   that the valence model outperforms it with results similar to previous
   findings in other political settings. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {After a long period of mostly case study research, in the recent past
   various integration and citizenship policy scholars have started to
   compare a relatively large range of countries by constructing policy
   indices. As there are almost as many indices as there are such studies,
   one might wonder whether it matters which indices we use. The main goal
   of this article is to compare these indices and to investigate
   commonalities and differences. By means of content, convergent and
   construct validity tests, methodological strengths and weaknesses will
   be discussed. It will be shown that most of the indices consist of
   different components and are sometimes weakly related to each other even
   if they can be explained by similar factors. An overview of the current
   state of research in this field allows us to learn from the innovative
   ideas that have been developed so far and to discuss the next steps to
   be taken.},

Title = {The conservative party leadership of David Cameron: Heresthetics and the
   realignment of British Politics},
Journal = {BRITISH POLITICS},

Volume = {8},

Pages = {260-284},

Abstract = {In the aftermath of defeat at the general election of 2005 under the
   leadership of Michael Howard, Andrew Taylor suggested that the
   Conservative party was `locked into a systemic crisis'. In the aftermath
   of the general election of 2010, and the forming of a coalition with the
   Liberal Democrats, Andrew Gamble argued that David Cameron had stalled
   the possible realignment of the centre-left and created a realignment of
   the centre-right. Although such assertions demonstrate the progress of
   the Conservative party between 2005 and 2010 under Cameron, much of the
   existing literature focuses on themes such as modernisation or
   ideological and policy renewal at the expense of analysing the
   importance of the party leader in terms of strategic positioning. This
   article examines the party leadership strategy of Cameron in terms of
   the logic underpinning coalition entry and how this relates to
   realignment and attempts to construct and occupy the political
   centre-ground. It situates his leadership strategy within a theoretical
   framework by arguing that his actions can be seen as an attempted act of
   political manipulation consistent with Riker's work on heresthetics. The
   article considers the key criteria for heresthetics as a means of
   showcasing Cameron as a possible heresthetician. Debates on portfolio
   allocation, electoral reform and key policy areas such as fiscal
   readjustment and tuition fees are considered in relation to attempted
   manipulation of the political agenda and political dimensions, as well
   as strategic voting and the politics of deflection and binding.},

Abstract = {Political economists usually study small states to understand the
   secrets behind their success. This article examines the reasons for
   their failure. Greece is the most obvious example of a small state that
   has not managed to navigate the global economic and financial crisis
   successfully. But Greece is hardly alone. Hungary, Iceland, Ireland,
   Latvia, and Portugal have also struggled in the crisis although they
   have little in common with Greece. Meanwhile, countries that share many
   Greek characteristics, such as Italy, managed to hold out much longer.
   This suggests that the explanation for small country failure is
   structural rather than country-specific. The implication is that all
   countries are potentially at risk.},

Abstract = {The United States' national security establishment lacks an integrated
   strategic planning capability. The current National Security Council
   (NSC) system relies heavily on part-time committees that lack the clout
   and time to execute strategic planning. The president could overcome
   this difficulty by looking to President Eisenhower's NSC system.
   Eisenhower's NSC relied on a Planning Board-which was neither a
   part-time committee nor fulltime staff-to get realistic planning that
   was not captive to parochial interests and to foster a national,
   strategic mindset without falling prey to an ivory-tower mind-set
   divorced from reality.},

Abstract = {This essay interprets Baldwin as continuing the Socratic practice of
   self-examination and social criticism while also shifting his Socratic
   undertaking by charting the limits of examination created by the harsh
   effects of race and slavery in the United States. The author argues that
   Baldwin's Socratic practice inflects not only his essays-the center of
   previous analyses-but also his fictions. By transposing Socrates to
   issues of race in twentieth-century America and confronting the
   incoherent effects of a racialized society, James Baldwin thus carries
   forward and transforms a pivotal figure in the history of political
   thought.},

Abstract = {Previous studies have demonstrated that the extent to which media
   coverage influences the issue priorities of policy makers is contingent
   on the type of issue, media, and political agenda. This article contends
   that the relationship between media and political agendas varies across
   the phases of the decision-making process. Based on a comprehensive
   dataset on issue attention in media coverage and various policy-making
   channels covering the years 1996-2003, the article analyses the level of
   media coverage and, more importantly, the distribution and
   correspondence of issue attention between media and political agendas
   across the four successive phases of the decision-making process
   (initiation, preparatory, parliamentary, and referendum phases) in
   Switzerland. Despite inversely distributed levels of attention for
   successive decision-making phases, both media and political agendas are
   concentrated on fewer issues in the initiation and referendum phases,
   and they are more strongly correlated in the most decisive stages of the
   process, that is, the preparatory and referendum phases.},

Abstract = {The article analyzes the formation and change of presidential cabinets
   in Uruguay during the period 1985-2010. In the first section we present
   the institutional and political features of the process of appointment
   and resignation of the ministers. The second section describes the
   cabinets formed in this period and shows that presidents have exchanged
   seats in cabinet by legislative support. The third section analyzes the
   political attributes of the ministers appointed (party affiliation,
   previous experience) and the type of linkage that they keep with the
   president. The fourth analyze the relationship between the time survival
   of the individuals in office, the political responsibility in front of
   congress and the existence of a legislative majority that support the
   president. The last section describes the Uruguayan pattern of
   ministerial designation based in (i) the establishment of an order of
   importance of portfolios, (ii) the nomination of individuals with party
   affiliation (weather insider or adherent politicians) and (iii) the
   influence of the legislative support in defining the ministerial team.},
