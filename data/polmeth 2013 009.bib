Title = {The curious case of Judge Aaron: the race, the law, and the protection

Journal = {POLITICS GROUPS AND IDENTITIES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {1},
Number = {3},
Pages = {370-389},
Abstract = {In 1957, six white men were investigated, prosecuted, and convicted by
   their peers for the crime of mayhem against Judge Edward Aaron, a black
   handyman. On the one hand, it could be argued that this case stands as
   an important counterpoint to the prevailing narrative of southern white
   injustice. In this case, justice seemingly prevailed. I argue, however,
   the overarching concern was to preserve white supremacy not justice for
   Aaron. Due to increased scrutiny by non-southerners, white elites
   sacrificed these men in an effort to protect further incursions against
   the ``southern way of life.{''} By moving to a less extreme form of
   racist practice, white elites sought to maintain white supremacy not
   undermine it. Thus, the conviction of these men served to partition the
   attack of Aaron as the result of a few bad actors whose removal from
   society served to buffer the institutional practice of white supremacy
   from direct challenges.},

Abstract = {Ten years of the Political Parties ACT 2002 (LOPP) enforcement have
   allowed the Courts to accumulate a vast experience of its application.
   Throughout these years, we have encountered several number of fraudulent
   strategies by the ETA and its political wing, in order to be present
   into democratic institutions. This paper tries to summarise the most
   important issues raised by the LOPP and its application during this
   years. Probably, the recent Sortu judgment supposes LOPP's end of cycle.
   The LOPP was designed to outlaw political groups that supported
   terrorism. It has already fulfilled its mission. At least, it seems the
   Constitutional Court opinion in its STC 138/2012, judgment which
   describes a roadmap to Sortu in order to avoid being outlawed again in
   the future. The rule of law is to enable that those who previously
   supported terrorists can rectify, and defend their political project
   through democratic means. It is time to reform the LOPP in areas such as
   the regulation of the internal democracy into parties, or the inclusion
   of racist and xenophobic activities as a cause for being outlawed.},

Journal = {AFRICAN SECURITY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {6},
Number = {3-4, SI},
Pages = {234-256},
Abstract = {This article examines convergence between the United Kingdom and France
   in West Africa since 1997-1998. This readiness to work together on
   African issues is in stark contrast to the history of rivalry between
   the two nations on the continent that dates back at least to the Fashoda
   incident of 1898. The article shows how security concerns in West Africa
   were a key driver of Anglo-French convergence and then goes on to
   examine how far the United Kingdom and France have been able tomove
   beyond their traditional, largely unilateral, policies within their
   spheres of influence in West Africa and adopt a new, more cooperative
   approach. The article uses three case studies-convergence within the
   United Nations Security Council and the European Union and engagement
   with Economic Community of West African States-to provide examples of
   different areas of convergence. It then goes on to ask how far we can
   generalize from these case studies about what enables convergence and
   cooperation and what hinders them. Finally, the question of regime
   efficacy, in terms of the outcomes of convergence, is addressed.},

Abstract = {As the 18th party congress convened, China's military development was
   generating more international heat and controversy than at any time in

   (PLA). This chapter assesses the PLA's strengths and frailties and
   reviews how new leader Xi Jinping smoothly asserted his authority over
   the military. We also dig behind the misleading headline figures for
   China's defence budget, and look at how a lack of trust and
   understanding clouds the diplomatic strategies of the big three players
   in East Asia - China, Japan and the United States.},

Abstract = {This work focuses on the problems related to the universal validity of
   human rights. One way of argumentation, known as absolute foundation,
   will be presented and two models that represent this foundation are
   analyzed: the absolute religious foundation and the absolute
   contractarian foundation. This paper intends to show that neither of the
   models is suitable to ground the universality of human rights because,
   first, they pretend to ascribe universal validity to arguments that are
   in fact not universal and, second, they make recourse to a high degree
   of abstraction that takes into account a very partial view of human
   reality.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL POWER},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {6},

Pages = {29-47},
Abstract = {This paper discusses the relationship between authority-production and
   experience through a consideration of the emergence of certain figures
   as authorities on particular matters as a result of extraordinary
   experiences that they have undergone. It argues that analysis of such
   figures of experiential authority can help us to identify `jectivities':
   foundational tenets upon which their authority is based and to which it
   ultimately refers. With reference to Harry Patch, a veteran of the First
   World War and Doreen Lawrence, the mother of Stephen Lawrence, who was
   murdered in a racially motivated attack at a bus stop, I contend that
   the authority carried by these figures testifies to certain socially
   produced objectivities which elicit an affective response, an embodied
   demand that they are listened to.},

Abstract = {From an analysis of a hypothetical transition from manufacture
   capitalism to socialism, this essay stresses why, according to Marx's
   proposition, it is necessary that this transition takes place under
   machinery's domain. In the case of manufacture it is possible to
   identify a tradeoff between productive efficiency and the humanization
   of labor activities. The essay clarifies how the initially hypothetical
   speculation acquires a historic sense inasmuch as Taylorism-Fordism's
   nature can be understood as a reinvention of the manufacturing system.
   The essay argues that the wide assimilation of Taylorism-Fordism in the
   Soviet Union's implementation of socialism imprisoned it within the
   above-mentioned tradeoff, making it perversely impregnated with the
   immanent mediocrity of Taylorism-Fordism},

   organization of the Spanish revolt of the Indignados. The article starts
   with the emergence of the 15M in Spain, criticizing the representation
   of the movement in the media and exposing the political and economic
   conjuncture of Spain at the date of the revolt. Then it analyzes the
   Indignados sociopolitical phenomenon as an articulation of social
   movements linked by one method of political decision and association:
   the assembly. After this, it tries to explore the limits and advantages
   of a noninstitutionalized approach towards social conflict, exposing the
   social changes the movement has introduced into the Spanish society.
   Finally, it points out the real obstacles for the 15M as a post-Fordist
   class movement in an attempt to understand the role of the Indignados
   like an alternative for political change in Spanish society.},

Abstract = {The article is devoted to the analysis of an important part of the
   social consciousness that the author defines as political capital. He
   views political capital as such a state of mass consciousness, under
   which a substantial amount of competencies is delegated to political
   power institutions and their leaders. Thereby, the society recognizes
   their right to make universally binding decisions as well as implement
   various actions, including enforcement measures, which are essential for
   the realization of these decisions, and, accordingly, declares its
   readiness to obey them. This is the basis for building prerequisites for
   the political process such as legitimacy of political system ( regime),
   law-abiding people, and many others. Exploring the structure and content
   of political capital in relation to the modern society as a whole, A.
   Galkin also traces the impact of the dynamics of this capital on the
   situation in the post-Soviet Russia.},

Abstract = {Care brings the traditional problem of carers' choice between paid work
   and family at a new level. Taking care drain from Romania as a case
   study, I analyse the consequences of parents' migration within a
   normative framework committed to meeting the needs of vulnerable
   individuals. The temporary migration of parents who cannot take their
   children with them involves moral harm, particularly the frustration of
   children's developmental and emotional needs. I use recent feminist work
   on justice and care in the economy to address the question whose
   responsibility it is to fill the void of care created by temporary
   migration. I argue that the moral issues raised by care drain are also
   issues of social justice and therefore call for rectification by the
   states involved.},

Abstract = {A growing part of industrial workers or employees are living nowadays in
   French periurban areas. These popular households are generally describes
   as victims of a social or spatial ``relegation{''}. They are also
   supposed to be largely right-leaning, and often converted to supporters
   of the FN (National Front, the main far-right party in France). Based on
   an ethnographic investigation conducted in a periurban industrial area,
   this article aims at discussing these patterns. The popular inhabitants
   belong to the stable fractions of the working classes and express
   aspirations for social advancement: most of them own their homes. Some
   of them, who had professional qualifications, manage to achieve
   relatively steady positions, and even supervisory roles or technician
   jobs. Their voting practices are indeed linked with their social
   dispositions: faced with massive reorganizations of forms of employment
   on offer, these working classes voters seem disposed to valuing forms of
   economic stabilization rather than access to distinctive cultural or
   educational resources. What become apparent from this case-study is the
   long-term effects of work reorganization policies: these evolutions
   drift industrial workers away from left-wing parties.},

Abstract = {The main purpose of the article is to describe and explain the
   phenomenon of rivalry for political leadership in the framework of the
   Polish executive in the years 2007-2010. This period has been defined as
   a period of cohabitation. Its specificity stems from the fact that the
   most important actors of this rivalry (president and prime minister)
   represented political parties with a rather right-wing political
   orientation. Despite this their institutional coexistence was marked
   with a compromise deficit. This, in turn, determined the search for
   sources of tension between the president and prime minister. In order to
   address this undesirable situation, the political environment focused
   solely on institutional factors determining the relationship between the
   key figures within the executive, which resulted in the proposal of
   specific constitutional changes. The multiplicity of the emerging
   proposals, however, could not conceal the fact that the causes of
   conflict were also embedded in behavioural factors.},

Abstract = {In order to return historical depth to the domestic analogy of abbe de
   Saint-Pierre's projects for perpetual peace, we have to analyze the
   intellectual paradigms that he borrows from the modern natural law
   through the translations of, Hobbes, Locke and Pufendorf. Such paradigms
   show a strictly rationalist approach if read in the light of the French
   moralists science de l'homme diffusely meditated by the author. This
   experience mediated by a deep intellectual exchange with his friend
   Fontenelle deserves a close examination in order to avoid anachronistic
   readings, often invalided by the criticisms of Philosophes who examined
   his projects. Only in this way the conceptual and epistemological
   caesuras, hidden behind the creation of an international arbitral
   institution, can come out},

Abstract = {Mexico has been struggling with notoriously high levels of
   organised-crime-related violence for years. The strategy adopted by the
   Calderon administration relied on largescale joint operations with
   strong military components to fight the cartels in a carteldecapitation
   strategy. The short-term success of this approach was however countered
   by its long-term consequences, which increased cartel fragmentation and
   related violence. Eduardo Guerrero analyses the landscape of Mexican
   organised crime in 2012, its new models of organisation and recruitment
   strategies and suggests the fundamental challenges facing the new Pena
   Nieto administration if it is to devise a security strategy that can
   succeed in the long term.},

Journal = {CRITICAL STUDIES ON TERRORISM},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {6},
Number = {3},
Pages = {429-446},
Abstract = {Reflexive approaches not only maintain that representations of danger
   are socially constructed but also that they relate with political
   behaviour. Representations of terrorism, for instance, are argued to
   constitute that danger in distinct ways and thus to make certain
   counterterror policies possible. This article challenges this popular
   association of reflexive security studies with constitutive effects. It
   argues that constitutive argumentation advances an insufficiently
   tangible argument of effect, and that this conceptual weakness derives
   from both a problematic foundational social theory and a premature
   rejection of causation. Drawing on the social theory of Margaret Archer
   and Roy Bhaskar and a differentiated notion of causation, the article
   advances a ``dialectical causal{''} framework for the analysis of
   representations of danger instead. Applying it to contemporary Swiss
   terrorism politics, the article shows how this framework improves on
   constitutive argumentation in disentangling the political powers
   involved in the production and enactment of representations of danger.},

Abstract = {On becoming Japan's prime minister for the second time, Shinzo Abe has
   set himself the task of reviving Japan as a regional power, by repairing
   years of economic and political stagnation. However, his foreign-policy
   intentions vis-a-vis China, Japan's largest neighbour, are not yet
   clear. John Hemmings and Maiko Kuroki argue that Abe's first premiership
   in 2006-07 provides clues which suggest that he will seek rapprochement
   with China, while simultaneously developing strong regional ties and
   fortifying the USJapan alliance.},

Abstract = {According to Ernst Cassirer the unitary aspect of Rousseau's thought
   could be found in the idea of the subject's self-determination. More
   recent studies - analyzing in a more innovative fashion Rousseau's
   theory of self-love ({''}amour propre{''}) - have stressed the
   constitutive dependence of the subjects on the esteem and recognition of
   their fellow-beings. This paper follows this second type of
   interpretation, but also stresses its limits. For Rousseau the Stoic
   ideal of personal interdependence coexists with the conception of
   intersubjective dependence on others.},

Pages = {427-443},
Abstract = {The regional level has traditionally had a weak position in the
   administrative system in all the Nordic countries. New developments in
   territorial governance throughout Europe characterized by a stronger
   regional role have found their way to the Nordic countries. The view of
   actors in peripheral Nordic regions can be labelled `redistributive
   regionalism' which implies that the actors' claims for a stronger role
   for the regional level must be understood in the context of the unitary
   state. The idea of a stronger regional level is embraced but has to be
   adapted to national characteristics, the unitary state and the
   traditionally strong role of local government, and to the various
   conditions of each region.},

Journal = {REGIONAL AND FEDERAL STUDIES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {23},
Number = {2},
Pages = {169-188},
Abstract = {Which region gains more from Nigeria's wealth is a subject of heated
   debate between northerners and southerners. While the former believe
   that the southern region gets more because it plays host to most of the
   economic activities of Nigeria, the latter believe that the northern
   region has through its many years of control of federal power. Given
   limited space, this study uses the regional distribution of the benefits
   of student enrolments in federal universities to provide some insights.
   The reason for the choice of university education is that it combines
   two features of being a benefit and key to certain other benefits the
   federal government dispenses. The conclusion from the data analysed is
   that the greater beneficiary of federal expenditures on education is
   southern Nigeria, which also likely has greater access to other benefits
   that come with educational qualifications. It follows that the extent of
   federal government's involvement in the provision of subsidized
   university education is the extent of advantage the south enjoys over
   the north.},

Title = {The `Bubbling Up' of Subterranean Politics in Europe},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CIVIL SOCIETY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {78-99},
Abstract = {This article presents the findings of a collaborative research project
   involving seven field teams across Europe investigating a range of new
   political phenomena termed `subterranean politics'. The article argues
   that the social mobilizations and collective activities in 2011 and 2012
   were probably less joined up, more heterogeneous, and, perhaps, even,
   smaller, than similar phenomena during the last decade, but what was
   striking was their `resonance' among mainstream public opinion-the
   `bubbling up' of subterranean politics. The main findings included:
   Subterranean political actors perceive the crisis as a political crisis
   rather than a reaction to austerity. Subterranean politics is just as
   much a characteristic of Germany, where there are no austerity policies,
   as other countries.
   Subterranean political actors are concerned about democracy but not as
   it is currently practised. They experiment with new democratic
   practises, in the squares, on the Internet, and elsewhere.
   This new political generation not only uses social networking to
   organize but the Internet has profoundly affected the culture of
   political activism.
   In contrast to mainstream public debates, Europe is `invisible' even
   though many subterranean political actors feel themselves to be
   European.
   The research concludes that the term `subterranean politics' is a useful
   concept that needs further investigation and that Europe needs to be
   problematized to seek a way out of the crisis.},

Abstract = {Multi-generation cohousing and community developments have been promoted
   for more than a decade in Germany. They are confronted with rising
   expectations of success regarding their effects on the health, care, and
   well-being of their residents, as well as on local civil society. This
   article analyses their impact on residents and associational life by
   surveying eight German developments. The empirical findings underline
   the relevance of an informal sphere between communities and civil
   society for welfare and quality of life. However, relevant questions
   concerning their future funding and their relationship to local civil
   society merit further discussion and analysis.},

Abstract = {The critical review is devoted to the memory of the Russian political
   thinker and philosopher of culture Vadim Tsymbursky (1957-2009). It is
   the publication of the monographic intellectual inquiry into the
   prominent researcher's heritage - inquiry realized by B.V. Mezhuyev
   ((sic), 2011. - 200 c. -B. Mezhuyev. Vadim Tsymbursky's Political
   Critique), that gave a chance to investigate the genesis of Tsymbursky's
   concepts - first of all that of ``the Island of Russia{''}. The author
   of the book has also analyzed many of the scientist's ideas, in
   particular: of Russia's imperial origins as of the product of Russian
   Europeanism; of adequate attitude toward the changes of early 1990s; of
   civilizational geopolitics, etc.},

Abstract = {The advent of the Internet has been rightfully hailed as the beginning
   of an era of virtually unlimited communication revealing ever clearer
   manifestation of the human potential. However, the impact of the new
   interactive tools on the perception of social reality requires a close
   study. The author draws attention to the instrumental nature of the Web
   2.0 and to the ambiguity of its use. He suggests that such
   characteristic features of the ``digital crowd{''} as suggestibility,
   irritability and impulsiveness, may be one of unintended consequences of
   automated communication.},

   Evidence from Consensus Group Commissions' Revenue Forecasts in the

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},

Abstract = {Increasing both the size and diversity of policymaking panels is widely
   thought to enhance the accuracy of collective policy decisions. This
   study advances the theoretical conditions in which improving collective
   accuracy necessitates an efficient trade-off between a panel's size and
   its level of organizational diversity. This substitution effect between
   these organizational characteristics is empirically supported with data
   on official general-fund revenue forecasts made by consensus group (CG)
   independent commissions in the American states. Evidence of an
   asymmetric substitution effect is also uncovered, whereby increasing
   organizational diversity in large CG commissions produces revenue
   forecasts that reduce collective accuracy by slightly more than three
   times as much compared to decreasing such diversity in small CG
   commissions. This study underscores the limits of organizational
   diversity as a mechanism for improving collective judgments when
   policymaking authority is diffuse among many panel members.},

Abstract = {The standard story of republican thought stops around the end of the
   eighteenth century, and contemporary republican political theory based
   on that story-for example, the work of Philip Pettit-is ill-equipped to
   confront problems that have appeared in the era of capitalism.
   Republican theory can benefit from attention to the emergence of social
   democracy in the early twentieth century, and to the role of republican
   ideas in that emergence. Jean Jaure`s, perhaps the most prominent
   exponent of social democracy at that time, drew on the republican
   tradition to defend a concept of justice that combines commitment to
   non-domination with worry about modern loneliness, and he derived from
   the republican tradition a defense of reformist political methods
   against their revolutionary critics. He suggests the usefulness of left
   political thought to republicanism, and of republicanism to thinkers on
   the left.},

Abstract = {The year 2012 was an eventful year for Hong Kong. On top of two
   important elections - of the chief executive and the legislative council
   - society had witnessed numerous scandals involving high level
   politicians and tycoons, pervasive social disgruntlement and protests of
   increasing intensity, frequency and scale. The new administration is now
   facing three key challenges in putting together a credible and competent
   government, dispelling social mistrust and gaining legislative support.
   It appears that the new Chief Executive is close to resolving none.},

Abstract = {Throughout the eighteenth and early nineteenth century, members of the
   local aristocracy, the Metropolitans of the two Principalities, or the
   Phanariot rulers created the first charitable foundations aimed at
   caring for the poor. The prince placed himself as originator of all
   organised welfare initiatives in the Romanian Principalities. By being
   very present in charitable actions, the prince ensured that the state
   controlled charity and set the direction it took, so that charity
   consequently became a matter of state. Despite constant appeals from the
   central authority, private initiative remained poorly organised. On the
   other hand, individual gestures, which certainly took place, are
   scarcely reflected by historical documents, being confined to families
   and having a smaller impact at the larger level of society as far as
   welfare and poor relief are concerned. In the first half of the
   nineteenth century, concern for the poor moved away from the religious
   sphere and became attributes of a good citizen's civic and patriotic
   duty. Charitable foundations started to be described as ``patriotic
   assets{''}, and their progress to be linked to the country's level of
   civilisation. Charity therefore gradually became a ``branch of
   administration{''}, and thus strongly dependent on its limited and
   always insufficient budget.},

Abstract = {This research is based on a finding; the Sahara is an obstacle in
   Spanish-Moroccan relations, so at least since 1975. The aim therefore of
   the article is to address two key issues. The first is that while Spain
   and Morocco diverge in view of the problem, there is no reason they can
   get to agree on the same solution: a Sahara linked to Morocco with a
   special status that ensures their autonomy. Spain as former head of the
   region, can help bring the parties. Morocco for his current
   responsibility over the territory, he can easier find a consensual
   solution. The second issue is that this analysis is done from a position
   that its author has maintained for more than three decades and is the
   belief that good solution to the Western Sahara problem may be with
   Morocco, but in democratic and decentralized Morocco, fully recognize
   plural identity.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE EDUCATION},

Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Pages = {417-435},
Abstract = {In this article, I argue that student learning is enhanced when civic
   engagement is a component of international education initiatives. When
   only presented with knowledge about global challenges, students can
   become frustrated and overwhelmed unless they also understand how they
   might contribute to solutions. Political science programs are uniquely
   positioned to provide students with the knowledge and skills necessary
   to become civically engaged members of the global community. However, we
   need to help students build bridges between knowledge and action. This
   can be accomplished by grounding global knowledge in concepts of
   citizenship. The evidence to support this claim can be found in student
   responses to the Atlas Program at Saint Louis University. This article
   describes the development and evolution of this program and analyzes its
   progress in fostering global civic engagement. By examining the
   evolution of the program, it highlights why it is necessary to root
   global knowledge in civic values.},

Abstract = {One feature of globalisation is the increasing spread of international
   standards. In general, standards define benchmarks and rules for
   production. They can stem from a variety of sources ranging from NGOs to
   industries and governments. This article focuses on standard setting by
   international standards development organisations. We explore into the
   global regimes that govern standards for wooden products that are used
   in construction. Although the regimes are under the notion of
   ``self-regulation{''}, such forms of ``private{''} governing are
   questionable from a democratic perspective. The article explores the
   composition and interest distribution of the actors steering
   standardisation in construction. Construction is one of the biggest
   producers of green house gas emissions. Since recently wood has been
   promoted as a means of carbon storage we focus on the norms that
   internationally are the most dominant with the intention to regulate
   sustainability and carbon efficiency for wood use in construction.
   Standardisation in this emerging field is still under development. The
   article aims to draw a comprehensive picture of the institutionalised
   rules and processes that up to now are globally most influential. In
   conclusion the process is best described as a ``regulation of
   self-regulation{''} taking place mainly under the institutional umbrella
   of the private actors CEN and ISO, with some influence from governments.},

Pages = {299-321},
Abstract = {This article analyses the effect of immigration-related diversity on
   different forms of trust through the hierarchical analysis of three
   levels of approximately 5,000 respondents nested in over 800
   neighbourhoods and 33 municipalities. The data set is based on a unique
   survey that was specially designed to measure different forms of trust
   and to test the effects of context. Building on previous findings about
   the effect of diversity on various forms of trust in Sweden, we discuss
   three mechanisms through which diversity may drive down community trust
   in diverse settings - dissimilarity, perceptions of unfairness and
   asymmetry of information and norms - and explore these empirically. In
   particular, we examine under which conditions asymmetry of information
   and norms and perceptions of unfairness affect community trust, and how
   it interacts with diversity. Our analysis reveals that norm asymmetry
   and perceptions of unfairness affect community trust negatively but the
   negative effects are more pronounced in the most diverse local
   communities.},

Volume = {32},
Pages = {309-322},
Abstract = {This paper aims at analyzing the use of the concept of ``constituent
   power{''} in the context of European integration.
   The thesis is that the constituent power is the ``forgotten{''} of
   European integration, since this legal order was built and acquired a
   political and constitutional dimension without any action attributable
   to an European demos. Indeed, it is under the combined action of the
   member States (as ``masters of the Treaties{''}) and of European
   institutions (especially the European Court of justice) that the process
   of ``constitutionnalization{''} has developed itself endogenously.
   It is generally argued that the lack of ``constituent power{''}
   illustrates the fact that the EU has not yet crossed the ``state
   threshold{''}, since this concept was historically shaped within the
   nation-state framework. However, we believe that the eviction of the
   concept of constituent power is not a theoretical necessity but that it
   stems from a political choice, due to the fear that the adoption of a
   European constitution by a European people could result in the
   disappearance of the states.
   However, we think that there is no conceptual need to limit the concept
   of constituent power to the state field. In other words, we assume that
   the concept of constituent power could be transposed into the European
   field and, moreover, that},

Pages = {35-54},
Abstract = {2012 in Bolivia was characterized by positive economic progress but with
   a conflictive social agenda Among the sensitive issues were the conflict
   over the construction of a highway through indigenous territory (known
   as TIPNIS), the general strike of health workers and the clash between
   miners working in cooperatives and those working for the state. Although
   Morales' administration was able to solve some of these problems,
   adopting a conciliator role in a growing scenario of social
   fragmentation, other topics remain in the agenda such as the TIPNIS,
   where the battleground is moving from the streets to the constitutional
   arena. The most important topics in the international agenda were the
   unsolved territorial dispute with Chile over access to the Pacific Ocean
   and the lukewarm relations with the U.S. In general, it was a year
   between good and bad news.},

Journal = {REGIONAL AND FEDERAL STUDIES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {7-26},
Abstract = {This article focuses on the representation of preferences with regards
   to language policy in Catalonia. By comparing social surveys produced by
   a variety of organizations with its own data, this paper demonstrates
   that there is a substantial gap between the political preferences of
   significant segments of the general population of Catalonia and the
   political preferences of their representatives at the Parliament of
   Catalonia. In particular, the language policy implemented by the Catalan
   elites is not consistent with the preferences of Castilian-speaking
   working-class citizens. The article identifies two mechanisms of
   `blocked articulation' which serve to impede the representation of the
   preferences of these voters in the region's representative institutions.
   These mechanisms are: (1) the under-representation of Castilian-speakers
   in the region's representative institutions; and (2) the partial
   assimilation of elected Castilian-speakers into the attitudes and
   preferences of the Catalan-speaking, hegemonic fraction of the political
   establishment.},

Abstract = {At the beginning of the XXI st century, Latin America is being largely
   governed by leftist governments. Several authors have differentiated
   between a `pragmatic' left, on the one hand, and a `populist' left, on
   the other. Using data from the AmericasBarometer surveys from 2012, we
   assess the socio-demographic profiles of supporters of the `populist'
   left in four nations: Argentina, Bolivia, Ecuador and Venezuela. By
   means of logistic regression models, we analyze the intention to vote
   for the candidate or party of the current President for citizens
   belonging to different levels of education, wealth, and other
   socio-demographic variables. The results suggest that not all
   governments classified as belonging to the Latin American `populist'
   left receive the support of the same kind of individuals.},

Abstract = {In October 2009, a private member introduced the Anti-Homosexuality Bill
   to Uganda's Parliament for consideration. This article analyzes the Bill
   within a broader context of transnational antigay activism, specifically
   the diverse ways that antigay activism in Uganda is shaped by global
   dynamics (such as the U.S. Christian Right's pro-family agenda) and
   local forms of knowledge and concerns over culture, national identity,
   and political and socio-economic issues/interests. This article lends
   insight into how transnational antigay activism connects to and
   reinforces colonial-inspired scripts about ``African{''} sexuality and
   the deepening power inequalities between the global North and South
   under global neoliberalism, and raises some important questions about
   how the racial and gender politics of the U.S. Christian Right's
   pro-family agenda travel and manifest within the Ugandan context.},

Abstract = {Political Scientists have widely explored why legislatures pass campaign
   finance regulations and how these laws condition the influence of
   organized interests over elected officials. Studies have not explained
   how state houses can overcome entrenched interests, to pass more
   restrictive legislative lobbying laws. Interest group pressure can be
   overcome when routine politics are impacted by agenda-setting
   environments and broader state political contexts that prompt the
   passage of legislative lobbying reforms. Findings suggest that although
   moralistic political culture and political scandals set the agenda for
   stricter regulation, the prospects for reform are tempered by the power
   of organized interests in state houses.},

Abstract = {Throughout the last two decades the creation of a multipolar world was
   proclaimed more than once in bilateral documents signed by Russia and
   China. Meanwhile, even studies of scholars from those two countries
   testify that unipolarity remains in the international relations.
   However, relevant scenarios do not exclude possibility of multipolarlity
   in not so far future. Yet despite certain similar challenges Russian and
   Chinese international standing differs a lot. While China emerges as the
   second superpower Russia has to fight for its place among the great
   powers.},

Title = {More Scottish than Welsh? Understanding the 2011 Devolved Elections in
   Scotland and Wales},
Journal = {REGIONAL AND FEDERAL STUDIES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {23},
Number = {5},
Pages = {591-612},
Abstract = {In line with the prevailing methodological nationalism of electoral
   studies, sub-state regional elections are often assumed to be shaped
   primarily by state-wide political dynamics. But such assumptions make it
   difficult to understand why, as occurred in Scotland and Wales in May
   2011, simultaneous sub-state elections might produce sharply contrasting
   outcomes. Drawing on original data from the Scottish and Welsh Election
   Studies, this paper compares voting behaviour in these two elections. We
   test two main hypotheses: that the election outcomes differed because of
   the greater influence of UK-wide political dynamics in Wales than in
   Scotland; and that the differing election outcomes reflected simply the
   differing attractiveness of the main parties in the two nations. We find
   substantial support for the latter hypothesis, but also some support for
   the former: vote choice in the 2011 devolved elections was more
   distinctively Scottish than it was Welsh. The conclusion considers the
   implications of our findings for understanding devolved politics in
   Scotland and Wales, and sub-state elections in general.},

Abstract = {Matthew M. Singer, Economic Voting in an Era of Non-Crisis: The Changing
   Electoral Agenda in Latin America, 1982-2010 Latin America's political
   economy has shifted in the three decades since the return to
   democratization, with the inflationary crises of the 1980s fading into
   the past. One consequence of this change is a reduction in the electoral
   salience of inflation. While electoral support for the incumbent in the
   1980s and 1990s was strongly tied to his or her ability to prevent
   increases in prices, in the 2000-2010 period there was no significant
   association between inflation rates and election outcomes. Instead,
   incumbents who presided over a growing economy in the last decade reaped
   electoral benefits. The importance of the economy for electoral outcomes
   varies over time and even across economic indicators.},

Abstract = {This paper considers the Liberal Democrat party as a brand, using
   appropriate branding concepts to analyze the fortunes of the party
   during the 2010 General Election. It explains Nick Clegg as a key
   influence on the brand's image nationally (the party leader as national
   brand spokesperson) and how the national image was moderated by Jeremy
   Browne (the focal constituency candidate and local brand spokesperson).
   The analysis then considers the effect of the subsequent Coalition
   Government (with the Conservatives) on the Liberal Democrat brand,
   focusing specifically on the new legislation to which it is inextricably
   associated.},

Abstract = {This article examines supranational European identity for children of
   immigrants - a topic relatively unexplored in literature on immigrant
   integration and on European identity development. It focuses on two key
   concerns: the potential significance of the link between children of
   immigrants and European identity, and children of immigrants'
   understandings of European identity. Findings suggest that European
   identity is of relevance to immigrant-origin individuals and indicate
   the importance of examining identification at multiple geopolitical
   levels, including the supranational level, in immigrant integration
   research. Findings also show that meanings attributed to European
   identity are varied but largely positive, and that they are often based
   on contrasts with the family's region of origin.},

Abstract = {This article addresses the question of why Thomas Hobbes named his 1651
   philosophical magnum opus, Leviathan, after the Biblical monster.
   Depicting the state in this fashion alludes to a contemporaneous
   interpretation of Leviathan as a crocodile, an animal that could
   represent the Devil. Hobbes has been considered an atheist or deist who
   was acutely aware of the political power of images. Constructing
   metaphors and similes likening Christianity to something that is
   swallowed, and the state to a crocodile, Hobbes esoterically expressed
   his disagreement with the Christian religion. This illustrated his
   belief that the Christian doctrine was destructive to the state and
   inferior to pagan empires in its capacity to induce law-abiding
   behaviour among citizens.},

Abstract = {The role of the public service in managing territorial diversity has too
   often been overlooked in the literature on multilingual states. In the
   article, we explore the issue of bureaucratic representation of the
   federal public administration of Belgium, Canada and Switzerland, three
   economically advanced federal states in which language has become over
   time the dominant cultural marker and dividing line. We argue that
   variations observed in mechanisms of bureaucratic representation can be
   explained by differences in the configuration of two variables:
   discourse about the contours of the political community and how it has
   been channelled through the policy-making process of each country.},

Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},

Volume = {50},
Number = {3},
Pages = {865-892},
Abstract = {In this article I try to explore a possible conceptualization of the
   body and subjectification technologies, considering them not as
   different entities but in their mutual conformation. To do this I
   propose to review the transformation of a medical technology, HIV
   testing, into a preventive technology. I am particularly interested in
   addressing the HIV test from the point of view of the bodies that it
   enacts in specific moral economies. I work through the narrative of the
   circumstances in which some men, mostly gays and seropositive, took the
   HIV test from two perspectives: first, I try to place bodies and
   technologies in their specific contexts of relations and experience. In
   a second step, I try to link these micro-processes to wider changes in
   the technology itself, underlining its historicity, and framing the HIV
   test in the changing political management of the epidemic. I argue that
   this perspective should be conceptualized as biopolitical, since what is
   at stake here is the specific and concrete ways in which the epidemic
   has been managed as a political problem in its broadest sense. Thus, I
   try to show how a redefinition of HIV testing can lead to novel
   enactments of the body, but in the process the technology is in turn
   redefined in subjective strategies that are unforeseeable. The article
   will be showing the body confronting HIV as something that is done, in
   changing manners over time, a doing that is affected and in turn affects
   the technologies and moral economies in which it operates},

Abstract = {This paper presents a way of thinking about how to respond to the
   pluralism of modern societies that avoids any commitment to
   contractualist norms of political justification. The argument developed
   appeals to the notion of a constitutional settlement. Constitutional
   settlements are complex on-going social practices that both express
   certain values to which political societies are committed and establish
   procedures for resolving disputes among members of these societies. As
   such, they are a product of both moral commitment and the balance of
   power. The paper shows how constitutional settlements relate to issues
   of stability and non-subjugation in politics, and explains how they can
   ground a distinction between justice and legitimacy.},

Journal = {AFRICAN SECURITY},

Abstract = {Over the past decade, numerous international actors have developed
   policy frameworks to address and ultimately prevent the resurgence of
   coups d'etat in Africa. By reconstructing international reactions to the
   coups in Guinea and Madagascar, this article analyzes whether this trend
   has also engendered a convergence in practice. This, it argues, involves
   a struggle over defining the terms of such interventions, first with
   regard to how to re-build legitimate political orders and second in
   relation to the definition of roles and hierarchies that emanate from
   multiple and sometimes conflicting mandates to address such situations.
   Furthermore, while convergence is understood as generally ambiguous in
   its consequences, this article suggests that even successful convergence
   in practice comes with fundamental costs that can compromise the
   preventive aims of such interventions.},

Abstract = {Political science graduate students need to develop strong skills in
   drafting empirical research manuscripts. Yet, many graduate student
   manuscripts contain similar shortcomings, which require student peers,
   faculty advisors, and journal referees to produce the same comments for
   multiple manuscripts. This article lists common comments on empirical
   research manuscripts, as a reference to help students revise their
   manuscripts before presentation to others for review, so that reviewers
   can focus on the more substantive elements of a manuscript, thus
   producing better manuscripts that are more likely to be published and
   thus contribute to knowledge about political phenomena.},

Abstract = {Recent years have seen a dramatic increase in state legislation likely
   to reduce access for some voters, including photo identification and
   proof of citizenship requirements, registration restrictions, absentee
   ballot voting restrictions, and reductions in early voting. Political
   operatives often ascribe malicious motives when their opponents either
   endorse or oppose such legislation. In an effort to bring empirical
   clarity and epistemological standards to what has been a deeply-charged,
   partisan, and frequently anecdotal debate, we use multiple specialized
   regression approaches to examine factors associated with both the
   proposal and adoption of restrictive voter access legislation from
   2006-2011. Our results indicate that proposal and passage are highly
   partisan, strategic, and racialized affairs. These findings are
   consistent with a scenario in which the targeted demobilization of
   minority voters and African Americans is a central driver of recent
   legislative developments. We discuss the implications of these results
   for current partisan and legal debates regarding voter restrictions and
   our understanding of the conditions incentivizing modern suppression
   efforts. Further, we situate these policies within developments in
   social welfare and criminal justice policy that collectively reduce
   electoral access among the socially marginalized.},

Abstract = {The Justice and Development Party (AKP) and its official political
   identity of conservative democracy dominated the first decade of the new
   millennium in Turkey. Conservative democracy rests on a fusion of a
   particularistic conservative national identity with the universal
   principles of liberal democracy. The conservative narratives on lesbian,
   gay, bisexual and transgenders (LGBTs) reveal the limits of this
   synthesis' ability to create a deliberative democracy in Turkey, and
   underscore the challenges faced in recognition of LGBT demands within
   the conservative democratic project.},

Abstract = {We examine how different formal citizenship regimes fare in achieving
   the political inclusion of immigrants and their children by looking at
   voting turnout in local elections. We analyse survey data from four
   European cities that grant voting rights to foreigners but are located
   in countries with contrasting rules for access to formal citizenship.
   Local voting gaps are larger where citizenship rules are more
   restrictive, which suggests that citizenship regimes have long-lasting

Abstract = {Why are statewide ballot initiatives used more frequently in some states
   relative to others? Using Gerber as a theoretical baseline, I argue that
   groups use initiatives in response to conditions surrounding
   representative government. Specifically, I argue that groups are best
   able to mobilize the resources necessary (i.e., citizens) to draft,
   qualify for the ballot, and pass an initiative when conditions
   surrounding representative government render it incapable of addressing
   citizens' policy preferences efficiently and effectively. Groups, that
   is, are best able to mobilize the resources necessary to pass
   initiatives as legislatures become insulated from citizens, or
   ineffective at digesting policy items. I extend the literature in this
   vein by finding strong evidence that initiatives are used in response to
   partisan conditions, which undermine legislatures' capacity to process
   legislation effectively. However, I find only limited empirical support
   for the argument that initiatives are used in response to legislative
   insulation.},

Abstract = {Presidents yearn for greatness to cement their ``standing in
   history.{''} But their efforts are vulnerable to constitutional and
   political constraints. The gap between presidential hope and the limits
   on their power is vividly displayed by their record of ``going
   public.{''} This article illustrates the costs of presidential
   promotions through a case study of President Barack Obama's public
   campaign on behalf of health reform, which provoked countermobilization,
   encouraged media coverage of the opposition, and widened the public's
   exposure to potent messages that undercut White House communications.
   The article concludes by suggesting partial steps to moderate
   expectations and work within institutional boundaries.},

Abstract = {This article examines the trade-offs between social and political
   integration by analysing migrant political representation on municipal
   councils in Britain and France. The argument is that social integration
   may allow migrants to interact with the mainstream population but it
   also reduces the capacity to form effective group mobilisation. In turn,
   less mobilisation reduces the likelihood of electing co-ethnics. In
   comparison, social segregation may increase separation from mainstream
   society but it also increases effective group mobilisation. In turn,
   more group mobilisation increases the capacity to elect co-ethnics.},

Abstract = {In Western Europe, individuals and groups increasingly claim that
   publicly enunciated denigrating racial discourse inflicts an injury upon
   them, and inscribe this claim under the rubric of equality. By adopting
   a method of claim-centered critical theorizing, I discuss the
   possibilities and implications of reading claims of racialized
   discursive injury as claims to equality. A review of contemporary
   political theorists concerned with equality and injurious discourse
   establishes the democratic relevance of claims of discursive injury. A
   discussion of Judith Butler's theory of performativity then identifies
   the properties of the injurable subject and of discourse's power.
   Finally, I specify how a postcolonial stance enables us to grasp the
   actualization of discursive injury as it resonates between past colonial
   inequalities and threats of future exclusion or death. This
   equality-focused reading sheds light on the transformative potential of
   claims of racialized discursive injury for resignifying equality in
   contexts marked by race and postcolonialism.},

Abstract = {Hayek's oft-neglected cognitive theory, articulated in The Sensory
   Order, provides a foundation for a theory of innovation that integrates
   cognition, experience, and the importance of freedom for the creation of
   entirely new conceptual categories and fundamentally innovative
   entrepreneurial endeavors. For Hayek, one sees only what one is prepared
   to see; that is, we can notice sensory and other phenomena only after we
   have classified the data into often-implicit abstract categories that
   are mediated to us physiologically. Learning takes places by using
   received categories while innovation takes place by creating new
   categories or moving data from one category to another, which is often
   an attempt to resolve anomalies. The new perceptual awareness required
   for discovery leads, in turn, to new categorizing and new perceptual
   horizons. Such innovation often requires not just freedom of
   imagination, but freedom of action, for one has to be able to try out
   many different perceptual possibilities.},

Abstract = {We present a novel method which can be used to show that contemporary

   might be expected - in reality many centuries. Using data on Republic of
   Ireland and Northern Ireland, jurisdictions with party systems that
   differ significantly, one of which poses significant challenges to the
   universality of many political science theories, we show how using
   surnames as markers can confirm the obvious explanation for the Northern
   Ireland party system and then propose a novel explanation for the Irish
   party system. We suggest that surnames could be an objective way of
   studying migration patterns and ethnic heritage which may be important
   in explaining party systems.},

Abstract = {The Treaty of Lisbon's institutional modifications narrowed the options
   for member states within the formal decision-making rules, mainly due to
   the broadening of the ordinary legislative procedure. This paper
   hypothesises that the actors in EU institutions seek to strengthen their
   influence through coordination across the EU legislative institutions,
   along either national or political party lines. The research data
   consist of co-decision files that include information on the national
   and political identities of all the relevant actors in the legislative
   process in 2004-2011. Statistical tests assess the likelihood of changes
   in the dynamics of the legislative process as related to the affiliation
   of the actors after Lisbon. The results show a clear difference in the
   post-Lisbon legislative process, indicating that the political party
   identity of the actors may play a more significant role, although other
   factors must be considered as well.},

Abstract = {There are many explanations for variation in political protest. However,
   they have not focused sufficiently on institutions and the influence the
   latter exert on protest. This article, by using multilevel analysis and
   cross-national survey data, suggests that political protest depends on
   the level of institutional decentralization. In fact, decentralization
   increases the number of state actors, implies a multiplication of access
   points to the political system, and provides greater chances of
   influencing the decision-making process. Furthermore, it is shown that
   the effect of mobilizing agencies, such as political parties and trade
   unions, also depends on the level of decentralization.},

Abstract = {In 2010, the Conservative-Liberal Democrat Coalition placed a moratorium
   on airport expansion in the south-east of England. In office, however,
   it has faced a sustained political campaign from supporters of the
   aviation industry and expansion, leading to the appointment in September
   2012 of the Davies Commission on airport capacity. This paper critically
   evaluates this nascent policy reversal in aviation policy, analysing the
   political backlash in favour of expansion and the political mediation of
   such demands by the Coalition. It argues that while the shifting
   political context has placed new pressures on the coalition, its current
   difficulties cannot be divorced from the continued resonance of the
   logic of aviation expansion embedded in British institutions at the end
   of the Second World War. The paper concludes with an assessment of the
   challenges facing the Davies Commission, the coalition and campaigners,
   when set against the continued grip' of aviation on our collective
   consciousness.},

Abstract = {This article provides an overview of major research findings regarding
   the Internet and American political campaigns. This is still a nascent
   subfield, but the research community has come to general agreement on
   five key points: (1) at the mass behavioral level, the Internet has not
   changed fundamental participatory inequalities; (2) we have seen an
   increase in small-donor activity, and these donations tend to flow
   toward polarizing candidates; (3) for political campaign operations,
   ``mundane mobilization tools{''} carry the largest impacts; (4) with
   political campaigns, the new focus on data analytics and the ``culture
   of testing{''} is substantially changing resource expenditures and work
   routines; and (5) there is currently a clear partisan divide between how
   Democrats and Republicans employ digital technology for campaigning. The
   article also discusses the methodological challenges that separate
   Internet-related research from many of the more established fields of
   campaign finance-related research. It concludes by posing a set of
   research questions for the 2014 and 2016 election cycles which will
   likely prove fruitful.},

Abstract = {Today, both the private and public sector organizations are exposed to a
   variety of risks and outages or downtimes so they suffer from their
   activities or business processes These risks may occur as a result of
   natural disasters, human error, sabotages, power outages, earthquake,
   storm, flood, they can also likely to be composed from outside
   influences (such as computer virus or cyber terrorism). Unless they are
   prepared for these types incidents, companies are to survive and advance
   against risks is becoming impossible. Business Continuity Management
   places people at the centre of BCMS. This article discusses Business
   Continuity Management organization that will carry out his/her role and
   responsibilities in a corporate/enterprise. The case of this topic and
   the purpose of the overall assessment of the situation is to determine
   the future of this discipline via sectoral differences, culture, in

Abstract = {This paper gives account of the main republican and federal theoretical
   principles developed by Jefferson from his seminal Notes on the State of
   Virginia, to some extent shared by Madison. ``Great principle{''} that
   fuels a new collective action logic, giving birth to the ``Republican
   Party{''}, and later the ``Democratic-Republican Party{''}. This
   question of principles -true ``war of principles{''} (Hamilton)- about
   what sort of Nation and State the United States of America was to be,
   appears notoriously at the origin of the first party system and
   electoral competition in USA. The disagreement between the
   ``republicans{''} (Jefferson, Madison) and ``federalists{''} (Hamilton)
   was very deep and insurmountable, beginning by the idea of Nature as
   rural rather than urban landscape of the American society, the plural
   Idea of the American nation, the kind of American Republic defended
   ({''}ward{''} based and democratic participative in Jefferson views),
   and the institutional design of federalism (dualist and defender of the
   States rights in Jefferson and Madison). The critic of Hamilton not only
   as ``centralist{''} but as ``monarchist{''} evidenced the substantive
   ideological and political differences among this three Founding Fathers.},

Abstract = {The public support literature maintains that leader popularity is driven
   by the state of the economy. Yet, according to the diversionary theory
   of war, foreign crisis participation may help an unpopular leader
   bolster his or her political fortunes through a rally-around-the-flag
   effect Utilizing CSES Module II surveys covering twenty-six countries,
   2001-2006, comparative investigation that links countries' foreign
   crises participation with individual-level data on subsequent support
   for their leaders is useful. Multi-level analyses reveal that foreign
   crisis participation draws attention to foreign policy issues, increases
   support for the leader, and comes close to offsetting the negative
   impact of unemployment. While employed and unemployed individuals
   respond to crises nearly equally, the crises help the leader less among
   citizens concerned about foreign policy.},

Abstract = {Under what conditions do citizens connect concerns about corruption to
   their evaluations of sitting executives? In contrast to conventional
   scholarship positing a direct, negative relationship between corruption
   and political support, we build on a small but suggestive body of
   research to argue that this relationship is conditional on economic
   context. We test this claim with national survey data collected in 19
   presidential systems as part of the AmericasBarometer 2010 study. Using
   both fixed effects ordinary least squares and hierarchical linear
   regression analyses, we show that individuals facing bad (good)
   collective economic conditions apply a higher (lower) penalty to
   presidential approval for perceived political corruption. This result
   holds across both an individual-level indicator of national economic
   assessment and a regional economic measure; we further test, and find
   less substantial results for, the moderating influence of personal
   economic conditions on the political toll of corruption perceptions.},

Abstract = {This article examines the recent developments in Turkey-Iran relations.
   Over the last decade there has been an obvious rapprochement between the
   two countries. Ideological rivalry gave way to pragmatism, especially
   obvious in economic cooperation. However, the Arab Spring and
   particularly the civil war in Syria led to a deterioration of the
   relations between Turkey and Iran and revealed the fragility of this
   relationship, especially in terms of security and rival visions for the
   region. Iran's newly elected moderate President Hassan Rouhani has
   already demonstrated that Iran is willing to cooperate with the West on
   several issues. For now it seems like Iran is switching from the hard
   line foreign policy of the Ahmadinejad era to a more cooperative stance,
   which most likely will affect Turkey-Iran relations in a positive way.},

Journal = {FRENCH POLITICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Pages = {217-240},

Abstract = {This article adopts an organization-centered and pragmatist approach in
   order to analyze Europeanization as a learning process in the field of
   public policy. This approach opposes the established view, which
   understands national ENGOs' (environmental non-governmental
   organizations') activism as a process that is simply responsive to
   European opportunities according to their resources and
   values/preferences. The concept of organizational learning
   re-establishes the organization as the unit of analysis and as an
   explanatory factor of the strategies related to the European Union (EU)
   arena. Defined as a `learning-by-doing' process, organizational learning
   consists of discovering and exploiting the EU multilevel game, while
   mobilizing internal resources for this purpose. The proposed analytical
   framework enriches the empirical discussion of the way in which French
   ENGOs deal with the uncertainty of multilevel policymaking, while
   discussing the strategic dimension of their EU activism.},

Abstract = {In this article, we create, validate, and analyze new dynamic measures
   of state partisanship, state policy mood, and state political ideology.
   The measures of partisanship and policy mood begin in 1956 and the
   measure of ideology begins in 1976. Our approach uses the advantages of
   two leading techniques for measuring state public opinionmultilevel
   regression and poststratification (MRP) and survey aggregation. The
   resulting estimates are based on nearly 500 different surveys with a
   total of more than 740,000 respondents. After validating our measures,
   we show that during the last half century, policy preferences in the
   states have shifted in important and sometimes surprising ways. For
   example, we find that differences in political attitudes across time can
   be as important as differences across states.},

Abstract = {The federal government's power to appoint judges has come under
   increased scrutiny in recent years. While many suggest that partisan
   affiliation, gender and professional background may be influencing the
   Canadian appointment process, and some have called into question the
   fairness of such influences, little attention has been directed at
   determining whether these characteristics influence the outcome of
   cases. This paper studies decisions made by the Ontario Court of Appeal
   between 1990 and 2003 and uses a unique measure of partisan affiliation
   in an attempt to answer the question: do characteristics which play a
   role in the appointment process influence judicial decision making.},

Abstract = {The development of United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR)
   1325 marked a significant step in recognising women's role in peace
   processes. While it has affected the drafting of peace agreements since
   its enactment, the question remains as to how to create appropriate
   structural spaces within a political system to give effect to 1325. This
   article reflects on the implementation of UNSCR 1325 on the island of
   Ireland. It considers the different interpretations of two sovereign
   governments on its applicability to post-conflict politics on the island
   of Ireland. It also evaluates the opportunities and challenges involved
   in applying this international framework to women, peace and security in
   a local context.},

   Evidence from Postcommunist Eurasia},

Number = {3},
Pages = {734-752},

Abstract = {Since the end of the ColdWar, political scientists have radically
   reexamined the role that elections play in authoritarian contexts. Some
   argue elections are congruent with authoritarianism and actually help to
   stabilize non-democratic forms of rule. Others challenge this claim by
   arguing that elections can function as a mechanism for democratization.
   We test whether elections have functioned as a mechanism of change or of
   neo-authoritarian stability in the postcommunist world. We generally
   find that elections neither promote democracy nor strengthen
   authoritarianism. However, we do find that in energy-rich states
   elections promote authoritarianism, though of a somewhat more benign
   sort. We also find that the mechanisms of electoral participation and
   competitiveness thought to promote democracy function differently in the
   postcommunist context and explore this in greater detail through a
   paired case study of electoral mobilization in Slovakia and Belarus.},

Abstract = {Research on American political institutions correctly emphasizes the
   ascendency of presidential power over the last century. Nevertheless,
   Congress possesses tools to influence how the executive branch shapes
   public policy. I examine how the use of limitation riders in
   appropriations laws allows Congress to affect the substance of
   bureaucratic decisions when Congress otherwise would not have much
   traction with the bureaucracy: under divided government. In examining
   the history of limitation riders that forbade the issuance of
   bureaucratic regulations from 1989 to 2009, I find support for this
   perspective. The findings suggest that, although Congress may be at a
   disadvantage in shaping law and policy relative to the president in many
   cases, its constitutionally protected spending authority continues to
   promote its ability to influence the executive branch.},

Abstract = {Employing a Marxist framework, this article examines how neo- liberal
   agendas for development pursued by successive regimes in Egypt have been
   associated with violence, fraud and corruption. Encouraged by
   international financial institutions and Western governments, the
   Egyptian state became a means of channelling public resources into
   private hands, using complex relations of privilege among officials and
   oligarchs. The article examines a growing conviction among Egypt's
   people that the presidency and the ruling party represented a criminal
   enterprise. Addressing notions of ``crony capitalism{''}, and the idea
   that the revolution of 2011 punished an aberrant political leader, it
   argues that bodies such as the International Monetary Fund and the World
   Bank have been party to consolidation of corrupt networks and
   development of an authoritarian state acting with impunity vis- a- vis
   the mass of Egypt's people. The article raises pressing questions about
   global responsibilities for state crime manifested at the local level.},

Abstract = {This article explores the mining tax ad war of 2010', which contributed
   to the removal of a first-term Labour prime minister and shaped
   Australia's Minerals Resource Rent Tax. In particular, it examines the

   under-explored aspect of communication power. The article identifies
   advocacy advertising as an increasingly prevalent technique used by

   In conclusion, the article focuses on the regulatory environment for
   such campaigns and the areas of future research that might help to

   Guizot, who was the leading figure of this political current. The Author
   argues that the category of ``capacite{''}, according to which the
   requisite for suffrage was individual worship and not census, didn't
   become a subject matter of legislation not so much for the growing
   social blindness of the July Monarchy as for the difficulty to find some

Title = {When Do Interest Groups Contact Bureaucrats Rather than Politicians?
   Evidence on Fire Alarms and Smoke Detectors from Japan},
Journal = {JAPANESE JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {What determines whether interest groups choose to contact politicians or
   bureaucrats? Despite the importance of this question for policymaking,
   democracy, and some prominent principal-agent understandings of
   politics, it is relatively unexplored in the literature. We argue that
   government stability plays a major part in interest groups' decisions.
   That is, central to interest groups' decisions is their assessment of
   the likelihood that politicians currently in power will continue to be
   in the future. We deduce logical, but totally contrasting hypotheses,
   about how interest groups lobby under such conditions of uncertainty and
   then test these using a heteroskedastic probit model that we apply to a
   unique longitudinal survey of interest groups in Japan. We find that
   when it is unclear if the party controlling the government will maintain
   power in the future, interest groups are more likely to contact the
   bureaucracy. When it is believed that the party in power will retain
   control for a considerable period, interest groups are more inclined to
   contact politicians. In addition, during times of government
   uncertainty, interest groups that are supportive of the governing party
   (or parties) are more likely to contact politicians and those that are
   less supportive will be more likely to contact bureaucrats.},

Abstract = {Scholarship on the political thought of James Madison has long been
   divided between adherents of the ``liberal{''} and ``republican{''}
   views, with a fusion between them recently emerging as the dominant
   understanding. Yet one element of Madison's thought cannot be neatly
   elided: the question of which value prevails when balancing mechanisms
   fail and a choice between majority rule and minority rights is
   unavoidable. This essay argues that Madison sided emphatically with
   majority rule, even when the majority in question was factious. His
   criticism of majorities is never tantamount to questioning their
   entitlement to rule: on the contrary, the analysis of Federalist 10, his
   clearest indictment of majority factions, is completely compatible with
   their democratic legitimacy. This vindication of majority factions when,
   however rarely, they formed is most evident in Madison's defense of the
   legitimacy of the 1820 Missouri Compromise, despite what he believed to
   be its factious nature.},

   The relationship between senators' religious identities, party

   themselves into the party that most closely resembles the values of

Abstract = {What, if anything, do the `square' protests and `occupy' movements of
   2011 bring to contemporary democratic theory? And how can we, as
   political theorists, analyse their discourse and do justice to it? We
   address these questions through an analysis of the Greek and Spanish
   protest movements of the spring and summer of 2011, the so-called
   aganaktismenoi and indignados. We trace the centrality of the critique
   of representation and politics as usual as well as the ideas about
   horizontality and autonomy in the protesters' discourse. These ideas are
   not only important to their critique of the contemporary liberal
   democratic regimes in the two countries, but also important to the way
   in which the protesters organise themselves. Nonetheless, as we shall
   argue, the protesters are caught within a tension between horizontality
   and verticality, between autonomy and hegemony, or between moving beyond
   representation and accepting representational structures. Given this
   tension, we examine how the protesters negotiate it in three key areas:
   politics, representation and organisation. Drawing on Jacques Ranciere,
   we further argue that the protesters can be seen as making a claim to
   equal voice. This is what Ranciere refers to as politics proper, and the
   question is then whether such a politics is possible without falling
   back into traditional forms of politics.},

Volume = {107},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {A central question in the study of political development is how conflict
   between ethnic groups might be transcended. Findings from social
   psychology suggest that ethnically integrating institutions such as
   militaries or representative bodies may remove prejudices and
   exclusionary behavior that perpetuate interethnic animosity. Political
   scientists have tended to be skeptical, arguing that such processes may
   actually intensify or ``freeze{''} conflicting ethnic identities. I use
   evidence from a hard case-military reform in the aftermath of a brutal,
   ethnically charged civil war in Burundi-to study this issue. At the
   macro level, the Burundian military undertook extensive quota-based
   integration that nonetheless resulted in a cohesive institution. A
   micro-level natural experiment, which produces quasirandom exposure to
   ethnic integration through the military retirement age, shows that
   exposure to ethnic integration decreases prejudicial behavior and is
   benign with respect to ethnic salience. Together, these results suggest
   promise in ethnic integration.},

Abstract = {This article assesses the impact of ``opposition entrepreneurs{''} on
   affirmative vote percentages for special purpose local-option sales tax
   (SPLOST) proposals in counties of the Metropolitan Atlanta region. The
   main question addressed is how does the presence of identifiable
   opposition-leading entrepreneurs in SPLOST campaigns affect the
   affirmative ({''}yes{''}) vote percentages for these sales tax
   proposals? Aggregate-level county data and election-specific campaign
   data were collected for 86 county and school district SPLOST referenda
   in 15 counties in the Metropolitan Atlanta region during the time period
   spanning from 1998 through 2011. The results of ordinary least square
   regression analyses support the hypothesis that the presence of
   opposition entrepreneurs in SPLOST campaigns reduces affirmative voting.
   The results indicate that opposition, by itself, is not sufficient to
   impact voting outcomes in tax referendum elections. Rather,
   consequential opposition efforts need to be led by an identifiable
   leader.},

Abstract = {The contrast between the predictability of presidential elections and
   the variability of early polls has come to be viewed as evidence that
   campaigns provide crucial information to voters. We argue that
   unmotivated survey respondents offering minimally acceptable answers
   (i.e., satisficing) offers an additional explanation for the classic
   conundrum of why the polls vary when the election outcome is
   predictable. The analysis relies on data from the National Annenberg
   Election Survey, a natural experiment that results from California's
   election laws, and the 2000 ANES survey mode experiment. The results
   support the claim that respondents' motivation to engage the survey
   question, not the information provided by the campaign, is the most
   important determinant of whether vote intentions reflect the
   ``correctly{''} weighted fundamentals. We conclude by discussing the
   implications of this finding for both survey-based and experimental
   studies of campaign effects.},

Abstract = {Information communication technologies have the potential to transform
   interactions between citizens and national Parliaments, with certain
   commentators even suggesting that information technologies have the
   capacity to reinvigorate democracy. This article examines an evaluation
   of the first ever e-consultation to be initiated by the Oireachtas from
   the perspectives of both consulters and participants. While the
   e-consultation achieved notable successes in terms of Parliamentary
   reform and enticing members of the public to participate in
   policy-making processes, this does not constitute a shift towards
   e-democracy. Instead, it might be more accurately defined in terms of a
   managerial, e-government approach, where processes such as the
   e-consultation are perceived by elected representatives and
   administrators alike as appendages to existing, centralised
   decision-making power.},

Title = {Explaining working-class support for extreme right parties: A party
   competition approach},
Journal = {ACTA POLITICA},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {48},
Number = {3},
Pages = {296-325},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Although the over-representation of working-class members among the
   electorates of Extreme Right Parties (ERPs) in Western Europe is well
   documented, previous studies have usually explained this pattern as a
   result of this voter group's changing political preferences. In contrast
   to these studies, this article argues that it is not the changing
   political preferences of the working class that lead them to vote for
   ERPs, but changes in the supply side of party competition that have
   caused the re-orientation of these voters from left-wing parties toward
   the extreme right. Differentiating between an economic and a cultural
   dimension of party competition, it is shown that both the policy options
   offered by parties to voters as the salience of the two issue-dimensions
   have changed dramatically over the last three decades. While the
   salience of economic issues as well as of party system polarization
   among these issues have declined in most Western European countries, the
   very opposite trend can be identified for non-economic issues, including
   the core issues of ERPs (for example, immigration, and law-and-order).
   These changes on the supply side of party competition cause
   working-class voters to base their vote decisions solely on their
   authoritarian, non-economic preferences and not - as in the past - on
   their left-wing economic demands. The theoretical assumptions are tested
   empirically with data from the Eurobarometer Trend File for the period
   from 1980 to 2002. In contexts where the economic dimension is more
   polarized or more salient than the cultural dimension, the positive
   impact of being a member of the working class on the vote decision for
   an ERP is significantly reduced.},

Abstract = {How does redistributive policy affect the survival of authoritarian
   regimes? I argue that redistributive policy in favor of cities, while
   temporarily reducing urban grievances, in the long-run undermines regime
   survival by inducing urban concentration. I test the argument using
   cross-national city population, urban bias, and nondemocratic regime
   survival data in the post-WWII period. The results show that urban
   concentration is dangerous for dictators principally by promoting
   collective action, that urban bias induces urban concentration, and that
   urban bias represents a Faustian bargain with short-term benefits
   overwhelmed by long-term costs.},

Abstract = {Voting technologies frame the voting experience. Different ways of
   presenting information to voters, registering voter choices and counting
   ballots may change the voting experience and cause individuals to
   re-evaluate the legitimacy of the electoral process. Yet few field
   experiments have evaluated how voting technologies affect the voting
   experience. This article uses unique data from a recent e-voting field
   experiment in Salta, Argentina to study these questions. It employs
   propensity-score matching methods to measure the causal effect of
   replacing traditional voting technology with e-voting on the voting
   experience. The study's main finding is that while e-voters perceive the
   new technology as easier to use and more likely to register votes as
   intended-and support replacing traditional voting technologies with
   e-voting-the new technologies also raise some concerns about ballot
   secrecy.},

Abstract = {A common objection against deliberative democracy relates to the
   impression that citizens, in general, are unwilling to participate in
   democratic politics. We contribute to the growing literature that
   challenges this impression by analyzing the discursive profile of
   citizens that participate in deliberation. By discursive profile, we
   refer to participants' own perceived role in the democratic process and
   their articulated motivations for joining a deliberative forum. We find
   that those who turned up in face-to-face deliberation tend to be less
   cynical toward politics. Moreover, based on their expressed motivations
   for participating, it can be inferred that linking the deliberative
   forum to decision makers provided an initial hook to participants.
   However, this changed as participants completed the process. At the end
   of deliberations, appreciation for the process itself ended up being the
   most resonant sentiment. These findings are based on both quantitative
   and qualitative analyses of data gathered from Australia's First
   Citizens' Parliament.},

Title = {The Programmatic Development of CDU and CSU since Reunification:
   Incentives and Constraints for Changing Policy Positions in the German

Abstract = {Like all political parties in modern democracies, the major German
   parties face challenges caused by changes both in the social structure
   of the electorate and in value orientations. Generally speaking, parties
   have to adopt policy positions that take into account changes in the
   preferences and structure of the electorate in order to maximise their
   share of votes. This article focuses on the programmatic development of
   the German Christian Democrats since reunification and discusses the
   incentives and constraints faced by the CDU and CSU to change their
   policy positions over time. By discussing patterns of social change,
   voting behaviour and (intra-)party competition in the German multi-level
   system, we derive several hypotheses about the programmatic development
   of the CDU and CSU since 1990. We evaluate these expectations on the
   basis of a dataset that covers information on the policy positions of
   all the major German parties - the CDU/CSU, SPD, FDP, the Greens and the
   PDS/Linke' - on the federal and state level in the time period from 1990
   to 2011. The results show that there is no distinct trend in the
   programmatic development of the Christian Democrats. However, we do find
   evidence to suggest that the German Christian Democrats take the
   setting' of an election into account; that is, they adopt policy
   positions according to the social structural profile of the electorate
   when the CDU or the CSU compete for votes in elections for the Lander
   parliaments.},

Title = {Policy Analysis beyond Personal Law: Muslim Women's Rights in India},
Journal = {POLITICS \& POLICY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {41},
Number = {3},
Pages = {384-419},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Granting legal rights to groups in deeply divided societies is important
   and necessary, but the cost of awarding these rights-in terms of their
   negative impact on civil rights, and particularly on women's rights-are
   key issues affecting the politics and policy of diverse polities. The
   article explores the implications for Muslim women of applying minority
   autonomy in India. In parallel, it delves into India's policy of
   religious autonomy for minorities as viewed by the political and legal
   authorities, and through the eyes of different sectors of the minority
   community. Analyzing the complex construction of rights within a
   communalized polity, this article attempts to transcend the ongoing
   debate on the implications of Muslim Personal Law in India and suggests
   policy directives aimed at empowering minority women. The Indian case
   provides a constructive microcosm for studying these tensions
   comprehensively and comparatively, and holds important lessons for other
   multicultural societies worldwide.},

Abstract = {As the medium of democracy, the Public is a communicational trace of the
   missing Collective Sovereign: the People or Demos. In political life, we
   often refer to the People, but in reality the People does not make a
   community. It is instead a notion, a missing Sovereign, the one who
   exists as concept but does not speak for oneself. The community is yet
   to be established, and this can be done only by communication. The aim
   of such communication is to formulate norms, rules and principles which
   are to be implemented or encouraged in public life. On a more normative
   level, this can be done in the process of writing a Constitution. The
   other objective is to discuss the concept of public good. This is left
   to communicational functions of the Public. The concept of the Public is
   left to citizens, who communicate with other citizens, and thus create
   public opinion. By doing that, the Public is here to remind the
   government that somebody else is to be Sovereign, i.e. that there is
   also the People. The Public is thus a substitute for the ``missing
   Sovereign{''}. There can be no Democracy without this role of the
   Public.},

   v. Yoo, Doe v. Rumsfeld, and Vance v. Rumsfeld display, even when the
   rights violations involve torture and similar acts, which ``shock the
   conscience,{''} there is no Bivens relief available to plaintiffs.},

Abstract = {We examine how war and rivalry affect state building in the Middle East.
   We argue that wars and rivalries promote state capacity, defined as the
   ability of a government to penetrate society for the purposes of
   resource extraction. Using cross-national time-series data for eighteen
   Middle Eastern countries from 1960 to 2003, we find that the structural
   pressure caused by the presence of international and domestic rivals
   augments extractive capacity. Conversely, both international and civil
   wars jeopardize state building in the Middle East. Furthermore, the
   negative effects of war upon state capacity are far greater than the
   constructive effects of rivalry.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to reintroduce discussions on gender relations in
   politics back into scholarly and political debate. Many countries have
   adopted gender quotas, but it is unclear whether their implementation
   has meaningfully changed the prevalent inequalities governing gender
   relations in politics. This article considers whether the implementation
   of gender quotas could promote change, and assesses this change with
   reference to five criteria formerly used to assess the strategy of
   gender mainstreaming. These are a shift towards a more comprehensive
   concept of gender equality; the incorporation of a gender perspective
   intersected with other inequalities in mainstream politics; equal
   political representation; organizational changes in selection and
   recruitment mechanisms as well as the functioning of politics; and,
   finally, the displacement of hierarchies, and the empowerment of
   subjects. Reflection on and empirical illustrations of gender quotas
   with regard to these criteria reveal a mixed picture, demonstrating the
   need to reintroduce discussions about gender equality within politics
   back into gender quota debates. This discussion will not focus on the
   legitimacy of or need for gender quotas, but on how their implementation
   can contribute to the improvement of gender relations in politics beyond
   a quantitative sense. Approaching gender quotas through the use of
   criteria devised for assessing the gender mainstreaming strategy is
   helpful in exploring the potential of gender quotas in the
   transformation of gender relations.},

   drugs, the variety of proposals for drug decriminalization on offer face
   technical inconsistencies that prove self-defeating. Instead, the topic
   of prohibitionism must be located as a major global and geopolitical
   problem, making such a paradigm shift impossible to overturn in the
   short, medium and long term.},

Abstract = {The Urdu-speaking population' in Bangladesh, displaced by the Partition
   in 1947 and made stateless' by the Liberation War of 1971, exemplifies
   some of the key problems facing uprooted populations. Exploring
   differences of camp' and non-camp' based displacement, this article
   represents a critical evaluation of the way political space' is
   contested at the local level and what this reveals about the nature and
   boundaries of citizenship. Semi-structured and narrative interviews
   conducted among camp' and non-camp' based Urdu-speakers' found that
   citizenship status has been profoundly affected by the spatial dynamics
   of settlement. However, it also revealed the ways in which formal'
   status is subverted - the moments of negotiation in which claims to
   political being are made. In asking how and when a stateless' population
   is able to access' citizenship, through which processes and by which
   means, it reveals the tension, ambiguity and conceptual limitations of
   statelessness' and citizenship, unearthing a reality of partial,
   shifting and deceptively permeable terrain. In doing so, it also reveals
   the dissonance and discord (constitutive of an us' and them' divide)
   upon which the creation of political space' may rely. Citizenship
   functions to exclude and, therefore, it is very often born of
   contestation.},

   horizons after AL-CUE VI Summit of Madrid held in 2010 and continued by
   I CELAC-EU Summit, which occurred in January 2013. The fact is that the

   The skepticism and lack of trust in the potential of this regional
   relationship, within the international political and economic context,
   give way to a wide range of possibilities and opportunities that should

Abstract = {Australia's first woman Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, was sworn into
   office in 2010. In 2012 she was driven to make a powerful speech on
   misogyny, which reverberated around the world. This research note
   explores the circumstances prompting the Prime Minister's speech and
   argues that the arrival of a woman Prime Minister helped bring into the
   open the gendered nature of politics. At a more formal level, sexist
   commentary focused on issues such as the Prime Minister's decision to be
   deliberately barren'. On talkback radio and the internet, sexual
   vilification took on more sexualized and violent forms. Increased
   awareness of the hostility being expressed about women in public life
   led to a feminist counter-campaign in 2012 using social media. In
   addition to the main argument, data is presented about the
   representation of women in Australian politics and the way that this has
   recently declined. It shows that electoral victories by parties that do
   not use gender electoral quotas have been largely responsible; Australia
   slipped from 15th to 45th place in the Inter-Parliamentary Union ranking
   for representation of women in national parliaments between 1999 and
   February 2013. The renewed attention to gender in politics is unlikely
   to halt this slippage in the short term.},

Abstract = {The focus of this article is on citizenship in its juridical sense.
   Other theorists, especially communitarians and civic republicans, have
   attempted to expand the idea of citizenship to include a
   social/political sense; they advocate expanding citizenship beyond its
   juridical confines to include civic participation as one of the
   hallmarks of citizenship. A new stage of expansion has begun; it is
   represented by those who want to make citizenship more multiple and
   flexible, to see citizenship in a more ethical/normative sense. These
   expansionist approaches do not jettison the juridical sense of
   citizenship. In fact, they build upon it. Therefore, these conceptions
   of citizenship become problematic to the extent that the juridical
   building block becomes problematic. Thus, the first task is to
   problematize this juridical sense of citizenship. This article explores
   a different critical path than the ones typically taken. It pushes the
   envelope by thinking about citizenship as a weapon. While more exposes
   of administrative and political abuses involving citizenship claims and
   issues are needed, this analysis unearths deeper, more fundamental
   problems with the concept of citizenship. Minimally, it pushes the
   debate beyond how inclusive or expansive citizenship should be made. It
   calls for a radical reappraisal of citizenship by recognizing
   citizenship as a weapon.},

Abstract = {This research examines recent electoral reform in French politics, and
   whether such reforms have served to minimize the overall impact of the
   earlier passage of gender parity law in 2000. As such, this is a study
   of how party elites often take steps to thwart any changes in the status
   quo that will endanger their own existing advantage or position.
   Specifically, we examine the increase in the number of two-round
   plurality districts for the Senate and the change from nationwide to
   regional districts for elections to the European Parliament (EP).
   Analysis of the 2001, 2004, 2008 and 2011 Senate elections suggests that
   the plurality method resulted in fewer women being elected to office, as
   compared with those Senate districts that used a closed-list
   proportional method, especially as a greater number of Senate districts
   began using the plurality method after the 2003 Raffarin reforms.
   Examining the 2004 and 2009 EP elections, we also find that the change
   to eight regional districts had an adverse effect on the election of
   female MEPs, primarily because fewer women were at the head of the
   regional party lists. Party proliferation in the 2004, 2008 and 2011
   Senate elections also served to reduce the number of women elected in
   these races.},

Abstract = {For over a century, the Canadian state funded a church-run system of
   residential schools designed to assimilate Aboriginal children into
   Euro-Canadian culture. In addition to the problems associated with its
   ethnocentric philosophy, the school system was also characterised by
   terrible health conditions and physical and sexual abuse of the students
   was widespread. Recently, the schools have been the object of the most
   successful struggle for redress in Canadian history. One particularly
   puzzling aspect about the school system is that it persisted for so
   long, despite that many of its failings were known very early in its
   operation. In this article, this puzzle is addressed via a cultural
   analysis of a political struggle over the residential schools that
   occurred within Canadian Anglicanism at the outset of the twentieth
   century. The article concludes that the meaning of the school system as
   a sacred enterprise contributed to its persistence.},

Abstract = {State governments have experienced considerable institutional change in
   the last several decades. None appeared at first glance to be as
   far-reaching as the legislative term limits that were adopted by over 20
   states in the 1990s. The evidence to date suggests that term limits have
   indeed changed the character of many of the states' legislatures, if not
   always as predicted by their advocates. We report data on veto dynamics
   over the period 19892008 to determine how term limits have impacted
   legislative-executive relations. Our data both challenge and support
   what has become the conventional wisdom, i.e., that term limits will
   weaken legislatures relative to their governors. States with more
   stringent term limits experienced fewer gubernatorial vetoes but proved
   more likely to override those vetoes when they were issued. Taken
   together the evidence suggests that the relationship between governors
   and legislatures in the wake of term limits is more complex and variable
   than scholars and others had previously thought.},

Title = {Politics and ethics in Aristotle and Machiavelli: a counterpoint to
   think political happiness.},
Journal = {ANACRONISMO E IRRUPCION},

Volume = {3},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {This article centers on the comparative analysis between the works of
   Aristotle and Machiavelli, taking into account the notion of happiness
   as its backbone. Although the Stagirite's remarks regarding eudaimonia
   are widely known, we can't state the same about the Florentine. Hence,
   our point of departure will be the formulation of a brand new
   hypothesis: Machiavelli's thought involves a consideration of happiness,
   though in a shaded fashion if we compare it with the thorough approach
   developed by the Stagirite. The comparative analysis between both
   authors is how we intend to grasp this new conception, political
   happiness.
   To this end, our paper is articulated in three main sections. In the
   first one, we briefly recount the category of eudaimonia within the
   Aristotelic philosophy in order to introduce the issue of happiness in
   Machiavelli. In the second part, we take a few steps into the prospect
   of thinking the category of political happiness by relating some of the

Abstract = {Nearly unique amongst the world's monetary bodies, the Federal Reserve
   defies description as a central bank. A century after its creation, the
   Fed retains a hybrid structure of a president-appointed,
   Senate-confirmed Washington board and twelve largely privately directed
   regional reserve banks-each of which remains moored in the cities
   originally selected in 1914. In this article we investigate the origins
   of the Federal Reserve System, focusing on the selection of the twelve
   reserve bank cities. In contrast to accounts that suggest politics
   played no role in the selection of the cities, we suggest that a range
   of political interests shaped Democrats' choices in designing the
   reserve system. The result was a decentralized institution that
   initially proved unable to coordinate monetary policy-a key contributor
   to the onset of the Great Depression less than two decades later.},

   both in terms of liberal democracy (depending on the processes of
   capitalist modernization in Latin America) as in a socialist
   perspective. The analysis focuses on the discourse of the Liminal
   Manifesto of the students of Cordoba, and in its historical and

   same perspective, the interpretation of other relevant university

Abstract = {Although there is a lively academic debate about contemporary populism
   in Europe and Latin America, almost no cross-regional research exists on
   this topic. This article aims to fill this gap by showing that a minimal
   and ideological definition of populism permits us to analyse current
   expressions of populism in both regions. Moreover, based on a comparison
   of four prototypical cases (FN/ Le Pen and FPO/Haider in Europe and
   PSUV/Chavez and MAS/Morales in Latin America), we show that it is
   possible to identify two regional subtypes of populism: exclusionary
   populism in Europe and inclusionary populism in Latin America.},

   soldier and two other members can only serve for one term, if not
   shorter. This new CMC is also capable of commanding the PLA effectively.
   Xi can rely on this new team for power consolidation and employment at
   an earlier date. The PLA has firmly supported Xi's political leadership

Abstract = {In a late dialogue on English common law, Hobbes addressed a perennial
   problem: how to allow exceptions to general rules without amplifying
   divisive claims of sovereign arbitrariness. His solution extended
   Leviathan's arguments against lawyers but also relied heavily on a
   conception of equity that the earlier treatise tended to obscure. For
   Hobbes, equity was not only a mode of sovereign adjudication, but also
   an instrument for molding dispositions conducive to ``Civill Amity.{''}
   Long-term stability therefore demanded that the sovereign power to make
   exceptions be limited by a general human capacity to treat others
   fairly.},

Abstract = {Even though political parties maintain control of presidential
   nominations, little is known about what leads individual party members
   to participate in the process. Party elites have a collective incentive
   to nominate an electorally viable and ideologically unifying candidate,
   and they also have personal, strategic incentives that may foster or
   prevent their participation in the nominating process. Using endorsement
   data on a subset of party elites-members of the U.S. House of
   Representatives-this article finds that individual members of the
   extended party are strategic with their decision to participate in or
   abstain from the nomination process.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the influence of societal values on individual
   attitudes towards immigration and immigrants. We argue that conflict
   between individual and societal values leads individuals to be exposed
   to frames and opinions that are contrary to their values, evokes
   competing considerations and creates attitudinal ambivalence and
   volatility. To evade ambivalence, individuals whose values are in
   conflict with those of their society rely less on their core values to
   construct their attitudes. Using data from the first wave of European
   Social Surveys and relying on Heteroskedastic Maximum Likelihood
   Regression, we test our argument simultaneously for 18 European
   countries and show that deviations from society's conservation and
   self-transcendence values lead to greater ambivalence in attitudes
   towards immigration and immigrants. Our results provide evidence of the
   importance of the social context and society's shared values in
   influencing personal political attitudes and judgments.},

Abstract = {The use of experimental method in the world of economics, particularly
   because of that economic behavior is quite complex and human modeling is
   shaped by homo economicus, was met with great resistance for a long
   time. But human modeling of economics was widely criticized in the 1940
   and experimental studies on market structures have been taking first
   steps since then. This process led to experimental studies of individual
   decision-making in the 1960s and 70s. The importance of these studies
   has been noticed and a Nobel Prize was given to Vernon Smith for his
   contributions to experimental economics by Nobel Committee in 2002. The
   most important contribution to the economic theories of these
   experimental studies in economics is that it helps in finding the answer
   to the question to what extent economics theories are valid in real
   life.},

Abstract = {This paper explores whether invoking social norms, in the context of a
   persuasive appeal, affects individuals' willingness to take action for
   the public good. The framework I develop brings together a host of
   factors treated as distinct in past work, including attitudes, rhetoric,
   and social norms. I test predictions from this framework in an
   experiment that focuses on a particularly important behavior-actions
   regarding the consumption of energy. I find that highlighting norms in
   the context of an appeal for energy conservation increases the
   importance individuals' associate with these actions, intentions to
   conserve energy, and actual behavior on a light-bulb purchasing
   decision. The findings have implications more generally for
   understanding when individuals take actions that promote the public
   good.},

Abstract = {Because campaign spending correlates strongly with election results,
   observers of American politics frequently lament that money seems to buy
   votes. However, the apparent effect of spending on votes is severely
   inflated by omitted variable bias: The best candidates also happen to be
   the best fundraisers. Acting strategically, campaign donors direct their
   funds toward the ``best{''} candidates, who would be more likely to win
   even in a moneyless world. These donor behaviors spuriously amplify the
   correlation between spending and votes. As evidence for this argument, I
   show that (non-strategic) self-financed spending has no statistical
   effect on election results, whereas (strategic) externally-financed
   spending does.},

Abstract = {What happens when a ballot measure becomes an orphan and there are no
   campaign expenditures for or against the measure? California's
   Proposition 91 provides one example of such a scenario and offers a rare
   opportunity to study what voters learn about a ballot measure in the
   absence of a campaign. Using an election survey, I assess what voters
   exiting the polling booth learned about Proposition 91 and compare it to
   what they learned about several other measures on the same ballot. My
   results suggest that even without a campaign, a large majority of voters
   still know a fact about Proposition 91. I also find that campaigns can
   greatly increase knowledge of the facts they choose to emphasize. (C)

Abstract = {The idea of social capital has had a powerful impact on the study of
   politics, policy, and social science at large. Much of what we know
   about the causes and effects of social capital, however, is limited by
   the nature of data used regularly by scholars working in this area.
   Current data sets allow researchers to study changes in social capital
   over time at the national level and static differences in the
   distribution of social capital across the states. The inability of
   scholars to know how social capital varies over time and across space
   limits the kinds of questions that can be asked. In this article, we use
   sample data of more than 20,000 individuals conducted biannually in the
   continuous 48 states by the marketing research firm MediaMark Research,
   Inc. to create a unique measure of social capital that varies across
   time and space. These data are available at the state level from 1986
   through 2004.},

Abstract = {Recent literature has shown that the long established link between
   economic performance and electoral outcomes is conditioned by a
   country's institutions and government, what is often termed clarity of
   responsibility'. In this article two distinct dimensions of the clarity
   of the political context are identified: institutional and government
   clarity. The first captures the formal dispersion of government power,
   both horizontally and vertically. The second captures the cohesion of
   the incumbent government. Analysing survey data from 27 European
   countries, it is shown that voters' ability to hold governments to
   account, for both the economy and management of public services, is
   primarily influenced by the extent to which there is an identifiable and
   cohesive incumbent, whereas formal institutional rules have no direct
   impact on performance voting.},

Abstract = {Research on electoral systems and their effects is subject to great
   controversies. This article aims to present and analyze the different
   positions in the debate, as closely as possible to the original text and
   its explanatory approach. It deals with the differences in particular
   scientific interests, research methods, definitions of concepts and
   assumed causal relationships between the variables involved, discussing
   finally the particular thesis about the effects of electoral systems and
   the options among them. The article systematically analyzes the theory
   of electoral systems from a historical perspective by assessing the
   controversial contributions of five important social researchers from
   five countries, making a difference at national and international level:
   Maurice Duverger, Stein Rokkan, Douglas W. Rae, Giovanni Sartori, and
   Arend Lijphart. A sixth author is somewhat hidden, but undeniably
   present; the author of these observations. His own comparative studies
   on electoral systems - where the analysis of the transcendental
   contributions of his colleagues is based on - have also obtained a
   controversial acceptance in some of the referred works.},

Abstract = {The Turkish economy has been crisis-prone since the establishment of the
   Republic in 1923. The various policies that resulted from the series of
   crises following the 1929 world economic recession have not only shaped
   the country's integration into the global economy, but have also
   determined the specificities adopted by the accumulation regimes. The
   impact of the current global crisis on Turkey, and the government's
   reaction to it, need to be analysed in relationship to the existing
   accumulation regime shaped by the country's history. Thus, while this
   article is concerned with Turkey's reactions to the current global
   crisis, it contends that policies from 2008 onwards show a degree of
   continuity with the policies already in place to cope with the problems
   generated by the 1994 and 2001 crises experienced in the country. The
   internationalisation of the Turkish economy, the relationship between
   core and periphery within the country, and the shifting relations of
   production and labour relations have all informed the AKP's response.},

Abstract = {For a long time, European Studies and transformation research on Eastern
   Europe were separate disciplines. This is anachronistic. Political and
   socio-economic developments east and west are closely intertwined. Even
   during the transition process, politics, economics, and society in East
   Central Europe and Eastern Europe were largely determined by the
   European Union. Supposedly specific East European phenomena have become
   all-European. This is shown by the quality of democracy, the
   transnationalisation of European companies, and the return to
   intergovernmental decision-making at the EU level.},

Journal = {OSTEUROPA},

Volume = {63},
Number = {2-3},
Pages = {147+},
Month = {FEB-MAR},
Abstract = {Starting in the 18th century, the majority of the world's Jews lived in
   Eastern Europe. The region remained the centre of Jewish life - until
   the Holocaust. But in both disciplines, in Jewish History and in East
   European History, research on East European Jews lived in the shadows.
   In Germany, such research is inseparably connected with 20th century
   history. After the First World War and the wave of Russian-Jewish
   immigration to Germany that followed, Jewish history flourished: After
   1933, ``research on Jews{''} became an anti-Semitic discipline, which,
   from 1939 onward, served German policies of occupation and annihilation.
   In the postwar era, Jewish history was initially taboo. Not until the
   mid-1960s were the first chairs of Jewish Studies established. It was
   only in the 1980s that East European History, which was then oriented
   towards social history, began to examine Jews in the Russian Empire and
   the Soviet Union. Today, the study of East European Jewish history has
   become a paradigm for transnational and global historical questions.},

Abstract = {The systematic study of law in Eastern Europe began in the 1920s. The
   involvement of experts in eastern law during the Nazi era has hardly
   been researched. In the East-West conflict, many of the legal scholars
   who focused on Communist Eastern Europe emphasised the role of their
   discipline as part of a political struggle. With the collapse of
   Communism, this legitimacy was lost. Even the content of socialist law
   disappeared. However, the opening of the countries of East Central and
   Eastern Europe and the differentiation of their legal systems have
   produced many new possibilities: the study of East European law is
   important for practical legal advice and should be an integral part of
   both general comparative law, as well as regional research directed
   towards Eastern Europe.},

Abstract = {Some scholars known as offensive realists claim that in the uncertainty
   of world politics, trust and cooperation between states is extremely
   unlikely. Others, such as defensive realists, claim that rational states
   are capable of finding ways to counteract the complications created by
   misperceptions and distrust, and to reduce uncertainty to levels where
   it no longer inhibits cooperation. In this paper, we construct a formal
   model to show how in some situations cooperation between states is
   indeed very unlikely: even in the presence of minor misperceptions,
   states fail to cooperate. We then ask whether diplomacy (modeled as
   cheap talk) is able to remedy the failure. We show that in many
   situations, allowing the countries to communicate prior to taking their
   actions does not enable them to cooperate.},

Abstract = {Since the late 1990s, Latvia has increasingly made claim on the

   framing nineteenth-century national identities and their contemporary
   instrumentalization as tools in the construction of national identity.
   The article then considers the ``seizure'' of Berlin, Rothko, and
   Eisenstein as ``Latvians,'' arguing that this process has been
   undertaken for both international and domestic purposes-to socialize and
   integrate Latvia with the West, and to promote domestic value change.},

Abstract = {This paper disentangles the impact of various dimensions of European
   integration on different aspects of the Belgian federal polity. We
   discern two opposite trends. While the institutional embeddedness of
   Belgium as an EU member state results in domestic centralizing
   tendencies and co-operative political practices, economic integration
   stimulates political pressures for regional autonomy, contributing to
   further divergence and hollowing out of the federal level. We conclude
   by arguing that the EU clearly affects territorial politics in Belgium,
   but, as the European causes are multidimensional, that also the effects,
   albeit substantial, will be diverse.},

Pages = {671-682},
Abstract = {In his 2004 presidential campaign, John Kerry, a Catholic, was
   threatened with being denied Holy Communion because of his pro-choice
   voting record. This article investigates the extent to which communion
   denial impacted Catholic elected officials and analyzes public attitudes
   regarding communion denial for Kerry. The results of our analysis
   suggest that, despite heavy media coverage, few bishops endorsed the
   communion denial and few pro-choice Catholic officials were threatened.
   While the data also indicate there are meaningful political implications
   for public attitudes on communion denial, the tactic does not command
   support from many Catholics.},

Journal = {CIVIL WARS},

Volume = {15},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {71-87},
Abstract = {After a civil war, there is a keen interest in `getting the institutions
   right'. This article summarizes our knowledge of one particular
   institution, the electoral system, through a review of the literature on
   power sharing and electoral systems in post-conflict societies.
   Surprisingly, there is little statistical support for the conviction
   that proportional representation (PR) contributes to inclusive political
   institutions and thereby to peace and democracy. More positively, a
   closer look at electoral system design as integral part of peace
   agreements reveals that PR is the standard choice, that it works as
   intended, and has a good record in securing peace, though less so of
   democracy. Future research should look at electoral system design as
   part of the peace process to explain these findings and draw lessons.},

   Broadway Musicians brings the New Marxian Class Analysis to issues
   facing Broadway musicians today. Here, I summarize some of the main
   contributions of the book and critically engage with a few of the key
   elements of her analysis. The book is full of interesting details
   concerning how a musical is organized, the complicated contractual
   arrangements involved, and the working conditions facing musicians in
   the orchestra pit. With this background, Mulder employs a class analysis
   and arrives at a classtransformative strategy for the benefit of the
   union membership. Her analysis serves as an excellent model for future
   class-theoretic research.},

Abstract = {Udenistic liberalism did not limit itself to the scope of Parliament or
   Executive proceedings, but rather helped construct a broad spectrum of
   reflections about Br azil. In this manner, it is possible to refer to
   different types of udenism as spec ific veins in Brazil's liberal
   tradition. This article seeks to establish some distinctions within this
   tradition, focusing on the discussion of two particular v eins, each of
   which is deeply identified with two great personalities of the time:
   Afonso Arinos de Melo Franco and Carlos Lacerda. These veins are
   differentiated mainly by two points: how conflict is perceiv ed and the
   role attributed to the elite in political dispute. In this manner, there
   is pedagogical udenism, which views conflict in a negative light and
   assigns a mediating role to the elite. This is the viewpoint represented
   by Afonso Arinos. Conflictive udenism, on the other hand, involves the
   elite in political struggles and considers confrontation with the enemy
   to be the essence of political dispute. This is the viewpoint championed
   by Carlos Lacerda.},

Abstract = {A survey of post-1989 Romania is to indicate that while looking forward
   and striving for democratic achievements, the country also had to look
   backward and ``come to terms{''} with her non-democratic recent past.
   Unfortunately, for more than 15 years after the collapse of communism no
   firm resolution has been brought to any of these pasts. The present
   paper is an overview of the politics of memory and its impact on the
   process of democratization in the case of Romania from 1989 to 2004. In
   this sense it focuses mainly, but not exclusively, on the way Romanian
   society dealt with history, memory, and amnesia when it came to Ion
   Antonescu and the Romanian Holocaust.},

   on the basis of 47 in-depth interviews with women in higher positions of

   general and specific tendencies typical for the two countries. The
   research shows that in Russia the promotion of women in power depends on
   the `will of the chief executive' while in France the promotion of women
   in power is the result of individual career strategies.},

Abstract = {China safely gathered in its colonised territories of Hong Kong, in 1997
   from Britain, and Macau, in 1999 from Portugal. But Taiwan, regarded as
   a renegade Chinese province, remained frustratingly beyond the reach of
   the motherland's embrace despite a quickening pace of trade, investment
   and people exchanges across the Taiwan Strait. And the initial
   indications following the 18th party congress were that reconciliation
   was still a distant prospect. While Hong Kong is securely established as
   part of China as a Special Administrative Region, friction is rising
   between Hong Kong and mainland Chinese people that, in Hong Kong at
   least, threatened to command as much popular attention as the leadership
   transition in Beijing. South China Morning Post reporters also took an
   in-depth look at China's much-vaunted experimental zone, Qianhai, across
   the border from Hong Kong. Can it live up to its billing as the future
   ``Manhattan of the Pearl River Delta{''}?},

Volume = {57},

Abstract = {This article reexamines the argument that targeted programs increase
   pro-incumbent voting by persuading beneficiaries to cast ballots against
   their first partisan choice. The evidence comes from the randomized
   component of Progresa, the pioneering Mexican conditional cash transfer
   (CCT) program. Experimental data show that early enrollment in the
   program led to substantive increases in voter turnout and in the
   incumbents vote share in the 2000 presidential election. The experiment
   also reveals that opposition parties vote shares were unaffected by the
   program. Thus, the electoral bonus generated by CCTs may be best
   explained by a mobilizing rather than persuasive mechanism. These
   findings are difficult to reconcile with the notion that the electoral
   effects of CCTs are a result of prospective concerns triggered by
   threats of program discontinuation or endogenous program enrollment.
   Instead, the evidence in this article suggests that CCTs mobilizing
   effects are compatible with programmatic politics.},

   of the diplomatic and commercial relations of Venezuela with The United

   possible to see that throughout the XX century they changed profoundly,
   representing a truly inflexion period with the pos-cold war era.
   Generally, Venezuela was an important international actor because of its
   external politics activism and also its energetic resources, being an
   important piece for the regional stability. The economic bonds with the
   United States are, in great part, a consequence of the Great Industrial
   Potency considerable energetic demand in the XX century and the fact
   that Venezuela is not just a great oil producer but also a great
   exporter.},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The focus of this article is to understand the determinants of negative,
   positive, or neutral tone in campaign news coverage. Much of the extant
   literature suggests, to some extent, the negativity bias often seen in
   political news stems from profit making objectives. This article asserts
   that news outlet ownership structures and economic incentives, coupled
   with political context, influence the likelihood of positive, neutral,
   or negative tone in campaign news. The findings presented herein suggest
   that corporate, chain, and nonlocal ownership all have consequences for
   campaign news tone.},

Abstract = {Political corruption is a key theoretical issue regarding the quality of
   democracy. And it was a main theme from the empirical point of view
   during the Spanish local elections held on May 2007. This paper focuses
   upon the electoral behaviour of foreign European retirees on that
   occasion and aims to know whether and to what extent corruption
   mobilized those citizens. Data confirm that there is a relationship
   between public charges of political corruption and electoral
   mobilization, but this is not enough as to affect election results. The
   paper analyses MIRES3i survey results and basic data provided by both
   the electoral census and the population census.},

Abstract = {Today's East Asia is fraught with tension and conflicts. If the tension
   and conflicts cannot be truly resolved, can East Asia be treated as a
   whole for discussion? If it is possible and even necessary to speak of
   East Asia as a whole, then what is the internal adhesive for this whole?
   East Asia cannot obtain status as a single, self-sufficient, and static
   category: It refers to different entities in different historical
   periods, and has been referred to by different subjects in different
   periods of time. We can only discuss East Asia in specific historical
   contexts, and that is the only way to make the discussion meaningful.},

Abstract = {In March 2013, the British-led military assistance and training mission
   in Sierra Leone drew to a close, after more than a decade at the centre
   of efforts to reform the country's armed forces following its protracted
   civil war. The transition of the mission to the smaller but more broadly
   focused International Security Advisory Team has raised questions
   concerning both the sustainability of the reforms implemented to date
   and the prospects for success as attention turns to the wider civilian
   security sector. On the basis of interviews with those directly
   involved, Ashlee Godwin and Cathy Haenlein examine both the nature and
   timing of the transition, and the challenges facing the new mission.},

Abstract = {The 2012 Basque regional election, held on 25 March, resulted in a new
   government of the Basque Nationalist Party (PNV). The incumbent
   Socialist Party suffered a dramatic reduction in electoral support,
   obtaining just 19\% of the vote, far below the 30\% they had attained in
   2009. This was the first election held in the Basque Country without the
   looming shadow of ETA (Euskadi Ta Askatasuna; ``Basque Homeland and
   Freedom{''}). However, the influence of the economy was stronger than
   the nationalism issue in this election, as we show in this electoral
   report.},

Abstract = {Although research on professionalism in state legislatures has been
   substantial, professionalism research has ignored legislative bodies in
   local government, such as city councils and school boards. Using
   detailed school district-level data and an original survey of school
   board members in 210 school districts in California, we develop measures
   of professionalism in the local government context. We then use these
   measures to examine which characteristics of school districts are
   associated with greater professionalization. Consistent with findings in
   the state politics literature, we find that districts with greater
   resources and more heterogeneous environments exhibit higher degrees of
   professionalism than other districts.},

Abstract = {In the wake of Stuxnet, there has been an increasing tendency on the
   part of politicians and analysts to see the sophistication of a
   cyber-attack as an indication of its perpetrator. Indeed, the more
   sophisticated the attack, the more sophisticated the attacker, thereby
   pointing to a state actor as the culprit - or so it is argued. However,
   Clement Guitton and Elaine Korzak note the lack of clarity and
   inconsistency around the term `sophistication', contending that it is
   context-dependent and therefore that it cannot be used unquestioningly
   in identifying the perpetrator of a cyber-attack.},

Title = {``Listing terrorists{''}: the impact of proscription on third-party
   efforts to engage armed groups in peace processes - a practitioner's
   perspective},
Journal = {CRITICAL STUDIES ON TERRORISM},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {189-208},
Abstract = {This article explores the effects of proscription - the act of listing
   an armed group as a designated terrorist organisation - as an example of
   how international counterterrorist policy can impact on the possibility
   for third-party actors to engage with listed armed groups in the context
   of peace processes. From a peace practitioner's perspective, the article
   draws on findings from a series of workshops organised with high-level
   mediators, counterterrorism policy-makers and diplomats, and interviews
   with policy actors and non-governmental peace-building organisations.
   The article concludes that the listing of armed groups as terrorist
   organisations is having serious consequences on the ability of
   third-party actors to engage with armed groups. It has affected both of
   the preconditions of access and trust, thereby narrowing the
   possibilities for third parties to effectively understand groups,
   influence them, affect their strategic calculations and train them in
   conflict resolution. The global proscription regime appears to be
   eroding in practice, with state third-party actors choosing to opt out
   of international proscription regimes. Doubts about the legality of
   third-party engagement are creating a new selective pressure on what
   types of conflict resolution activities are possible.},

Abstract = {The research is exploratory and we aimed to identify through a
   questionnaire, what are the possible determinants of organizational
   climate perceived by students of industrial engineering at the UNET
   (Tachira university) that may be present in the process of academic
   training of future professionals the Tachira who will make life in the
   different sectors of both the state and the country. It is Considered a
   field investigation because the information was lifted directly from the
   object of study that statistically was represented by 178 students of
   the career, where 78 were from the basic cycle and 100 from the
   professional cycle. To construct the instrument initially students were
   surveyed, the information was triangulated with document review and
   expert opinion, thereby achieving the possible determinants of
   organizational climate that were valued by students according to their
   level of importance. The result was, there are 10 conditions that will
   measure the state of organizational climate during the process of
   education: Student characteristics, family issues, school history, study
   skills, teaching and learning methods, Physical conditions of
   Infrastructure, Support regard to the quality of student life, attitude
   of teachers towards students, attitude among students, student planning,
   concluding that the level of importance of these variables is very
   similar for the basic cycle students as professional cycle.},

Title = {HRM Reform in Decentralised Local Government: Empirical Perspectives on
   Recruitment and Selection in the Philippines and Thailand},
Journal = {ASIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {21},
Number = {3},
Pages = {249-267},
Abstract = {Over the recent decades decentralisation has been an influential process
   for public sector reform. Like many countries in Southeast Asia, the
   Philippines and Thailand have experienced a transitional period of
   decentralisation since the 1990s, but its corresponding results are
   considered to be poor, allowing for an increase in corruption associated
   with local elites and other interested parties. This article addresses
   the problem by focusing on Human Resource Management (HRM), with an
   emphasis on recruitment and selection in decentralised local
   governments, as there exists limited research in this area. Despite
   similar outlook of decentralisation reforms in these countries, the
   comparative analysis will illustrate differences in HRM policy
   arrangements between the central and local government, which reflect on
   the roots and backgrounds of the reform initiatives in each country.
   Moreover, empirical case observations at the local level from four case
   cities will present positive HRM practices, as well as the negative
   ones. Such evidence cannot be explained by contemporary theories on
   decentralisation, most of which doubt feasibility of the reform in
   developing countries.},

Title = {Palpable insecurity and Sen's comparative view of justice:
   anthropological considerations},
Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {16},
Number = {2},
Pages = {266-283},
Abstract = {Amartya Sen's comparative approach to justice makes clear that notions
   of justice are shaped by human agency and experience, and both his focus
   on the `internal view' of well-being that emphasizes suffering as a
   central feature of illness and his recognition that social and cultural
   factors shape perceived injustice are critical to this approach.
   However, Sen questionably depicts the contributions of anthropological
   research to this project as limited to `the sensory dimension of
   ill-health.' Focusing on mental health in the context of global justice,
   I argue that Sen's treatise on justice can be refined through an
   ethnographic method that synchronizes attention to (1) cultural
   knowledge and social relations in ecological settings; (2) fundamental
   human needs; and (3) levels of analytic specificity involving
   situations, categories, and events. This method integrates analysis of
   internal phenomenology and external constraints of political economy and
   ideology. To demonstrate I discuss three cases involving students and
   violence in Rio de Janeiro, women and witchcraft in Ghana, and
   historical migration and war trauma among Vietnamese immigrants in which
   external conditions of insecurity and inequality contributed to
   deteriorating mental health conditions including depression, trauma, and
   debilitating anxiety.},

Abstract = {The Pearl River Delta, after pell-mell industrialization, suffers air
   pollution. Two-thirds of the pollutants come from Hong Kong-owned
   factories in Guangdong. Direct 2011 medical costs in Hong Kong are
   reliably estimated at US\$513 million, and annual excess Hong Kong
   deaths from air pollution exceed 3,000. Dirty air hurts quality of life,
   recruitment of professionals, tourism, and other desiderata-including
   government legitimacy. This article surveys the relevant politics,
   medicine, economics, and air chemistry, recommending cap-and-trade
   policies that are acceptable where markets now rule in both
   ``systems{''} of Hong Kong-Guangdong. It stresses the need for official
   enforcement of caps. Although local governments have cooperated to
   establish air-monitoring stations, they have yet to leverage Hong Kong's
   expertise in regulation and Guangdong's potential for manufacture of
   air-cleansing equipment. They need a regional emissions trading scheme
   (ETS). With Beijing's plans to have a nationwide ETS by 2015, this
   severe problem could be solved sooner rather than later.},

Abstract = {The study focuses on the evaluative dimension of social movements. The
   central question is: How do values and ideas shape collective identity
   during the process of mobilization? This issue is examined in three
   steps: in the first step, we investigate the relationship between
   cultural values and collective identities from a sociological
   perspective. In the second step, the discussion shifts to the influence
   of general value commitments on the mobilization of the Occupy movement
   in the USA. Based on a content analysis of text material from two
   sources-magazine articles and Tactical Briefings from the Adbusters
   Media Foundation's website-we examine similarities and differences in
   cultural orientations. In the third step, we analyse the central value
   relations in the discursive space that shaped the collective identity of
   the Occupy movement.},

Title = {Between Multitude and Pueblo: Venezuela's Bolivarian Revolution and the
   Government of Un-governability},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {35},
Number = {4},
Pages = {567-585},
Abstract = {Venezuela's Bolivarian Revolution uses officially sponsored
   commemorations, festivals, and publications to underscore its relation
   to and dependence on unrest and ungovernability. In this way, it founds
   a basis and legitimacy not through a historical link to a people or
   territory, juridical recognition of sovereignty, nor to bureaucratic and
   institutional continuity, but rather to a direct link to constituent
   power. However, as opposed to other cases in the Republican tradition
   that celebrate the revolutionary origins of modern nation states, this
   article contends that this discursive practice highlights the way in
   which the Bolivarian Revolution shuttles between poles of
   un-governability and representation, reflected at a subjective level in
   the figures of the multitude and the pueblo. I suggest a reading of
   official discourses that celebrate the autonomous and collective
   subjects of the caracazo-an anti-neoliberal uprising and massacre in
   1989-and the April 2002 coup and counter-coup as valorizations of
   un-governability. The article contends that these dynamics illustrate a
   desired and novel-but as yet not fully realized-democratic praxis that
   breaks with forms of constituted (state) power more familiar to the
   Western and North Atlantic political traditions.},

Abstract = {This article addresses how the work of the French philosopher Jean-Luc
   Nancy might inform our understanding of `social authority'; an authority
   generated in everyday practices. It argues that the `governmentality'
   approach, while drawing out the forms of power that fill the sphere of
   community-oriented politics, does not recognise the important role
   played by the loss of community. The article thus sets out how Nancy's
   work, in re-framing this `loss' as the constantly occurring
   fragmentation of the community, allows for a productive and augmentative
   approach to authority, highlighting its contingent production in moments
   of creativity and contestation. A final section sets out how, in light
   of these considerations, such a `social authority' may be seen as
   essential to a democratic politics.},

Abstract = {This article deals with the issue of the peace-building process in
   countries with long-standing civil wars and the factors that might
   influence such processes. Based on my analysis, I identify two types of
   factors that might influence the peace process: power-sharing
   arrangements as an institutional factor, and attitudes of internal
   actors of the peace process as an agency factor. In this article I
   analyze the peace-building process in the West African country of
   Liberia. The peace-building process is analyzed through the study of the
   two main peace treaties signed to end the Liberian civil war in the
   1990s: the Treaties of Abuja and Accra. In the analysis, I focus mainly
   on the extent to which the peace treaties incorporate the elements of
   power-sharing as well as the motivations, decision-making, and behavior
   of internal actors involved in the peace building process during the
   implementation of the peace treaties. The goal of this analysis is to
   reveal which dominant factor influenced the stability of the
   peace-building process in Liberia.},

Journal = {POLITIX},

Abstract = {How do local authorities of small periurban towns come to adopt national
   housing policy in order to influence their built environment and
   population - be it in favor of home ownership or mixed-income
   regulations? We seek to answer this question with this article. Based on
   the study of a growing residential community outside of Lyon known to
   vote left wing since 1983, we will tackle the question of diversity
   policies, one that is rarely posed when discussing this type of
   periurban settlement. Our analysis on the sociopolitical and
   institutional logics underlying the construction of housing developments
   reveals their ambiguity: the larger ``American style{''} residences aim
   to attract middle class families from urban areas, while affordable
   housing quotas are imposed in new programs in order to meet the needs of
   the local modest households. Nevertheless, local policies are strongly
   influenced by real estate developers, especially in periods of economic
   crisis. The statistical analysis of population settlements reveals the
   gap between the political project of social diversity and its concrete
   realization, and further shows the appearance of ethno-racial and
   socioeconomic micro-segregations happening at the level of residential
   sections.},

Abstract = {This article asks why, and when, the process of nominating candidates in
   the United States changed from conventions to direct primaries. We
   conduct an event history analysis to investigate rival explanations for
   why the rules governing nominations changed. One credits reformist
   pressures that were largely external to the interests of the major
   political parties. Another proposes that party elites adopted direct
   primaries to protect their internal interests. We produce some results
   consistent with each explanation, but find the weight of our evidence
   supports the idea that rules changed in response to anti-party reform
   pressures.},

Abstract = {Contemporary authoritarian regimes frequently coexist with a range of
   non-governmental associations, while resisting any trajectory towards
   democratization. This article reviews three major explanations for such
   political interactions, before proposing an alternative explanatory
   framework, using Young's dualistic approach to civil society. This
   approach stresses that the discursive role of civil society needs to be
   understood in order to explain the dynamics of coercion and cooperation
   faced by civil society organizations under authoritarian rule.},

Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},

Pages = {145-162},
Abstract = {As a multiethnic, multicultural and multilingual society, Israeli
   society has a high degree of social segmentation. One of the main tools
   to deal with the prevailing high level of social conflict is fostering
   the participation of youth in encounter groups, which promote dialogue
   and coexistence between social groups in conflict.
   Within the various approaches and teaching methods developed for
   encounters between Arabs and Jews, we can identify the pros and cons of
   each model. This article refers to them, analyzing and characterizing
   the model promoted by the Gesher Foundation(Bridge), which has fostered
   dialogue encounters on the secular-religious conflict that led to the
   murder of the Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in 1995.
   The present study suggests that this model is characterized by adopting
   tools and techniques from the varied and various existing currents in
   the field of intercultural dialogue. It is also proposed in the article
   that the structure of the meeting sponsored by Gesher, its logic and
   workflow development reflects characteristic elements of the
   transformative mediation.
   Therefore, this study suggests that such models should be employed in
   societies with increasing social polarization, as is the case with
   Israeli society.},

Abstract = {Between 1784 and 1795, the first U.S. standing armies were sent in
   relentless waves against the peoples of the Old Northwest, to initiate
   the conquest of the American empire in `the West'. Typically, following
   a short pretense of diplomacy, the U.S. army initiated campaigns of
   terror accompanied by massacres of inconvenient peoples. Using the
   specific example of the Miami peoples of Indiana between 1788 and 1791,
   this article will describe the fractal nature of the successive waves of
   attacks, deconstruct U.S. massacre rhetoric, and highlight the
   contemporary analyses of events by the Native peoples of the Old
   Northwest.},

Title = {Hegemonic Duopoly at the Grass Roots: Why Progressive Third Parties
   Rarely Win State House Elections},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {35},
Number = {2},
Pages = {250-271},
Abstract = {This article addresses why US progressive third parties today seldom win
   state legislative elections, despite apparent opportunities to the
   contrary. It analyzes seventeen illustrative races for state
   representative in New England. It finds that seemingly viable
   progressive third-party candidates often lose because they are not
   sufficiently connected to their districts socially. Due to this deficit,
   they are unable to appeal to as many voters as typically better
   connected major party opponents. This is interpreted as indicative both
   of major parties' hegemonic ability to dominate local elections through
   sheer social influence and of the corresponding need for progressive
   third parties to develop more such influence.},

   We use the comparative advantages, as a tool of economic theory, applied

   agri-food of the harmonized system (HS) international trade for its
   acronym in English, for the period 2007 to 2011. Found that in Mexico
   there are 8 chapters with comparative advantage, and in United States 10
   of 24. For Mexico, the stage is unfavourable in relation to the world's
   largest agricultural economy, when in June of 2013 proposed support by
   890 billion dollars for the ``Farm Bill{''} 2014-2018 in the U.S.},

Abstract = {The contemporary dynamics of proxy warfare will make it a significant
   feature of the character of conflict in the future. Andrew Mumford
   identifies four major changes in the nature of modern warfare and argues
   that they point to a potential increase in the engagement of proxy
   strategies by states: the decreased public and political appetite in the
   West for large-scale counter-insurgency `quagmires' against a backdrop
   of a global recession; the rise in prominence and importance of Private
   Military Companies (PMCs) to contemporary war-fighting; the increasing
   use of cyberspace as a platform from which to indirectly wage war; and
   the ascent of China as a superpower.},

Journal = {ACTA POLITICA},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {48},
Number = {1},
Pages = {92-116},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Despite being among the most important indicators of political
   participation, relatively little is known about the origins and the
   development of political interest over the lifespan. The formative years
   between childhood and adulthood are generally considered a crucial phase
   in which future electors form and strengthen political habits. The aim
   of this research is to better understand this important stage by
   examining the way in which parental socialization and life-cycle events
   affect the formation and growth of political interest during adolescence
   and young adulthood. While parental influences are expected to take
   place during childhood and persist over-time, life-cycle events are
   considered to influence development in early adulthood for those
   adolescents who did not grow up in a highly politicized environment. We
   assess these assumptions by applying latent growth curve modeling and
   using the German Socio-Economic Panel, which spans from 1984 to 2007.
   Our findings confirm strong parental socialization effects on interest
   levels during teenage years. While life-cycle events are not found to
   strongly affect the development of political interest during the
   formative years, the transition to adulthood is indeed a more critical
   period for those individuals who did not acquire high levels of interest
   from their family. Acta Politica (2013) 48, 92-116. doi:

Title = {Imagining nationhood: narratives of belonging and the question of a
   Christian state in Fiji},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE PEACE \& SECURITY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {25},
Number = {2},
Pages = {227-242},
Abstract = {The idea that Fiji should be a Christian state resurfaces periodically.
   In 2012, it has appeared in a number of submissions to the Constitution
   Committee from the Methodist Church and a political party, the SDL, both
   of which are known to have strong support from the majority of iTaukei
   (indigenous Fijians). This paper explores how an influential faction of
   iTaukei Methodists has imagined Fiji as a Christian community connected
   to ` place' through kinship and narratives of historical belonging.
   After sketching out iTaukei claims that resulted in the 1987 and 2000
   coups, it examines the impact of the 2010 Decree, which shifted the word
   ` Fijian' from being a marker of racial identity to one of national
   identity, and shows the disjunction between notions of a democracy based
   on international conceptions of human rights and the desire of many
   iTaukei for a Christian state. This religious nationalism reflects the
   tension between communal and national identities, paralleling similar
   tensions in countries like India. Lastly, the article examines some of
   the public responses to the Constitution Commission, which was the first
   time since the 2006 coup that the public have felt able to openly
   discuss their views about governance in Fiji.},

Abstract = {This article examines two prominent ideologues, Ali Shariati of Iran and
   Maulana Maududi of Pakistan, in order to determine their influence on
   national politics in the second half of the 20th century. Were they only
   fundamental actors of political Islam in their societies, or did they
   also have a significant impact on the reformation of Iranian and
   Pakistani nationalism? If they did, who exactly were Shariati and
   Maududi, and what are their legacies? In order to answer these
   questions, this article focuses on the Iranian experience with
   nationalism before and after the Iranian Revolution (1979) and Pakistani
   nationalism embedded with Islamism from independence (1947) until the
   end of the 1980s. In light of Ranajit Guha's concept of hegemony, this
   article brings to the foreground the possibility of alternative ways of
   thinking and belonging.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ELECTIONS PUBLIC OPINION AND PARTIES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {23},

Pages = {49-65},
Abstract = {In list PR systems, the criteria applied in the candidate selection
   process can be analysed by contrasting the realistic and marginal
   candidates with the non-realistic candidates on the list. Realistic
   candidates stand a large chance, for marginal candidates this chance is
   more dependent on their personal result or the result of the list. This
   approach was applied to the Belgian Chamber elections in the period
   1999-2010. A multilevel multinomial regression analysis shows that
   incumbents, mayors and party employees stand a significantly larger
   chance of being selected as a realistic or marginal candidate. No
   evidence was found of a specific gender bias. Once the above-mentioned
   variables are taken into account, previous campaign experience has a
   negative effect on the odds of being selected. For the marginal
   positions, parties particularly seek local office holders from larger
   municipalities.},

Abstract = {Russia's centenary celebrations for the Patriotic War of 1812 were
   organized by the government, military, and church at the general
   exclusion of the public. By concealing the crisis-ridden present in
   favour of commemorating a glorious past, Russia's tsarist regime sought
   to unify the nation around the throne. The official events and projects
   for the 100th anniversary of the war were relatively effective because
   the regime drew on the traditional narrative that Russia, as a leading
   spiritual and moral power and bastion of true Christianity, would always
   be in a position to fend off attacks by seemingly superior Western
   opponents.},

Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {16},

Pages = {557-572},
Abstract = {Could the notion of compromise help us overcoming - or at least
   negotiating - the frequent tension, in normative political theory,
   between the realistic desideratum of peaceful coexistence and the
   idealistic desideratum of justice? That is to say, an analysis of
   compromise may help us move beyond the contrast between two widespread
   contrasting attitudes in contemporary political philosophy: `fiat
   iustitia, pereat mundus', on the one side, and `salus populi suprema
   lex', on the other side. More specifically, compromise may provide the
   backbone of a conception of legitimacy that mediates between idealistic
   (or moralistic) and realistic (or pragmatic) desiderata of political
   theory, i.e. between the aspiration to peace and the aspiration to
   justice. In other words, this paper considers whether an account of
   compromise could feature in a viable realistic conception of political
   legitimacy, in much the same way in which consensus features in more
   idealistic conceptions of legitimacy (a move that may be attributed to
   some realist theorists, especially Bernard Williams). My conclusions,
   however, are largely sceptical: I argue that grounding legitimacy in any
   kind of normatively salient agreement does require the trappings of
   idealistic political philosophy, for better or - in my view - worse.},

Journal = {CIVIL WARS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {7-20},
Abstract = {Syria's slide into sectarian civil war in 2011 raises a new fundamental
   knowledge question about the conditions under which power-sharing pacts
   can be clinched as an approach to war termination. When intrastate
   conflicts escalate into violent sectarian struggles, power-sharing is a
   likely basis of an eventual political settlement in situations where
   partition is off the table. This article contends that there remain two
   puzzling knowledge gaps about powersharing as the basis for peace
   agreements to end civil wars: first, the specific conditions under which
   elites find it in their own interest to share power with bitter
   adversaries rather than fight on the battlefield, and second, how
   warending elite-negotiated pacts may evolve into more enduring social
   contracts. These puzzles, critical for policymakers and still unresolved
   in the scholarly literature, suggest the need to develop more
   contingent-and context-specific knowledge if research findings are to
   more capably contribute to peacemaking efforts.},

Abstract = {Purpose - The chapter provides background for the reader, lending
   context to the aims of this book.
   Design/methodology/approach - This chapter begins by placing the study
   of biology and politics in a larger framework. It also compares and
   contrasts the biological perspective of politics with the mainstream
   view. Finally, the chapter orients the reader by providing a brief
   summary of the volume's contents.
   Findings - An introductory chapter would seldom provide findings.
   However, its goal is to provide the reader with context.},

Abstract = {Earlier this year, political scientists Hanes Walton, William ``Nick{''}
   Nelson, and Richard Iton passed away. Their contributions to political
   science cannot be over-emphasized. In this essay I use literary critic
   Albert Murray (who also passed away this year) to argue their work can
   best be understood as heroic attempts to expand the contours of the
   discipline, attempts that attack ``social science fiction{''} while
   simultaneously promoting a blues inflected conception of black life.},

Abstract = {Several academicians and political analysts considered that the protest
   of October 2010 in Gdeim Izik, Western Sahara, was the prelude of the
   Arab Spring that started months later in many Arab countries. However,
   we consider that this idea cannot be supported and that it is
   undesirable since it diverts our attention focus from the origin of
   Gdeim Izik's events: the sovereignty conflict over the Western Sahara
   territories. The reasons why we believe that the Gdeim Izik protests
   cannot be included in the protest movements and the fifth wave of
   political change in North Africa and the Middle East are as follow: (a)
   the characteristics of the protest; (b) the political consequences for
   political organization, representation and participation in Western
   Sahara; (c) the consequences of the political reform process in Morocco
   for the territorial organization of Morocco and the Sahara region; and
   (d) the international consequences for the resolution of the sovereignty
   conflict in Western Sahara.},

Abstract = {This article contributes to the discussion about a reform of the
   Austrian PR electoral system and evaluates the political consequences of
   a (counterfactual) implementation of a plurality voting system. The
   arguments will be presented in four principal steps: (1) The article
   starts out with a review of the merits and shortcomings of majoritarian
   and consensus democracies so as to justify some principal yardsticks for
   the evaluation of real-world electoral systems. (2) The subsequent
   section considers the context of Austrian politics more systematically
   and reviews principal arguments that have been put forward for and
   against reform efforts. (3) The empirical part of this article
   systematically discusses the ``psychological effects{''} of a plurality
   system in Austria. (4) Ultimately, the mechanical effects of plurality
   in Austria are evaluated by counterfactual statistical simulation
   models.},

Abstract = {One of the most glaring differences between traditional and emerging
   middle powers relates to their projection of societal values abroad.
   Since most emerging powers are essentially fragmented multiclass states,
   class compromise often emerges to intermediate contradictory demands
   emanating from fragile political coalitions. Against the backdrop of
   vast income inequalities, and facing some domestic constituencies
   favouring liberalization on the one hand against proredistributive
   groups on the other, adopting a middle power role, in the cases of South
   Africa and Brazil, emerges in order to ameliorate these conflicting
   demands. Two dimensions are examined very briefly, namely recent
   mediation efforts in Iran and Libya and attempts to effect
   redistribution by reforming processes of global governance.},

Abstract = {Housing in Dakhla has emerged as a strategic sector for the Moroccan
   public authorities. It is basically an industry with a strong
   involvement of central institutions and a high level of state subsidy.
   The evolution of housing-related decisions implemented by Morocco in the
   most southern region of the Western Sahara reveals significant changes
   in the targeted beneficiaries. These variations derive from the deep
   demographic changes undergone by the region and highlight a readjustment
   in the Moroccan strategy for the distribution of goods among the
   different groups which coexist nowadays in the disputed territory.},

Abstract = {Since the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement in 2005, the

   successful in part, this approach has nevertheless led to the continued
   proliferation of armed groups. In this article, Lesley Anne Warner
   analyses how the government of South Sudan and the SPLA have
   administered the amnesty and integration process, concluding that
   military integration is a process that is managed, but not yet fully
   mastered.},

Journal = {CRITICAL STUDIES ON TERRORISM},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {6},
Number = {3},
Pages = {371-391},
Abstract = {Drawing on the core commitments of Critical Terrorism Studies, and
   mostly, the ethic of emancipation, this article focuses on the Boko
   Haram insurgency to investigate recurring violent conflict in Nigeria.
   It identifies a governance gap not adverted to in the official narrative
   which has led to gross discontent at the lower levels of the society.
   The governance gap has created fertile breeding grounds for the
   recruitment of disillusioned youths who are easily mobilised to violence
   and lately, insurgency. There are normative and pragmatic reasons to
   adopt and prioritise social welfare through the implementation of
   economic, social and cultural obligations and due-process rights as a
   viable approach to at least reducing the spate of violence in the
   country. The discussion has relevance for resolving situations of
   violence and conflict in sub-Sahara Africa in particular and elsewhere
   in the developing world.},

Abstract = {The political system of the Islamic Republic of Iran begins with the
   idea of (Wilayat Al-Faqih) which is a unique structure of applying the
   Islamic roles without any interference in the internal affairs of its
   neighbors and other countries.
   Iran security constitute gives a significant role to Iran's foreign
   policy, through defending the country against any potential threats and
   implementing policies to achieve the national goals set by the Supreme
   authority of the Imam Khomeini of Iran, the Council Planning Department
   and the National Security Council.
   The foreign policy objectives give priorities for achieving the
   revolution goals. The success of the central objectives of the Islamic
   revolution in Iran is enhanced by the strategic location that makes Iran
   economically significant
   since 2010, the development of relations with Saudi Arabia reflects the
   increased sectarian divisions of the Iranian society regarding the
   central objectives and Iran concerns of the Arab Spring in the region,
   the situation in Syria and the supporting the Assad regime which became
   a strategic concern of Iran, and this put Iran in facing of Arab
   countries, including GCC, and other Sunni Arab states to confront Iran
   in Syria, these issues make the possibility of improving Iran's
   relations with the outside world little. Some Iranian scholars believe
   that Iran is flexible concerning the settlement of the nuclear power of
   Iran by saying that the Western powers lack flexibility regarding Iran's
   programs of obtaining nuclear power.},

Abstract = {I argue that candidates shape their issue agendasthe sets of related
   issues on which they focusin part in response to the issue agendas of
   their opponents and that competitive campaigns stimulate candidates to
   respond to one another at higher rates. I test my theory of candidate
   interaction using weekly advertising data at the media market level from
   146 statewide elections54 gubernatorial and 92 U.S. Senate contestsfrom
   six election years and across all 50 states. I find that candidates
   systematically respond to one another's issue agendas and do so to a
   greater extent in competitive elections than in noncompetitive
   elections.},

Abstract = {The presidential cabinet has long been neglected by political scientists
   and political historians. The former tend to dismiss the cabinet as a
   noninstitution that has never transcended its lack of constitutional
   foundation; the latter have generally ignored it. Focusing on the
   progressive era, and upon one of Woodrow Wilson's most prominent cabinet
   secretaries, this article argues for a reconsideration of the
   presidential cabinet and its individual members as important policy and
   political actors during a time of increasing federal government
   competency but as yet unformed White House executive agencies and staff.},

Abstract = {Through a comparison of federal Argentina and unitary Chile, we ask
   whether federalism explains subnational protections of women's
   reproductive rights. We explore two factors: policy jurisdictions under
   decentralization and party system territorialization under federalism.
   We find that, under decentralization, subunits in both countries enjoy
   autonomy in funding and delivering health care. Yet, decentralization
   does not explain why specific subunits comply with national policies
   while others deviate. We argue that federalism, in allowing party system
   fragmentation, makes subunit leaders more responsive to local concerns,
   especially when subunits vary in their principled opposition to or
   support for contraception. When party systems are centralized, as in
   unitary states, partisan allegiances better predict patterns of
   compliance and defiance. Thus, federalism matters for understanding
   patterns in the subnational variation of policy outcomes.},

Abstract = {Among the numerous questions mentioned in the HDRs, are those related to
   precarious urbanization and its effects upon the lives of those who have
   no politics capable of making the urban space more appropriate for the
   increase of income, and the improvement of habilitations and capacities.
   According to the analyzed documents, the fight against different forms
   of exclusion and inequality goes through the investment in sanitation,
   housing, medical assistance and hospitals, schools, leisure, etc.
   However, the effectiveness of such investments depends on the
   development of ways to expand local income and budgets. Tax-paying
   decentralization and better administration of taxes and investments are
   some of the suggestions on how to do it. When the 1990 and 2006 HDRs are
   compared, there are noticeable changes regarding the role of the State
   in the suggestions and proposals that seek to bring the exclusions
   caused by precarious urbanization to an end.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to analyze the foreign policy activism of a
   Republican congresswoman of Serbian descent Helen Delich Bentley during
   the war in Bosnia from 1992 to 1995. The paper will argue that Bentley
   was a congressional foreign policy entrepreneur utilizing nonlegislative
   avenues of foreign policy influence. Her policy aims from 1992 until the
   end of her term in Congress in 1994 were to establish U.S. neutrality
   and nonintervention in Bosnia. Though unsuccessful on both fronts,
   Bentley's foreign policy activism sheds light on the domestic policy
   debates over the formulation of U.S. policy towards Bosnia. The paper
   contributes to the literature on interventions in the Balkans and also
   to literature on congressional foreign policy entrepreneurship.},

Title = {THE ``MIRAGE{''} OF SOCIAL JUSTICE: HAYEK AGAINST (AND FOR) RAWLS},
Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {25},
Number = {3-4, SI},
Pages = {409-444},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {There is an odd proximity between Hayek, hero of the libertarian right,
   and Rawls, theorist of social justice, because, at the level of
   principle, Hayek was in some important respects a Rawlsian. Although
   Hayek said that the idea of social justice was nonsense, he argued
   against only a particular principle of social justice, one that Rawls
   too rejected, namely distribution according to individual merit. Any
   attempt to make reward and merit coincide, Hayek argued, would undermine
   the market's price system, leaving us all poorer and less free. Like
   Rawls, Hayek held that we should assess social institutions from behind
   a veil of ignorance, and he thought that doing so pushed us toward
   egalitarianism. Most of the distance between Hayek and Rawls at the
   level of policy stems from Hayek's optimism about the operation of
   markets, his equivocation about the meaning of central concepts, and his
   appeal to under-argued slippery slopes. Hayek wavered, however, between
   claiming that private property and markets benefit everyone, compared to
   the feasible alternatives, and the principle that they maximize the
   opportunities of a randomly selected member of society, i.e., aggregate
   opportunity. Contemporary Hayekians claim that capitalism raises the
   position of the worst off in the long run, in future generations,
   whereas Rawlsians insist that inequalities between social positions
   should benefit the worst off now.},

   Middle Eastern, Asian and African countries who justify suicide bombing
   and dislike regional/world powers, and its relationship with the
   occurrence of terrorism originating from the former countries and
   directed against the powers. We find that the share of highly educated
   people in this critical support group (regardless of gender and age) in
   a country is significantly correlated with the number of international
   terrorist acts carried out by individuals or groups from that country.
   The paper confirms that public opinion has an impact on terrorism and
   suggests that increasing education is not by itself a sufficient means
   of counter-terrorist policy.},

Abstract = {Standing committees play a vital role in the policy-making process of
   modern parliaments. This study investigates the assignment criteria of
   standing committee members in the 17th Bundestag by applying
   congressional theories of legislative organisation to the German case.
   The statistical analysis shows that MPs often join the same committees
   that they have been members of in prior legislative periods. While prior
   occupation/education and affiliation to interest groups only partially
   explain the distribution, interviews with whips and secretaries in
   Berlin show that regional factions and the political reputation of the
   MP play a major role in the assignment process. Parties monitor
   carefully whether committees are staffed with preference outliers during
   the assignment process while partisan considerations are hardly evident.
   This is strong evidence for the claim of informational theory of
   legislative organisation which highlights the information-processing
   character of committees.},

Title = {Voter Demands, Access to Resources, and Party Switching: Evidence from
   the South Korean National Assembly, 1988-2008},

Abstract = {This paper investigates why some legislators tend to switch parties
   frequently - which is believed to undermine effective representation of
   citizen interests in democracies - while others tend to stay put. On the
   assumption that the ultimate goal of legislators is to be reelected, I
   argue that voters' demands for local/individual benefits, or pork, and
   legislators' lack of access to resources for such benefits are likely to
   lead the legislators to switch parties in order to improve their
   electoral chances in the subsequent election. By analyzing party
   switches by legislators from 1988 to 2008 in South Korea, where the
   president controls access to the pork pipeline, I find that the
   president's party members are less likely and independents are more
   likely to change party affiliations, irrespective of voter demands for
   pork or national public policies. However, I also find that opposition
   party legislators who are elected from less-developed districts, where
   voters tend to desire pork over policy, are more likely to switch
   parties than those elected frommore-developed districts. These findings
   suggest that interaction between voter demands and party access to
   resources influences politicians' party loyalty: voter demands for pork
   (or policy) tend to lead politicians to be less (or more) loyal to their
   current parties. Voter demands, however, have little impact on the party
   loyalty of those who are already in parties with access to the pork
   pipeline.},

Abstract = {Agenda-setting and policy-formulation processes, including those
   involved in global issues such as climate change, have been a focus of
   continuous research during recent years. Most studies have taken a
   broad, longitudinal perspective, with limited emphasis on the individual
   level decision making that can better explain the broader dynamics
   tested in the past. This study presents an analysis at the micro level
   that uncovers specific instances of individual decision making within an
   information-processing framework. Additionally, little is known about
   how climate change is defined in developing nations that are highly
   vulnerable to its effects. This micro-level analysis focuses on national
   legislators and advisers in the Peruvian Congress. The article presents
   a detailed narrative of the formulation process of several climate
   change bills and the development of a special committee on climate
   change and biodiversity in the 2006-2011 legislative period in the
   Peruvian Congress. The study discusses the role of policy entrepreneurs,
   the influence of limited or inaccurate information, and the competition
   with other policy issues through an analysis of in-depth interviews with
   these legislative elites. The results show the significant influence of
   media reports and Internet use in a low-information environment.},

Abstract = {This paper attempts to analyze some mechanisms of neoliberal ideology in
   the public university system. Drawing upon political economy of
   communication resources we propose that one can assess the
   aforementioned mechanisms as a type of audience commodity work by which
   neoliberal ideology incorporates students into the process of
   ideological production, the goal of which is to shape student's
   understanding of education and self as a marketable commodity. In making
   this argument, the paper modifies Dallas Smythe's conception of the
   audience commodity and introduces the notion of the student-commodity.
   We argue that, ultimately, the role of the public university in a
   neoliberal regime is to produce the student-commodity and sell it to the
   corporate sector. These are examples of what Smythe calls the
   ``consciousness industry,{''} and we argue is the core productive
   activity of the public university system.},

Abstract = {The deepening of the Single European Market is expected to induce
   further migration within the European Union over the next few years. In
   line with these developments, we study the impact of individual-and
   contextual-level indicators of immigration on public support for further
   European integration. The results of our comprehensive multi-level
   analysis of EU member states illustrate that individual-level
   anti-immigration attitudes have the strongest effect on public support
   for European integration. This effect is even more pronounced in
   countries with strong economies. At the macro level, neither the
   proportion of foreigners nor the importance of the subject of
   immigration in a country have a significant impact. However, we find a
   negative relationship between the number of applications for asylum as
   well as a pro-immigration integration policy and public support for
   European integration.},

Abstract = {The methods used to select public officials affect the preferences they
   bring to office, the incentives they face while in office, and,
   ultimately, the policy goals they pursue. We argue that the preferences
   and actions of local election officials (LEOs) differ depending on
   whether they are elected or appointed. We test these expectations with a
   data set that includes the survey responses of 1,200 Wisconsin LEOs,
   structured interviews, census data, and returns from the 2008
   presidential election. Drawing upon a natural experiment in how
   officials are selected, we find that, compared to appointed officials,
   elected officials express greater support for voter access and
   expressless concern about ballot security and administrative costs. For
   appointed officials, we find that voter turnout in a municipality is
   lower when the LEO's self-reported partisanship differs from the
   partisanship of the electorate but only in cases where the official is a
   Republican.},

Abstract = {The introduction of a provision in the Lisbon Treaty allowing European
   Union institutions to forge binding inter-institutional agreements
   (IIAs) draws attention to the limited research that exists on these
   instruments of EU governance. This article contributes to the
   development of this literature by presenting empirical evidence on two
   cases of decision-making on IIAs: on lobby regulation; and on the
   regulation of the conduct of EU public servants. In the first case the
   proposed IIA was successfully concluded; in the second, it was not. In
   contrasting these cases this article explains these differing outcomes
   with reference to the relevance of shared inter-institutional values and
   the mutual benefits of agreement. The findings suggest that both shared
   values and mutual interests are likely to be important in shaping
   successful IIA decision-making.},

Abstract = {This article examines the evolution of the European Council in the
   post-Lisbon period. Having a standing president is a major innovation:
   the European Council is no longer subject to national grandstanding,
   occasional weak leadership and uneven presidential performance. The new
   arrangement provides continuity and consistency. Herman Van Rompuy
   became the first elected president in an exceptionally challenging
   policy environment, with the European Council emerging as a
   quasi-permanent forum for crisis management. Fissures erupted between
   the eurozone members and non-members; between and among the big and
   small member states; and between the United Kingdom and the rest. A
   preliminary assessment suggests that the standing European Council
   presidency and Van Rompuy's incumbency have been highly beneficial for
   the EU, which fared better than it otherwise would have under the
   pre-Lisbon rotating presidency.},

Abstract = {This article presents the ``Granada-Employment{''} Project external
   evaluation of implementation and results, as an active policy designed
   to improve the employment of groups excluded or at risk of labour
   exclusion, which combines traditional elements - such as vocational
   training policies and sociolabour insertion tracks -with other
   innovative tools - as territorial pacts. The Contextualized
   Participative Mode of Evaluation (CPME) applied is ad hoc designed and
   follows the pluralist and participative theoretical premises. It allows
   the policy actors' participation in the evaluation indicator definition
   and results interpretation. On the other hand, it joins to the public
   policy analysis that considers the context as a determinant variable
   both of the policy outcomes and the evaluative praxis. The main
   conclusions show, firstly, the effectiveness of the participative
   evaluation methodology applied to bottom-up implementation processes,
   which has allowed the finding of the territorial agent as determinant
   actor of the territorial pacts policy-making. Secondly, they present the
   achievements and keys of this vocational training policy, which have
   contributed to reach high level of labour insertion among the
   unemployed. The design and implementation of contextualized,
   decentralized and specialized training actions are key elements for the
   success of this kind of measures.},

Abstract = {The paper analyses how perceptions of government quality - in terms of
   impartiality and efficiency - impact on attitudes to taxes and social
   spending. It builds on data from the European Social Survey 2008 from 29
   European countries. The paper shows a large degree of congruence between
   expert-based judgments and the general public's perceptions of the
   quality of government. It also shows that the quality of government has
   a clear, independent effect on attitudes to taxes and spending, so that
   people who perceive institutions as efficient and fair want higher taxes
   and spending. But government quality also conditions the impact of
   egalitarianism on attitudes to taxes and spending: in
   high-quality-of-government egalitarianism has a clearly stronger impact
   on these attitudes. It is concluded that government quality is an
   important and so far neglected factor in explaining attitudes to welfare
   policies.},

   definitions. It also highlights the strong points and the shortcomings
   of both, proposing at the same time a new definition more suitable for a
   comparative analysis. In doing this, it puts forward some useful
   criteria with a view to establishing what a minister actually is, what a
   cabinet is and how it is made up. The second part provides an overview
   of the structures of governments in 38 countries, from core to junior
   ministers, on this basis.},

Abstract = {The traditional dispute over whether there are one or two `concepts' of
   freedom has recently been reignited. Despite this, Isaiah Berlin's
   distinction between positive and negative freedom retains a significant
   amount of influence over academic and popular disputes about freedom,
   continuing to withstand recent attempts, in Eric Nelson's words, to
   `lift the shadow' of Berlin's famous dichotomy. Berlin's distinction has
   traditionally been assailed by two separate schools of thought. One line
   of argument, propounded by Quentin Skinner and Philip Pettit, has
   suggested that Berlin's account includes (at least) one concept of
   freedom too few. Another line of attack, however, propounded by the
   likes of Nelson, Efraim Podoksik and Gerald MacCallum, has suggested
   that, to the contrary, Berlin's account contains one concept of liberty
   too many. In this article, I will attempt to clear up this confusing
   picture by discussing how both of these lines of attack have a role to
   play in helping to dismantle Berlin's ultimately misleading account of
   freedom. In the second half of the article, I then go on to explore the
   implications of this for contemporary political theory in the
   construction of a theory of freedom for modern political communities,
   discussing how the `spectrum' of liberty I explore in the first half
   leads, naturally, to a social model of individual liberty.},

Abstract = {This article presents an alternative theoretical framework to account
   for the political transition in Indonesia in 1998. Challenging the
   mainstream literature, which focuses on the presumed significance of
   civil society, the article claims that so-called democratization in
   Indonesia offered a mechanism through which to reorganize the
   distribution of patronage within the state. The transition was caused
   not by assertive civil society but Suharto's excessive centralization of
   patronage networks, which had the effect of alienating a significant
   proportion of the regime elite. Against this backdrop, democratization
   facilitated a decentralization of previously centralized patronage
   networks and a redistribution of spoils within the state towards elites
   that had been excluded from Suharto's inner circle.},

   Raymond Aron. The french autor holds, along all his works, two
   fundamental concepts of ideology. The narrow original concept of
   ideology as a secular religion, that provides a theologico-political
   critic of ideologies, was rectified by a more inclusive concept. The
   dissertation on this change shows some of the main foundations of the
   french autor's thought.},

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {57},
Number = {4},
Pages = {858-874},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This is an article about package deals in EU legislative politics and
   their effects on policy outcomes. It analyzes interchamber exchange
   between the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament. The main
   argument is that package deals allow Member States control over the
   financial aspects of legislation and ensure its timely adoption. In
   exchange, the Parliament gains access to some of the EU's most expensive
   policy areas. Intercameral logrolling is analyzed across all EU
   legislation completed in the period 1 May 1999-30 April 2007, including
   2,369 issues, 1,465 legislative proposals, and 19 policy areas. The
   results indicate that package deals in the EU are conditional on the
   distributive nature of proposals and their urgency. In turn, through
   logrolling, the Parliament extends its influence in distributive
   policies.},

Abstract = {Globalization is generating new forms of citizenship that often go
   beyond the institutional perception of social identity. These new forms
   of citizenship are developed in a scalable way to a greater extent than
   rights and obligations, and are entirely managed by the citizens
   themselves. To demonstrate empirical support for this issue, the case of
   minority communities in Turkey constitutes one of the most relevant
   examples, since citizenship in this country has long been associated
   with an idea of political loyalty and total allegiance to the
   nation-state. The main purpose of this article is to show how urban
   space and urban protest allow minorities to find alternative forms of
   expression for their collective identity, and to create a new
   understanding of citizenship beyond the classical definition, being
   based instead on institutional representation. The aim of this research
   is to examine the process of urban transformation in Istanbul, how this
   phenomenon shapes the structure of cities and how it gives rise to
   social resistance and protest, especially in neighborhoods housing
   minority communities. In this context, the article focuses on planning
   movements in Turkey through a comparative study of two urban planning
   projects and the citizens' protests against them.},

Abstract = {At the expense of those who use petroleum in Illinois, the Underground
   Storage Tank (UST) Fund provides tank owners and operators with the
   financial support they need to remediate leaking UST sites. Little has
   been written on the sociodemographic factors that influence UST site
   remediation because most analysts characterize ``open{''} tank sites
   (those in need of remediation) using only descriptive statistics. I
   examine how socioeconomic variables and the passage of time influence
   the distribution of open sites within Illinois and find that only time
   contributes to the likelihood that a site will remain open. This result
   suggests that reducing the reimbursement timeline for tank owners and
   operators should be considered as an effective strategy for increasing
   remediation rates, both within Illinois and throughout the United
   States.},

Abstract = {Why do people dislike politicians and could anything be done about it?
   Drawing upon survey evidence, it is argued that the twin charge against
   politicians is that they are engaged in a kind of game and that they are
   a political class out of touch with real life. These charges are
   examined and found to have at least some merit. Remedies would involve a
   change in political behaviour; and measures to widen political
   recruitment. The consequences of not making such changes will be a
   further erosion of political trust. Constitutional change is less
   important in tackling dislike of politicians than alterations in
   political behaviour.},

Abstract = {The Faroe Islands, a non-sovereign nation within the Kingdom of Denmark,
   have become the latest actors in the extended Arctic region to prepare
   their own strategy on Arctic affairs. A working group report of April
   2013 predicts peaceful Arctic development that could bring profit for
   the Faroes but also new challenges notably in the field of civil
   security. Its detailed sections contain recommendations on economic
   opportunities especially linked with increased shipping and fisheries;
   research and education; the environment; and maritime safety and
   emergency response. The report is a professional product, reflecting
   years of Faroese engagement in Arctic research, fisheries, and
   international cooperation in the Arctic Council and elsewhere. It shows
   how Arctic considerations are pushing the Faroes towards acquiring more
   independent capacities, including new legal rights and institutional
   participation, given their already extensive relevant competences and
   the differences between their needs and Denmark's. Further, some
   features of the Faroes' response to the challenges facing them mirror
   the finds of `small state' studies and confirm that non-sovereign
   entities having reached a certain level of autonomy can (mutatis
   mutandis) have similar external agendas, and seek similar solutions, to
   states of comparable size. While the report's conclusions have already
   been accepted by the Faroese Parliament, some question-marks remain over
   Faroese capacity to realize its potentially costly recommendations.},

Abstract = {Icelanders applied for EU membership in 2009, but in 2013 when the new
   government took office, negotiations were put on hold. The question
   whether Iceland should join the EU or not has been a source of debate
   among Icelanders for many years. This paper's authors therefore found it
   interesting to study EU's image based on whether voters are in favor or
   not of joining it or which political party they vote for and how
   important the main issues of the debate are to them. A quantitative
   research in the form of a questionnaire was used for this purpose. The
   population of interest was voters in Iceland. A convenience sample
   consisting of students at the University of Iceland, friends of the
   authors on Facebook and others was used. EU's image among those who are
   in favour of EU membership or vote for political parties that are in
   favour of joining it is better when it comes to image factors which
   could be considered positive. EU's image among those who are not in
   favour of EU membership or vote for political parties that are not in
   favour of joining it is better when it comes to image factors which
   could be considered negative. The issues that those who are in favour of
   EU membership emphasize in the debate are more important to the voters
   who are in favour of joining the EU whereas the issues that are
   emphasized by those who are against EU membership are more important to
   those who are against joining the EU.},

Abstract = {This study asks how well the Nordic nations have managed in a new social
   environment of globalization, increasing competition and new challenges
   to the Nordic welfare model? The focus is on well-being outcomes, rather
   than on welfare inputs (expenditure generosity or rights and
   institutional features). For this purpose we have constructed a data
   bank with well-being measures for 29 modern nations, based on 69
   variables in 9 well-being dimensions. With this data we have constructed
   an overall well-being index and sub-indexes for these nations. We find
   that in terms of well-being outcomes the Nordic nations (including
   Iceland) share major patterns of well-being characteristics. In a
   data-driven clustering analysis (with Dendograms, using the Ward Method)
   of all the 69 variables, our well-being outcomes cluster the nations in
   a way comparable to Francis Castles' families of nations and
   Esping-Andersen's main welfare regime types. We disaggregate the
   outcomes by clusters and well-being dimensions. The findings indicate
   that the five Nordic nations had the highest level of well-being amongst
   modern nations during the period from 2005 to 2008, along with
   Netherlands, Switzerland and Luxembourg. The strength of the Nordic
   cluster of nations seems to be their emphasis on equality of income
   distribution, poverty reduction, improving family conditions and
   facilitating social cohesion and participation, while also promoting
   economic strength and a high affluence level. The study also assesses
   correlates of well-being amongst these nations, including welfare state
   generosity, political influences, social trust, strength of democracy
   and distributional characteristics. The findings support a narrative
   emphasizing the importance of lifting the worse off up the well-being
   ladder of society. That seems to be the most efficient strategy for
   improving the overall well-being of modern nations.},

Abstract = {Recent analyses have reported a generational pattern in electoral
   participation both in national and the European Parliament elections
   which suggests that a lower voting propensity among the younger cohorts
   remains relatively stable over time. Based on the Swedish national
   election studies 1960-2010, this article examines the magnitude of
   generational differences in a high-turnout context. It contributes to
   earlier studies by using multilevel modeling to estimate the impacts of
   life cycle, generation and period on turnout and by aiming to account
   for the generational effect with institutional- and individual-level
   factors. The results show a fairly modest generational effect. When
   controlling for the proportion of party members in the electorate and
   the effective number of parties, the differences between generations in
   their propensities to vote are substantially reduced.},

Abstract = {There is an ongoing debate within the economic voting literature about
   whether the economy's salience systematically fluctuates over time or is
   constant. The recent global economic slowdown provides leverage to test
   the proposition that voters give greater weight to economic performance
   when it is weak. Data on voters' issue priorities from 2000 to 2011
   shows that voters were more likely to consider the economy an important
   issue during periods of bad or volatile economic performance. A weak
   economy also focuses voter attention on corruption and crime while
   reducing attention to social policy and foreign affairs. Crime rates,
   terrorist attacks, globalization, and the level of development also
   affect the economy's place on the electoral agenda. Thus one impact of
   the recent financial downturn was a shift toward economic voting in
   countries where it was deepest. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Political parties' issue ownership-their perceived competence in
   handling issues and problems-is a major ingredient explaining voting
   behavior. Yet, our understanding of the sources of issue ownership is
   limited. This study is the first to bring together and evaluate four
   different explanations of voters' perceptions of parties' issue
   ownership: partisanship, attitudes, perceived real-world developments,
   and constituency-based ownership. Using novel measures implemented in a
   national survey, we show that all four sources exert independent, if
   varying, influences on voters' issue ownership perceptions. Even though
   voters' partisanship tends to dominate issue ownership perceptions,
   attitudes and performance evaluations also matter. Moreover, the
   hitherto mostly neglected constituency based component of ownership has
   a substantial, independent influence on ownership perceptions. These
   findings indicate that issue ownership is more than merely an expression
   of partisanship and attitudes.},

Abstract = {This article makes sense of the seeming contradiction between
   citizenship and violence at two historical junctures in the Colombian
   department of Antioquia and its capital Medellin. It shows how
   governmental interventions aimed at moral and physical improvement
   during La Violencia (1948-1958) were embedded in narratives of a
   racialized and spatialized regional identity of antioquenidad. Residents
   of Antioquia saw themselves as sharing a racial unity that emphasized
   whiteness, capitalism, hard work, and civilization, while they saw
   residents of outlying areas as deviant, lazy, and uncivilizable.
   Violence was the result. It then explores the relationship between
   contemporary (1990s-2000s) social programs to promote citizenship in
   Medellin and their coexistence with violent paramilitary control of the
   city. Marked declines in the city's homicide rates were the result of
   control through violent protection by paramilitary forces. In looking at
   the relationship between violence and urban social programs at two
   historical moments, the article shows the complicated links between
   liberal projects of governance, citizenship, and violence.},

Abstract = {Why are some governments able to undertake controversial policy reforms
   and others are not? Conventional wisdom argues that single-party
   majority governments are best able to implement reforms because there
   are fewer veto actors within the government that can block the reforms.
   However, these accounts fail to consider the veto power of societal
   actors and particularly of trade unions, which can stall reform even in
   the presence of a unified executive. This paper argues that
   controversial reforms require broad societal and, consequently,
   political consensus, which are easier to achieve under minority
   governments or governments of broad coalitions. Evidence from 22 OECD
   parliamentary democracies over 35 years shows that minority and large
   coalition governments have been more successful in reducing social
   security contributions and pensions than narrower majority governments.
   This is especially true in countries where trade unions are militant and
   often resort to industrial action.},

Abstract = {Does becoming a citizen represent a major step toward the inclusion of
   Latino immigrants in the American polity? I study this question by
   comparing the behavior of immigrants who have acquired citizenship with
   that of immigrants who are not willing or not eligible to become
   citizens, focusing on nonelectoral political activities such as
   contacting government officials and working to solve problems with
   others informally or through existing groups and organizations. The data
   analysis is based on recent survey data from the 2006 Latino National
   Survey. I use matching methods to control for the nonrandom selection of
   respondents into citizenship status, and perform a sensitivity analysis
   to evaluate the robustness of findings to hidden bias. Results suggest
   that granting citizenship to nonnaturalized immigrants is a measure
   that, by itself, is unlikely to achieve full inclusion of Latino
   immigrants in the broader democratic process.},

Abstract = {The authors present a Case Study conducted in a Portuguese military
   organization, to answer the following research questions: (1) what are
   the most relevant dimensions and categories of information security
   controls applied in military organizations? (2) What are the main
   scenarios of information security incidents that are expected to occur?
   (3) What is the decision process used for planning and selection
   information security controls? This study reveals that: (1) information
   security within the military organization is built on the basis of
   physical and human attack vectors, and targeting the infrastructure that
   supports the flow of information in the organization; (2) the
   information security controls applied in the military organization are
   included in ISO/IEC 27001; (3) planning and selection of applied
   information security controls are made by decision makers and
   information security specialists. It appears that specialists impose
   their planning options essentially seeking to select and retrieve past
   successful information security cases.},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The role of mediation as an alternative conflict resolution technique
   remains a disputed subject within Europe and the European Union. Indeed,
   both national laws and European regulations and directives have been
   introduced with the aim of enforcing or encouraging the application of
   what is perceived as a more effective means of managing conflicts, but
   the results continue to be inconsistent. Certain states, such as Norway,
   Denmark and Belgium have registered positive results related to the
   praxis of mediation while others, such as Italy, Spain and France, have
   been relatively unsuccessful. Generally, the considerable gap in
   mediation related performance between the ``North{''} and the
   ``South{''} of Europe is considered as rooted in deep cultural
   differences; while this is not by any means false, it is insufficient to
   fully explain the phenomenon. The aim of this article is to approach the
   subject matter from a purely technical angle, isolating the cultural
   factor without forgetting its relevance. What we have left is a
   structural analysis which emphasizes the importance of the legal and
   institutional policy concerned with court-annexed mediation. In this
   context, a fundamental difference is identified between the pragmatic
   and the legalistic approach.},

Abstract = {Since the 1980s almost all OECD and EU states have implemented policies
   of liberalization and denationalization. This study offers a model for
   explaining this phenomenon by regarding it as a process of policy
   convergence. The determinants and causal mechanisms driving the
   proliferation of privatization policy are identified with the help of
   convergence mechanisms proposed by the sciences and then analytically
   evaluated and interpreted with regression analyses of two independent,
   quantitative studies. The results identify independent problem-solving,
   peer pressure and international harmonization as the most important
   causal mechanisms. Membership of the EU is shown to be a strong
   privatization factor, and on the OECD level, party affiliation of the
   government is identified as an important intervening variable.},

Volume = {29},
Number = {51},
Pages = {41-64},
Month = {JUL-DEC},
Abstract = {The main objective of this article is to analyze the conceptual
   framework that supports social involvement in healthcare in the Latin
   American context. It is based on the participation proposal by Cunill
   (1991). The methodology is analytical-documentary; it includes 25 items
   of national and international research, referring to a social
   participation model in health, institutionalized in Latin America. The
   study reveals multiple Latin American efforts regarding social
   participation in healthcare. In the majority of the cases reviewed, it
   was found that they respond to three approaches: liberal democratic,
   social democratic and revolutionary reformist. Regarding the modes of
   social participation in healthcare, it was shown they were marked mostly
   by an informative mode in Ecuador, a consultative approach in Chile,
   Cuba and Brazil; a resolutive/auditory modein Mexico and Chile, a
   delegativemodein Costa Rica; and, to a lesser extent, an executive
   approach in Argentina. Among the institutional mechanisms for
   participation in healthcare, Councils and/or Health Committees stand
   out. Conclusions are that social participation in healthcare demands
   active citizenship, social and institutional networks and political will
   as requirements; inclusion, autonomy, democratization and equality as
   principles; and civic vocation, shared responsibility and social
   commitment as characteristics.},

Abstract = {What is the effect of political dynasties on effective governance? To
   determine whether dynastic presence has a positive or detrimental effect
   on good governance, we examined the Philippine House of Representatives,
   an institution where more than 60\% of its members have been dominated
   by such clans since the restoration of democracy in 1987. Specifically,
   we test whether provinces dominated by such established families are
   more likely to bring higher levels of pork barrel allocations to their
   provinces. The findings show how provinces dominated by family clans are
   less likely to experience good governance in terms of (a) infrastructure
   development, (b) spending on health, (c) the prevalence of criminality,
   (d) full employment, and (e) the overall quality of government. The
   implications of the empirical analyses convey that political dynasties
   have deleterious effects in terms of the allocation of public goods,
   even if their presence induces higher levels of congressional earmarks.},

Abstract = {This article reconstructs Habermas' shift from an exclusive secularism
   advanced in his earlier pre-89 writings to his vision of a postsecular
   society mainly defended in a series of works in the past ten years. It
   is argued that, despite this significant shift, Habermas' conception
   remains, at the philosophical level, tributary to a questionable
   secularist view of reason of Kantian extraction. From a
   socio-theoretical perspective, Habermas' view is problematic as it
   projects a new type of society on account of what is, at best, a
   minority phenomenon, namely the translation of religious into secular
   contents through rational dialogue amongst citizens. In contrast to this
   post-Kantian and hyperbolic vision of a ``postsecular society{''}, I
   suggest a less rationalistic and more differentiated understanding of
   the discoursive and non-discursive interaction between religious and
   democratic practice.},

Abstract = {Important parts of the literature on strategies of interest
   organizations consider the political activities of interest
   organizations as serving to build and maintain exchange relationships
   between organizational representatives and constituents, policymakers
   and the news media. The incentive for organizational survival produces
   activities that links social and political domains. This review
   integrates various strands of existing thinking on interest groups under
   an `exchange' perspective. It produces a view on interest organizations
   as being strategically strongly constrained through different demands
   made on the organization when engaging in relationships with supporters,
   policymakers and journalists. While challenging, research designs should
   account for the interrelated nature of these relationships rather than
   treating organizations as a strategically autonomous actors.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the limits that ideas place on the scope of
   policy expansion though an empirical puzzle. Canada lacks a nationwide,
   universal pharmaceutical insurance program, which contrasts with the
   experience of most mature welfare states and Canada's own broad public
   hospital and medical insurance. The article find that ideas matter in
   policy development because of the mechanisms put in place by the pace of
   change. A slower, incremental process of policy development leads to
   restricted policy ideas that limit opportunities for program expansion.
   The article finds evidence of a reciprocal relationship between policy
   ideas and public expectations in four proposals for nationwide
   pharmaceutical insurance in Canada between 1944 and 2002.},

Abstract = {This article examines the state response to voluntary federal
   certification of electronic voluntary voting system guidelines (VVSGs)
   and current intergovernmental issues surrounding electronic voting
   systems across the country. Federal certification is not widespread, and
   most states have adapted modified methods of assuring system integrity
   or have opted out altogether. States that participate in VVSG have
   greater technological sophistication, higher levels of election
   administration professionalism, and are more likely to adopt touchscreen
   voting machines. Unlike other election administration reforms, VVSG does
   not appear to be linked to partisan political factors. Our findings have
   implications for understanding the limits of voluntary federal programs
   and the importance of technological capacity and professional human
   resources in American election administration.},

Journal = {LATIN AMERICAN POLICY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {4},
Number = {1},
Pages = {123-143},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Economic and political relations between Argentina and China have been
   rapidly expanding for a decade and a half, especially since 2004, when
   the government of Argentine President Nestor Kirchner defined the course
   of ``strategic partnership{''} with China. Important Argentine landowner
   and business groups formed that were associated with Chinese state
   public or private interests. Chinese corporations also advanced in the
   acquisition or control of some of the major national or foreign oil and
   mining companies in Argentina. Historically, the Argentine ruling
   classes have been strongly associated with or had a direct presence in
   the state apparatus. Their financial dependence on capital from great
   powers has been at the base of Argentine dependency. Today, commercial
   ties and direct investment or association of Chinese capital within
   local economies are described as an opportunity that would allow Latin
   American countries to develop their production, diversify their
   international relations, and reduce their external debts. In Argentina,
   government and business sectors-some of them directly related to Chinese
   interests-promote the adaptation of strategic areas of the local economy
   to complementarity with the Chinese economy. The growing importance of
   bilateral trade and of Chinese capital in Argentina and its competition
   with U.S. and European interests with historic roots in the country
   require us to rethink the ``classic{''} debate about Argentina's
   dependency on great powers.},

Abstract = {Imagine, as most economists do, that financial-market participants
   understand the basic structure of the world: While they cannot predict
   the future with certainty, they are endowed with knowledge of the
   possible outcomes of their actions and the probability that each of
   those outcomes will occur. Given these assumptions, if bankers,
   regulators, investors, and rating agencies were rational, we may
   conclude that the financial crisis was caused by poor incentives: These
   actors must have knowingly jeopardized their institutions and the global
   economy to pursue private gain. Alternatively, market participants,
   caught up in the mania of crowds, may have irrationally ignored risks of
   which they were aware and of which they knew the correct probability.
   Neither of these explanations for the financial crisis stands up to the
   evidence, since both explanations assume that the participants knew the
   U.S. housing market was about to crash. A fresh look at the data five
   years later suggests that they were ignorant of this fact, and that they
   acted rationally (or at least reasonably) in light of what they (thought
   that they) knew. This allows a more nuanced understanding of how
   financial institutions ended up in bedlam, why credit markets collapsed,
   and why they took so long to recover.},

Abstract = {The paper argues that a direct causal role for federalism must link
   policy makers' actions to costs and uncertainties unique to federalism,
   those associated with maintaining jurisdictional autonomy. The paper
   develops a formal model of imperfect information between two government
   actors, one preferring policy change and the other the status quo. A
   government chooses to change policy (or not) in a context where two
   things are uncertain: the stomach for intergovernmental retaliation, and
   the jurisdictional bona fides of the government in the policy area. The
   model shows how policy change is endogenous to beliefs about whom courts
   will support during federalism review. The model is then used in a
   detailed analysis of Australian cabinet archives at the state and
   Commonwealth levels, pertaining to the issue of Indigenous land rights
   policy between 1966 and 1978.},

Abstract = {While Carmines and Stimson's work on issue evolutions has prompted
   research showing the dynamics and effects of new party alignments on
   abortion, religion, gender and cultural issues, this research has all
   centred on the United States. This article examines issue evolution in
   Britain. Using evidence on the timing of changes in elite positions from
   Comparative Manifestos Group data, and survey data on public attitudes
   to the European Union with a longer historical sweep than heretofore,
   the article finds strong evidence that the European issue has followed
   an issue evolution path, though with distinct dynamics contingent on the
   pace of elite re-positioning. Thus, this article extends the theory of
   issue evolution to a parliamentary political system and demonstrates the
   responsiveness of the public to elite cues, while also providing
   additional insights from a unique case in which elites have staked out
   distinct positions not once, but twice.},

Abstract = {Is there a conflict between the principles of representation by
   population and the representation of communities of interest? In Canada,
   the legal requirement to design electoral districts based on
   pre-existing regions and communities of interest has produced large
   discrepancies in district populations. Several authors claim that this
   situation has a deleterious effect on the representational experiences
   of those citizens living in more populous districts. This paper examines
   whether the population of an electoral district affects the quality of
   political representation in that district. We first present survey data
   characterizing the relationship between constituency population and
   citizens' reported satisfaction with democracy and contact with
   politicians and parties. We then present audit experimental evidence
   from Canada demonstrating that the helpfulness of politicians towards
   citizens is not conditioned on constituency population. Our data
   indicate that constituency population has no clear impact on the quality
   of representational experiences in Canada, suggesting that it is
   possible to ensure the effective representation of communities of
   interest without harming the overall quality of Canadian democracy.},

Abstract = {This article addresses the challenges of justifying restrictions on
   migration given a rejection of nationalism as a defensible mode of
   political integration. Specifically, it focuses on constitutional
   patriotism, which is proposed as a means of making robust democratic
   practice possible in diverse contexts. Given that constitutional
   patriotism represents a commitment to universal principles as a source
   of attachment rather than the binding sentiment of nationalism, can we
   continue to rely on nationally defined and controlled migration
   practices? This article argues that, appropriately understood,
   constitutional patriotism implies a commitment to much freer movement of
   individuals across political boundaries than theorists have previously
   acknowledged. Applying such an approach, however, provokes some
   challenges to the sustainability of shared rule informed by principles
   rather than identity. This seeming paradox may mean that constitutional
   patriotism is more difficult to implement, and highlights practical
   challenges surrounding the liberalisation of border controls that are
   pertinent to theorists concerned with post-national citizenship more
   broadly conceived.},

Abstract = {After a decade of remarkable growth rates, the region of Southeast
   Europe was severely affected by the euro area fiscal and economic
   crises. The decreased international interest in this region does not
   depend entirely on the lack of global finances, rather on the structural
   problems of these small economies. The answer to this vicious cycle of
   economic recession, unemployment, and poverty lies in a new growth model
   based on regional economic integration, to enhance sustainable,
   inclusive, and smart growth. With a strong political will of all
   parties, the next 10 years can bring about a free regional economy, an
   interoperable new economic reality that would project collective
   financial stability, attract ``qualitative{''} foreign direct
   investment, raise competitiveness and support innovative industries for
   long-term growth and development. Good governance, economic rule of law,
   and structural reforms are imperative for achieving these challenging
   objectives.},

Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICS RESEARCH},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {41},
Number = {3},
Pages = {417-442},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Advocates of term limits argued that term limits would help reduce
   out-of-control government spending by removing veteran legislators who
   became acclimated to the prospending environment in our nation's
   capitals. However, previous research shows that term limits may increase
   spending, which could jeopardize state fiscal health. The primary
   purpose of this article is to examine whether states with term limits
   encounter more fiscal problems than non-term-limited states. I suggest
   that the short-term fiscal outlooks and loss of experienced legislators
   produced by term-limit turnover lead to poor fiscal conditions. Myopic
   legislators may avoid tough fiscal decisions, while inexperienced
   legislators may be ill-equipped to develop sound fiscal policy. Analysis
   of budget data on U.S. states from 1983 to 2008 reveals that legislative
   turnover decreases budget balances. Results further show that these
   effects do not appear in the upper chamber, perhaps because state
   senates have more experienced legislators than the lower chamber.},

   collected in this special issue: the relationship between legislative
   disruption and deliberative democracy. The practice of legislative
   disruption appears to go against the normative aspirations of
   deliberative democracy, but our discussion identifies several respects
   in which this mode of engagement can function to reinstate a
   deliberative environment in certain contexts. Drawing on the articles in
   this special issue, our analysis also brings to the fore certain
   inadequacies in deliberative democracy as a framework for evaluating
   legislative disruption.},

Abstract = {The 2010 election proved critical for ethnic minority representation in
   Britain. The number of minority Members of Parliament reached an
   unprecedented high. Furthermore, the virtual monopoly of the Labour
   party on minority parliamentary representation ended. In explaining this
   development, this article moves away from the traditional discussion of
   disadvantages facing minority candidates and turns to the role of the
   political parties. It argues that a new commitment to increased minority
   representation exists and shows, on the basis of new data, that in the
   2010 election both Labour and Conservatives employed a variety of
   strategies for increasing ethnic minority representation. The strategy
   to select more minority candidates in white' seats was not only a key to
   increasing the numbers of minority parliamentarians but also signals a
   departure from the traditional pattern of ethnic minority politicians
   being elected by ethnic minorities.},

Abstract = {Most existing studies of leadership effects on electoral success employ
   survey data only. This time-series study combines a content analysis of
   media appearances of the right-wing populist leader Geert Wilders in
   2006 with his party's popularity in the polls. The content analysis
   focuses on three aspects of the media coverage: (1) visibility, (2)
   whether he articulates a vision for the future, and (3) his
   self-confidence. Wilders was selected because as a leader without a
   party he represents the most likely case to find media effects.
   Var-analysis showed a significant positive effect of vision' on media
   attention, and a negative effect of popularity in the polls on
   visibility in the media. Yet, the study finds little support for the
   leadership hypothesis', and thus contributes to literature showing that
   the effects of the representation of political leaders in the media are
   more limited than often assumed.},

Abstract = {While piracy has been an old plague, its economic costs have increased
   enough in the Horn of Africa since the end of 1990s to push major
   countries to look for specific actions, either at national level or
   through coordinated missions. Maritime insecurity can then be analyzed
   as an ``international public bad{''} requiring a collective solution.
   The conceptual framework of public goods appears useful to understand
   how to deal with piracy as well as identify the theoretical grounds to
   supply maritime security as an international public good. Such a
   theoretical framework then helps analyze more particularly the NAVFOR
   Atalanta mission. Even though this is not the only on-going operation,
   European Union's mission appears as the most visible reaction against
   piracy on the high seas and it is fruitful to understand both benefits
   and limits of such collective action against piracy.},

Abstract = {It has often been argued that the communication strategies used by
   right-wing populists are key to their appeal to voters. However, prior
   studies found only rather limited across-the-board effects of
   communication strategies that employ a populist style and rhetoric. In
   this study, we focus on the conditionality of the effects of these two
   communication strategies on the perceived legitimacy of one right-wing
   populist and one mainstream leader. We use an experimental setup with a
   large-N representative sample of Dutch voters (n =3125). The results
   show that the effects of populist communication strategies differ for
   the lower educated and the politically cynical. These groups of voters
   are more susceptible to persuasion by the populist style of the
   right-wing populist party leader. Results are discussed in the light of
   research on (right-wing) populism. Acta Politica (2013) 48, 192-208.

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The conflict in Afghanistan is very complex, with multiple implications,
   and it can be analyzed, like every type of conflict, by using multiple
   tools and considering various aspects. This conflict is ongoing since
   2001, making it one of the longest so far, and the reasons of its
   prolongation are numerous; some of them will be presented in the
   following paragraphs. We will go through the conflict history in the
   Afghan area as early as the British dominance in the 19th century, to
   the Russian intervention and through the American intervention in 2001.
   The important reasons and stages of this conflict will be emphasized in
   this paper, but the main focus will be on the most recent conflict
   started after the US intervention targeted to cut down a terrorist base
   located in Afghanistan. We will try to emphasize the most important
   causes for which the conflict emerged, the main actors, and the trigger
   causes that led to an ongoing complicated and unsecure situation in
   Afghanistan. The latest conflict will be correlated with other similar
   conflicts that the country passed through in the 20th century.},

Abstract = {This article reviews the conceptual and analytical contribution of one
   strand of `global social policy studies' since the mid-1990s. It
   outlines some of the strengths and weaknesses of the core conceptual
   basis of the approach acknowledging that the theoretical aspects have
   remained more implicit than explicit in many core texts. The article
   advances the case for using the `Agency, Structure, Institution and
   Discourse' (ASID) approach as a framework within which to advance the
   analysis of the formation and transformation of `global social policy'.
   The recent development of the ILO and UN policy on advancing social
   protection floors is then used to illustrate how the ASID approach might
   be applied to an actual global social policy change.},

Abstract = {A long-standing problem in the US Mexico bilateral agenda is migration.
   Although both countries have important agreements to promote economic
   exchange and trade, the events of 9/11 and other acts of terrorism have
   increased concerns about bonier security. Since the US-Mexico bonier is
   one of the most important bottlers in the world in terms of activity,
   securing it without interfering with the legitimate flow of people and
   goods, poses an important challenge. The purpose of this paper is to
   propose conceptual frameworks and models to facilitate collaboration
   across national bottlers, by discussing and considering key factors for
   collaborative US Mexico Bonier Security Infrastructure and Systems.
   Bonier security technical solutions pose an interesting domain because
   there are a myriad of concerns (e.g., political, economic, social and
   cultural) outside the technical implementation that must be deliberated
   and examined. In this conceptual study, unique aspects of trust,
   governance, information sharing, culture, and technical infrastructure
   are identified as the key ingredients in a cross-bonier collaboration
   effort. A bi-national organizational network appears to be an effective
   institutional design to develop a better understanding of the problem,
   as well as required policies and technologies. This approach is
   consistent with experiments, research, and conclusions found in the
   European Union.},

Abstract = {Building on the formal literature on democratization, this paper models
   a dictator's choice between closed authoritarianism, electoral
   authoritarianism, and democracy in the shadow of violent revolt. Under
   autocracy, the dictator controls policy but lacks information on the
   policy demands of citizens and thus the likelihood of popular revolt.
   Electoral authoritarianism enables the dictator to tie policy choice to
   an electoral signal from citizens, which may be advantageous even if
   elections make revolt more likely to succeed. Implications are drawn for
   how economic inequality, regime strength, and uncertainty predict regime
   type, policy concessions, and political violence. A key result is that
   electoral authoritarianism is chosen for middle values of inequality and
   uncertainty.},

Abstract = {Do institutions designed to limit arbitrary government promote the
   survival of democratic regimes? Although the international effort to
   build the rule of law is predicated on a belief that they do, mainstream
   research on democratic survival typically treats institutions as
   epiphenomenal. We argue that institutions encourage regime survival by
   addressing problems of monitoring and social coordination that
   complicate democratic compromise. We find that property-rights
   institutions generally, and judicial institutions specifically,
   encourage survival, especially when macroeconomic conditions favor
   inter-class compromise.},

Abstract = {This article tests the impact of corruption on electoral turnout for
   over 200 elections from over 70 presidential systems conducted between
   1990 and 2011. Differentiating among three corruption indicators (i.e.,
   the International Country Risk Guide corruption indicator, the
   Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index, and the World
   Bank Control of Corruption measure), I evaluate corruption's precise
   impact on electoral participation in a pooled time series framework.
   Controlling for compulsory voting, semi-presidentialism, regime type,
   development, political culture, the closeness of the election, and state
   size, my results are nuanced. I find that corruption more narrowly
   defined as political corruption stifles turnout, whereas a rather broad
   definition of corruption, which includes societal and financial
   corruption, has no impact on macro-level turnout. Finally, I discover
   that the interactive impact of corruption on other variables in the
   turnout function is rather limited.},

Abstract = {Focusing on social movement organizations (SMOs) in the Czech Republic,
   this article explores the level of transnational activism of these
   actors. Although knowledge exists on domestic interest groups' choice of
   European Union (EU) venues for lobbying, the influence of EU funding on
   protest and public campaigning by actors such as SMOs remains
   under-studied. We show what the level of transnationalization of SMOs
   is, what types of transnational strategies SMOs employ, and what
   explains these choices. Specifically, the article examines the effect
   the EU has had on Czech SMOs. We are interested in whether EU funding
   contributed to their de-radicalization and co-optation by the political
   elite, or rather empowered them to engage in transnational protest. The
   results of our analysis support the empowerment hypothesis.},

Abstract = {This investigation note talks about the concept of political pacifism as
   a theoretical framework in International Relations. This concept that
   forms an analytic axis with realism or realpolitik, could help us to
   understand divers theoretical proposals that exist around the concepts
   of peace and war. Those proposals are based on a more or less
   justification of war.
   We present this political pacifism as one of the axis ends and, at the
   same time, as a theoretical proposal which starts with the beginning of
   human civilization. A tradition of thinking that has undergone a
   constant evolution as we will see in this paper.},

Abstract = {This article examines differences in the drivers of state Temporary
   Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and Medicaid immigrant eligibility
   policies, determined in the wake of the 1996 Welfare Reform. The
   findings show that differences in the incentive structures of the two
   programs may affect the way race politics influence each. Specifically,
   race is a strong negative correlate for TANF inclusion of immigrants as
   states with large African American populations were more likely to
   exclude legal permanent residents from the program. In the case of
   Medicaid, the size of the immigrant population is a strong positive
   correlate for inclusion. The effect of the size of the black population,
   although negative, is small and not significant. The study confirms
   extant research findings that ideological factors play an important role
   in the formation of both policies.},

Abstract = {Aaron Martin's (2012) recent article is the first to use survey data to
   compare the political participation of young people with that of older
   age groups in Australia. As such, it adds to our empirical knowledge of
   political participation, particularly by emphasising the changing focus
   of young people's engagement. Yet, like most mainstream, and especially
   quantitative, political participation researchers, Martin does not
   engage adequately with the growing, more critical literature). This
   response raises some of the issues emphasised in this literature,
   relating them directly to Martin's contribution. It has four sections:
   firstly, a brief consideration of Martin's main conclusions; secondly, a
   discussion of putative reasons for the change in forms of participation;
   thirdly, a consideration of broader forms of political participation;
   and finally, a consideration of the relationship between identity and
   political participation, which is at the core of most broader
   discussions of the latter.},

Pages = {58-80},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Presidential signing statements, especially ``constitutional{''} ones,
   have been characterized as line-item vetoes and a general abuse of
   power. But are signing statements so sinister? We suggest that the
   popular unilateral powers framework, as applied to signing statements,
   is inappropriate and that signing statements of all types function more
   like a dialogue with Congress. Using content analysis of all signing
   statements from 1977 to 2010, we demonstrate that signing statements
   routinely address general interbranch themes rather than the substance
   of a law. We thus provide a new perspective on presidential signing
   statements as a continuation of interbranch dialogue.},

Abstract = {This article undertakes a comparative study of the concept of federal
   supremacy as it appears in the constitutional texts and judicial
   doctrine of the United States, Australia, India, Canada, and Germany. It
   discusses the complex judicial techniques and principles developed in
   each of these federations, and argues that the approaches based on
   ``conflict{''} and ``field,{''} respectively, should be distinguished as
   opposing paradigms of interpretation. The field approach is criticized
   as being incompatible with a coherent vision of supremacy, and as being
   itself replete with conceptual problems that are unnecessary to the
   resolution of cases. It is further suggested that the conflict approach
   is in itself sufficiently flexible to be adapted to all situations.},

Abstract = {For all of the attention given to charisma in media accounts of
   presidential campaigns, there is surprisingly little systematic research
   on the use and effect of charismatic rhetoric, even though researchers
   outside of political science have attempted to deconstruct and analyze
   the different components of rhetorical speech. We draw from this
   scholarship to explore the use of different forms of charismatic
   rhetoric throughout the entire 2008 presidential campaign season. We use
   DICTION 5.0, a content analysis program designed specifically for
   political discourse, to explore the use of rhetoric in the campaign. We
   begin by mapping the prevalence of different types of rhetoric and then
   move on to examine the impact of partisanship and electoral context
   (primary vs. general election) on rhetorical choices.},

Abstract = {On joining the OSCE, states undertake comprehensive human-rights
   commitments. How have the states of Central Asia, whose regimes are not
   known for their progressive character in such matters, balanced concerns
   for security with human rights? The paper examines four incidents of
   human-rights abuses by state security forces. It further critically
   considers the efforts of the EU and the OSCE to pursue a security agenda
   while also promoting human rights in Central Asia; the latter have often
   suffered at the hands of the former. This looks set to continue as the
   focus on ``hard security{''} issues remains.},

Abstract = {As of August 7, 2010 the Colombian government has become more actively
   involved in Latin American regional issues. The most recognized
   achievements have been the reestablishment of diplomatic relations with
   Ecuador and Venezuela, the commitment made in different arenas to
   strengthen mechanisms of regional integration, the renewed interest in
   giving priority to relations with Latin America and the Caribbean, and
   the interest in diversifying international relations. The purpose of
   this paper is to analyze the evident shift in Colombia's foreign policy
   since Juan Manuel Santos assumed presidency and to detail the effects of
   this change in the framework of LatinAmerican regional integration.
   Also, the paper addresses how these new shifts could grant Colombia some
   degree of autonomy in its foreign policy.},

   a Qualification Controversy},
Journal = {POLITIX},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {26},
Number = {104},
Pages = {87+},
Abstract = {This article intends to study the controversies regarding the
   characterization and qualifications of colonial regimes (through the
   Algerian case). It focuses on several patterns: the colonial situation
   as permanent war, as state of exception, or as ambivalent regime
   fluctuating between peace and war. However, these controversies are not
   only theoretical or limited to the academic sphere. They were crucial
   during the entire colonial period. Colonial exceptions were regularly
   denounced, both in France and in the colony, precisely for the
   discrepancy between governmental metropolitan principles and colonial
   practices. The ambiguity of colonial regime not only has been a
   constraint for colonial administrators who had to justify their actions,
   but has also nourished the mobilisations of colonial actors, being
   French settlers of colonised Algerians.},

Abstract = {The decision of national governments to integrate and break down
   boundaries generates changes in subnational governments and it's a
   window of opportunity for them to increase their international
   management autonomy vis a vis the Central States. However, as shown by
   this article, the ability to turn this challenge into an opportunity or
   a problem will depend on the type and scope of integration processes on
   the one hand, and the geographic location and the production profile of
   each province, on the other.
   The article identifies two types of incentives: the direct and formal,
   such as participation channels and resources that provide EU governments
   subnational actors, and indirect incentives and informal, that in
   contrast to the first, from the action of markets and states. Mercosur
   is a hybrid case in this regard: while we are facing an increasingly
   open process space and resources at the national level logic prevailing
   dynamics and distribution remains in the hands of national bureaucracies
   and discourages collective action horizontal and crime, which ultimately
   is still powered by the markets and reduced major advantages compared
   those provinces.},

Volume = {42},
Number = {4},
Pages = {425-442},
Abstract = {This article outlines the contours of a historical-materialist policy
   analysis through a dual critique. First, historical-materialist
   approaches all too often conceptualize policy in a functionalist way as
   the ``outcomes{''} of predominant social relations, especially of class
   relations. The contingencies and the internal logic of policy processes
   are often downplayed. However, the correspondence (or lack thereof)
   between societal reproduction -i.e. the complex societal relationships
   in which people and collectives reproduce themselves materially and
   symbolically, as well as societal nature relations -and policy needs to
   be conceptualized. It is proposed to understand the state as, among
   other things, a ``knowledge apparatus{''} which attempts to create this
   correspondence. It constantly organizes or even produces knowledge about
   the objects it intends to steer, about societal and political issues,
   and about the possibilities of how to deal with problems. Secondly,
   policy analysis in general and interpretive policy analysis in
   particular have a simplified understanding of the state, due to their
   deficits in the field of state theory. From a perspective of a critical
   theory of the state and of hegemony, the state is understood to be a
   social relation with power-shaped selectivities, and is embedded in a
   context which likewise needs to be understood.},

Abstract = {Recent responses to the global economic crash of 2008, such as Occupy
   Wall Street and other political encampments, have raised important
   questions about the constitution of the ``we{''} and the relationship
   between democracy and change in the context of contemporary capitalism.
   To address these important new political developments, this article
   argues for ``participatory contract building{''} as a new direction in
   critical contract theory and participatory democracy. In order to unpack
   this approach, it analyzes the recent ``crowd-sourced{''}
   constitution-drafting process in Iceland. It is suggested that this
   example may provide a platform for a multi-tiered practice of
   participatory contract building, one that engages the many places in
   which we find ourselves subject to contractual relations in ways that
   offer people more opportunities to make meaningful decisions about the
   power relations that shape our lives.},

Abstract = {Regulation is a valuable tool for delivering policies. But some rules
   can be unjustifiably expensive from the perspective of citizens and

   planning and construction permits. Therefore, particular attention
   should be paid to potential ( or real) administrative costs and burdens
   resulting from local regulations. A method has been set out at OEDC and
   EU level. In Spain, best practices have begun to show results.},

Abstract = {Nazi discourse on womens' role since its inception as movement until its
   break down as regime is by no means original. However, its inflexibility
   makes of it a peculiar case in Western history. Once it took power over,
   Nationalsocialism became an outstanding case of all these anti-modernist
   currents opposing the emancipation of women. Starting in 1933 its praxis
   was addressed to worship maternity and domesticity, the true womens'
   realm, as well as keeping them away from the public sphere, mens' realm.
   Any attempt to bridge both spheres, the private and the public, was
   stigmatized as ``antinatural{''}. The argument will rely on original
   documents of the era, most of all writings and discourses by Adolf
   Hitler and the Reichsfrauenfuhrerin, Gertrud Scholtz-Klink.},

Abstract = {We asked a series of questions to Monica Cioli and David Rifkind,
   authors of two important books which focus on the process that enabled
   art and architecture to acquire a specific political meaning under
   fascism. The outcome is a dialogue that shows how the relationship
   between fascism and art is not characterized by a mere appropriation or
   a mutually functional exploitation between the artist or the architect
   and the fascist regime. Art prepares a specific appropriation of
   technology and serves to introduce the political anthropology of the
   fascist man. Similarly, architecture establishes an organization of
   urban spaces coherent and necessary to the hierarchical order of the
   corporatist society.},

Abstract = {Italian law recently imposed compulsory mediation before reaching a
   judge. That change produces important consequences at social and
   cultural level. A new professional profile arises, as a civil mediator,
   who address conflict by developing communicative process between parties
   in conflict. His/her aim is to create conditions for a paradigm shift
   from the traditional contraposition of conflicting parties through
   communication and comprehension of opposing views and understanding.
   Mediation involves the adaptation of a number of approaches to conflict
   including the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) methodology or the
   Ghandian approach. The Interdisciplinary Centre ``Sciences for Peace{''}
   (CISP) at Pisa University experienced in this regard through its
   research in the area of service provision for the homeless. The CISP
   research suggests that a holistic and systematic approach to conflict
   resolution is required. Such an approach requires that the social,
   cultural and political contexts of conflicting parties must be examined
   if social relationships are to be constructed or developed. To evolve
   from stereotypical fear and social prejudices, intervention through
   social mediation will develop cultural empowerment within communities of
   focus and thus reduce or resolve conflict situations.},

Abstract = {This article examines the cultural politics of organizing in the Occupy
   LA movement. Utilizing ethnographic methods and the analysis of digital
   media sources produced by a variety of Occupy activists, this study
   focuses on how members of Occupy LA, in the post camp eviction period,
   made efforts to infuse a new kind of class politics among members of the
   newly and structurally dispossessed in the Los Angeles area. It focuses
   mainly on their efforts to build bridges among a variety of community
   based social movements during specific actions such as May Day 2012 and
   their efforts to ally themselves with organizations fighting the
   gentrification of Downtown Los Angeles and Skid Row in particular.
   Utilizing the theoretical lens of David Harvey's notion of
   ``accumulation by dispossession{''} it concludes that Occupy LA has
   helped to open up new opportunities for rethinking the concept of
   ``class consciousness{''} and its relationship to the structural
   dispossession of black and Latino communities. It also concludes that
   while this new politics is tentative and fragile, it has also opened up
   a creativity in thinking through the practical organizational issues of
   dealing with organizing across lines of race, class, and gender.},

Abstract = {This article aims at analyzing the connections established between the
   sport phenomenon and politics in the Portuguese New State between 1933
   and 1945. What were the relations established between the Salazarist
   regime and sport? How did the government act in relation to sport and
   how did it fit (and was modeled) in to the proposal of social control
   put forward in the New State? In order to better comprehend these
   connections, I examine how sport was used as a strategy for the

Abstract = {Before the 1990s, very little research had been done on the religious
   dimension in the dynamics of internal and international violent
   conflicts. Two factors may explain this: first, the lack of interest of
   a good part of international theory in peace research and conflict
   resolution in particular; and, second, the negative impact of the
   division between the major disciplines of social sciences and area
   studies. This article takes this insufficiency as its starting point and
   assumes that the factors of greatest value in explaining violent
   conflict are diverse (political, economic or social processes), and to
   speak of a single factor (religion) in isolation makes little sense if
   it is not contextualized within a metatheory. Thus, the article presents
   several elements that are derived from the theory of conflict resolution
   and area studies on the Middle East and North Africa region, and which
   should be taken into consideration when examining the extent to which
   religion contributes to violent conflicts and their evolution.},

Abstract = {The sovereign debt crisis in Greece and other periphery countries is a
   yardstick for the viability of the European project: if Greece defaults
   and exits the Euro-zone, then the entire European architecture will be
   questioned. This article examines the origins of the Greek debt crisis
   and argues that the key sources of the debt are the economic and
   political factions that have dominated Greek politics since the fall of
   the Colonels in summer 1974 amidst the Cyprus calamity. These factions
   (political parties, comprador economic interests etc.), whose policy
   actions and preferences are amalgamated with the interests of
   Euro-Atlantic elites, are now being severely undermined, both
   politically and economically, as the prosperity of the Greek middle
   classes is eroded following two years of harsh austerity measures
   imposed on the Greek ruling factions by those Euro-Atlantic elites.
   Furthermore, this article outlines ways out of the Greek debt crisis,
   putting into test some reasonable policy proposals that are being widely
   discussed in Greece and abroad.},

Abstract = {An increasing emphasis on personalities, at the expense of party
   policies, is a trend that has been apparent in UK General Elections for
   the past two decades. However, the 2010 election saw that trend reach
   new heights in what is here described as a ``hollowed out{''} election.
   This article, based on research that investigates the news agendas of
   the parties and contrasts these with those of the media and the public,
   seeks to demonstrate the extent to which, with the exception of
   generalized debate about the state of the economy, there was an almost
   total absence of policy discussion by the parties and the media during
   the 2010 campaign. This is attributed to three factors: the impact of
   the first-ever leaders' televised debates, ideological convergence
   between the parties, and the fact that the two issues of greatest
   concern to the public-government spending cuts and immigration-were
   issues that the parties felt were ``too hot to handle.{''}},

Abstract = {I investigate the sciences for their use of the terms `democracy' and
   `democratic'. Findings suggest that particles do not behave in
   democratic ways as they are driven by strict forces. The key is to
   investigate whether these forces allow for `democratic' things to
   manifest when unicellular life emerges from the `prebiotic soup'. A
   small selection of eusocial and social nonhumans like gametes, crows and
   bonobos are described. We see that nonhumans do not practice complex
   democracy Rather, nonhumans have perfected specific behaviours that we
   as humans explain as `democratic' behaviours. A discussion follows
   arguing that evidence supports the idea of an underlying basic democracy
   We should look to nonhuman democratic specialization to see what we can
   borrow from them to use in our moral systems.},

Journal = {PARTY POLITICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {19},

Abstract = {In cross-national research on party systems, the empirical units of
   analysis are often assumed to be self-evident, which can be conducive to
   misleading research results. This problem is particularly important with
   regard to party system classification, for which a methodologically
   rigorous approach to the units of analysis is needed. This article
   proposes a set of operational criteria for identifying elements that
   qualify for inclusion within the universe of democratic party systems
   among individual election outcomes and country-specific sequences of
   elections. On this basis, I introduce additional criteria for
   distinguishing between party systems and party non-systems, and among
   party systems evolving within the same nation-state settings. By
   applying these criteria to a set of 1502 national legislative elections
   held in the world's democracies from 1792 to 2009, the article
   identifies 162 units that can be entered into a classification of the
   world's democratic party systems and 21 party non-systems.},

   domestic welfare system reforms},
Journal = {POLITIQUE EUROPEENNE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {40},
Number = {2},
Pages = {94-118},
Abstract = {The more recent literature on the transformation of national welfare
   systems has demonstrated that the European Union is an important
   variable to take into account in order to understand domestic reforms.
   Our aim is to analyse more precisely the political mechanisms thanks to
   which the EU plays a part in the social policy changes of its member
   States. We argue that in order to understand how the EU influence social
   policy reforms at the domestic level, it is necessary to look at the
   usages of European resources and constraints by national actors and to
   focus on how they transform them in political opportunities. We show
   that Europe contributes to change national welfare systems, making them
   more ``employment-friendly{''}. However, this change does not result
   from a direct pressure on national government, but rather from the
   availability of different resources that national actors can (or not)
   use in order to follow their interest and attain their aims. By using
   these resources, including negatively, they participate to the
   incorporation of ideas and norms defined at the EU level into the
   national debate and policy process, thus contributing to the
   Europeanisarion of domestic welfare reforms.},

Abstract = {In the initial stage of the Arab Spring, China did not have a clear
   policy towards what was happening in the Arab world. The result was
   cooperation with the West during the Libyan crisis. For the first time
   in its modern history, Chinese Navy dispatched ships in a rescue mission
   far away from its shores. The Chinese media was cheering its
   Government's efficiency and military capabilities aimed at saving
   Chinese workers abroad, trying to redirect attention of Chinese public
   from the main issue - the people's uprising.
   Arguably, Libya serves as another proof that humanitarian intervention,
   even when aimed at protecting civilians, is usually politically
   motivated. The Western military intervention threatened to undermine
   Chinese interests in Libya and, eventually, China expressed concern over
   its own internal situation. Although seemingly completely different in
   this regard, the situation in the Arab states had bore some resemblance
   to the Chinese political reality.
   When the revolution encompassed Syria, China started to fear that a
   defeat of the regime in Damascus could open the way for a final
   confrontation between the West and the theocratic regime in Iran.
   Accordingly, China had to assume a more proactive role in the Arab world
   and strengthen its alliance with Russia.},

Abstract = {Many analyses have provided evidence that the European agenda is not
   salient for the public and the EU political arena is perceived as a
   sphere in which less is at stake. However, in the political mobilization
   we could observe a growing interactions between the national and
   European agenda - not only national politics is thematized for the EP
   election campaign but also vice versa: European agenda is more and more
   present in the political appeals and voters mobilization. The economic
   and fiscal crises have accelerated these processes. The study examines
   Slovakia - a country with a specific integration trajectory and explores
   how the European agenda has entered the domestic politics recently. The
   analysis deals also with position of the political parties towards the
   EU integration and the images of the EU which emerged in the latest

Abstract = {We review advances in the study of retrospective voting, or how citizens
   evaluate and act on their perceptions of government performance. As a
   whole, the recent literature provides a more complete and nuanced
   picture of the retrospective voter as sometimes, but not always,
   effectively incentivizing elected officials to enhance public welfare.
   Leveraging examples of retrospective voting in areas other than the
   economy, the field is heading toward a middle ground in which voters
   resemble decision makers in many other domains. In many cases, a
   coherent logic governs voters' choices. In other instances, voters make
   mistakes, often in predictable ways subject to well-known psychological
   biases. Understanding the circumstances under which retrospective voting
   achieves effective democratic accountability and when it fails to do so
   is an important task for subsequent research. We discuss two additional
   issues for future exploration: a better understanding of normative
   benchmarks, and increased attention to the relationship between
   retrospective voting behavior and policy outcomes.},

Title = {Can Climate Change Negotiations Succeed?},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {1},
Number = {2},
Pages = {138-150},
Abstract = {More than two decades of climate change negotiations have produced a
   series of global climate agreements, such as the Kyoto Protocol and the
   Copenhagen Accords, but have nevertheless made very limited progress in
   curbing global emissions of greenhouse gases. This paper considers
   whether negotiations can succeed in reaching an agreement that
   effectively addresses the climate change problem. To be effective, a
   climate agreement must cause substantial emissions reductions either
   directly (in the agreement's own lifetime) or indirectly (by paving the
   way for a future agreement that causes substantial emissions reductions
   directly). To reduce global emissions substantially, an agreement must
   satisfy three conditions. Firstly, participation must be both
   comprehensive and stable. Secondly, participating countries must accept
   deep commitments. Finally, the agreement must obtain high compliance
   rates. We argue that three types of enforcement will be crucial to
   fulfilling these three conditions: (1) incentives for countries to
   ratify with deep commitments, (2) incentives for countries that have
   ratified with deep commitments to abstain from withdrawal, and (3)
   incentives for countries having ratified with deep commitments to comply
   with them. Based on assessing the constraints that characterize the
   climate change negotiations, we contend that adopting such three-fold
   potent enforcement will likely be politically infeasible, not only
   within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, but
   also in the framework of a more gradual approach. Therefore, one should
   not expect climate change negotiations to succeed in producing an
   effective future agreement-either directly or indirectly.},

Abstract = {In scores of countries, the adoption of gender quotas has boosted the
   numbers of women elected to national legislatures. How does the growing
   presence of women affect legislative behavior regarding women's rights?
   Using an original dataset of all the bills submitted to the Argentine
   Congress between 1983 and 2007, we analyze the relationship between
   women's presence in Congress and the introduction and approval of bills
   related to women's rights. Our dataset allows us to compare three
   periods with varying levels of women's presence in both legislative
   chambers (the first without quotas, the second with a quota in one
   chamber, and the third with full quota implementation in both chambers).
   Our results confirm the necessity of distinguishing between the process
   of legislative behavior and its outcome. We show that many more women's
   rights bills were introduced when women held a greater share of seats in
   both chambers. However, the approval rates of these bills actually
   declined. Despite their greater presence, women continue to be
   marginalized in the legislature and to suffer reduced political
   efficacy.},

Abstract = {The decision to enter into peace negotiations with the FARC represents
   the latest in a series of attempts by Colombia's Santos administration
   to prioritise political over military activities in seeking an end to
   the country's internal conflict. Yet despite favourable political
   conditions, a number of major challenges remain which could prevent a
   meaningful peace settlement from coming to fruition. Matt Ince argues
   that the single largest obstacle in this regard is the potential for the
   talks to cause fragmentation within the FARC, an outcome that could
   impede its leaders in negotiating a settlement viewed as legitimate by
   the entire organisation, while opening the door to the emergence of FARC
   splinter groups in the period ahead.},

Abstract = {Migration processes intensification that often turns around into the
   growth of social tensions poses before researchers the whole array of
   acute issues. What role does ethnicity play in how host society
   perceives migrants? Is a migrant's ethnic affiliation the main factor
   that determines attitude towards him? What is rejection of migrants
   based on? What can cause interethnic conflict? Looking for answers to
   these questions D.Karanov turns to the cultural aspects of interethnic
   interaction revealing the role of cultural factors that find their
   refection in key identities, in relations between migrants and members
   of host society under conditions of multiethnic urban atmosphere.},

Abstract = {At the center of debates on deliberative democracy is the issue of how
   much deliberation citizens experience in their social networks. These
   disagreements about disagreement come in a variety of forms, with
   scholars advocating different empirical approaches (e.g., ; ) and coming
   to different substantive conclusions. We address these discrepancies by
   going back to the basics: investigating the consequences of conceptual
   and measurement differences for key findings relating interpersonal
   political disagreement to political attitudes and behaviors. Drawing on
   the 20082009 ANES panel study, we find evidence that different measures
   of disagreement have distinct effects when it comes to individuals
   preferences, patterns of engagement, and propensities to participate. We
   discuss the implications for the study of social influence; as
   interpersonal disagreement can mean different things, scholars should
   think carefully about how to study it and should exercise caution when
   making pronouncements about its empirical and democratic consequences.},

Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {35},
Number = {1},
Pages = {44-64},
Abstract = {The neoconservatives have fallen out of favor among Washington
   policymakers under President Obama as well as among conservatives
   themselves. However, neoconservatives' impact on contemporary political
   discourse remains significant. This article is about the evolution of
   neoconservatives' thinking about capitalism. Specifically, it is about
   neoconservatives' ideological journey from right-wing critics of
   capitalism to one of its most ardent defenders. At the heart of their
   writing about capitalism are two distinct, but related cultural
   critiques of capitalism. In their view, capitalism creates a culture
   that is decadent, effeminate, and preoccupied with immediate
   gratification. This culture threatens the Protestant ethic and the
   heroic virtues of patriotic self-sacrifice. The Protestant ethic
   legitimizes capitalist accumulation and inequality, while the heroic
   virtues made the US a global superpower. Through supply-side economics
   and American empire the neoconservatives sought to recover both, the
   cultural foundations of capitalism located in the Protestant ethic and
   the heroic virtues of a global superpower. Neoconservative writings on
   capitalism are key to understanding the shift in the discourse on the
   economy, the welfare state, and foreign policy over the last thirty
   years.},

Pages = {196-204},
Abstract = {Against scepticism from thinkers including John Rawls and Thomas Nagel
   about the appropriateness of justice as the concept through which global
   ethical concerns should be approached, Amartya Sen argues that the
   problem lies not with the idea of justice, but with a particular
   approach to thinking of justice, namely a transcendental approach. In
   its stead Sen is determined to offer an alternative systematic theory of
   justice, namely a comparative approach, as a more promising foundation
   for a theory of `global justice.' But in the end Sen offers no such
   thing. He does not develop a theory of justice and this is all to the
   good; for if values are plural in the way Sen suggests, then justice is
   not a master idea but one value among many, and it should be neither the
   first virtue of social institutions, nor the notion that frames all our
   reflections on ethical and political life.},

Abstract = {For thousands of years people have saved their loudest praise for
   individuals who made `the ultimate sacrifice.' Recently, however, many
   people have begun to equate suicide terrorism with sacrificial heroism.
   These assertions benefit from a general lack of conceptual clarity
   regarding the nature of sacrificial heroism itself. Therefore, this
   paper aims to explore, describe, and define sacrificial heroism, arguing
   that it requires two primary things: the risk of something highly
   valued; and the attempt to achieve a directly morally positive result.
   The paper then reviews four representative scenarios, including two
   types of suicide terrorism and two types of sacrificial heroism, in
   order to highlight several critical differences between those actions
   that deserve to be praised as supremely heroic and those which clearly
   do not.},

Abstract = {American rhetoric has repeatedly painted Canada as a conduit for
   terrorists to enter the USA. But what actually happens at Canada's
   borders? This article analyses open-source, cross-sectional data on
   Canadians convicted of terrorism offences between 1999 and 2011. It
   applies social network analysis (SNA) investigating stochastic networks
   by means of the structure of human groups using pairwise links among
   their members - to (1) identify the drivers, nature and direction of
   Canada-US extremist cross-border traffic; (2) generate hypotheses from a
   limited data set that can be subjected to further empirical scrutiny
   with the aim of modelling cross-border extremist networks more
   generally; and (3) assess the risk they pose by measuring the extent to
   which such networks increase or reduce marginal costs. SNA of nine cases
   involving 14 subjects between 1997 and 2011 finds no systematic
   terrorist threat directed at the USA emanating from Canada. That finding
   is reinforced by the simple structure of cross-border networks.
   Terrorist traffic actually runs both ways, exploits countervailing
   transaction costs in the form of markets of opportunity on either side
   of the border, and much of the effort is in support of terrorist
   activity outside of North America. Most subjects crossed the Canada-US
   border legally at ports of entry, suggesting that enforcement resources
   are better spent on flows than controls at the actual border.},

Pages = {87-99},
Abstract = {In recent years, political theorists have begun to grapple with the
   important normative questions that arise in relation to claims for
   language rights. This paper will seek to contribute to this ongoing
   debate by focusing in detail on the issue of linguistic survival. It
   will consider to what extent the members of a minority language
   community can demand that they have a right to see their language
   survive into the future. This question will be considered from two
   distinct perspectives. First, from an individualist perspective: can the
   members, as individuals, demand that they have a right to see the
   language survive? Secondly, from a group perspective: can the members,
   as a collective, demand that they have a right to see the language
   survive? In both instances it will be demonstrated that the concept of
   survival raises a number of substantial normative and ontological
   problems; ones that mean that a right to such a good would be extremely
   difficult to justify. Given this, it is concluded that those linguistic
   activists who have tended to base their rights claims on the concept of
   survival need to reflect critically on their arguments and develop a new
   conceptual vocabulary.},

Abstract = {The European Union's (EU) relationship with North African countries has
   long been the subject of intense academic enquiry. For many years, the
   EU has performed a difficult balancing act between managing the security
   concerns of its member states, dealing with authoritarian regimes that
   have questionable human rights records, creating and maintaining good
   economic relations, and pursuing more normative objectives. Have
   security objectives overridden other concerns? While the EU has
   cooperated with regimes with questionable human rights records,
   counterterrorism cooperation between the EU and North African countries
   has not developed as much as previous academic studies believe. However,
   what are the prospects of this changing with more recent developments
   after the Arab Spring? This article examines in detail the reasons why
   the EU does not currently conduct significant counterterrorism
   cooperation with North African countries and discusses whether this
   situation is likely to change as a result of the events of the Arab
   Spring, which has swept through North Africa and the Middle East since
   2010.},

Abstract = {In the summer of 2012, two candidates faced off for the Republican
   nomination to the US Senate from Texas: a Cuban-American with limited
   Spanish-language skills and a bilingual Anglo. How important were these
   counter-stereotypical language skills? Does fluency in Spanish (or the
   lack thereof) matter to voters? Does the degree to which language
   ability matters depend on the ethnicity of the candidates, or of the
   voters? We explore these questions with a series of randomized survey
   experiments: one with Republican voters in Texas just prior to the
   primary election, and later with three Internet experiments. We find
   that language ability matters. Latino voters, including Republican
   Latinos in Texas, reward bilingual ability. In contrast, Anglo
   Republican voters punish it, but not in Texas.},

Abstract = {Do sub-national parties reproduce the programmatic orientation of the
   party as a whole? Or are they able to adjust their programmatic
   orientation to their sub-national electorate? I seek to answer these
   questions based on the policy positions of German sub-national parties
   and survey data on voters' positions. Referring to these very similar
   parties - which all have to commit themselves to certain policy
   positions in the run-up to state elections - allows for a controlled
   analysis of sub-national parties' autonomy. The analyses reveal that the
   regional context does play a role; voters' preferences and the
   unemployment rate appear to influence the dynamics of party positions.
   However, the results also show that regional branches of the same party
   change their positions in a similar way and also seek not to distance
   themselves too far from the national party line. This indicates that
   German sub-national parties appear first and foremost to be regional
   party branches of national parties.},

Abstract = {In present-day South Africa we are daily confronted with individual or
   group scenes of violence in townships and `shanty-towns' where people
   live in poverty. Frequently, it involves people clamouring for the
   redemption of the promises made to them by politicians prior to the
   first democratic election in 1994 promises of a wonderful `new South
   Africa' that would meet their needs. In reality, their common experience
   is of a housing shortage, poor education, few jobs and very little
   prospect of alleviating their profound poverty. It seems as if in our
   country violence has become the power of the powerless.
   It would, of course, be entirely misleading to give the impression that
   violence is a phenomenon created by the `New South Africa', for under
   the previous government we experienced violence on an enormous scale, in
   particular statesponsored violence, and structural violence. But it was
   not accompanied with promises that this would become better. At present
   it is this gap between the `promised land' and harsh reality that to a
   large extent seems to fuel the violence.},

Title = {The European Public Sphere: Myth, Reality or Aspiration?},
Journal = {POLITICAL STUDIES REVIEW},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The discussion about the public sphere only began to have significant
   relevance within the setting of the European Union in the middle of the
   1990s when a growing degree of attention was directed towards European
   integration and the role of national and transnational media in
   providing thrust for it. Since then, the notion of the public sphere has
   been seen as a central feature of European democracies, shaping the
   coherence of political systems and decision-making processes. There has
   also been a tendency in the literature to perceive the European public
   sphere (EPS) as having positive effects on the EU by endowing it with
   legitimacy and providing a space where its institutions and leaders can
   be made more transparent and accountable. What is disputed throughout
   this scholarship is the possibility of creating an overarching European
   public sphere that would act as a transnational discursive space uniting
   various communication fluxes and actors from all strata of society.
   However, the answers provided by scholars for this puzzle are at most
   ambiguous or undecided and seem to be torn between viewing the EPS as
   aspiration, myth or reality.

Title = {INTRA-REGIONAL INTEGRATION IN LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN AND THE
   MISSING TRANSPACIFIC LINK},
Journal = {REVISTA ANDINA DE ESTUDIOS POLITICOS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {3},
Number = {1},
Pages = {186-203},
Abstract = {The Asia-Pacific (AP) and Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) regions
   are not only the main poles of dynamism in what is considered to be an
   intractable global economic environment, but they are also at the
   forefront of important geopolitical transformations. Spurred by the
   promise of a greater role in world affairs, LAC governments have been
   actively pursuing new regionalization strategies with the aim of
   positioning LAC as an alternative constellation of power in an
   increasingly inter-dependent and complex multi-polar international
   system. Though LAC's emergence onto the world stage is in part explained
   by the growing importance of transpacific economic relations, these have
   been relatively understudied, particularly, as they concern the
   development of alternative regionalization processes in the Western
   Hemisphere. This essay seeks to explain the evolution of the latest
   waves of LAC intra-regional integration and cooperation in the context
   of robust transpacific economic relations. Broader theoretical
   perspectives on the regionalization of the international political
   economy help explain the transition from ``open{''} towards
   ``post-liberal{''} strategies of regionalism in LAC. The Union of South
   American Nations (UNASUR) serves as a case study through which to
   underscore the main characteristics of post-liberal regionalism, and
   assess the prospects for intra-regional integration and cooperation
   within a heterogeneous and multilayered landscape of regional groupings.
   Additional observations are made on the current trends in South-South
   trade and investment relations between the AP and LAC, how they impact
   regionalization processes in LAC and how intra-regional groups can help
   strengthen transpacific relations in the coming years.},

   Alternative Development Opportunity},
Journal = {ASIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Pages = {21-40},
Abstract = {China, once seen as a threat by the states of South Asia, is now viewed
   correctly as an alternative development opportunity. The unprecedented
   success of the Chinese development model places it as an obvious
   alternative to that offered by India-or indeed by the Western model of
   development-but what implications does this have for the middle and
   small powers that surround India, and indeed for India and the Western
   developed world? The fundamental rationale for China's relations with
   South Asia has changed radically, but the Sino-centric nature of Chinese
   foreign policy remains. Uniquely, for India's neighbours, but also for
   the global political economy as a whole, Chinese economic power raises
   political issues of human security, economic interdependence, and the
   relationship between physical infrastructure and the benefits of global
   public goods. The Chinese necessity to tranship through South Asia is
   identified as a complex new reality for the great power.},

Abstract = {As the new-look Obama administration sets foreign policy goals for the
   coming four years, many of the changes that swept through the Middle
   East during the US president's first term will continue to reshape
   regional geopolitics. It is within this context that the relationship
   between the US and its NATO partner in the region, Turkey, could come to
   play a vital role. Beniamin Poghosyan argues that after a period of
   apparent distance, during which Turkey prioritised its relations with
   non-Western allies, Ankara's recent policies show a renewed emphasis on
   its strategic alliance with the US in its attempt to successfully ride
   the waves of unrest in the Middle East.},

Abstract = {This article examines if the emergence of more partisan media has
   contributed to political polarization and led Americans to support more
   partisan policies and candidates. Congress and some newer media outlets
   have added more partisan messages to a continuing supply of mostly
   centrist news. Although political attitudes of most Americans have
   remained fairly moderate, evidence points to some polarization among the
   politically involved. Proliferation of media choices lowered the share
   of less interested, less partisan voters and thereby made elections more
   partisan. But evidence for a causal link between more partisan messages
   and changing attitudes or behaviors is mixed at best. Measurement
   problems hold back research on partisan selective exposure and its
   consequences. Ideologically one-sided news exposure may be largely
   confined to a small, but highly involved and influential, segment of the
   population. There is no firm evidence that partisan media are making
   ordinary Americans more partisan.},

Title = {Pluralism and liberalism: reading the Indian Constitution as a
   philosophical document for constitutional patriotism},
Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {16},
Number = {5},
Pages = {676-697},
Abstract = {Liberalism and pluralism are seen as being in tension in liberal Western
   nation-states, while multiculturalism, as a policy of resource
   allocation to minority groups, has been the standard response to
   pluralization. This limits the pluralist potential of a constitutional
   liberalism. The fusion of a liberal theory of autonomous individuality
   with a pluralist theory of multiple belonging has to look beyond
   multicultural policy in order to enhance liberal commitments to citizens
   through pluralist provisions. An analysis of the Indian Constitution's
   Fundamental Rights, as a normative document, shows that the citizen can
   be understood as an autonomous individual given identity through
   belonging to a plurality of groups. Consequently, rights are taken to
   accrue to all citizens equally as autonomous individuals, but also by
   virtue of their belonging to groups, with special provisions made
   available for vulnerable ones. Rights for a plurality of vulnerable
   groups should not be seen as illiberal additions but integral to the
   conception of liberalism. If such a view of citizenship were to be
   integrated into the liberal constitutions of irreversibly pluralizing
   Western democracies, then a pluralistic constitutional patriotism could
   be fostered amongst members of vulnerable groups, while demonstrating
   that standard liberal rights guarantee equal citizenship for all.},

Pages = {157-167},
Abstract = {Simulations are employed widely as teaching tools in political science,
   yet evidence of their pedagogical effectiveness, in comparison to other
   methods of instruction, is mixed. The assessment of learning outcomes is
   often a secondary concern in simulation design, and the qualitative and
   quantitative methods used to evaluate outcomes are frequently based on
   faulty paradigms of the learning process and inappropriate indicators.
   Correctly incorporating assessment into simulation design requires that
   an instructor identify whether a simulation should produce positive
   changes in students' substantive knowledge, skills, and/or affective
   characteristics. The simulation must then be assessed in ways that
   accurately measure whether these goals have been achieved. Proper
   assessment can help demonstrate that simulations are productive tools
   for learning and that their popularity in the classroom is justified.},

   growth and continuous launch of new Social Programs have marked the year

   genocide},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GENOCIDE RESEARCH},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Pages = {41-67},
Abstract = {Can genocides be predicted? I present two models (and further robustness
   tests) to assess the risk of genocide onset one year into the future.
   The first model is global and includes all country-years for which data
   are available. While it does a good job at identifying the few cases of
   genocide onset in the sample, it also generates a high number of false
   alarms. The second model uses a smaller sample restricted to
   conflict-years. It correctly identifies nine of the ten cases of
   genocide onset and the number of false alarms is reduced, although the
   model needs further improvements before it can be put to practical use.
   While developing the models in an inductive, iterative way, I identify a
   number of factors that correlate with genocide onset, adding to existing
   research. These include direct threats to a government (riots,
   assassinations and, in one of the robustness tests, anti-government
   demonstrations) and economic discrimination against ethnic groups.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE EDUCATION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {9},
Number = {3},
Pages = {336-344},
Abstract = {This article investigates the effect of long-term learning teams on a
   student's retention of factual knowledge, ability to apply theories to
   analyze political events, and perception of the learning experience. The
   study compares two sections of an introductory world politics course-one
   that grouped students into long-term learning teams and one that did
   not. The results revealed that learning teams that met weekly helped
   students recall facts and cooperate with others to learn. However,
   learning teams did little to enhance a student's ability to use theories
   to explain political events. This suggests that future analysis of
   learning teams might focus on the dynamics found within the group and/or
   on how student personalities affect the learning process.},

Abstract = {An important purpose of the law is to communicate to people what is
   expected of them. Additionally, laws can send signals that sanction or
   prohibit certain actions. However, for laws to be effective in
   communicating messages, it requires them to be heard and interpreted by
   target populations in the ways policy makers intended, yet that is not
   always the case. This chapter examines whether current laws send signals
   encouraging foreigners to migrate to the United States, or for teenagers
   to engage in sexual activity. What it concludes is that there is little
   evidence to support the beliefs that immigrants are a financial drain on
   the economy or that the teaching of sex education to teenagers increases
   their sexual activity.},

Title = {Just a Matter of Identity? Support for Independence in Catalonia},
Journal = {REGIONAL AND FEDERAL STUDIES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {23},
Number = {5},
Pages = {523-545},
Abstract = {The Catalan case is usually depicted in the literature as a typical
   example of a nation without state with a predominant civic nationalism,
   where the importance of dual identities tends to generate claims for
   self-government short of independence. However, the recent evolution of
   Catalan and Spanish politics shows that independence receives relevant
   levels of support even among groups expressing some degree of
   identification with the state identity. This paper aims to fill the gap
   in this relatively unexplored dimension of Catalan nationalism by
   analysing the factors that help explain support for independence in
   Catalonia. The results of the research point to the importance of
   identity in explaining attitudes towards independence but also that it
   receives widespread support across Catalan society, suggesting much more
   complex relations.},

Abstract = {This paper argues that not only is there a relationship between birth
   activism and abortion activism, but that if empowering women is the
   goal, the two cannot be separated. By understanding how women's bodies
   have been controlled and their reproductive lives appropriated, the
   current pro-choice and birth activist frameworks that are used to
   advocate for women can no longer be understood to address women's needs.
   It is by working through the framework of full-spectrum reproductive
   justice that women may become truly empowered to regain control over
   their reproductive lives.},

Abstract = {The article presents an attempt of the analysis of the Soviet Union
   policy in comparison to the Russian Empire. The author proposes and
   justifies an argument that the Soviet Union used to be a peculiar type
   of the empire. The comparative analysis of the Soviet Union and the
   Russian Empire is conducted on the basis of three parameters that are of
   major significance for the 20th century imperial formations:
   modernization, nationalism and ideology. According to the author's
   conclusion, despite the fact that the Soviet Union achieved remarkable
   success in fulfilling its geopolitical aspirations, it failed to
   efficiently solve the problems that played a decisive role in
   determining the empire's fate. The global crisis allowed the Soviet
   Union to gain the status of superpower, but after having proved

Title = {Unofficial men, efficient civil servants: Raphael Lemkin in the history
   of international law},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GENOCIDE RESEARCH},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {297-316},
Abstract = {This article examines Raphael Lemkin's campaign for the Genocide
   Convention in the context of other internationalist projects pursued at
   the UN in the postwar era. Lemkin's papers at the American Jewish
   Historical Society, as well as at the New York Public Library, testify
   to his concern that his ambition to establish genocide as a particularly
   criminal act would be disrupted either by advocates of the Universal
   Declaration of Human Rights or by international lawyers and civil
   servants working at the UN Legal Commission, prioritizing the concept of
   crimes against humanity and the Nuremberg Judgment. While his project to
   create an internationally recognized law to make genocide a crime was
   legalistic in its implicit faith in the power of lawmaking, Lemkin
   cannily sought to distance the Convention from those promoting the
   renewal of international law in a period defined more by realist
   skepticism about interwar approaches. Instead, he rooted genocide in a
   religiously inflected moral idiom that could distance his project from
   those pursuing a broader agenda of international legal codification,
   which met with scorn especially from those journalists whom Lemkin
   successfully recruited to the cause of prohibiting genocide. In order to
   demonstrate this claim, this article first establishes that Lemkin's
   concern to preserve the basic idea behind the minority protection
   treaties set him apart from other international jurists of the period
   working towards the establishment of binding legal enforcement for the
   protection of individual human rights. It then contextualizes Lemkin's
   rivalry with the legalists by examining the effort by UN civil servants
   and international lawyers to revive the prewar project to expand
   international law, arguing that it compels a reconsideration of
   Lemkin's, and the Genocide Convention's, place in the history of
   international law and legal order more broadly.},

Title = {The fifth wave of democratisation?: Political change without regime
   change in Arab countries},
Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {50},
Number = {3},
Pages = {893-934},
Abstract = {From a comparative perspective, this paper studies political change
   processes that followed the Arab protests and revolutions since December
   2010. Previous experiences show the tendency of democracies to appear in
   waves. However, we hypothesise that we are not facing a new wave of
   democratisation in the Arab World, but a wave of political change that
   comprises several different processes (democratization, political
   liberalisation, new forms of authoritarianism or cosmetic reforms of
   authoritarian regimes). Firstly, we frame current dynamics in North
   Africa and the Middle East into a fifth wave of political change.
   Secondly, we study political change models and consider their origins,
   proceedings and current political processes. Thirdly, we examine these
   processes, paying especial attention to changes in party systems,
   constitutional reforms and elections. Finally, we evaluate if a change
   in the nature of Arab regimes has taken place. Our main conclusion is
   that in countries that have started a transition towards democracy, a
   resulting democratic regime is unclear (Tunisia, Libya and Yemen) or the
   democratic transition has failed (Egypt). In addition, the remaining
   Arab countries with political reforms have not registered a real change
   in their regimes, which remain authoritarian},

Title = {Party members in a pillarised partitocracy. An empirical overview of
   party membership figures and profiles in Belgium},

Abstract = {This study examines the pillarised and partitocratic nature of Belgian
   political parties via an empirical overview of their party on the
   ground. Two main research questions guide the study: To what extent can
   party membership figures in Belgium be considered as ideal-typical of
   pillarised or partitocratic parties? And how does the social and
   political profile of party members in Belgium correspond to what one
   might expect from pillarised or partitocratic parties? The study relies
   on two types of data set: party membership figures since WWII and
   membership survey data of the four `dominant' relatives in each party
   family in Belgium. The article shows contradicting results. Although
   party membership figures have nuanced the idea of partitocratic and
   pillar parties, the analysis of the profile of party members has
   produced more conclusive results. The members of some parties (PS,
   CD\&V) still display a strong encapsulation in their sociological world,
   report specific reasons for joining, as well as lower levels of activism
   than in other parties. The pillar parties in Belgium seem to have
   reached a paradoxical situation in which their anchorage in civil
   society is still very strong, yet it relies on a shrinking social basis.
   These results raise the question of the incentives that parties offer to
   their party on the ground to mobilise citizens for participation. They
   indicate a need to look more systematically and empirically at this
   neglected aspect of party organisation, as it provides important
   information for the debate on party decline. Acta Politica (2013) 48,

Abstract = {The (alleged) existence of a large number of voters feasibly to be

   because it implies that these individuals will vote in accordance with
   the choice made by the manipulator agent outside their own interests.
   Regardless of the veracity of the premise, its roots in Mexican
   political culture, generated actions and statements that impacted the
   presidential election process. But this idea - that of voting against
   the interests of the voter-has in the Left tradition an ancient
   treatment that linked at least Marx, Lenin and Gramsci. Here we address
   the linkage between this treatment and the relationship with Mexico in
   2012.},

Abstract = {Riker famously theorized that political actors faced with suboptimal
   outcomes might be able to garner a more desirable one by adding issues
   to the agenda. To date, limited support for Riker's theory of
   heresthetics exists, primarily consisting of case studies and anecdotal
   evidence. We offer a systematic analysis of heresthetical maneuvers in
   the context of Supreme Court decision making. We argue justices who
   oppose a potential case outcome may add alternative issues to the record
   in an effort to restructure the terms of debate. Data from justices'
   behavior during oral argument support Riker's theory.},

Abstract = {What are the conditions under which external actors positively influence
   democratization? A growing literature analyzes the external dimension of
   democratization, focusing, for instance, on the power of EU enlargement
   conditionality to spur democratic reform in the post-communist world,
   and especially the Balkans. This paper compares the effect of Western
   leverage over transitions in the Balkans and the Arab Spring countries.
   Western democratic leverage is a function of external power and internal
   vulnerability to external democratizing pressure, but it is also related
   to factors such as Western political will, the influence of
   countervailing external powers, and nationalist resistance. The article
   demonstrates that on all of these dimensions, Western democratic
   leverage over the Arab Spring countries is significantly lower than it
   has been over the Balkan states, and thus that the prospects for
   democratization in states such as Egypt, Libya, and Tunisia are dimmer.},

Abstract = {This paper tackles the problem of comparison between proximity and
   directional voting in 27 European multi-party systems. This is a
   previously unaddressed aspect of European spatial issue voting. We focus
   on the spatial voting theories as predictors of vote intention,
   evaluating the extent of proximity and directional voting. We describe
   the influence of identical predictions on the comparison of these
   theories. Our multilevel analysis of the 2009 European Election Study
   data shows more empirical support for proximity voting than directional
   voting in the countries analyzed. It does this by clearly
   differentiating between those cases where it is possible to compare
   proximity and directional voting and where this is impossible.
   Nevertheless, the prevalence of proximity theory decreases in more
   polarized party-systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The last state of the discipline survey was done 15 years ago. In
   celebration of the 40th anniversary of Politikon the authors take stock
   of the transformation of the discipline since 1994 to show how changes
   in the tertiary education sector have influenced Political Science.
   Results of a survey of the discipline, which includes academic modules
   offered in Political Science and International Relations, as well as
   ratings of academic departments and individual scholars are analysed to
   show the significant changes that have occurred since the last survey.
   New and a greater variety of modules are offered, research outputs have
   increased, as have the numbers of students. On the whole, Political
   Science scholars are more positive about the discipline than 15 years
   ago. We conclude by arguing that policy relevance remains an issue and
   that there is a need for a greater African focus.},

   political philosophy as if it were a performance act. Zizek is a
   neo-Leninist writer, a political-philosophical shepherd, but he is not
   the Shepherd Borat. Kurelic criticizes and rejects Zizek's
   reinterpretation of Benjamins's `divine violence' as theoretically
   incorrect and politically useless. By comparing Zizek's and Arendt's
   understanding of the French Revolution Kurelic wants to show why the
   `divine violence' recommended by Zizek would for Arendt be an `element
   of totalitarianism'. He points out that the political success of
   socialist and communist ideas was always derived from the vision of the
   better future, not from the promises of unrestrained revenge and
   political violence. Zizek's attempt to reconcile the terror of the
   Jacobins with his modern revolutionary neo-Leninism is a political
   nonstarter.},

Journal = {STUDIES IN INDIAN POLITICS},

Abstract = {In his famous study of the impact of electoral regimes on party systems,
   Duverger suggested that two-party systems are always found to be
   associated with single-member constituencies where candidates are
   elected by a plurality of votes (Duverger, 1964).
   Many studies of what Rae called the political consequences of electoral
   laws have tended to confirm this well-known electoral `law'. A few
   studies (Betz, 2006; Chhibber and Murali, 2006; Diwakar, 2007, 2010),
   however, have drawn attention to India's exceptionalism in terms of
   party aggregation.
   This article explores a relatively minor-and thus less-examined but
   nonetheless puzzling-aspect of Indian exceptionalism: the spectacular
   failure overall of candidates (and of minor parties) to conform to
   Duverger's law. Since 1957, the first national election after States
   Reorganisation, the average number of candidates standing in Lok Sabha
   constituencies in all states has tended to rise. In 2004, for example,
   in all but four states there were more than 10 candidates per
   constituency in over 90 per cent of constituencies.
   In this article I explore why neither the mechanical nor the
   psychological processes commonly understood to be so compelling
   elsewhere exert significant influence in India. This suggests that there
   are hitherto unrecognized presuppositions to Duverger's law.},

Abstract = {Decades of research has shown that economic considerations are strongly
   tied to evaluations of the president. Many studies have found that
   framing (often called priming) by news coverage, events, and
   presidential rhetoric can increase the weight of economic and other
   considerations in presidential evaluations. I use a survey experiment to
   show that attribution frames can decrease the weight of economic
   considerations on presidential evaluations. The finding holds
   implications for the public's capacity to hold the president accountable
   and presidents' legislative strategies.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS AND LAW},

Abstract = {The prior policymaking literature has been largely theoretical and
   focused upon agenda setting and the initiation mechanisms of policy
   change, namely triggering events. Notably absent from the prior
   literature have been studies aimed at developing and empirically
   evaluating models of policymaking as a process with outcomes. Such a
   process/outcome model of policymaking would necessarily include
   initiation mechanisms, or triggering events, agenda setting, politics,
   and subsequent outcomes (intended vs. unintended). This paper applies
   such a process and outcome model through an evaluative case study of the
   tragic death of Martin Lee Anderson in a Florida juvenile boot camp. The
   death of Martin Lee Anderson in January, 2006 sparked a major debate and
   a series of subsequent policy initiatives in Florida related to juvenile
   boot camps, the treatment of juveniles in confinement, and overall
   accountability of the state's juvenile justice system. Employing
   multiple data sources, the evaluation assesses the triggering events,
   subsequent processes, and resulting policy outcomes. The findings
   demonstrate that policymaking occurs in a sequential manner with
   identifiable stages. Different actors influence each stage of the
   process and help to shape the final policy outcomes. However, using the
   methods of in-depth interviews and participant observations revealed
   that outcomes are also shaped by various political negotiations which
   are not easily captured through conventional research and evaluation
   methods.},
