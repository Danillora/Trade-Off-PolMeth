Abstract = {The European Union (EU) has become an important global actor in numerous
   areas. It is an economic giant, a key actor in global trade and trade
   negotiations. It leads talks on environment and it is the biggest
   provider of assistance to the developing world. It is the largest
   contributor to the United Nations budget and its peacekeeping missions
   are present in all major conflicts. With such prominent global presence,
   it would seem that when the EU speaks, the world listens.
   This paper assesses whether new public communicative spaces are emerging
   between the European Union and the rest of the world, including
   Australia. It first argues that supranational developments in the EU
   have encouraged an important shift in which international political
   communication is no longer equated with the boundaries of the nation
   state. It goes on to illustrate how the emergent Euro- olity is
   developing an important strategy for communication not only with its own
   Member States and their citizens but also with the world. To test how
   the new communication environment is received outside the EU, encounters
   of the Australian media with the European Union are analysed. The
   results tend to confirm the European Union's existing fears of being
   largely unheard.},

Title = {Presidential and legislative elections: How the type of election impacts
   the degree of nationalization - The case of France (1965-2012)},
Journal = {FRENCH POLITICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {11},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {It has been demonstrated that in most countries electoral behaviour
   follows a pattern of nationalization, that is, national politics
   substitute local politics. Most research (both comparative and single
   case study) analyses the phenomenon of nationalization and its strength
   by focusing on a single type of election: the legislative/parliamentary
   election. When dealing with comparative research, this implies that the
   electoral offer and the context differ from one country area to another
   or within one country. The original contribution of this article is that
   it offers both a new methodological and substantive perspective. From a
   methodological point of view, we propose a quasi-experimental design.
   Nationalization will be measured for two types of elections
   (presidential and legislative), in the same country (France), at the
   same territorial level (departments), for a long span of time (the Fifth
   Republic), covering 9 presidential and 14 legislative elections. For
   this analysis, the nationalization of the electoral behaviours will be
   calculated by employing first the standard deviation, the Mean of
   Absolute Deviation and then the Bochsler index (2010). The Bochsler
   index allows us to measure nationalization at the country level, and is
   not sensitive to the size and the number of parties. Therefore, the
   Bochsler index is the best instrument when dealing with a comparative or
   a longitudinal design. From a substantive point of view, this article
   aims to demonstrate that the degree of nationalization depends on the
   type of election. In our case, which is a semi-presidential system, we
   expect to observe a higher degree of nationalization in presidential
   elections compared with legislative elections. In fact, with regard to
   legislative elections the local dimension of the vote (department level)
   should lead to a higher fragmentation of electoral behaviour.},

Abstract = {The discipline of history has failed to recognize that it has always
   been affected by contemporary politics in diverse ways, despite attempts
   to maintain its autonomy. The article argues that unless the
   relationship between history and contemporary politics is defined, both
   would be misused for partisan ends. On this backdrop, the article
   explores relations between the two in the Indian context and argues
   that, in India, history was always influenced by political imperatives
   and contestations. History was used to affirm or deny the claims of the
   existence of an Indian nation since times immemorial. The article
   further argues that the use of history for the political project of
   historically constituting an Indian nation was integral to the events
   surrounding independence and partition.},

Abstract = {This paper addresses the impact of the number and timing of panel waves
   in campaign panel surveys on findings concerning the prevalence of
   early, campaign, and late deciding as well as on the determinants of the
   time of voting decision. Using data from a seven-wave online campaign
   panel survey conducted during the 2009 German federal election, we
   demonstrate that the number and timing of panel waves affect results
   concerning the time of voting decision considerably. Whereas the number

Abstract = {The number of legislators elected in a single district influences many
   aspects of state legislative elections. However, there is a dearth of
   research on how district magnitude influences campaign fundraising. We
   theorize that the greater competition for funds in multimember districts
   results in candidates raising less money and encourages them to be more
   entrepreneurial in their fundraising efforts. Specifically, we expect
   multimember district candidates to raise contributions from more diverse
   sets of interests than candidates in single-member districts, raise more
   funds out of state, and create more unique financial constituencies.
   Using data on candidates for Maryland's House of Delegates in 2006 and
   2010, we find support for our hypotheses.},

Abstract = {Throughout the years of philosophical writing that set in Theodor
   Adorno's life, it is possible to observe a detailed reflection on the
   dilemmatic situation in which the idea of equality is placed in modern
   democracies. After Auschwitz, no longer it would be possible to
   understand-in the same terms as classic liberalism had thought it- the
   conflict between the egalitarian principle, which acts as foundation of
   the juridical- political order, and the principle of recognition of the
   difference. In this occasion we would attempt to follow the itinerary of
   these reflections on the problems of moral and political philosophy by
   way of its negative dialectics.},

Abstract = {This paper examines how interpersonal social networks relate to the
   voting behavior of men and women. We argue that underlying the gender
   gap in voting is related to social processes that depend on the partisan
   and sex composition of networks. Analysis of the 2000 American National
   Election Study identified two ways that sex differences are relevant to
   network explanations of voting behavior. First, men have more sex
   homophily in their networks than women. As men are more likely to be
   Republican than women, this leads to different discussion environments
   for men and women. Second, menand not womenare more likely to share the

Abstract = {The disintegration of the Soviet Union raised the question of how to
   reinterpret post-Soviet geography, including that of Central Eurasia.
   Russian Eurasianism, which equates Russia with Eurasia, became one
   popular approach in the post-Soviet space. This approach uses
   Eurasianism as theoretical justification of contemporary Russian
   anti-Westernism. An alternative view of the latest regional divisions of
   the post-Soviet space links the states of the Central Caucasus
   (Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia) and Central Asia (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan,
   Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan) to form a new region-Central
   Caucaso-Asia. Unlike contemporary Russian Eurasianism, the concept of
   Central Caucaso-Asia favors strengthening the state sovereignty of
   countries in this region.},

Abstract = {Why do some individuals engage in more religious activity than others?
   And how does this religious activity influence their economic attitudes?
   We present a formal model in which individuals derive utility from both
   secular and religious sources. Our model, which incorporates both
   demand-side and supply-side explanations of religion, is unusual in that
   it endogenizes both an individual's religious participation and her
   preferences over economic policy. Using data on over 70 countries from
   the pooled World Values Survey, we find that religious participation
   declines with societal development, an individual's ability to produce
   secular goods, and state regulations on religion, but that it increases
   with inequality. We also find that religious participation increases
   economic conservatism among the poor but decreases it among the rich.
   Our analysis has important insights for the debate about secularization
   theory and challenges conventional wisdom regarding the relationship
   between religious participation and economic conservatism.},

Abstract = {We show how preferred committee assignments act as an electoral subsidy
   for members of Congress-empowering representatives' legislative careers.
   When holding preferred assignments, legislators are free to focus on
   legislative activity in Washington, DC. But when the subsidy is removed,
   legislators are forced to direct attention to the district. To test our
   theory of legislative subsidy, we exploit committee exile-the
   involuntary removal of committee members after a party loses a sizable
   number of seats. Legislators are selected for exile using members' rank
   on the committee, causing exiled and remaining legislators to appear
   strikingly similar. Using exile, we show that it has only limited
   electoral consequences, but this is partly due to compensatory efforts.
   Exiled legislators shift attention away from Washington and towards the
   district: they raise and spend more money for reelection, author less
   legislation, are absent for more days of voting, and vote with their
   party less often.},

Abstract = {Contemporary organisations in any industry are increasingly dependent on
   information systems. Today most organisations are online all the time,
   and their internal systems are used in environments that are already or
   easily connected to the internet. The paper analyses cyber threats and
   their potential effect on the operations of different organisations with
   the use of scenario analysis. The scenarios are built based on a
   literature review. One outcome of the analysis is that to an
   organisation it is irrelevant where a cyber threat originates from and
   who it is targeted for. If the threat is specifically targeted to the
   organisation or if the threat is collateral in nature is not important;
   preparing for the threat is important in both cases. The paper discusses
   the pressures that the cyber threats pose to information security
   policies, and what the role of the information security policy could be
   in preparing for the threats.},

Abstract = {The conventional wisdom about political science international education
   assumes that students choose between short ``island{''} study abroad
   programs that are accessible but have only superficial impact, and
   longer immersion programs, achieving a greater effect. This article
   argues that well-designed study abroad programs can combine the best of
   both models to achieve significant impact even in a short program. It
   proposes a ``bridge model{''} for reconceptualizing study abroad not as
   a discrete event with more or less impact on student learning, but as a
   key intervention that furthers a student's overall development within an
   internationalized curriculum. The article examines the case of a
   peacebuilding study abroad program in Ecuador. It measures alumni
   perceptions of impact, objective outcomes, and alumni network
   development. The key finding is that solid program design and structured
   cross-cultural interaction produces the type of long-term effect and
   networks traditionally associated with immersion programs.},

Abstract = {The first traces of processing the homosexual experience can be found in
   Czech literature in the second half of the 19th century. At that time,
   authors sublimated their feelings, hid behind masks, and sent at best
   hidden signals. Otokar Brezina, the most important author of Czech
   symbolism, and the expressionist and surrealist Richard Weiner still
   chose this path. The first to take a different path was Jiff Karasek ze
   Lvovic, who no longer masked homosexuality, but stylized it by
   projecting it into Antiquity. For contemporary poet Jiff Kubena,
   Antiquity and the Middle Ages no longer provide the backdrop that made
   it possible to express the unspeakable. Like Vaclav Jamek, Kubena was
   already making his homosexuality a theme under the Communist regime.
   Therefore, their work could appear only after 1990, when a literature of
   (self-) liberation inferior in artistic terms was also flourishing.},

Abstract = {What can Hannah Arendt's writings offer to current thinking on the
   environment? Although there are some obvious connections between her
   work and current issues in environmental ethics, not very much has been
   written on the topic. This article argues that Arendt's philosophy is
   particularly fruitful for environmental thinking because she explicitly
   links the material and biological conditions of human existence with the
   political conditions of human freedom. This is articulated in the
   article as the requirement of both constrained consumption and
   unconstrained deliberation. The article elaborates these notions before
   concluding that Arendt's philosophy uniquely combines the existential
   task of self- understanding with the practical task of confronting our
   environmental challenges.},

Abstract = {Cross-sectional research designs show that proportional representation
   (PR) tends to produce more equitable outcomes in terms of gender
   representation. While existing research provides valuable insights into
   the covariates of gender representation, such cross-sectional designs
   fail to provide a definitive test of the influence of electoral rules
   both over time and in the case of mixed systems. Addressing this gap,
   this article proposes a longitudinal research design using the case of
   Germany, because half the Bundestag's seats are allotted through
   majoritarian first-past-the-post methods, while the other half are
   allotted through proportional methods. The main findings point towards
   heavy interaction between the two electoral tiers that becomes visible
   in party quotas, double nominations and increased competitiveness of
   female candidates.},

Abstract = {Year 2019 will be the fiftieth anniversary of the construction of the
   first and possibly still the most famous peace wall in Northern Ireland
   (NI). The wall was built in 1969 to separate the Catholic Falls Road and
   the Protestant Shankill Road. An Army Major, overseeing the construction
   of the wall at the time, said: `This is a temporary measure ... we do
   not want to see another Berlin wall situation in Western Europe ... it
   will be gone by Christmas'. In 2013, that wall still remains and almost
   100 additional walls and barriers now complement the original. This
   article presents new primary research that measures public attitudes
   towards such structures today. Some recent thinking in government policy
   circles suggests that the building of walls as a viable policy response
   to the conflict in NI is now over. If this is true, what should happen
   to the existing walls and to the concerns of those living closest to
   them? A draft government report, leaked in January 2013, suggests that
   these peace walls should be brought down by 2022. Understanding public
   attitudes towards such a potential move is critical for both
   policymakers and practitioners on the ground and our research findings
   offer important and comprehensive quantitative baseline indicators. The
   use of these indicators may go some way to help shape the formulation
   and implementation of peace walls policy in the future.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN UNION POLITICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Pages = {388-407},

Abstract = {How does ideological congruency affect the speed of legislative
   decision-making in the European Union? Despite the crucial importance of
   actor preferences, the effect of partisan alignments and ideological
   composition of the European institutions has largely been neglected.
   However, we argue that the ideological congruence between legislative
   bodies has an important effect on the duration of policy-making. We test
   our theoretical expectations based on a large new dataset on
   decision-making speed in the European Union using event history
   analysis. The findings confirm our theoretical claim indicating that the
   ideological distance between the European institutions slows down
   policy-making which has important implications for the problem-solving
   capacity of political systems more generally.},

Abstract = {The forward march of globalization has paused since the financial
   crisis, giving way to a more conditional, interventionist, and
   nationalist model of development. The geopolitical scene is strongly
   affected by factors related to this trend - such as protectionism,
   economic and resource nationalism, technological, the rise of new energy
   producers and consumers, changing pricing mechanism, declining levels of
   investment, and shifting trade flows toward Asia. With a particular
   focus on Turkey's neighborhood and the Southern Corridor, this paper
   discusses changing dynamics and emerging new risks in the new global
   energy game, with a view to developing messages for government and

Abstract = {Since the recent global crisis demonstrates the failure of the
   neoliberal model of development, we urgently need a change of paradigm.
   This essay aims to focus on the theme of commons, as a central element
   of a new model of development. The author analyses the theoretical
   foundations of the standard modern economics (based on de-socialization
   of individuals, naturalization of economics and depolitization of
   society), to which she opposes the conception of the individual as a
   relational being. The argument is based not on an anti-modernist point
   of view, but on the consideration of modernity itself as a field of
   tensions. In opposition to some of the dominant tendencies of the recent
   debate about commons, the fundamental thesis of this paper is that they
   can only be considered and valorized in a triangular scheme
   (public-common-private), recognizing the centrality both of
   institutional mediation and of the role of the public sphere and the
   State (or better: stateness). This is the only premise for a new model
   of development, based on green economy, commons, and social goods.},

Abstract = {This article presents an analysis of the multiple purposes of
   citizenship regimes in 36 states in Europe. Previous studies on this
   topic suffer from two methodological deficits that lead to an incomplete
   perspective on how states regulate citizenship status: they emphasise
   the importance of static national membership models and focus nearly
   exclusively on the access to citizenship for immigrants. To overcome
   these deficits, we develop a citizenship regime typology based on
   functional components of citizenship laws, focusing on acquisition as
   well as loss, inside as well as outside the territory of a state. We
   find that citizenship regimes in Europe configure along two dimensions
   that can be associated with territorial and ethnocultural inclusion,
   which result in four types: territorially and ethnoculturally selective
   regimes that are inclusive on only one of these dimensions, expansive
   regimes that are inclusive on both dimensions and insular regimes that
   restrict both inclusions.},

Abstract = {This paper is concerned with the development of national primary
   education regimes in Europe, North America, Latin America, Oceania, and
   Japan between 1870 and 1939. We examine why school systems varied
   between countries and over time, concentrating on three institutional
   dimensions: centralization, secularization, and subsidization. There
   were two paths to centralization: through liberal and social democratic
   governments in democracies, or through fascist and conservative parties
   in autocracies. We find that the secularization of public school systems
   can be explained by path-dependent state-church relationships (countries
   with established national churches were less likely to have secularized
   education systems) but also by partisan politics. Finally, we find that
   the provision of public funding to private providers of education,
   especially to private religious schools, can be seen as a solution to
   religious conflict, since such institutions were most common in
   countries where Catholicism was a significant but not entirely dominant
   religion.},

Abstract = {In conflict zones, the phrase, ``The democratic process is a vital part
   of the peace process{''}, is often heard. Yet many voting procedures are
   far from ``peace-ful{''}. Indeed, in many instances, divisive and
   adversarial voting procedures have not only failed to heal the dispute,
   they have in fact exacerbated the situation and, at worst, been the
   catalysts of violence.
   In the democratic process, voting may be used either (a) by the people
   (i) to make a decision in a referendum and (ii) to choose their
   representatives in local and general elections, and/or (b) by these
   representatives (i) when formulating policies and (ii) when electing a
   power-sharing administration and/or sub-committees. This article looks
   at all of these voting procedures: first in regard to the present
   situation; next with respect to those jurisdictions which have tried to
   use more inclusive methodologies; and thirdly, as part of a polity which
   at the very least could facilitate the resolution of conflicts and, at
   best, help to prevent any recurrence. In all three sections, it
   concludes by asking, and answering, the following question: Will
   consensus voting work?},

Abstract = {Drawing upon the tools of Foucaultian-inspired governmentality, this
   article traces the narratives of good citizenship' that are normalized
   through contemporary programs to promote asset accumulation through
   formal savings. It suggests that savings promotion programs embody a
   particular conception of good citizenship defined by a neoliberal ethos
   of individual risk management and asset accumulation. It traces this
   through the Proyecto Capital program to promote personal savings
   accounts, which is being implemented in conjunction with Peru's
   conditional cash transfer program Juntos. It pays attention to the
   capacities, habits, and attitudes which these programs seek to foster,
   and locates these within a longer, discontinuous history of citizen
   improvement and reform. In doing so, it aims to disrupt the promotion of
   formal savings as a common-sense solution to poverty.},

Abstract = {Research on violent mobilization broadly emphasizes who joins rebellions
   and why, but neglects to explain the timing or nature of participation.
   Support and logistical apparatuses play critical roles in sustaining
   armed conflict, but scholars have not explained role differentiation
   within militant organizations or accounted for the structures,
   processes, and practices that produce discrete categories of fighters,
   soldiers, and staff. Extant theories consequently conflate mobilization
   and participation in rebel organizations with frontline combat. This
   article argues that, to understand wartime mobilization and
   organizational resilience, scholars must situate militants in their
   organizational and social context. By tracing the emergence and
   evolution of female-dominated clandestine supply, financial, and
   information networks in 1980s Lebanon, it demonstrates that mobilization
   pathways and organizational subdivisions emerge from the systematic
   overlap between formal militant hierarchies and quotidian social
   networks. In doing so, this article elucidates the nuanced relationship
   between social structure, militant organizations, and sustained
   rebellion.},

Abstract = {Previous research emphasizes the importance of path dependence for
   sustainable energy transitions, but their strategic nature is frequently
   overlooked. We examine formally how exogenous shocks, such as changes in
   international energy prices, interact with positive reinforcement
   factors, such as the growing strength of the renewables advocacy
   coalition. We find that political competition modifies the effect of
   path dependence on policy and outcomes. Specifically, while green
   governments can use positive reinforcement mechanisms to lock in policy
   commitments (by creating green constituencies), brown governments
   strategically underprovide public support for renewable energy (to avoid
   creating green constituencies). The effect of positive reinforcement
   also decreases with international energy prices. Our empirical analysis
   shows that (1) political competition conditions the policy response to
   exogenous shocks and market failures, while (2) governments
   strategically exploit path dependence for political gain.},

Abstract = {When do elections in authoritarian regimes lead to democracy? Building
   from the distinction between competitive and hegemonic authoritarian
   regimes, I argue that presence of relatively weaker incumbents renders
   competitive authoritarian elections more prone to democratization, but
   only when domestic and international actors choose to actively pressure
   the regime. The effects of two forms of pressureopposition electoral
   coalitions and international conditionalityare theorized. Propositions
   are tested using a comprehensive dataset of elections in authoritarian
   regimes from 1990 to 2007. Results support two core claims: that the
   effect of electoral pressure is conditional on the type of
   authoritarianism and that this greater vulnerability to pressure is the
   reason why competitive authoritarian elections are more likely to lead
   to democracy. In contrast, several alternative explanationsthat
   differences across regime type are explained by alternation in power,
   better electoral conduct, or ongoing processes of liberalizationare not
   supported by the evidence.},

Abstract = {Studies of the link between state capacity and development often utilize
   national-level governance indicators to explain fine-grained development
   outcomes. As capacity in some bureaucratic agencies matters more for
   these outcomes than capacity in others, this work proxies for capacity
   within the set of relevant agencies by using a measure of `mean'
   capacity across all agencies in a polity. This practice is problematic
   for two reasons: (1) within-country, cross-agency diversity in capacity
   often overwhelms the variation encountered across public sectors
   considered in their entireties; (2) national-level reputations for
   capacity are not particularly informative about differences in capacity
   in functionally equivalent agencies in different countries. The article
   draws on the author's survey of public employees in Bolivia, Brazil and

Abstract = {This article analyses the links between populist radical right parties
   and their voters regarding European integration in 11 European
   countries. It does so by using data from the 2008 European Social Survey
   and the 2006 UNC-Chapel Hill Expert Data Base on political parties and
   European integration. In addition to mapping the Eurosceptic
   orientations of political parties and their voters, the article examines
   the degree to which attitudes towards the EU and voting for populist
   radical parties are connected to each other. The results lend support to
   the hypothesis that most populist radical right parties have managed to
   establish links with their voters regarding European integration. The
   analysis also shows that links between populist radical right parties
   and their voters tend to be stronger for those parties that adopt more
   extreme negative positions towards European integration.},

Abstract = {The huge inflow of asylum seekers to European countries in the early
   1990s drove those countries to initiate policies that restricted asylum
   seekers' rights and benefits. Were these policies spontaneous responses
   to the mounting inflow or instead political outcomes determined by
   political factors such as partisanship and election timing? Analyzing
   data on the introduction of policies that restricted asylum seekers'
   welfare benefits and rights in 13 European countries from 1981 to 2000,
   this article finds that upcoming elections increase the likelihood of
   policy introduction. This election effect is greater in the presence of
   right-wing parties. These results imply that policies regarding asylum
   seekers' welfare benefits have been utilized by right-wing parties for
   electoral purposes. Therefore, these policies should be understood as
   the outcome of political choices.},

Abstract = {Rapid economic development and a rising middle class have given hope to
   China's political development. The democratisation history around the
   world provides clues to the possible directions China's new middle class
   might be heading in politics. The conservative Chinese middle class is
   predicted to make China's democratisation more stable than volatile,
   more gradual than radical. China may experience a long but steady path
   towards democratisation just like other major democratised countries.},

Abstract = {We link the intensity of campaign competition in different electoral
   systems with the number of candidates running for public office and
   their ideological differentiation. We show that proportional elections
   have more candidates, competing less aggressively in campaign spending,
   than those in majoritarian elections. Candidates' ideological positions,
   however, can in general be more differentiated in majoritarian or
   proportional elections. We also study the equilibrium effects of
   plurality premiums and the consequences of heterogeneity among
   candidates in nonideological characteristics.},

   process that encouraged a significant increase of foreign born
   population flows into the European societies. Drawing on the literature

   in Spain, and compares it with the diversity of European policies in
   this area. Subsequently, the study focuses on the results of the family
   reunification policy making, by exploring the intensity of family
   migration flows towards Southern European countries in comparison with
   those to Central and Northern Europe countries with a longer experience
   in receiving substantial migration in-flows.},

Title = {Relationships and definitions on belonging within government-actively

   arguments},
Journal = {TEMAS Y DEBATES},
Year = {2013},
Number = {26},
Pages = {39-75},

Abstract = {Based on a a conceptual frame that diagnoses a scenario of fluctuating
   political identities and transformed political parties, this paper
   presents some arguments about the ways organizations, networks and
   groups defined their belonging to a government supporting ensemble
   {[}oficialismo] in Lula's Brazil (2002-2006) and Nestor Kirchner's
   Argentina (2003-2007), the internal dynamics, the sort of relationships
   they established with other actors within the oficialismo, and how they
   bonded with the government. I argue that analyzing these two active and
   organized government supporting ensembles by using the terms party in
   office or partisan coalition would be to forcefully reduce the
   heterogeneous variety of organizations and groups that composed the
   organized political orbit of both leaders. Therefore, the paper proposes
   an approach through the concept of oficialismo. I have opted not to
   study these ensembles from a institutionalist perspective of how
   government coalitions function. Not only because such an approach would
   prove to be inadequate to understand the Brazilian and Argentinian
   political representation contexts in those years. But also because the
   thesis is guided by another purpose - it wishes to comprehend in depth,
   through empirical work and based on the testimony of their own actors,
   the prime features of two government supporting ensembles. Three
   government supporting sectors are defined in both cases: social
   organizations, national labor federations and what I have called the
   ``partisan space{''}.},

Title = {Implementing EU external migration policy: Security-driven by default?},
Journal = {COMPARATIVE EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {11},
Number = {4},
Pages = {406-427},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Most assessments of European Union (EU) external migration policy attest
   that it is dominated by migration control measures but overstate its
   potential to be implemented because they do not adequately account for
   the limited EU influence in non-member states (NMS). Although prevalent
   explanations for the security bias in EU external migration policy
   (EU-EMP) focus on the level of political discourse and decision making,
   there is another explanation for the dominance of security measures that
   stems from implementation dynamics in NMS. Drawing on insights from the
   public policy and implementation literature, the article argues - based
   on Matland's framework - that different combinations of ambiguity and
   conflict around components of migration policy shape distinct
   implementation dynamics of EU external policy. Implementation of the
   most comprehensive package of EU-EMP to date - the `Global Approach to
   Migration' - is assessed in two priority countries: Morocco and Ukraine.
   The findings reveal that implementation of migration control measures
   benefits from low levels of ambiguity because it is easier to identify
   cooperation partners and translate clear policy approaches into viable
   interorganisational cooperation than in labour migration and migration
   and development measures under a preventive approach.},

Abstract = {Turkey demonstrated remarkable economic performance over the last
   decade. In order to meet the goals set for 2023, however, the Turkish
   economy must shift to a new paradigm in which human capital is the main
   driver of technological advancement and economic development. As figures
   show, the quality of a country's education system plays a major role in
   that country's economic performance, including GDP. As Turkey still
   remains far behind OECD levels in education, Turkish policy makers need
   to transform their approaches to education. Prioritization of K-12 and
   early childhood education (ECE), along with a broad consensus on a human
   rights-oriented education system, are vital if goals set for 2023 are to
   be reached.},

Abstract = {Childcare policy has become an integral part of social and economic
   policy in post-industrial democracies. This article explores how the
   transformation of party systems structures the politics of childcare
   policy. It reveals that political parties contend with each other over
   childcare and female employment policy on the social-value dimension as
   well as the redistributive dimension. Assuming that different party
   policies have distinct impacts on public childcare policy, it is
   hypothesised in this article that a government's policy position
   composed of the governing parties' policy positions affects changes in
   public spending for childcare services. Through an analysis of the
   pooled time-series and cross-section data of 18 advanced industrialised
   countries from 1980 until 2005 using multivariate regression methods, it
   is revealed that a government's redistributive leftright policy position
   interacts with its social liberalconservative policy position, and that
   a leftliberal government raises its budget for childcare services while
   a leftconservative government does not.},

Abstract = {Unionlearn and union learning representatives were developed by the
   British TUC to match workers with education and training opportunities,
   strengthen the economy, foster market inclusion and facilitate social
   mobility. Their contribution to union revitalisation was emphasised.
   This article questions whether, with unions confronting global crisis,
   this is a necessary initiative. It stemmed from TUC failure to achieve
   policy goals, institutional needs, consequent acceptance of a lesser
   role, and the availability of state finance. Claims by academics that it
   provides influence over state policy and contributes to revitalisation
   remain inadequately evidenced. Union resurgence is not immanent. The way
   forward is through adversarial grassroots organising and socialist
   education, not through retooling capital, improving members'
   marketability and partnership with a hostile state.},

Title = {Euro-scepticism and radical right-wing voting in Europe, 2002-2008:
   Social cleavages, socio-political attitudes and contextual
   characteristics determining voting for the radical right},
Journal = {EUROPEAN UNION POLITICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {14},
Number = {2},
Pages = {183-205},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In this contribution, we focus on the role of euro-scepticism on radical
   right-wing voting in national elections in 18 European countries between
   2002 and 2008. We do so with multilevel modelling taking advantage of
   high-quality cross-national European data. First, we focus on social
   cleavages related to voting, e.g. social class and religiosity. Second,
   we examine the effects of several contextual characteristics, of which
   some are classical and others new. Third, we take diverse
   socio-political attitudes into account. We test whether euro-scepticism
   affects voting for the radical right, over and beyond other determinants
   that have previously been proposed to determine radical right-wing
   voting. We find evidence that euro-scepticism indeed contributes to the
   explanation of voting for the radical right beyond perceived ethnic
   threat and political distrust. At the same time euro-scepticism is much
   less relevant than perceived ethnic threat in explaining why particular
   social categories, i.e. lower educated people, manual workers,
   unemployed people and non-churchgoers are more likely to vote for the
   radical right.},

Abstract = {Parliaments are basically adversarial settings that instantiate the
   polarization of political power. In debating the pros and cons of
   available alternatives, parliamentarians are supposed to observe
   convention-based institutional norms and regulations. However, in
   critical moments these rules are strategically violated to achieve
   political goals. Gender-related asymmetries in parliamentary power
   balance tend to emerge in disorderly parliamentary behaviour and/or
   disruptive discourse practices. This article focuses on the way in which
   the rules, procedures and practices of parliamentary interaction are
   being transgressed in mixed-gender encounters. The results indicate that
   a range of five context-specific master suppression techniques1 are used
   by both female and male MPs to enact and reinforce their own power
   position and, at the same time, to challenge and undermine the
   opponent's authority and credibility. A micro-level analysis of
   gender-related disruptive discourse practices in the UK Parliament and
   the Swedish Riksdag shows how different parliaments, with different
   rhetorical styles and traditions, often exhibit different forms and
   manifestations of rule violation, on the one hand, and different
   reactions to disorderly discursive behaviour, on the other.},

Abstract = {This introductory article outlines the conceptual approach of this
   special issue on legislative protest and suggests that this form of
   protest alerts us to the negotiated institutional politics of
   parliaments. Together with many contributors to this issue, this article
   briefly puts forward a performative approach to studying legislative
   protest that brings into focus the spaces in which performances take
   place, the speech and rhetoric through which is performed as well as the
   bodies that convey the somatic norms of institutions as well as to alert
   us to issues of representation and representativeness of legislative
   institutions. Legislative protest then is viewed not simply as
   disruptive and inefficient, bringing into disrepute the reputations of
   legislative bodies; rather the performance of protest is regarded as yet
   another register through which we can productively map the changing
   cultural and historical development of representative politics.},

Abstract = {This article explores the phenomenon of legislative protest and presents
   an analytical framework for understanding its significance for
   democratic theory and practice. Legislative protest is defined as
   disruptive behaviour of elected representatives within legislative
   settings. Acts of legislative protest include sit-ins, boycotts,
   walkouts, and individual or collective disobedience of the presiding
   officer within legislative chambers or committees. This article begins
   from the premise that legislative protest should not be dismissed as
   frivolous or self-interested behaviour. Such acts are significant
   because they are disruptive, literally of the routine proceedings of
   legislatures, and figuratively because they transgress boundaries of
   orderliness according to formal rules and norms of behaviour in
   legislative settings. Variations in the significance and justifiability
   of such acts of legislative protest are interpreted according to three
   key debates in democratic theory, namely legislative conflict,
   deliberation, and representation. Beyond these three broad debates, it
   is argued that any attempt to decipher the substantive meaning of
   legislative protest must be informed by a grounded analysis paying
   attention to specific forms of protest performed within specific
   legislative settings. Such analysis should acknowledge the corporeality
   of protest and its embeddedness within historically contextualized
   institutional and cultural scripts.},

Abstract = {This article aims to show an overview of the energy cooperation scheme
   called PETROCARIBE, proposed in 2005 by the Bolivarian Republic of
   Venezuela to the Caribbean and Central American countries. It argues
   that the emergence of this project, like other South-South cooperation
   initiatives, is clearly linked to several strategic foreign policy
   goals, which basically refer to geopolitical, economic, security and,
   last but not least, international solidarity parameters. The first
   section outlines some general characteristics of South-South cooperation
   and current trends and debates. The following presents the peculiar
   features of the Bolivarian foreign and energy policies. The next
   presents a general description of the PETROCARIBE framework, working
   mechanisms and its most important projects. Finally, after a discussion
   on PETROCARIBE as a South-South cooperation initiative, by highlighting
   its scopes, problems and vulnerabilities, some conclusions are drawn.},

Abstract = {This paper contributes to the literature concerning burden sharing in
   specific crisis response operations. We provide a quantitative
   expression of burden-sharing behaviour of the NATO and Non-NATO allies
   during the International Security Assistance Forces operations in
   Afghanistan from 2001 to 2010. We conclude that the military
   contribution of the United States, as expressed by the average number
   deployed, surpasses the total contributions of the NATO EU and Non-NATO
   countries. However, the relative contribution of the United Kingdom, as
   expressed in terms of relative population size and Gross Domestic
   Product exceeds the contribution of the United States. We also conclude
   that the relative numbers of casualties of the United Kingdom, Denmark,
   and Canada exceed the burden of the United States.},

Abstract = {International human rights treaties are argued to increase both the
   likelihood of domestic mobilized dissent and judicial constraint. These
   pressures pull leaders in conflicting directions: mobilized challenges
   undermine a leader's position in power, increasing incentives to
   repress; courts raise the probability of litigation, decreasing
   incentives to repress. We argue authorities balance these pressures
   based on their job security. Politically insecure leaders, desperate to
   retain power, repress to control the destabilizing effects of dissent.
   Secure leaders are less likely to fall to citizen pressures, but the
   probability of facing an effective judiciary weighs heavily in their
   expected costs. Consequently, they repress less to avoid litigation. We
   find empirical support for the implications of our formal theory using
   data on commitment to the UN Convention Against Torture. Treaties have
   no effect on repression in states with insecure leaders but have a
   positive effect on rights protection in states headed by secure leaders.},

Abstract = {Recent scholarship in comparative political behavior has begun to
   address how voters in coalitional systems manage the complexity of those
   environments. We contribute to this emerging literature by asking how
   voters update their perceptions of the policy positions of political
   parties that participate in coalition cabinets. In contrast to previous
   work on the sources of voter perceptions of party ideology in
   parliamentary systems, which has asked how voters respond to changes in
   party manifestos (i.e., promises), we argue that in updating their
   perceptions, voters will give more weight to observable actions than to
   promises. Further, coalition participation is an easily observed party
   action that voters use as a heuristic to infer the direction of policy
   change in the absence of detailed information about parties' legislative
   records. Specifically, we propose that all voters should perceive
   parties in coalition cabinets as more ideologically similar, but that
   this tendency will be muted for more politically interested voters (who
   have greater access to countervailing messages from parties). Using an
   individual-level data set constructed from 54 electoral surveys in 18
   European countries, we find robust support for these propositions.},

Abstract = {Russian society has a dual structure. On the one hand, the state has
   created formal professional castes, to which it allocates resources
   based on the principle of welfare-state distributive justice. On the
   other hand, there exist informal ``corporations{''}. Politics in Russia
   revolves around the conflict between these two principles of order. On
   one side are those who want to allocate resources according to the
   principles of a deeply socialist caste society; on the other side are
   the members of different regions, sectors, concerns, clans, or ethnic
   groups who want to see resources allocated according to the unwritten
   ``rules{''} of a fluctuating hierarchy of these ``corporations{''}.},

Abstract = {Different schools inside Argentinean Marxism agree to mark as one of the
   fundamental causes of Argentina bad economic development to the fact
   that its international market insertion was at the era of the rule of
   Monopoly Capital. Therefore, they attribute the historical limitations

   of extra economic relations. In this paper, we criticize the main

Abstract = {An implicit element of many theories of constitutional enforcement is
   the degree to which those subject to constitutional law can agree on
   what its provisions mean (call this constitutional interpretability).
   Unfortunately, there is little evidence on baseline levels of
   constitutional interpretability or the variance therein. This article
   seeks to fill this gap in the literature, by assessing the effect of
   contextual, textual and interpreter characteristics on the
   interpretability of constitutional documents. Constitutions are found to
   vary in their degree of interpretability. Surprisingly, however, the
   most important determinants of variance are not contextual (for example,
   era, language or culture), but textual. This result emphasizes the
   important role that constitutional drafters play in the implementation
   of their product.},

Abstract = {Maren Milligan, Fighting for the Right to Exist: Institutions, Identity,
   and Conflict in Jos, Nigeria Power sharing, or the predetermined
   allocation of state resources to putative groups, is an increasingly
   popular conflict resolution mechanism throughout the globe. However,
   critics argue it rests on ill-founded assumptions of group fixity,
   deepening divides it seeks to overcome. Proponents respond that liberal
   consociationalism reduces conflict by allowing for self-determined
   groups. In order to evaluate these claims, a model of power sharing
   explains the incidence of conflict in Jos, Nigeria. The findings refute
   the claims of liberal consociationalism regarding the
   conflict-mitigating potential of self-determination of groups. National
   conflagration of localized conflict resulting from power sharing
   suggests that ethno-federal power sharing does not quarantine conflict.},

Abstract = {Little is known about the American public's policy preferences at the
   level of Congressional districts, state legislative districts, and local
   municipalities. In this article, we overcome the limited sample sizes
   that have hindered previous research by jointly scaling the policy
   preferences of 275,000 Americans based on their responses to policy
   questions. We combine this large dataset of Americans' policy
   preferences with recent advances in opinion estimation to estimate the
   preferences of every state, congressional district, state legislative
   district, and large city. We show that our estimates outperform previous
   measures of citizens' policy preferences. These new estimates enable
   scholars to examine representation at a variety of geographic levels. We
   demonstrate the utility of these estimates through applications of our
   measures to examine representation in state legislatures and city
   governments.},

Title = {The Europeanisation of national institutions reassessed: A comparison of
   regional policies in Germany and Italy},
Journal = {COMPARATIVE EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Pages = {201-221},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This article explores an aspect of Europeanisation which notions of
   `adaptive pressure' and `usage' of European policies have tended to
   neglect: in a complex policy field such as regional policy it is the
   evolving nature and heterogeneity of (different) domestic institutional
   arrangements which will shape and determine the opportunities for
   domestic actors to exploit European policies. The article explains the
   differential impact of European regional policies in eastern Germany and
   southern Italy by focusing on the different domestic institutional
   settings and the competition between domestic actors for the position of
   gatekeeper in relation to the Commission. Despite similar exposure to
   European regional policies, the existence of `parallel institutions' in
   German regional policy proved to be the basis for an empowerment of the
   regions through the reinforcement of one institutional arrangement at
   the expense of the other while limiting change within the institutions.
   By contrast, the dichotomous nature of formal and informal rules and
   institutions in Italian policies for the south resulted in the
   exploitation of European regional policy by a national actor in order to
   drive through change in governance and administration. Comparative

   limits to liberalism},
Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {20},
Number = {2},
Pages = {215-239},

Abstract = {This article argues that, since the end of the Cold War, the
   understanding of democratic norm promotion has shifted through three
   conceptually distinct and chronologically distinguishable stages: the
   early 1990s view that democratic norms would be universalized with the
   Cold War victory of liberal ideals and the spread of new global norms of
   good governance; the mid- to late-1990s view that barriers to the
   promotion of democratic norms could be understood as the product of
   state or elite self-interests; and the perspective dominant since the
   2000s, that the promotion of democratic norms necessarily involves much
   deeper and more extensive external intervention in order to transform
   social institutions and societal practices. Through charting the shifts
   in the understanding of democratic norm promotion, this article seeks to
   highlight the problems inherent in norm promotion discourses that
   emphasize the importance of subjective agency, normative choices, and
   cultural and ideational frameworks of understanding. A key problem being
   that, in the downplaying of social and economic context, agency-based
   understandings tend to degrade the rational capacities of and to
   exoticize and problematize the non-Western subject. The social
   constructivist approach, which presupposes a closed or endogenous
   framework of societal reproduction, has thereby been a crucial paradigm
   through which Western democracy promotion discourses have shifted to
   emphasizing the subjective policy barrier posed by the allegedly
   non-liberal' mindset of the non-Western subject.},

Abstract = {This article examines the perennial mutual frustration between
   presidents and their military advisors over decisions to use force. What
   often appears to be a personality-driven or political debate between the
   commander in chief and his strong-minded military advisors actually has
   deeper institutional and cultural roots. The ``professional{''} military
   officer has certain expectations about how to craft ``best military
   advice{''} for the president that are deeply embedded into the
   organizational culture and in fact hard-wired into the institutionalized
   and incredibly detailed military planning processes. This planning
   process is designed with expectations about the roles civilian
   leadership will play in providing guidance, which are in many ways out
   of synch with the expectations of the president and his civilian
   advisors. Ultimately, the output of the military's planning process
   fails to deliver the type of nuanced advice in the form of creative
   options that the president needs.},

Abstract = {In recent years the debate on territorial organization of political
   power in Spain has become particularly intense. The failure of the
   political process of reform of the Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia and
   the current debate over the right to decide, or the problems associated
   with the Basque context, raise many questions about the future. This
   paper attempts to relate some concepts of contemporary political theory
   with that scenario, focusing on issues such as constitutional
   recognition of the right of secession or proposals for multinational
   federalism. To do this, we review different theoretical approaches to
   the phenomenon of multinationality and present some considerations on
   the possible reform and/ or reinterpretation of Spanish law.},

Abstract = {Extant research has given little consideration to the conditions under
   which presidential partisan behavior might vary. This has undermined
   comparative analyses and obscured important partisan behaviors in
   earlier periods simply because they took unfamiliar forms. This article
   develops theoretical expectations to aid in the detection of different
   varieties of presidential partisanship. Illustrative case studies then
   examine one type sub-rosa partisanship observed in the Eisenhower,
   Nixon, and Ford presidencies. Though not overt partisan displays like
   those that are common today, their efforts to build southern party
   organizations made important contributions to American political
   development and to evolving modes of presidential partisanship.},

Abstract = {Scholars warn that avoidance of attitude-discrepant political
   information is becoming increasingly common due in part to an
   ideologically fragmented online news environment that allows individuals
   to systematically eschew contact with ideas that differ from their own.
   Data collected over a series of national RDD surveys conducted between
   2004 and 2008 challenge this assertion, demonstrating that Americans'
   use of attitude-consistent political sources is positively correlated
   with use of more attitudinally challenging sources. This pattern holds
   over time and across different types of online outlets, and applies even
   among those most strongly committed to their political ideology,
   although the relationship is weaker for this group. Implications for
   these findings are discussed.},

Abstract = {Although several legislative gridlock models have produced different
   results in terms of legislative gridlock under divided government, these
   studies have neglected contingent party pressures. This paper suggests
   an alternative contingent party pressure model. The main result of this
   model is that legislative gridlock is affected by the interactions of
   issue salience and government types. High issue salience increases
   legislative gridlock under unified government and, in contrast,
   decreases under divided government.},

Abstract = {In this article, the author argues that the Progressives can be as much
   characterized as the antistatists of the nineteenth century as the
   statists of the twentieth century because their overriding goal was the
   destruction of the party state and not, directly, the creation of the
   bureaucratic state. They found in Anti-Federalist political thought a
   general antistatist template that they used to articulate their specific
   objection to the nineteenth-century party state. This template comprised
   a mutual commitment to simple government, the common good as a
   preinstitutional reality, democracy, direct and responsive government,
   fear of elite rule, civic education, and cultural homogeneity.},

Abstract = {Social services in the United States are supplied by both the public and
   private sectors. Previous political science research has focused on
   public transfers or Medicaid; I study ``Other Public Welfare{''}
   programs that include contracts and grants to private social services
   providers, focusing on the relationship between the two sectors. My
   results imply that an increase in either Other Public Welfare spending
   or private individual and family services employees leads to an increase
   in the other sector. I find weaker evidence of similar relationships
   involving private residential care or day care services, and private
   social services employment is generally independent of public spending
   on transfers and Medicaid. My results have implications for the full
   effects of changes in public welfare spending, including the effects on
   the private sector, as well as the effects of organized interests on
   public welfare spending.},

Abstract = {Issues of human rights have always been crucial in the continent of
   Europe. The institutionalization of fundamental rights for European
   citizens remained a matter of much discussion among legal scholars for
   decades. With the amendment of the Lisbon Treaty, major changes were
   forwarded within the Union regarding that matter; one of those is the
   accession of the Union to ECHR. The purpose of this paper is to discuss
   major institutional aspects of this accession and propose solutions,
   after addressing certain difficulties on one hand and on the other, to
   draw the new picture of judicial protection of fundamental rights in
   Europe.},

Abstract = {Since the boat clash incident in September 2010, tensions have persisted
   between Japan and China over the sovereignty of the Senkaku/Diaoyu
   Islands. Although territorial issues can easily become national symbols
   and used against other countries, nationalism hampers diplomatic
   concessions essential for diverse international resolutions. Greater the
   attention the public pays to such issues, lesser the room governments
   have for maneuvering. The Japanese and Chinese administrations will find
   it difficult to extricate themselves from the current deadlock if each
   party merely continues to assert its sovereignty over the islands. This
   study examines the possibility of expanding both countries' common
   interests in the East China Sea by focusing on the fisheries issues that
   triggered the 2010 incident. Japan and China have not fulfilled their
   obligation - as stipulated in the United Nations Convention on the Law
   of the Sea - to conserve biological resources in their Exclusive
   Economic Zones (EEZs). The New Japan-China Fisheries Agreement (2000)
   established vast special water zones in the middle of the East China Sea
   instead of demarking the EEZs between the two countries. However, the
   Joint Fisheries Committee established in accordance with the agreement
   has not worked to prevent overexploitation and to maintain sustainable
   development of fishery stocks in the zones. Thus, this paper proposes
   that Japan and China launch an initiative for effective control of
   fishing resources in the East China Sea, most preferably in
   collaboration with related neighboring parties.},

Abstract = {Careful users of CMP party position data should take the uncertainty of
   position estimates into account. We compare and evaluate two current
   approaches that provide error estimates for party positions. Researchers
   of the CMP group identify measurement error in quantitative content
   analysis as the cause of uncertainty about position estimates, whereas a
   second approach by Benoit et al. (2009) attributes the uncertainty of
   position estimates to a stochastic generation of election programs. We
   illustrate the commonalities and differences of these approaches and
   provide two empirical applications, the identification of the left-right
   order of parties and of policy shifts by parties, using CMP data for 25
   countries. Despite conceptual differences, results in these applications
   are surprisingly similar. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The extent to which the electorate uses issue information to update
   their candidate evaluations over the course of political campaigns has
   often raised questions about citizen competence. Using a ten-week panel
   experiment designed to capture the low-information context of most
   congressional races this study contributes to our understanding of when
   and by what processes issue information produces enduring effects.
   Findings reveal that when voters need to assess an ideologically
   moderate candidate, they rely less on partisan cues but instead of
   storing issue information in long-term memory - either via a
   memory-based or on-line process - considerations in short-term memory
   remained one of the most powerful predictors of candidate evaluation,
   particularly when new issue information deviated from partisan norms.

Abstract = {This research paper examines the relationship between the type of
   transition and electoral system choice. The analysis is based upon a
   country sample of 51 third-wave democracies. The theoretical arguments
   lead to the hypothesis that countries whose transitions to democracy are
   driven both by the ruling elites and civic forces apply more permissive
   electoral systems afterwards. Whenever there is one dominant actor
   during the transition process, a less permissive electoral system
   becomes more likely. It is also assumed that countries that have a
   democratic past tend to rely on the institutional design of that period.
   The results of a multiple regression analysis confirm the hypotheses and
   point out that political actors behave strategically and according to
   their utility function, especially in transition processes, which are
   characterized by great uncertainty. Ideology does not matter and
   information from the past is used to predict future developments.},

Title = {Nationalisation of multilevel party systems: A conceptual and empirical
   analysis},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {52},
Number = {2},
Pages = {212-236},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The concept of nationalisation' is vigorously discussed in the
   literature and three dimensions have been proposed. A first dimension
   considers the extent to which a party's vote in territorial units varies
   across time and this is labeled dynamic nationalisation'. Distributional
   nationalisation' focuses on the degree to which there is an equal
   distribution of party votes across territorial units. Finally,
   party-linkage nationalisation' concerns the extent to which candidates
   link together under common party labels. In addition to a conceptual
   debate there has been a simultaneous debate on the measurement of the
   various forms of nationalisation. This article contributes to both
   debates and argues that most of the literature on nationalisation
   suffers from a methodological nationalism bias that is, the tendency of
   many scholars to choose the statewide level and national election as the
   natural unit of analysis. This claim is supported by a conceptual and
   empirical analysis regarding the effects of decentralisation on
   nationalisation. The conceptual analysis shows that the non-robust
   findings of many studies concerning the effects of decentralisation on
   nationalisation can be related to the methodological nationalism bias.
   An effect of decentralisation is found once nationalisation is
   conceptualised with regard to its multilevel dimension and the
   measurements of nationalisation are differentiated according to parties,
   regions and type of elections (national or regional). An empirical
   analysis on the nationalisation of party systems, parties and regions in
   18 countries for national and regional elections held between 1945 and
   2009 shows that regional authority has a significant and robust effect
   on regions and regional elections but not on parties, party systems and
   national vote shares.},

Abstract = {In the US context, research on ambivalence has established that
   individuals often simultaneously possess positive and negative
   considerations on a political object. Yet little is known about
   ambivalence in support for European integration. This article proposes a
   measure that distinguishes ambivalence from indifference in attitudes
   towards the European Union (EU). Using data from Eurobarometer wave 63.4
   and the Chapel Hill expert survey I find that the causal logics of
   ambivalence and indifference are sharply different. Multinomial
   regression analysis reveals that levels of ambivalence towards the EU
   increase with political sophistication. Also, citizens are more
   ambivalent, less indifferent, and less positive about the EU when elite
   division on European integration is more pronounced. Finally, trust in
   EU institutions and attachment to Europe decrease indifference and
   ambivalence about the EU.},

Abstract = {In political theory, the subject of tax morale is closely linked to
   issues of citizenship and civic duties. Research on tax morale, however,
   is still rather underdeveloped in political science. In this article, we
   systematically compare a rational considerations approach with an
   approach focusing on the influence of community orientations on an
   individual's tax morale. We expect that contexts varying with the
   existence and duration of communist rule have caused systematic
   differences in terms of the motivation for tax morale. Multilevel
   analyses based on data taken from the fourth wave of the World
   Values/European Values Survey (1999/2000) confirm our expectations that
   socialization under communist rule strengthens the relevance of
   community orientations in explaining an individual's tax morale and
   reduces the impact of rational considerations.},

Abstract = {What explains the propensities of countries to experience coups d'etat?
   This article tests various, at times competing, theories of coups using
   event history analysis by modeling coups as repeatable events. We
   highlight the different roles that political regimes play in inducing or
   deterring coups, and argue that political regimes that are not clearly
   democratic or autocratic are the most vulnerable to coups. Features of
   hybrid regimes increase their underlying coup vulnerability and the
   impact of coup-triggering events. While existing literature has noted
   higher coup frequency in nondemocratic regimes than in democratic
   regimes, we note the impact of differences within the nondemocratic
   regimes, with particular emphasis on the timing of a coup event.
   Contributing to growing research on variations in nondemocratic regimes
   and their consequences, our analysis of global coup data in 152
   countries indicates that very autocratic regimes are much less
   vulnerable to coups than hybrid regimes.},

Abstract = {Financial transfers from richer members to the poorer ones are a
   necessary tool for creating commitment to a regional integration
   project, especially from countries that have less potential to benefit
   economically from the process, as the case of EU shows. Since 2004,
   MERCOSUR has a mechanism for reducing asymmetries, the FOCEM, which is
   also a form of development aid and South-South cooperation. Brazil, the
   largest economy of MERCOSUR, accounts for 70\% of the resources, while
   Paraguay, the least developed country, is entitled to 48\% of annual
   payments. The aim of the paper is to evaluate how the fund has worked.
   The data collected show that FOCEM has become representative in relation
   to the GDP of Paraguay, its main beneficiary, and to the amount of
   development aid granted by Brazil, its main contributor. At the same
   time, the fund faces serious institutional challenges, as the MERCOSUR
   itself.},

Abstract = {Currently, participation of the mass media in Venezuelan sociopolitical
   events is undisputed; their information networks extend, creating an
   impact on political events taking place in the country. This paper
   analyzes the trajectory of media behavior in contemporary history,
   taking as support the proposals of Gil, Ortiz and Revuelta (2002) and
   Garcia (2003). The methodology was documentary with a bibliographic
   design. Books, articles and printed materials were analyzed,
   interpreting their contents with analysis and synthesis techniques.
   Results indicated that media participation is undisputed in current
   Venezuelan politics, and that in turbulent times, journalism can
   contribute to guiding citizen behavior. For this reason, it is essential
   to consider the ethical orientation of journalists and the media.
   Conclusions are that the media should be guided by a code whose purpose
   is to report truthfully, objectively and in a timely manner, given their
   influence on the political scene. The study highlights the importance of
   the media's contribution to developing objective guidelines to eliminate
   the polarization that exists today.},

Journal = {POLITIQUE EUROPEENNE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {39},
Number = {1},
Pages = {76-104},
Abstract = {The dramatic events that started unfolding in the Mediterranean region
   since 2011 have revealed how volatile it remains in spite of a 40-year
   long European ``structural foreign policy{''}. Though it is much too
   early to fully grasp the mid-and long-term consequences of the ``Arab
   Spring{''}, it is almost certain that this chain of events will have a
   deep impact on the socio-political reconfigurations of North African and
   Middle Eastern countries and on regional power equations, therefore
   creating the need for external actors to adapt. This is all the more
   true for the European Union because of geographical proximity, migration
   realities, economic, political and social stakes as well as the dense
   relationships that emerged out of Euromediterranean policies. In line
   with the concept of ``normative power{''}, this article attempts to
   identify some of the factors that might substantially contribute to the
   future reconfiguration of Euromediterranean relations. After having
   surveyed the various dimensions of European foreign policy since the
   1970s, the article focuses on post-{''}Arab Spring{''} reorientations,
   trying to substantiate the claim that, limited by both an institutional
   and conceptual path dependency that perpetuates the contradictions of
   the EU's normative power posture, these reorientations seem to portend a
   weakening of the Union's performative potential and a diminution of its
   standing in the future balance of power in the Mediterranean.},

   considered to be ``the birth of EEC law{''}: the landmark decisions of
   the Court of Justice in Van Gend et Loos and Costa v. ENEL, in which the
   Court laid the basis of its ``constitutional doctrine{''}. Relying on
   archival sources, the author highlights both the part played by the
   European political institutions in the invention and in the judicial
   validation of the ``European legal order theory{''}, that is of its
   specificity vis-a-vis national and international legal orders, and the
   political stakes that underpinned its conceptualization at the end of
   the 1950s. In other words, this work suggests that these mythical
   decisions have to be fully understood as the result of a mobilization
   strategy led by the Legal Service of the European Executives to secure
   the advent of the future United States of Europe, whereas the very
   project of building a supranational Europe was seen as compromised by
   its promoters},

Abstract = {Conventional wisdom says that individuals ideological preferences do not

   the assumption that the contemporary Court is objectively conservative
   in its policymaking, meaning that ideological disagreement should come
   from liberals and agreement from conservatives. Our nuanced look at the
   Court's policymaking suggests rational bases for perceiving the Court's
   contemporary policymaking as conservative, moderate, and even liberal.
   We argue that subjective ideological disagreementincongruence between
   one's ideological preferences and one's perception of the Court's
   ideological tenormust be accounted for when explaining legitimacy.
   Analysis of a national survey shows that subjective ideological
   disagreement exhibits a potent, deleterious impact on legitimacy.
   Ideology exhibits sensible connections to legitimacy depending on how
   people perceive the Court's ideological tenor. Results from a survey
   experiment support our posited mechanism. Our work has implications for
   the public's view of the Court as a political institution.},

Title = {Why mobilize support online? The paradox of party behaviour online},
Journal = {PARTY POLITICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1},
Pages = {83-103},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The internet offers opportunities for political mobilization that
   parties are under-exploiting. Drawing on the rational choice approach to
   party behaviour, this paper builds an argument for why this is the case.
   I argue that if parties are not using new media to mobilize support, it
   is because the benefits of using it are uncertain while there are very
   certain costs - communicational and organizational - involved in the
   decision. I also argue that party characteristics shape incentives to
   use the internet for political mobilization and hence help to account
   for observed differences in party behaviour online. Using evidence from
   parties in Spain and Catalonia, the study finds that parties that are
   large, in opposition, non-programmatic, and non-bureaucratic tend to
   have greater incentives to use the internet for political mobilization,
   both because they expect to get the largest benefits and to pay the
   minimum costs from online mobilization.},

   the notion of State and, secondly, examines what consequences the EU law
   could produce regarding the status of French nationals, which have
   become, since the Treaty of Maastricht, citizens of the European Union.
   The two terms of the major political relation: State and citizen, are

   social control, as well as the historical attempts to legitimate it as
   the bearer of truth (in Greece), of science (in Modern World) and of
   reason (in the present). The text adopts a critic perspective when it
   demonstrates the loss of credibility of the State and the power, which
   find themselves forced to resort to the supposedly rationalized speech
   of jurists and judges that are not committed to the justice, but to the
   logical argumentation, and, thereby, end up occupying the post of

   powers make it a seemingly ideal antidote to the current negotiation
   inertia. But how realistic is it for the Security Council to play a role
   in curbing climate change? This paper examines the ambition and
   enforcement limitations of the current UN legal regime for climate
   change and analyses whether the Security Council could help fill the
   gaps. It argues that climate change can legitimately be seen as a
   security issue, and that it is legally feasible for the Security Council
   to act on it, even using its full range of powers. However, politically
   there are just a few options worth exploring at this stage. These
   include: monitoring and early warning of climate-related security
   threats; and helping to resolve disputes peacefully between blocks of
   states with regards to mitigation and adaptation ambition.},

Abstract = {International investment agreements are foundational instruments in a
   transnational investment regime that governs how states regulate the
   foreign-owned assets and the foreign investment activities of private
   actors. Over 3,000 investment agreements between states govern key
   governmental powers and form the basis for an emerging transnational
   investment regime. This transnational regime significantly
   decentralizes, denationalizes, and privatizes decision-making and policy
   choices over foreign investment. Investment agreements set limits to
   state action in a number of areas of vital public concern, including the
   protection of human and labour rights, the environment, and sustainable
   development. They determine the distribution of power between foreign
   investors and host states and their societies. However, the societies in
   which they operate seldom have any input into the terms or operation of
   these agreements, raising crucial questions of their democratic
   legitimacy as mechanisms of governance. This paper draws on political
   science and law to explore the political economy of international
   investment agreements and asks whether these agreements are potential
   vehicles for promoting international human rights. The analysis provides
   an historical account of the investment regime, while a review of the
   political economy of international investment agreements identifies what
   appears to be a paradox at the core of their operation. It then examines
   contract theory for insight into this apparent paradox and considers
   whether investment agreements are suitable mechanisms for advancing
   international human rights.},

Abstract = {More than 50,000 people from all continents came in the end of March
   2013 to Tunis to attend the World Social Forum (WSF). They discussed on
   a global scale the combined social, economic, ecological and political
   crises of capitalism and how to fight collectively against them. Tunis
   shows-after 12 years of its existence-the importance of the WSF. It is
   internationally the biggest framework for members of social and
   ecological movements and left activists.},

Abstract = {This paper presents the first comprehensive quantitative analysis of
   patronage appointments in Austrian state-owned enterprises. It is based
   on data on the nominations of 1242 individuals to managerial boards in
   corporations that were majority-owned by the Austrian federal government
   between 1995 and 2010. The multivariate models show that the composition
   of government, ministerial partisanship, the size of corporations and
   the importance of the individual posts are significant determinants of
   patronage appointments.},

Title = {The Power Horizontal: Law, Violence and Intelligence in the Execution of
   Judicial Decisions in Russia},
Journal = {POLITIX},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {26},
Number = {104},
Pages = {155+},
Abstract = {The role of violent entrepreneurs in the making of Russian capitalism is
   well documented; yet, its evolution during the 2000s is far less known.
   Though a trend towards the legalization of conflicts has been observed
   since the late 1990s, does this mean that violence is less or no longer
   used? This paper deals with the way law and force are used and
   articulated when solving economic conflicts, by focusing on the
   execution of decisions by commercial courts during the late 2000s. The
   analysis of the work of bailiffs in Yekaterinburg shows that they
   collaborate with private firms staffed with former law-enforcement
   agents. Known as debt-collection agencies, these private firms
   contribute to the development of new forms of governmentality in Russia,
   in the shadow of governmental efforts to build a ``power vertical{''}.},

Abstract = {The theory of collective action has long since moved beyond the
   ``free-rider problem{''} as originally stated by Olson (1965). It is now
   recognized that large-scale participation is possible even without
   selective incentives, but this has raised new questions. I discuss two
   types of contributions from the past few years. Some of the recent
   literature has remained close to the canonical game-theoretic framework,
   clarifying many analytical issues and proving important results in
   participation games that had remained elusive. We now know that the
   ``turnout paradox{''} had been grossly overstated. Another set of
   contributions has expanded the original framework, incorporating results
   from psychology and social sciences with the aim of obtaining more
   realistic models with better empirical performance.},

Abstract = {The media frenzy surrounding Sarah Palin has brought attention and
   popular validation to the burgeoning conservative feminist movement,
   which for many appears absurdly paradoxical because of its fusion of
   seemingly contradictory ideological discourses: feminism, neoliberalism,
   and Christianity. Like other ideologies, these too must adapt to
   contemporary fashion and, even more important, to the pluralistic and
   fragmented nature of postmodernism. In this analysis of the Christian
   Right women's movement, I assert that Christian Right women are
   constructing a postmodern consciousness shaped from contradictory
   discourses (conservative Christian and feminist, for example) while
   simultaneously insisting on the organic coherence of their collective
   identity. Although it seems counter-intuitive, this conservative
   strategy of ``pick and choose'' has helped the Christian Right frame
   much political conversation within their own terms, and this phenomenon
   is effecting what may be an irreversible change within all ideologies
   involved},

Journal = {POLITIX},

Volume = {26},

Pages = {9+},
Abstract = {Promoting home-ownership for low-income households has become a
   political motto in a variety of national and historical contexts.
   However, at least in France and Western countries, the sociological
   study of working-classes has often focused on social housing estates.
   This issue analyzes the making of policies supporting the rise of
   homeownership among working-classes, and the role of high-ranking civil
   servants, experts, local authorities or home-builders in it. It also
   questions the impacts of such housing policies on social inequalities.
   How do the residential careers of homeowners, partly shaped by such
   public policies, contribute to redefine social hierarchies? Introducing
   the different contributions of this issue, this paper highlights how
   they participate to a renewed study of social classes, and calls for
   further research on this matter.},

Abstract = {What are the challenges of teaching Cold War politics to the
   twenty-first-century student? How might the millennial generation be
   educated about the political science theories and concepts associated
   with this period in history? A college student today, who grew up in the
   post-Cold War era with the Internet, Facebook, Twitter, smart phones,
   laptops, and tablets, demonstrates a learning style that responds better
   to interaction and the use of multimedia in the classroom. What is an
   innovative teaching technique to accommodate this active-learning style?
   How might college professors teach undergraduates about a significant
   historical event such as the Cold War, when most were born after it
   ended? We argue that for the millennial generation Hollywood
   blockbusters, when used in an engaging manner beyond merely showing
   clips, are effective pedagogical tools that make abstract Cold War
   theories and concepts more understandable, identifiable, and still
   relevant. Our findings reveal that engaging the Millennials with ``big''
   post-Cold War entertaining movies like Crimson Tide and Star Trek VI:
   The Undiscovered Country, in two undergraduate international relations
   courses, not only increased student comprehension and knowledge about
   the Cold War but also enhanced their ability to relate the era to world
   politics today.},

Abstract = {In this article, we analyze the European Union's (EU) approach to the
   Israeli-Palestinian conflict, showing that there is a wide gap between
   its nonnative opposition to the occupation, Israel's expanding
   settlement project, and the EU's foreign trade policy. Our argument is
   not only that there is no evidence of norm diffusion from the EU to
   Israel, but that within the EU itself there is no diffusion from the
   normative political stance to the EU's economic interests. The Israeli
   case suggests that the pro-democracy activists of Tunisia, Egypt, and
   Syria should be aware that the trade interests of the EU Member States
   will ultimately trump the EU's political declarations.},

Number = {5},
Pages = {90-96},
Abstract = {In the inter-war years, it was important for Britain to preserve
   friendly relations and influence throughout its empire to maintain
   competitive advantage in markets in a time of austerity. One way of
   doing this was through the export of cultural imperialism, and colonial
   administrations in particular were keen to maintain their hold over
   indigenous populations by preserving the cultural ideologies and brand
   (and thereby associated power) of the mother country. David Hammond
   argues that the military band was a particularly effective and
   economical resource for this: through the expression of British symbols,
   routines and rituals, they epitomised the British control systems and
   power structures without the need for `hard power' engagement.},

Abstract = {In his article, Dr. Vladislav Inosemtsev, Russian economist, outlays a
   new approach to Western overseas expansion that developed from the 15th
   century onwards. He argues that a distinction should be made between
   settler colonies (which could be named colonies in the strict sense of
   the word) and occupied territories (which should rather be labeled as
   dependencies). In view of such distinction, he draws a line between
   colonies' struggle for independence and dependencies' fight for
   sovereignty. His argumentation goes further, being applied to Russia's
   colonization of Siberia in the 16th and 17th centuries, as well as to
   Russia's conquest of Central Asia in the 19th century. The different
   nature of these moves, the author believes, may provide a new basis for
   inquiry into the current state, as well as into the possible future of
   reintegration of the post-Soviet space.},

Abstract = {The objectives of this work focuses on (1) To analyze the segments of
   users and potential users of public health services based on their level
   of use of the system and (2) the demonstration that the high frequency
   of use of the public health services is related to the degree of
   satisfaction with them. The results obtained allow to demonstrate that
   it is possible to establish user profiles based on their frequency of
   use of public health services, and that the elements that determine the
   satisfaction with these vary according to the category of user. This is
   a very useful tool for the design and management of health services,
   orienting them to the needs of citizens and thus raising their level of
   satisfaction.},

   predominantly Republican, even in a year in which a Democrat was
   re-elected to the White House, and on balance party identification among
   these voters showed a slight Republican edge. Only the growing
   contingent of Latino Catholics kept the national vote of the entire
   religious community closely balanced. Despite widespread agreement among
   scholars that the partisan behavior of Catholics has changed, there is
   much less consensus on the nature of that change, its permanence, and
   its causes. We review the historic patterns of Catholic partisanship and
   voting behavior, discuss three major perspectives on electoral change
   among Catholics, and test these perspectives with data drawn from the
   2012 National Survey of Religion and Politics, with a rich battery of
   religious measures. We find that socioeconomic factors, religious
   perspectives, and issue preferences among Catholics all influence
   partisanship and vote choice, reducing any true ``distinctiveness{''} of
   the ``Catholic vote.{''}},

Abstract = {In 2012 the Socialist Party (PS) presidential candidate, Franois
   Hollande, defeated the incumbent, Nicolas Sarkozy. The victory was
   convincing, though not overwhelming. Hollande thus became only the
   second Socialist president of the Fifth Republic after Franois
   Mitterrand. Hollandes success in the presidential contest was reinforced
   a few weeks later when the PS and immediate allies won an absolute
   majority of seats in the parliamentary election. The articles in this
   special issue explore many of the key aspects of both 2012 campaigns:
   from understanding how Sarkozy could fall so rapidly from grace to
   examining the extent to which the outcome symbolises a new direction for
   France, both domestically and internationally.},

Journal = {ASIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Pages = {41-61},
Abstract = {This article investigates Japanese approaches to managing oil import
   security in the period 1970 - 2005 by developing a framework that
   integrates portfolio and inducement approaches to managing import
   security. It argues that Japan is an insuring state and, in the context
   of continuing asymmetric dependence, seeks to ensure its security not
   only through portfolio strategies that aim to reduce systemic and
   specific risks, but also through political and economic inducements that
   reinforce those portfolio strategies. Empirical evidence suggests that
   these strategies have enhanced Japan's insurance cover against oil
   unanticipated supply disruptions and has enhanced its relative security
   over the period. The Japanese case suggests the importance of exploring
   portfolio strategies and structures as power in addition to other forms
   of non-military power, such as economic aid and diplomacy, in
   understanding international economic security.},

Pages = {165-182},
Abstract = {The paper presents the concepts of absolute and relative surplus value
   with a view to specifying how these categories are used by the Latin
   American Marxist, Ruy Mauro Marini in his theory of labor power
   superexploitation and subimperialism. It is argued that both types of
   extraction of surplus value are derived logically and historically by
   Marx. On this basis, the paper explains the controversy concerning the
   specificity of the dependent capitalist economy by pointing out that it
   has its roots, in theoretical terms, in the question of the
   generalization of relative surplus value throughout the entire world,
   and in practical terms, in the issue of how political action can
   construct a socialist society on the periphery of the capitalist system.},

Abstract = {From a feminist perspective the text argues that Crouch's diagnosis of a
   `postdemocracy' remains conceptually limited because it denies the
   interwovenness of democracy and social relations. Furthermore, the
   article argues that in the current `postdemocracy' restrictions of the
   political become visible that have always been constitutive for modern,
   western democracies exactly because of an intrinsic depoliticization of
   the social, the social relations and living circumstances of the
   political subjects. This depolitization of the social can remain
   invisible not at least due to powerful gendering mechanisms. Against
   this background, the article ends by proposing to re-think democracy by
   taking the social as starting point for re-thinking the political.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CIVIL SOCIETY},

Pages = {300-324},
Abstract = {The article analyses closely the role of civil society in the local
   translation and adaptation of transnational standards of responsible use
   of natural resources in global certification regimes. The study builds
   on original evidence from Russia on civil society and forest
   certification, based on extensive fieldwork. It argues that the local
   translation of global sustainability standards into on-the-ground
   practices is not a straightforward execution of rules imposed by
   powerful transnational actors-e.g. international nongovernmental
   organizations, multinationals, governments, or consumers. Rather, local
   civil society actors elaborate the ways in which transnational standards
   are implemented locally and thereby construct new knowledge related to
   standard implementation and responsible natural resource management. The
   paper contributes to the literature on transnational governance by
   examining the involvement of civil society organizations in the
   translation, adaptation, and learning dynamics in global certification
   regimes.},

Abstract = {Studies analyzing the American Congress demonstrate that senators'
   attention towards voters substantially increased after the 17th
   Amendment to the U. S. Constitution, which replaced their indirect
   appointment with direct election. Even though this finding seems useful
   for theoretical generalizations, expectations become unclear as concerns
   about career perspectives differ. Should politicians with nonstatic
   ambition shift their attention towards voters if they do not expect
   reelection? Making use of a quasi-experimental setting, I analyze the
   impact of the shift from indirect to direct election to select the
   members of the Argentine Senate. I develop an argument for why, in spite
   of the lack of systematic pursuit of reelection, elected senators have
   incentives to be more oriented towards voters. Through the analysis of
   about 55,000 bills, I evaluate senatorial behavior under both sources of
   legitimacy. The findings support the idea that audience costs make a
   difference in behavior, regardless of short-term career expectations.},

Abstract = {Research on autocracies and their consequences has been a growth
   industry in the latest decade. Nonetheless, the relationship between the
   type of autocracy and the violation of civil liberties has largely been
   ignored. In this article, we employ a new dataset, which includes
   cross-temporal data on freedom of speech, freedom of
   assembly/association, freedom of religion, and freedom of movement, to
   shed light on this issue. Analysing 182 countries in the period
   19792008, we show that democracies repress civil liberties less than
   autocracies do, whereas we find little evidence to the effect that
   different kinds of autocracies violate civil liberties to different
   degrees. However, we also show that the differences between democracies
   and autocracies have declined starkly since the Cold War. Finally, our
   results demonstrate that the difference in the extent to which
   democracies and autocracies repress civil liberties is larger for the
   freedom of speech and freedom of assembly/association than for the
   freedom of religion and freedom of movement. We take the general
   difference between the two categories of liberties as evidence that
   autocracies repress political liberties more than private liberties
   because the former presents levers for oppositional activity. We argue
   that the cross-temporal differences are a consequence of the spread of
   more minimalist democracies since the end of the Cold War.},

Year = {2013},
Volume = {84},
Number = {1},

Month = {JAN-MAR},
Abstract = {Nineteenth-century constitutional reformers focussed on parliament.
   Their central idea was citizenship, modelled variously on the democracy
   of ancient Athens, small communities like Switzerland, and especially
   the United States, a particular inspiration for Gladstone who admired
   its constitution. The 1911 Parliament Act marked the final triumph of
   the Victorian Liberals legacy, with a very different impetus coming from
   Lloyd George during his coalition. Labour focussed on class, not the
   constitution, though the ILP favoured localism and devolution, before
   succumbing to a centralising unionism. Tawney championed the idea of
   social citizenship, emphasising activism and education. After 1945,
   Labour did not prioritize constitutional reform until the dramatic
   changes that came after 1997. Gordon Brown then revived the notion of
   citizenship, and possible codification, in pursuing the values of
   Britishness. Labour's legacy was a confusing one. But Ed Miliband's
   policy revision could reclaim the idea of citizenship, an egalitarian
   concept to counter the inequalities of class.},

Abstract = {The author analyses particularly important, topical and at the same time
   dramatically ``tangled{''} national question in Russia. It is the
   politically determinative correlation of federal and national
   dispositions in its state system that constitutes the key object of the
   author's attention. Their combination, in the author's opinion, to a
   large extent predetermines specific character of the Russian federalism.
   The author considers the broad problematic field of mutual relations
   between the Russians and the non-Russian nations in Russia, as well as
   the variety of concrete connotation of ``nationalism{''} in Russia's
   politics. He accentuates the threat of accumulation of misbalances in
   affairs of the state regulation of the federal and of the inter-national
   relations. The article covers also the idea of ``new federalism{''} able
   to open the way for removal of irregularities in the relations between
   the Russian nation and the other nations of the Russian Federation.},

   Constitutional amendments, through the selection of some representative
   cases. It focuses on the case-law of the legal systems chosen where
   Constitutional or Supreme Courts asserted being enabled to verify the
   effectiveness of limits against possible misuses by political actors.
   Those Courts used different arguments to demonstrate that the control of

Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE PEACE \& SECURITY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {25},
Number = {3},
Pages = {299-312},
Abstract = {Historically, Bangladesh has a strong and culturally embedded vibrant
   public sphere. The Bangladeshi public sphere always consists of a
   multiplicity of publics. The idea of public sphere in Bangladesh was
   based on the idea of secular rationality or religious neutrality.
   However, the situation is changing; attempts are being made to create an
   Islamist public sphere. This paper highlights two examples of this
   effort to foster the Islamization of the public sphere: production of
   Islamist fiction and founding women's discussion groups. It argues that
   the emerging Islamist public sphere in Bangladesh only subscribes to one
   interpretation of Islam and that the traditional authorities are now
   being replaced by the Islamist interpretation advanced by ideologues. It
   further argues that the absence of reference to local syncretistic
   traditions in the new Islamist discourse makes its authenticity suspect.},

Abstract = {This essay seeks to analyze how historians have treated the concept of
   space as an analytical category, by focusing on three spatial concepts:
   frontiers, Europe and the world. The argument proceeds along several
   lines: first that historians have long been engaged in debating the
   interaction of geography and culture, thus foreshadowing the ``spatial
   turn,{''} second, that representative figures in different specialties
   have been working away against a Eurocentric conceptualization of space
   and third that in order to achieve these ends they have employed
   theoretical insights from the social sciences. The essay concludes that
   the spatial turn has provided a fresh perspectives on the ways in which
   space has been conceived by employing terms like frontiers and place to
   illuminate cultural categories, but that there is a danger for
   historians that this ``turn{''} can lead into imprecise or abstract
   formulations that lose their heuristic possibilities.},

Journal = {TEORIA Y REALIDAD CONSTITUCIONAL},

Abstract = {The present document studies the political and juridical problem that
   the independence proposals of the catalonian nationalism represents for
   the Spanish State. Our thesis, beginning with de absolute compatibility
   between International Law and Constitutional Law, is that the answer to
   the question if a territorial entity can decide by itself to become
   independent, in a democratic Constitutional State, is necessarily
   negative. To sum up, we maintain that when it is not possible to appeal
   to the Humanitarian International Law, the seccesion is a merely
   internal problem of a State and, so that, it is not in the European
   Union Law, but in the Spanish Constitutional Law, and the democratic
   Theory of the Pouvoir Constituant, where you must look for a solution to
   the problem set up by the catalonian nationalism.},

Abstract = {The essay is a `personal impression' of Isaiah Berlin and his
   liberalism, beginning with some intellectual biography, and turning to
   the question of how the way Berlin wrote about political ideas
   illuminates the liberalism he espoused. The essay discounts Berlin's
   self-description as a historian of ideas who had abandoned philosophy,
   and follows Bernard Williams in arguing that the historicity of our
   political values demands a dialogical approach to their analysis in
   which we engage with our forebears and contemporaries in an essentially
   conversational mode. The claim is illustrated with Berlin's engagement
   with Alexander Herzen and Romanticism.},

Pages = {7-26},
Abstract = {Over the last decade, Colombia has developed the field of peace studies.
   This field has been shaped by the long and complex history of violence
   in the country. The discussions about peace, in this context, became a
   conflictive scenario, as the visions of peace and change strategies are
   sometimes opposed. Thus, peace studies contain a dual nature: on the one
   hand, within academic discussion, different conceptions of peace are
   confronted. On the other hand, within the political realm, stepping back
   and responding to the existing conflicts is not an easy task. This paper
   presents the changes within historical reflections of CINEP about peace.},

Journal = {COMPARATIVE EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Pages = {49-69},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {When interpreted as citizenship of the European Union, the development
   of European citizenship has prompted a series of debates on rights,
   membership and belonging, and democracy and constitutionalism. These
   debates can be enriched by highlighting the ways in which European
   citizenship is enacted by a variety of actors. It is argued that acts of
   European citizenship occur under two different dynamics: extension and
   assertion. Acts under the dynamic of extension are most often acts
   extending existing legal citizenship regimes by formal and public
   institutions, such as the European Court of Justice. Acts under the
   hitherto relatively neglected dynamic of assertion are likely to be more
   diffuse in location and visibility and uncertain in their goals and
   impacts. Understanding such acts - and the links between acts under the
   two dynamics - has the potential to reinvigorate and expand research
   agendas in the study of European citizenship. Comparative European

Abstract = {One of megatrends of the 21st century is establishment of the new world
   order. Within this megatrend we can distinguish some trends that require
   special attention. Among them are the following:
   at the global level: formation of a new international system among a
   bigger new group of leading world powers (great powers) that are
   dramatically different in their characteristics;
   at the macroregional level: formation of new subsystems with
   core-countries;
   at the regional level: redistribution of influence between regional
   powers within big subsystems like transatlantic or possible transpacific
   subsystems. In the following paper we shall analyze some trends that
   take place, paying special attention to a Eurasian subsystem ``Small
   Eurasia{''} that includes most of the former Soviet republics (excluding
   the Baltic States).},

Abstract = {Does public action contribute to the rise and decline of historical
   forms of working-class property ownership? This is what this article
   demonstrates, focusing on the political construction of housing markets.
   It deals specifically with a state policy implemented at the beginning
   of the 1970's in France by the Ministry of Equipment, meant to arouse a
   new offer of low price houses known as ``chalandonnettes{''}. Analysing
   the archives of the Ministry, we can conclude that, at the end of the
   1960's, the idea that a centralised and direct state is necessary to
   regulate the development of suburban housing is taken as granted by the
   civil servants of central administration. However, as power relations
   change in the housing field during the 1970s, this kind of public
   intervention on housing market tends to lose its legitimity and gives
   way to a more indirect way of encouraging working-class property
   ownership.},

   forty years the family institution has known deep changes in the western
   countries. As a result the representation of families and parents has
   been drastically altered. Once again the emergence of families of same
   sex parents brings into question the foundations of both families and
   filiation as it has been the case for divorces, step families and
   medically assisted procreation. Resting on actual research, we will
   reflect the social and legal foundations of the family, particularly the
   difference between sexes for the setting up of filiation ties.},

Abstract = {This article is an overview of a comprehensive film-based course that
   covers basic topics appropriate for an introduction to international
   relations (or world politics) course. Film provides a new and novel
   perspective by which to view international interactions. I explore how
   various aspects of international politics are covered by movies with
   attention focused on how these films can provide important educational
   lessons to guide course content. The course focuses on the topics of
   conflict, peace, and theories of international interactions, but others
   should adapt the content to meet their pedagogical or ideological needs.
   Emphasis is placed on using film to explain events and theory. The goal
   is to utilize movies to reach out to students unfamiliar with the
   processes of global affairs so that they will be motivated to move on to
   advanced topics and understand the basic issues in the field.},

Abstract = {Purpose - This chapter contributes to comparative biopolitics and
   reviews primatological literature, especially about our nearest
   relatives, the Great Apes.
   Design/methodology/approach - Biopolitics in this chapter means
   evolutionarily informed political science, with emphasis on power
   relations. I review the literature on intrasexual and intersexual
   dominance interactions among individuals and competitive and/or
   agonistic interactions among groups in the Great Apes (Hominidae,
   formerly Pongidae): orangutan (Pongo with two species and three
   subspecies), gorilla (Gorilla with four subspecies) bonobo (Pan
   paniscus), and common chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes with four subspecies).
   In the final section I present some (speculative) thoughts on Pan prior
   or the modern human ancestor.
   Findings - Not only Man is a political animal.
   Originality/value - Impartial, objective, and as complete as possible
   review of the literature for the students of (comparative) politics,
   ethology, and psychology.},

Title = {Between Depoliticization and Radicalization - Towards a Theory of
   Democracy and Politics in Times of Resistance},
Journal = {POLITISCHE VIERTELJAHRESSCHRIFT},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {54},
Number = {1},
Pages = {75-110},
Abstract = {Political protest and resistance is a hot topic of debate. Despite the
   wide range of democratic theories, this paper argues that only a radical
   democratic approach is in the position to free radical (sometimes
   violent) resistance from the stigma of irrationality and highlights its
   emancipating democratic-political potential, i.e. resistance as a
   critique of the diverse strategies of de-politicization in modern
   political orders. In opposition to these forms of de-politicization,
   protest and radical resistance can be interpreted as a struggle for
   political equality, for a counter-hegemonic discourse, and for political
   freedom. This seems to be the political dimension of resistance which
   has to be distinguished from economic, religious, social or ideological
   motives. Although radical democratic theory's impact on the renewal of
   our democratic-theoretical repertoire has to be acknowledged, this
   approach falls short in both, in giving a coherent account for the
   radicalization and escalation of political conflicts and in providing us
   with the necessary conceptual apparatus to outline the contours of a
   conflictive democratic-political order that is able to prevent political
   conflicts from escalation. In the third part of the paper, I therefore
   introduce an alternative political-theoretical conception, the
   Republicanism of dissent, which seeks to elaborate on the interrelation
   between depoliticization and resistance in a constructive
   democratic-theoretical manner.},

Journal = {RUSI JOURNAL},

Volume = {158},
Number = {4},
Pages = {6-18},
Abstract = {With the growing global importance of China, Chinese organised crime has
   become a growing non-military threat to national and international
   security. Peng Wang focuses on the three dimensions of Chinese organised
   crime: the resurgence of the criminal underworld and rampant police
   corruption in mainland China; cross-border crime in Greater China; and
   Chinese organised crime overseas, including in the UK. The national,
   regional and international threats posed by ethnic-Chinese criminal
   groups require the law-enforcement agencies of both China and those
   countries hosting Chinese communities to improve their response
   strategies as a matter of urgency.},

Abstract = {Kim Jong-un placed power consolidation as his primary mission in 2012,
   mainly through leadership reshuffle. He presented a new face to the
   world by emphasising ``people's livelihood{''} although the military
   first policy remains the top priority. In 2012 China-DPRK relations
   worsened due to Kim's continued violation of Chinese vital interests.
   Although Beijing's DPRK policy is still status-quo based, Xi Jinping has
   taken new approaches to manage the Pyongyang challenge. China-DPRK
   special relationship is no longer sustainable.},

Abstract = {The exploration of the religious underpinnings of intolerance has long
   focused on the effects of religious behaviors and beliefs, but has
   ignored a variety of important facets of the religious experience that
   should bear on tolerance judgments: elite communication, religious
   values about how the world should be ordered, and social networks in
   churches. We focus on the communication of religious values and argue
   specifically that values should affect threat judgments and thus affect
   tolerance judgments indirectly. We test these assertions using data
   gathered in a survey experiment and find that priming exclusive
   religious values augments threat and thus reduces tolerance.},

Abstract = {Digital security governance - the use of digital personal data for
   threat analysis on the basis of (automated) risk profiling - enhances
   terrorism risk management in Europe. European security strategies
   emphasise that information and communication technology increasingly
   play a key role in preventing and anticipating threats such as terrorism
   and cyber-crime. It enables, for example, the sharing of personal,
   financial or travellers' data with third countries. This article focuses
   on digital security governance in the context of the Passenger Name
   Record (PNR), the Advance Passenger Information (API) and the Terrorist
   Finance Tracking System (TFTP) programmes. Particularly, it considers
   the ethical dilemmas of using and sharing digital personal data as well
   as accountability for this type of risk management. Because there are
   broader socio-political, legal and technological issues connected to the
   use of information and communication technology for digital security
   governance, the concept of accountability in this article is holistic.},

Abstract = {At the end of World War II, F. A. Hayek denounced the then-popular idea
   of central planning by arguing that, if pursued to its logical
   conclusion, it would entail totalitarianism. But there were at least two
   problems. First, judging by his example of Nazi Germany, state control
   over the economy appears to be a consequence, not a cause, of the
   monopolization of political power. Second, he conflated socialism and
   mere interference in the market with central planning. Therefore,
   history did not so much falsify Hayek's prediction as bypass it: Once
   the vogue for central planning faded in the West, Hayek's book became
   irrelevantexcept, ironically, in Germany. There, it was read as a
   manifesto for good planning through the rule of law. Alongside other
   neoliberal writers, Hayek had a profound (if little acknowledged)
   influence on the shape of the emerging Federal Republic and, through it,
   on the whole European institutional framework.},

Abstract = {Popular music can be used to encourage active political discussions,
   increase understanding of political concepts and encourage
   student-centred learning on subjects with which students may unwittingly
   already be familiar via their iPods (TM). While some faculty may already
   be using music in the domestic political context, music can also be
   utilised in international and comparative political science classes as
   well. This article suggests that music and politics can be evaluated in
   four approaches: Music as `cause or outcome' of political processes,
   music as `mirror' revealing what we already believe about politics being
   reflected back to us, music as `data' as the music itself, or the manner
   in which music is consumed, affects how an audience interprets and
   responds to it and, lastly, music as `constitutive', in that, music
   constitutes norms, values and identities. This article suggests that
   students actually do become more engaged and have a better understanding
   of political concepts through the use of music in the classroom. The
   article also provides some useful advice for utilising music in the
   classroom to increase student engagement, critical thinking and better

Journal = {SOCIALIST STUDIES},

Volume = {9},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {94-110},
Month = {WIN},
Abstract = {This article theorizes the relationship of privacy to capital and
   projects of security and, in doing so, situates privacy in context to
   pacification. In particular, the article provides an interrogation of
   the contradictory structuring of privacy as both an object threatened by
   security and the role of privacy as a means to resist or limit projects
   of security. Through an analysis of Thomas Hobbes' writings, this
   contradictory dual-deployment of privacy is unseated to reveal that far
   from challenging security, privacy has historically been presupposed and
   structured by security projects. Moreover, by acclimatizing us to our
   existence as atomized individuals, alienated from our collective social
   power, privacy in fact pacifies us. This process is explored through an
   examination of the Passenger Flight List agreement (PNR) between the
   United States and EU member states. The article concludes with a brief
   discussion of the implications of our reliance on privacy has for
   challenging the logics of security and pacification, especially with the
   emergent technology of Drones.},

Journal = {PEACE ECONOMICS PEACE SCIENCE AND PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {19},
Number = {3},
Pages = {393-402},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The CDCM project explores whether and how constitutional reform could
   reduce political instability and violence in Africa, by addressing the
   question in three steps. First, case studies of seven African countries
   identify how at key turning points the domestic political institutions
   either mitigated - or exacerbated - violent outcomes. Second, an
   unprecedented database of constitutional design in all of Africa reveals
   that most countries on the continent have highly centralized political
   institutions, which many experts believe foster conflict. Third, these
   lessons are combined to develop policy recommendations for foreign aid
   to promote democracy and good governance in Africa. Counter-intuitively,
   the CDCM project does not recommend promoting radical constitutional
   reform to ``accommodate{''} groups based on their identity, as favored
   by many academics, on grounds that it is too different from what
   currently exists and therefore could result in half-measures that risk
   exacerbating political violence. Instead, the project recommends
   promoting gradual reform of Africa's existing, centralized
   constitutional designs by counter-balancing them with liberal
   institutions, especially the separation of powers, which could foster
   both peace and democracy on the continent.},

Volume = {32},

Abstract = {This study investigates retrospective voting and issue voting, and their
   change over time in a transitioning country. Sociotropic, as well as
   egocentric economic evaluations, and policy issues of parties are
   expected to play an increasing role in party preferences of citizens
   over time. Data consist of 41 Hungarian cross-sectional surveys, between
   1998 and 2008. Results of conditional logistic regression models reveal
   that voters reward incumbent parties when they see improvements in their
   personal or the national economic situation, and punish them if the
   economy deteriorates. Distance from a given party on the left-right
   scale also decreases the chance of voting for that party. Voting
   behavior is changing during transition. The evaluations of the national
   economy and personal situation have an increasing impact on party
   preferences over time. We found educational heterogeneity in the extent
   of economic voting. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This article explores the need for Mexican policymakers to add an active
   industrial policy as a key instrument to assist in the nation's so far
   failed quest for high and sustained economic growth. Mexico implemented
   drastic reforms in the mid-1980s to open its markets to foreign
   competition and to reduce the state's intervention in the economy, but
   these reforms failed to ensure robust economic growth. The article
   explores myths and facts of the theory and practice of industrial
   policy. It identifies what type of industrial policy the new
   administration, which took office in December 2012, will apparently
   implement during 2013-2018 and how it may, or may not, help to put
   Mexico onto a path of high, sustained economic expansion.},

Abstract = {Citizenship is fast emerging as a central concern for transgender
   politics. This article approaches the topic of transgender citizenship
   by investigating empirically how the practice of blogging has served as
   a way of claiming, or practicing, intimate citizenship for transgendered
   people. Theorization of intimate citizenship helps us to further our
   understanding of the ways in which our most private decisions and
   practices are inextricably linked with public institutions, law and
   state policies. Significantly, this development is also tied up with
   other characteristically late modern technological advancements, ranging
   from new reproductive technologies to new Information and Communication
   Technologies. In the case of transgender politics, such interlacings
   become particularly perspicacious, not only due to modern discourses
   concerning diagnosis and treatment, but also because the presence of
   social media resources affords new possibilities for the sharing of
   personal and political narratives about being transgendered'. In this
   article, I investigate an event in the Swedish blogosphere, namely the
   way in which the national celebration of Swedish Mother's Day became a
   site for the contestation of the current limitations of the reproductive
   legal rights for transgendered people, providing an opening for a more
   general debate on transgender reproductive rights.},

Abstract = {This article is concerned primarily with the relationship between
   academic ideas and the `real world' of politics. Disciplinary histories
   often assume a one-way influence of ideas, that of the academy into
   political practice. This article reverses that relationship and explores
   the way in which real-world ideas about politics have the potential to
   influence the way in which the academy develops, and the kind of
   responses it might offer. The primary focus is upon England and the
   marketisation of higher education; it asks are we burning all our books?
   This article also raises broader questions about the relationship
   between academia and that which it observes, with specific reference to
   political science.},

Title = {The power and limitations of televised presidential debates: Assessing
   the real impact of candidate performance on public opinion and vote
   choice},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {32},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {A growing literature establishes that presidential candidates can help
   and hurt themselves through their performance in televised debates.
   Debate performance, however, is a somewhat elusive concept. Voters'
   post-debate assessments of the participants may be heavily colored by
   pre-existing attitudes toward candidates, parties, and the incumbent
   president. This paper attempts to tease out the ``true{''} impact of
   debate performance, i.e., those times in which the candidates'
   superiority or inferiority on stage breaks through voters' cognitive
   filters. We find that debate performance is responsible for only about
   half of the variance in viewers' assessments of winners and losers; that
   it is possible to be declared the winner in the post-debate polls based
   entirely on factors exogenous to the debate itself; and that even a
   highly successful performance might yield only a narrow win in the
   post-debate polls. We also present evidence that, when measured
   properly, debate performance can actually alter candidate preferences.

Abstract = {This paper examines the decision to vote or not vote in experimental
   elections. We replicate the important findings of Duffy and Tavits
   (2008), though with a different design. Our results support their
   finding, that is, turnout is affected by the belief that one's vote
   counts and that overestimation in the perception that one's vote counts
   does not disappear completely over time. Going beyond previous research,
   we also find that turnout is not higher under a proportional system than
   under a plurality system, as well as that beliefs about being in a
   pivotal position have a greater impact on turnout among the risk averse.

Abstract = {Political science is divided between methodological individualists, who
   seek to explain political phenomena by reference to individuals and
   their interactions, and holists (or nonreductionists), who consider some
   higher-level social entities or properties such as states, institutions,
   or cultures ontologically or causally significant. We propose a
   reconciliation between these two perspectives, building on related work
   in philosophy. After laying out a taxonomy of different variants of each
   view, we observe that (i) although political phenomena result from
   underlying individual attitudes and behavior, individual-level
   descriptions do not always capture all explanatorily salient properties,
   and (ii) nonreductionistic explanations are mandated when social
   regularities are robust to changes in their individual-level
   realization. We characterize the dividing line between phenomena
   requiring nonreductionistic explanation and phenomena permitting
   individualistic explanation and give examples from the study of ethnic
   conflicts, social-network theory, and international-relations theory.},

Abstract = {This article outlines three theoretical arguments-socialization, status
   discontent, and elite cues-that generate competing predictions about the
   way context shapes gender attitudes. Using hierarchical analysis, we
   assess the power of these arguments in Latin America, a region that
   manifests considerable variation on our central explanatory variables
   and thus offers important theoretical leverage. We find men's gender
   attitudes to be highly contingent on elite cues and susceptible to
   backlash effects in response to women's economic advancement. Also,
   where women lack national representation, distrust of government
   promotes support for female leadership as an alternative to the
   discredited ( male) establishment. The analysis supports existing
   individual-level explanations of gender attitudes and demonstrates a
   connection between diffuse democratic values and gender egalitarianism.
   The findings suggest that recent advances for female politicians in
   Latin America may be susceptible to reversal, and they illuminate
   strategies for strengthening women's equality in the region.},

Abstract = {Well-known approaches in comparative institutional analysis like the
   Varieties of Capitalism typology often do not explicitly consider how
   institutions are shaping public debates. In doing so, they fall short of
   grasping the full extent of divergence among advanced economies. By
   exploring the policy preferences of a broad range of relevant actors
   including public administrations, parties, interest groups,
   corporations, experts and transnational governmental actors, this
   analysis can show how the institutional constellations of the United
   Kingdom, France and Germany explain a considerable part of the variation
   in their debates on economic liberalization reforms. The analysis is
   based on extensive content analysis data from quality newspapers and
   confirms that national peculiarities in public debates are a function on
   the particular institutional context. Contrary to intuitive expectations
   from the literature on comparative political economy, however, the
   course of debates complements the structure of interest intermediation:
   In Germany and France, corporatist and state-led concertation is
   accompanied by comparatively fierce public debates, whereas the
   conflictive decision-making processes in the United Kingdom go along
   with rather calm public conflicts. Key to understand this
   complementarity is the consideration of both political-economic and
   general democratic institutions, which are conjointly shaping the
   outcome of debates.},

Volume = {43},
Number = {4},
Pages = {741-773},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This article sets out and tests a theory of public policy investment -
   how democratic governments seek to enhance their chances of re-election
   by managing a portfolio of policy priorities for the public, analogous
   to the relationship between investment manager and client. Governments
   choose policies that yield returns the public values; and rebalance
   their policy priorities later to adjust risk and stabilize return. Do
   the public reward returns to policy capital or punish risky policy
   investments? The article investigates whether returns to policy
   investment guide political management and statecraft. Time-series
   analyses of risk and return in Britain 1971-2000 reveal that risk and
   return on government policy portfolios predict election outcomes, and
   that returns, risk profiles and the uncertainty in public signals
   influence the prioritization of policies.},

Abstract = {Members of Congress grant access to outsiders as a means of alleviating
   uncertainty over policies and elections. For those seeking access to
   Congress, a key factor determining their success is the appearance of
   usefulness, namely, the perceived ability to provide a Member of
   Congress with some resource that he or she desires. These resources come
   in a variety of forms, including votes, campaign contributions, policy
   expertise and public credibility. Given these assumptions, who is
   granted access to Congress, and which members are more likely to grant
   it? Previous studies have found a direct relationship between
   organization or Political Action Committee (PAC) contributions and
   access to Members of Congress, measured by the amount of contact. Some
   have gone a step further, finding that, while PACs play an indisputable
   role in access, the real driver is constituency, or at least salience to
   the district or state from which the Member of Congress hails. Here, we
   present the results of an experiment conducted in the spring and summer
   of 2010, in which one of the authors called the offices of each member
   of the Senate, first as a private citizen and then as a registered
   federal lobbyist, and requested a meeting with each senator to discuss a
   health care bill that had been languishing in committee for some time.
   Unsurprisingly, the registered lobbyist experienced a clear advantage
   over the ordinary citizen, securing 27 meetings compared to just 7 as a
   citizen. The lobbyist was granted more access in other measurable
   categories, although party affiliation or campaign contributions had
   little effect. While previous studies have found strong PAC contribution
   and constituency effects on access, one important fact stands out from
   our experience: only 8 of the 100 Senate offices asked whether the
   lobbyist had an interest in the senator's state, and only 4 of the 27
   who granted meetings did so. Perhaps the assumption that a lobbyist,
   whether inor out-of-state, is a potential source of campaign funds is
   strong enough to override the constituency effect, but we found no
   compelling evidence that membership on relevant committees or a past
   reliance on health sector or lobbyist contributions drove access.
   Rather, it appears as if ` lobbyist' simply works as a magic word when
   requesting access to a Member of Congress, with power beyond the borders
   of a state or district. Although the results of our experiment are
   limited, they do suggest that several questions about citizen and
   lobbyist access to Congress remain and need to be addressed, especially
   given the normative assumption that Members of Congress should represent
   the people they serve.},

Abstract = {Nikolas Rose and Carlos Novas use the term biological citizenship
   broadly to describe the increasing connectivity of biological categories
   of citizens' identities. In line with Rose and Novas, social scientists
   use biological citizenship today to describe the emergence of citizens'
   rights to protection and their increased mobilization around biology as
   a claim to active citizenship. In this article, I critically engage with
   the conception of biological citizenship forwarded by Rose and Novas,
   and detail the ways in which this concept is more complex and less
   emancipatory than is often assumed - especially in today's neoliberal
   age. Drawing on the example of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination
   promotion in Canada, I elucidate the intricacies and complex techniques
   that are often involved in citizenship projects. Specifically, I
   position HPV vaccination biocitizenship as a biopolitical tool, and pay
   close attention to the forms of knowledge, practical mechanisms, and
   types of authoritative bodies that frame biological risks for HPV and
   bioidentities in gendered ways. It is hoped that, through this example,
   the scope of biocitizenship can be expanded to encompass more than the
   rights and entitlements of citizens in relation to their biologies. I
   conclude by offering insights into theorizing emerging neoliberal
   biocitizenship projects today.},

Title = {Policy framing and denizen enfranchisement in Portugal: why some migrant
   voters are more equal than others},
Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},
Year = {2013},

Number = {6-7},
Pages = {852-872},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {The enfranchisement of non-citizens across different democracies has
   been mostly approached at with macro-explanations that propose national
   traditions of citizenship or transnational influences as remote causes,
   leading researchers to explain variation through some fuzzy balancing of
   the two. This article joins the more recent literature focusing on the
   meso-level, particularly on political discourses on denizen
   enfranchisement, to examine the deviating case of Portugal, based both
   on strict reciprocity and on differentiating clauses that divide
   non-citizen migrants into different universes of voters and non-voters.
   Such a case allows theoretical refinement of process-based and
   discursive approaches on denizen enfranchisement and shows that it
   succeeded in Portugal when parliamentarians framed it as a symbolically
   generous but practically restricted move that promised prestige gains
   vis-a-vis Europe and Portuguese emigrants.},

Abstract = {Research on contemporary party organization emphasizes the growing power
   of the party in public office (PPO). The relationship between the
   external party organization and the PPO, however, is rarely analysed
   directly. We argue that the capacity of the extra-parliamentary party to
   regularly extract a fixed share from their MPs' salaries - the
   collection of party taxes' or tithes' - can give us insights into the
   level and the nature of control the external organization exercises over
   MPs within and across organizational levels. Beyond providing new
   insights into an under-researched, but generally widespread, source of
   party funding across 25 parties in five Westminster democracies, the
   study shows the following: while party family shapes a party's basic
   capacity to establish an intra-organizational rule that obliges MPs to
   regularly contribute parts of their salary, ideology drives the salary
   share a party can expect MPs to pay. The federal-unitary divide affects
   whether the national or the regional organizations are the main
   recipients of these contributions.},

Abstract = {Research indicates that, when engaging their opponents, strategic
   candidates will draw (and redraw) lines of conflict, pulling attention
   to their advantaged topics. But do these expectations hold up in
   debates, where candidates are at the mercy of those asking the
   questions? And do strategic debate behaviors matter? This study draws on
   past literature to hypothesize the specific types of agenda-control
   behaviors we should see in debates. These hypotheses are tested in the
   2008 presidential debates, using quantitative content analysis to
   examine candidate agenda setting, issue framing, and tone. The results
   show that both Obama and McCain used all three means of agenda control
   to continually displace the line of conflict in their favor. These
   findings offer empirical support for theories of strategic agenda
   control and heighten our understanding of agenda setting, framing, and
   tone as agenda-control mechanisms. Additionally, media and public
   opinion data suggest these debate agenda-control behaviors had real
   effects during the 2008 election.},

Abstract = {The selection of party leaders in Germany has traditionally been
   characterised by elite agreement behind closed doors. Most often, only
   one single candidate was presented to the conference delegates. Yet
   things have changed to some degree since the 1990s. First, most parties
   have introduced statutory reforms at the national level allowing for
   intra-party plebiscites. At the national level, this has basically
   remained paperwork. Second, and more interesting for the purposes of
   this paper, similar reforms have been introduced at the Land level. In
   an increasing number of cases, Land parties have chosen their party
   leader or top candidate for Land elections via grassroots participation.
   What have been the motives for opening up selection procedures and
   giving members a say? The article points to electoral images and elite
   stalemates as main drivers of this development. It shows that party
   primaries contain elements of uncertainty about outcomes which make
   party elites hesitant to make more extensive use of membership ballots.},

Abstract = {Recognising that the world into which students emerge upon graduation is
   characterised by constant change, we embrace a critical pedagogy that
   can be implemented in the classroom through the use of freehand drawing.
   Freehand drawing is a technique that can stimulate a critical stance, as
   visual representations allow us to comprehend the world differently,
   while permitting us see how others understand the world. First year
   students, in their first lecture, were asked to draw their
   interpretations of Irish politics and to explain in writing what they
   had drawn. The students were then placed in groups and asked to note
   what they saw in each other's drawings, allowing for the identification
   of general patterns and themes. In this context, freehand drawing
   facilitates our ability to: `see' how we understand a topic and that
   there are multiple ways of understanding; test theories, orthodoxies and
   accepted truths; scrutinise tacit assumptions; and ponder other
   possibilities. In employing freehand drawing in this manner, our aim is
   to create a learning environment where students develop their capacity
   for critical self-reflection.},

Abstract = {Measures taken by the EU's major decision-makers in order to confront
   the public debt crisis provide evidence that the EU's constitutional
   nature has been changed. This compound political community whose
   legitimacy was based on the fine balance between the need to establish
   more European unity and the need to preserve political autonomy of
   member states, is now gradually transforming into an imperial, centre -
   periphery model of governance. The author analyses this development in
   the light of the guardian of the constitution concept, developed in the
   works of Benjamin Constant and Carl Schmitt. Regardless of changes of
   socio-historical circumstances, the guardian of the constitution's
   fundamental task is to determine the point that must not be surpassed if
   the legitimacy of a political community is to be maintained. In the
   context of the European integration process the question ``Who is the
   guardian of the constitution?{''} has deliberately been sidestepped.
   That strategy, which has proven to be functionally rather successful,
   has been pushing the EU towards its current systemic crisis. Long
   absence of a guardian of the European treaties/constitution has
   eventually confronted the member states with the choice between refusing
   to obey the centre's decisions and conceding of the responsibility for
   their citizens' welfare to the European proto-imperial order. The empire
   concept used in this article is normatively neutral, used only as a
   possible theoretical framework for explaining the new empirical reality
   of the European integration process.},

Title = {The fate of governing parties in times of economic crisis},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {32},
Number = {3},
Pages = {494-499},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The severity of the recent economic crisis in Europe provides an
   opportunity to test some of the conventional hypotheses about the
   effects of economic adversity on election outcomes in a broadly
   comparative context. In 16 of 27 elections held in EU member countries
   between 2008 and the end of 2011, incumbent governments went down to
   defeat. In many of the cases in which a governing party was defeated, a
   government of the center-left was replaced by one of the center-right.
   The average level of decline in the share of the vote for governing
   parties (-8.1\%) however was surprisingly modest in comparison with
   previous election cycles. Nevertheless, the results were devastating for
   governing parties in a number of instances, such as Ireland or Hungary.
   We also consider the relative merits of retrospective and prospective
   interpretations of these outcomes in the light of contextual effects
   arising from factors such as globalization and institutional clarity as
   these affect perceptions of the responsibility of governing parties or
   coalitions in coping with the crisis in the domestic political
   environment. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This essay examines how two Jefferson biographies represented the Thomas
   Jefferson-Sally Hemings relationship in the post-civil rights movement
   era: Fawn Brodie's Thomas Jefferson (1974), a controversial publication
   that claimed that Hemings and Jefferson loved each other, and Joseph
   Ellis's American Sphinx (1996), one of the last mainstream biographies
   to deny that they had any children together. The story in both cases
   serves as an allegory of founding authority and national membership. The
   author finds that Ellis and Brodie characterize Jefferson as a fallible
   founder to affirm that founding ideals can accommodate and overcome
   racial differences and injustices.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {32},
Number = {3},
Pages = {529-535},

Abstract = {This article asks if, when, and why different groups of voters behave
   differently in the wake of economic downturns. We examine two Swedish
   elections (1994 and 2010) that were held just after two deep recessions
   (the financial crisis of 1991-1993 and the 2008-2009 Great Recession).
   We find that group differences were much larger in 2010 than they were
   in 1994. After the 1991-1993 recession, the government's electoral
   support declined across the board. In 2010, there were large differences
   between voters with low economic status (who were unlikely to support
   the government) and voters with high economic status (who were likely to
   do so). Our findings suggest that group differences in electoral
   behavior after an economic downturn depend on contextual differences
   across elections. We argue that future research should pay close
   attention to the magnitude of economic shocks, the development of asset
   prices (especially real estate), and changes in social policy. (C) 2013

Abstract = {Why are the leaders in some U.S.-style legislatures more influential
   than others? This study uses individual-level data on lawmakers'
   perceptions of their leaders' influence to test three general theories
   of legislative power delegation: legislative leaders have no real power,
   simple collective action theory, and Conditional Party Government
   theory. These perceptions of speakers' legislative influence are modeled
   with varying intercept, multilevel, ordered probit models. The analyses
   strongly support the simple collective action problem explanation of
   legislative leadership influence, in particular suggesting that
   collective problems caused by the internal dynamics of the legislative
   process drive the delegation of influence to leaders.},

Abstract = {The allegiance of national bureaucratic elites to European, national,
   institutional and policy-specific identities or associations is the
   subject of a growing body of European integration literature. Reviewing
   the methods employed by committee governance research, Q methodology is
   suggested as an alternative mechanism for measuring bureaucrat norms,
   beliefs and values. Its application to research on European committee
   governance could therefore increase the robustness of the qualitative
   element of existing mixed methods approaches. This would provide further
   insight into policy-making processes at the international level.},

Abstract = {This article sets two of Hoffmann's satiric fairy-tales, ``Little Zaches
   acclaimed as Zinnober{''} (1819) and ``Master Flea{''} (1822), in their
   socio-political context of post-Napoleonic Europe. It identifies them as
   political allegories through which Hoffmann comments on the instability
   of western European politics in the early nineteenth century. We
   demonstrate how Hoffmann's position as a Prussian state judge informed
   his propensity for satirical observation couched in the genre of
   fairy-tale and variations thereof. We explore his scrutiny of hypocrisy,
   pride and nepotism, together with his particular focus on received
   ideas, such as Enlightenment rationalist principles. Concomitantly, we
   examine how he reworks familiar fairy-tale motifs in order to expose the
   effects of political repression. We compare the lampoon of his
   contemporary, Friedrich Ludwig Jahn (founder of the Open Air Gymnasium
   Movement) in ``Little Zaches{''}, with his satirization of Privy
   Councillor von Kamptz (Director of Prussian Military Police) as
   Councillor Knarrpanti in ``Master Flea{''}, the first fairy-tale causing
   wry amusement, but the second leading to a high profile libel case. We
   align with Zipes's argument that Hoffmann's fairy-tales demonstrate
   connections between history, politics and the fairy-tale, and we show
   how Hoffmann's revisioning of fairy-tale motifs mediates political
   satire. We extend Zipes by emphasizing Hoffmann's use of the
   increasingly popular Oriental, and especially Arabian, tale. This
   article concludes that Hoffmann contributed significantly to the
   critical acclaim of the satiric fairy-tale, and that his loss of
   literary judgement in ``Master Flea{''} accounts for the legal
   consequences which he suffered.},

Volume = {19},

Abstract = {The outbidding model of ethnic party competition predicts that ethnic
   parties adopt radical strategies to maximize support among voters of an
   ethnic group. In contrast, this article argues that ethnic parties have
   a wider range of strategies at their disposal. Integrating recent
   findings, ethnic party strategies are defined by the criteria of appeal
   and policy position as static bidding, ethnic underbidding, ethnic
   outbidding, lateral bidding, lateral underbidding' and lateral
   outbidding. Empirically, a comparison of strategies adopted by ethnic
   parties competing for votes of the Hungarian and Bosniak minorities in
   Serbia shows variance of strategies within and across groups despite an
   environment conducive to outbidding and while holding institutional
   context factors constant. Factors causing this variance are explored
   through content analysis of 18 semi-structured interviews with ethnic
   party elites. An explanation that links strategies to parties' goals and
   the incentives of the structure of intra- and inter-ethnic competition
   is suggested for further research.},

Abstract = {Theoretical work on taxation and state-building borrows heavily from
   early modern European experience. While a number of European states
   increased centralized tax revenues during this period, for others
   revenues stagnated or even declined and these variations have motivated
   alternative arguments for the determinants of fiscal and state capacity.
   This study reviews the arguments concerning the three determinants that
   have received most attention, namely warfare, economic structure, and
   political regime, and tests them by making use of a new and
   comprehensive tax revenue dataset. Our main finding is that these three
   determinants worked in interaction with each other. Specifically, when
   under pressure of war, it was representative regimes in more
   urbanized-commercial economies and authoritarian regimes in more
   rural-agrarian economies that tended to better aggregate domestic
   interests towards state-building.},

Abstract = {Scholars of environmental citizenship have often drawn attention to the
   spatial mismatch between ecological systems and nation-states, arguing
   that citizenship needs to be scaled up to meet global environmental
   challenges. I argue that rethinking the scale of ecopolitical engagement
   requires moving beyond a simple spatial hierarchy topped by the global'.
   Debates in human geography lead us towards a relational conception of
   space, where densely networked interactions produce dynamic and
   multi-layered configurations of actors. Supplementing this perspective
   with political-ecological and post-humanist theories of human-nature
   interaction, citizenship can be understood as a process of political
   becoming within shifting assemblages of socio-ecological relationships.
   The second half of the analysis deploys this theoretical perspective to
   narrate three vignettes that locate nature's citizens in a diversity of
   socio-ecological contexts, debates and conflicts in Latin America.
   Drawing on regional scholarship, these vignettes examine the political
   ecology of citizenship in relation to water, climate governance and the
   struggles of indigenous peoples.},

Abstract = {This article explores the connections between two literature pieces
   written by Niccolo Machiavelli: The Prince and The Mandrake. Despite a
   noticeable distance between the contents of a political treaty and a
   theater play, we will argue that the Machiavellian concept of virtue and
   its link with goddess Fortuna is a recurrent concept in both pieces. The
   battle between personal will and fate is always recurrent in
   Machiavelli's work without having to take into account his writing
   style. This battle is one of the most remarkable issues in the
   occidental world. Machiavelli (re) created a new conscience of European
   politics in the 16th century: the individual's Prevalence over the
   community; of the calculated rationality over destiny; of science over
   tradition. In both The Prince and The Mandrake a political and cultural
   model can be found. This model convered over the Old World, and it
   obtained the well known victories in the name of freedom, equality, and
   democracy.},

Abstract = {There are increasing calls for parliamentary select committees to take
   on additional tasks, becoming more involved in the legislative process
   with the aim of enhancing scrutiny of the executive. Analysis of the
   role of the Commons Welsh Affairs Select Committee in the process of
   devolving additional powers to the National Assembly for Wales under the
   Government of Wales Act (GoWA) 2006 highlights some of the challenges
   that select committees face in undertaking such work, particularly in a
   complex constitutional context where the aims of scrutiny are subject to
   conflicting interpretations. Although the referendum result in Wales on
   3 March 2011 and the consequent coming into effect of Part 4 of the GoWA
   have rendered the Legislative Competence Order procedure largely
   obsolete, there are also lessons to be drawn from the Welsh Affairs
   Committees experiences in the 20052010 Parliament about the role of
   select committees in providing a bridge between the devolved
   legislatures of the UK and Westminster.},

Abstract = {The objective of this research is to determine citizen's participation
   influence on marginalization levels at Michoacan's state municipalities.
   To that aim an econometric model is developed, the analysis includes
   variables such as the degree of participation and the marginalization
   index, reported by the 113 Michoacan's state municipalities. The results
   reveal that those municipalities with a wide or very wide participation
   showed progress in municipal marginalization index, thus confirming the
   positive impact that citizen participation has on people's life quality
   improvement. Finally, based on these results, a proposal to implement
   participatory budgeting is included, the proposal intent to enhance
   municipal government performance and, therefore, ameliorate people's
   living conditions.},

   and began their state building on the wave of democratic enthusiasm by
   the general public. Majority of those countries entered into European
   Union a decade ago as consolidated well-working democracies, although
   public trust in democratic political institutions has been on the slow
   decline since gaining independence, only to drop substantially more
   after global economic crisis hit countries of Central and Eastern Europe
   in 2009. Authors are analysing trends in (dis)trust levels in key
   political institutions in Central and Eastern European EU member
   countries, and comparing the results with other EU member states.},

   Americans who do not think of themselves primarily as American, who

   acculturated are more likely than others to prefer coethnic

Abstract = {From 1789 to 1913, U.S. senators were indirectly elected by state
   legislatures; this electoral mechanism ostensibly girded U.S. senators
   against the instability of public opinion and insulated them from direct
   public pressures. The adoption of the 17th Amendment in 1913 replaced
   this system with the direct election of senators. In this article, we
   use an original data set of recorded ballots for U.S. Senate elections
   in state legislatures from 1871 to 1913 to illustrate the dynamics of
   indirect elections. Our broad goal is to identify components of the
   process that shed light on who was elected to the Senate under this type
   of electoral system and how indirect elections fared as a mechanism of
   representation. We find significant evidence that under the indirect
   electoral mechanism, Senate elections were contentious, and winning
   majority control of the state legislature did not always ensure an easy
   electoral process. Specifically, the breakdown of caucus nominating
   processes, the size of majority coalitions, and whether the incumbent
   senator was running for reelection each exerted an effect on the
   probability of conflict in the indirect election process.},

Abstract = {Councillor retention is an issue that has been largely neglected in
   recent academic literature despite being a present concern for
   policymakers in the field and those involved in the practice of local
   politics. This article utilises original data to consider the dropout
   patterns of councillors in greater detail, particularly with regard to
   sex. It confirms the finding of the existing literature that women are
   more likely to drop out of local politics than men and then goes further
   than previous work to examine reasons as to why this might be the case
   and to introduce data looking at the future political intentions of
   councillors after they have stood down. Evidence is found that, having
   stood down from their council duties, women councillors are less likely
   to want to remain politically involved than their male colleagues.},

Title = {The Legal Concept of Liberal Reforms in Russia (Through the Example of
   Federalism Reform and Higher Education Reform)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS AND LAW},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {6},
Number = {2},
Pages = {168-177},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The intensification of Russian citizens' political activities after
   December 2011 has simplified the process of political parties'
   registration and led to the creation of the Opposition Coordination
   Council. The analysis of the Council's functioning proves that it
   doesn't carries out the real coordination of all the opposition forces'
   actions. This is because the Council consists of politicians whose views
   differ too much. The impossibility of working out a common opposition
   strategy requires the development of a unified political program of
   opposition politicians who have similar convictions.
   In these conditions the development of this program is needed for
   liberal politicians who mutually understand the necessity to build in
   Russia a democratic legal state, in which human rights would be
   observed. The article draws attention to some approximate structural
   elements of such a political program of the union of liberal parties.
   The author thoroughly analyzes two issues: federalism reform and
   education reform.
   The revival of Russian federalism is supposed to include at least three
   lists of arrangements: renewal of budgetary federalism, i.e. the
   increase of regional budget revenues collected in its territory;
   political reorganization of regional managerial human resources
   including the revival of the institute of election of all governors and
   the determination of their performance quality characteristics regulated
   by the civil society. Third, this is the reform of the existing
   distribution of matters of competence and powers between the center and
   regions according to the sectoral factor. In this sense, the experience
   of the federative state of Canada can be used. The distribution of
   powers between the center and regions there is carried out not according
   to the sectoral factor, like in Russia, but according to the types of
   activity having either central or regional importance.
   Education reform that is currently under way in Russia causes a series
   of negative consequences connected with the growth of educational
   process bureaucratization, reduction in financing for universities,
   their groundless enlargement, lack of objective criteria for evaluation
   of students' knowledge, and creation of the atmosphere of insecurity of
   the future. In this regard, the liberal concept involves the release of
   lecturers from paper work, election of state universities' rectors and
   rating system allowing taking into account the scientific and methodical
   contribution of each lecturer to the process of students' education,
   increase in financing for lecturers' salaries depending on their
   position in the higher educational institution's rating, and increase in

Abstract = {A number of societal and institutional factors enhance the development
   of a vibrant civil society, such as a country's socioeconomic traditions
   and societal structure, political institutions, or foreign influence.
   But the question of which one of these factors contributes most to a
   vibrant civil society still remains unanswered. Using ordinary least
   square techniques, this article statistically tests the competing
   factors with a large-N design that includes 42 countries. Our dependent
   variable is the new Civil Society Index, composed of a structural and a
   value dimension of civil society. The results show that a country's
   quality of political institutions and a high degree of religious
   fragmentation have the strongest impact on the development of a vibrant
   civil society. In order to examine the causal relationship, we reassess
   our findings by conducting two case studies on Chile and Russia. The
   case studies corroborate the causal direction from the quality of
   political institutions to a stronger civil society.},

Abstract = {Australia faces a complex set of dilemmas in foreign, defence, and
   economic policy. Australian governments have traditionally relied on the
   United States to underwrite the country's defence policies, and have
   regularly demonstrated loyalty to the bilateral strategic alliance. Yet,
   Australia's economic security has become more dependent on China, a
   country with which the US has a competitive relationship. This article
   first reviews theories of competition among great powers. It then
   analyses key factors that are shaping the region and the Australian
   policy environment. It is argued that Australia may have much to gain
   from acting collaboratively with other middle powers within multilateral
   institutions. In this context, Australia may also benefit from a more
   robust recognition of its own distinctive national interest.},

Abstract = {In this article the extent to which political variables can explain the
   behaviour of constitutional judges in Italy when dealing with conflicts
   between the central government and regions is explored. Two competing
   hypotheses are tested. One hypothesis argues that one should expect some
   alignment between the political preferences of the judges and the
   success of the central government primarily due to the appointment
   mechanism. The other hypothesis suggests that there should be no
   systematic alignment between the political preferences of the judges and
   the success of the central government. Unlike previous literature, the
   empirical results presented in this article seem to confirm that when
   the Rapporteur and the court's majority are allegedly affiliated with
   the Prime Minister's coalition, the odds of success of the Prime
   Minister go up.},

Title = {Economic Policy Voting and Incumbency: Unemployment in Western Europe},
Journal = {POLITICAL SCIENCE RESEARCH AND METHODS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {1},
Number = {1},
Pages = {53-66},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The economic voting literature has been dominated by the incumbency-
   oriented hypothesis, in which voters reward or punish governments at the
   ballot box according to the nation's economic performance. The
   alternative (policy-oriented) hypothesis, in which voters favor parties
   that are closest to their issue position(s), has been neglected in this
   literature. This article explores policy voting with respect to an
   archetypal economic policy issue-unemployment. Voters who favor lower
   unemployment should tend to vote for left parties, since they `'own''
   the issue. Examining a large time-series cross-sectional pool of Western
   European nations, this study finds some evidence for economic policy
   voting. However, it is conditioned by incumbency. According to varied
   tests, left incumbents experience a net electoral cost if the
   unemployment rate climbs. Incumbency, then, serves to break any natural
   economic policy advantage that might accrue to the left due to the issue
   of unemployment.},

Abstract = {In this study, I use a computerized experiment to test whether elected
   officials differ from everyday citizens in how they use information to
   make political choices. Ninety state and local level elected officials
   took part in the study, as did 179 adults from the general population. I
   tracked participants' information use as they attempted to solve two
   hypothetical public policy problems. The data show that while elected
   officials differ from everyday citizens in their demographics and in the
   consistency of their political views, these groups did not differ
   systematically in their depth of information search, their proclivity to
   compare choice alternatives, or their depth of information processing.
   These findings held across two different public policy scenarios,
   controlling for differences in political knowledge, education, and
   elective experience. In addition to opening a new methodological
   frontier for the study of political elites, these results accelerate an
   ongoing debate between Burkeian paternalists and advocates of a more
   populist democracy.},

Abstract = {We analyze the effect of redrawn constituents on incumbent vote shares
   in Georgia U.S. House elections from 1992 to 2006. The Georgia General
   Assembly redrew the congressional boundaries for the 2006 midterm and
   the new lines redistributed approximately 31\% of residents into
   districts with a different incumbent than the one representing them in
   2004. With the use of Voting Tabulation District (VTD) data, we use a
   hierarchical model to evaluate the effect these redrawn constituents had
   on their new incumbent's vote share. We find a consistent pattern: both
   Democratic and Republican incumbents experienced significant reductions
   in their vote shares as a consequence of the redrawn VTDs placed in
   their districts. The short-term political climate featuring a national
   Democratic tide and a simultaneous statewide trend favoring the Grand
   Old Party (GOP) helps to explain this finding. With offsetting partisan
   conditions, the incumbency advantage came to the fore as Georgia U.S.
   House members, irrespective of party affiliation, performed better among
   the constituents they retained prior to redistricting. Our findings for
   the 2006 election run counter to the significant Republican
   redistricting advantage prevailing in Georgia congressional contests
   from 1992 to 2004.},

Abstract = {The cross-sectional variation among state legislative leaders' formal
   powers provides a unique opportunity to test a variety of hypotheses of
   the American legislative process that involve the causes and effects of
   these powers. But to date, measures of these powers have been developed
   primarily for single years or biennia, limiting their applicability,
   especially for drawing causal conclusions. In this note, I develop an
   index of state House speakers' formal powers for each biennia from 1981
   to 2010 (for even-year-election states) and from 1982 to 2009 (for
   odd-year-election states).},

Abstract = {Little is known about political polarization in German public opinion.
   This article offers an issue-based perspective and explores trends of
   opinion polarization in Germany. Public opinion polarization is
   conceptualized and measured as alignment of attitudes. Data from the
   German General Social Survey (1980 to 2010) comprise attitudes towards
   manifold issues, which are classified into several dimensions. This
   study estimates multilevel models that reveal general and issue-as well
   as dimension-specific levels and trends in attitude alignment for both
   the whole German population and sub-groups. It finds that public opinion
   polarization has decreased over the last three decades in Germany. In
   particular, highly educated and more politically interested people have
   become less polarized over time. However, polarization seems to have
   increased in attitudes regarding gender issues. These findings provide
   interesting contrasts to existing research on the American public.},

Abstract = {This article is a study of political economy of Gujarat in the context
   of the issues pertaining to `good governance'. The article reviews
   Gujarat's socio-economic development with respect to key indicators of
   environment, health, education and welfare programmes. It presents an
   argument that overall economic growth alone is not the adequate
   criterion for assessing good governance. Rather, broader issues of human
   development, reach and depth of welfare programmes and the approach
   informing the economic policy constitute the core bases for the
   assessment of a state's claims to good governance. Gujarat, one of the
   states of the Indian union, is seen as a developed state that has made
   considerable progress in more recent times in the direction of good
   governance. This article seeks to critically examine this impression.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to provide the basis for a theory of
   imperialism that is consonant with open Marxism. The paper argues that
   accounts of imperialism heretofore have been contingent and focused on
   the appearance of imperialism, and spent little time considering its
   essence as a manifestation of the state's power and desire to maintain
   the circuit of capital both nationally and internationally. The paper
   seeks to show that open Marxism is well placed to achieve this, and to
   move towards an idea of an open Marxist theory of imperialism.},

Abstract = {In recent years, relations between China and Bolivia have increased. On
   the one hand, China has scaled up positions as a Bolivian trading
   partner; in particular, the Asian giant has continued to be one of the
   major contributors to Bolivian mineral and energy industries. On the
   other hand, Bolivia has increased its exportations to China by selling
   products-mainly raw materials-including minerals such as raw tin ore,
   tin, silver, zinc, lead, and antimony and hydrocarbons and lithium
   carbonate, used to produce electric vehicle batteries. The fact that
   Bolivia is increasing its mineral sales to China could be considered
   good news; Bolivia is rich in natural mineral and energy resources, but
   it is a country with poorly distributed wealth, and most of its
   indigenous and poor population is located in the Potosi region, where
   lithium is being extracted. This article will shed light on the
   potential negative socioeconomic and environmental effects that lithium
   extraction may have on these communities.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {We analyze the effect of municipal financial transparency on the
   magnitude of political budget cycles. Our sample covers the Spanish
   largest municipalities in the period 1999-2009. While the impact of
   transparency on the electoral cycle has been studied at the
   international and regional level, there is no empirical evidence of its
   effect at the local level. Using the financial transparency index made
   by Transparency International Spain, we show that municipalities with
   lower levels of financial transparency present an electoral cycle in
   total spending, whereas such an electoral impact on total spending does
   not appear in high transparent municipalities. Furthermore, the
   magnitude of cycles in capital spending and taxes does not vary among
   low-transparency municipalities and high-transparency municipalities.},

Abstract = {In the past twenty years, the CDU's perspective on gender issues has
   changed radically. Although the CDU has not become a feminist party, it
   has significantly modified its former stances on gender issues mostly in
   a progressive direction. The presence of female party chair and
   Chancellor Angela Merkel is the most obvious change, but the party has
   shifted its position in many other areas as well. The CDU adopted a
   gender quorum' in the mid-1990s, which has been partially successful at
   increasing women's representation within the party. Under the Grand
   Coalition the CDU-led government backed reforms to the parental leave
   law, linking payments to prior salary and explicitly encouraging fathers
   to take time off. The Grand Coalition also significantly increased child
   care for children under 3. Merkel did not initiate the party's
   modernisation, and in many cases these changes date back to the 1980s.
   Merkel has accelerated the pace of change, however. The CDU's reforms in
   gendered issue areas are quite popular with female voters and the party
   is gaining ground with women of all age groups.},

Abstract = {The assumed difference and continuing estrangement between political
   philosophy and political science is a relatively recent development.
   Both fields sprang from closely entwined concerns about democracy and
   matters of social and political justice, and today both must still
   confront their practical as well as cognitive relationship to their
   subject matter. This issue, however, has receded into the background of
   these discourses. Ludwig Wittgenstein's vision of philosophy is in
   effect a vision of social inquiry. His work, when viewed from this
   perspective, prompts us to reconsider the logical status of various
   modes of political inquiry: how can these practices, descriptively and
   normatively, do justice to their subject matter? How can they deal with
   such foundational issues as the nature of social phenomena, the concepts
   of representation and interpretation, the problem of knowledge of other
   minds and what is involved in making explanatory and evaluative
   judgments about the objects of inquiry? Contemporary Political Theory

Abstract = {Three great waves of seizing power and founding states mark communism's
   basic history. At the zenith of its expansion in 1980, one-third of
   humanity lived in communist political orders. They differed enormously
   in terms of history, socio-economics, and politics. This disparity makes
   it difficult to explain the rise and dynamics of communism coherently.
   What distinguishes communist parties and political orders from all other
   historically known systems is their ``totalitarian{''} character. They
   aimed at the entirety of all social relations and resorted to a form of
   terror that was not only directed against society, but at the same time
   assumed ``auto-terrorist{''} traits. This distinguishes communist
   regimes from fascist ones. The terrorist fury cannot be derived from the
   ideas in the classics of Marxism nor explained by the character of
   political leaders. The sources of this compulsive totalisation and the
   terrorist auto-destruction of communist regimes can be derived only from
   the intrinsic conditions of each of these systems of organising society
   and wielding power.},

Abstract = {Presidents have the power to nominate the top ranks of the executive
   branch and they use it toward their own goals. Presidents need a mixture
   of experienced and loyal officers to promote bureaucratic competence and
   responsiveness, and advance their policies within the executive branch,
   but scholars' focus has often been senatorial obstructionism rather than
   when presidents prefer loyal nominees and experienced nominees. This
   study uses a sample of 573 subcabinet nominations between 1961 and 2006,
   and relates presidents' nominee choices to their policy priorities and
   departmental jurisdictions. It finds that presidents nominate
   significantly more loyalists and fewer experienced officers to higher
   priority departments, indicating the importance of responsiveness, as
   well as their suspicion of experienced officers. Presidents select more
   experienced nominees for lower priority departments to assure competence
   where they are least concerned with responsiveness. Furthermore, it
   finds that increased Senate ideological opposition has no significant
   effect on presidents' selections.},

Abstract = {The 3/11 combined disaster in Japan focused both Japanese civil society
   and government decision makers on the issue of nuclear power Whereas
   surveys over the post-war period indicated that many Japanese supported
   the growing. role of nuclear power in Japan's overall energy policy, the
   current crisis has resulted in a sea-change in public opinion. Even
   though some scholars have depicted Japanese civil society as
   comparatively weak and poorly organized, the disaster has stimulated
   citizen science, prompted large protests, and spurred many to challenge
   governmental authority. This article investigates the ways that Japan's
   relatively stable patterns of state-and-civil-society relations have
   been reconfigured as a result of the Tohoku disaster Polity (2013)

Abstract = {As Sri Lanka's civil war escalated in the spring of 2009, protests led
   by the Sri Lankan Tamil diaspora in Toronto appealed for an immediate
   ceasefire agreement between the Sri Lankan government and the Liberation
   Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). Held simultaneously in Chennai, London,
   and Oslo, the protests called for an end to the hostilities in Sri Lanka
   as well as recognition of the legitimacy of Tamil Eelam, a separate
   nation state for Tamils in Sri Lanka. Based on interviews and media
   coverage in Toronto, this article investigates how these immigrant
   protests' constituted transnational acts of citizenship'. I examine the
   Toronto protests through three acts in the protest that challenged the
   exclusions of national citizenship by moving from Toronto's streets,
   statist discourses of Canadian citizenship, and the violence of war in
   Sri Lanka. Although these transnational acts of citizenship were
   rendered inaudible in public culture, the article concludes by exploring
   the possibilities of citizenship and belonging in the Sri Lankan Tamil
   diaspora following the defeat of the LTTE.},

   activities at his own and sole proposal. The Public Ministry must be
   capable to accomplish its proactive constitutional mission -not reactive
   as the Judge's- defending legality and public interest since the initial
   phase; as the faculty to hold charges during the trial belongs to the
   Public Ministry. Compared to more executive or judiciary public ministry
   models, the Spanish Public Ministry ``impartiality collectively

Abstract = {While scholars have illuminated the effects of mass incarceration, the
   origins of the criminal justice policies that produced these outcomes
   remain unclear. Many explanations obscure as much as they reveal-in
   great measure because they either ignore or minimize the consequences of
   crime. Emphasizing the exploitation of white fears, the construction of
   black criminality, or the political strategies of Republican political
   elites, prevailing theories ignore black crime victims. In order to
   excavate the historical roots of the modern carceral state, this study
   traces the development of New York State's Rockefeller drug laws. Rather
   than beginning in Albany, this history focuses on Harlem, a community
   hit hardest by rising crime rates and drug addiction. Drawing upon a
   variety of primary sources, this study traces how African American
   activists framed and negotiated the incipient drug problem in their
   neighborhoods and interrogates the policy prescriptions they attached to
   indigenously constructed frames. It describes how middle-class African
   Americans facing the material threats of crime and crime-related
   problems drew upon the moral content of indigenous class categories to
   understand these threats and develop policy prescriptions. It reveals
   how the black middle class shaped the development of this punitive
   policy and played a crucial role in the development of mass
   incarceration.},

Abstract = {There are many reasons why political parties can take the racial and
   ethnic minority voters for granted in Britain. They vote overwhelmingly
   and loyally for the left-wing parties, have fewer resources than white
   voters and they mostly live in geographical clusters giving them
   electoral leverage in a limited number of seats. Yet, minorities
   participate as much as the white population and seem to do more so in
   areas of ethnic concentration. Using the British Election Study, Ethnic
   Minorities British Election Study, British campaign spending data and
   the electoral agents survey from 2010 election, we explore the
   relationship between party campaigning, individual mobilisation and
   ethnic population density. We find that although minorities perceive
   less contact, parties campaign just as hard (or harder) in areas of
   minority concentration and they target minority voters in these areas,
   However, minority voters living outside of local concentrations of
   population may experience less contact from parties.},

Pages = {297-311},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This article makes two sets of observations about the moral bases of
   opposition to nuclear power First, the article distinguishes between
   survivalist opposition to nuclear power (built on a conviction that the
   central moral fact about nuclear power is the cataclysmic threat it
   represents) and a more political opposition that focuses on matters of
   justice and democratic equality Second, the article notes that the
   tension between these two styles of moral reasoning reflects a more
   general tension in the environmental movement as a whole. The movement
   against nuclear power therefore provides an illustration writ small for
   why environmentalists would do well not to rest their politics entirely
   on claims about human (and broader ecosystem) survival. Polity (2013)

Journal = {PS-POLITICAL SCIENCE \& POLITICS},

Volume = {46},

Pages = {313-323},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The arrival of Hurricane Sandy within a week of the 2012 presidential
   election caused unprecedented disruption to the final days of the
   campaign and Election Day in areas that were affected. The precise
   impact of the storm on those areas hit hardest was not necessarily
   clear. Contrary to prior research on the effect of disasters on
   electoral outcomes, we find that the president's vote share was
   ultimately increased in storm-affected areas by about four percentage
   points, plus or minus two points. While those states most heavily
   affected were unlikely to give their electoral vote to Romney because of
   other factors, we present counterfactual analyses that show that such a
   storm could have had a significant impact on swing states: although the
   storm only affected some areas, we show that Virginia would likely have
   been won by Romney were it not hit at all, whereas North Carolina would
   likely have gone for Obama had it been directly in the storm's path.},

   Policy},

Year = {2013},
Volume = {11},

Abstract = {The so-called ``subprime mortgage crisis{''} has led to intense scrutiny
   of American housing policy, mortgage finance, and even the goods of
   homeownership. Some critics allege that the housing bubble and ensuing
   financial crisis were consequences of misguided state intervention,
   while others contend that the sources of the crisis lay in the
   pathologies of unregulated markets. Both sides, however, treat the
   crisis and its underlying causes primarily through an economic lens of
   cost-benefit analysis. Building on the insights of contemporary
   political theorists and the new institutionalism in political science,
   we consider American housing policy from the vantage of virtue theory.
   Not only is housing and mortgage policy inevitably normative, but public
   policy can be an important tool in fostering what we call the ``subprime
   virtues{''} of truth-telling, promise-keeping, frugality, moderation,
   commitment, foresight, and judgment that are absolute prerequisites for
   any decent society.},

Abstract = {The relative share of different regions in state income and the division
   of state expenditure between the capital and the countrysides are among
   the most divisive issues in Icelandic rural policy discourse. This
   discourse reflects a diversity of attitudes towards social justice and
   the different interests of different areas. However, there is very
   little research into the geographical distribution of state expenditures
   across regions, despite heated arguments over the substantial interests
   at stake. This research focuses on state expenditures in the Northeast
   district of Iceland based on the 2011 state budget and additional
   information collected among various institutions and ministries. Results
   show that government activities in the east Northland are 11\% less than
   predicted by population or the equivalent of 74 thousand ISK per
   inhabitant per year. Government activities in Eastern Iceland are 23\%
   less than predicted by population or the equivalent of 159 thousand ISK
   per inhabitant per year. Yet the state contributes a similar amount to
   ensure that municipal services are similar in the Northeast and regions
   of the country and to support agriculture in the Northeast region. As an
   independent ``Northeast state{''} the region would have a budget deficit
   of 625 million ISK or 1,2\% of total tax revenues based on current state
   income and expenditure in the region. In comparison the budget deficit
   of the Icelandic state was 7,9\% after financial costs according to the
   2011 state budget. This indicates that a hypothetical, independent
   ``Northeastland{''} could be viable but further research is needed.},

Abstract = {In the framework of academic discussion, it is emerging the necessity to
   deal with the interaction between different inequalities in the public
   policy's design and implementation, being the intersectional approach a
   very interesting theoretical proposal. It has been detected, however,
   that more empiric analysis are needed in order to prove the obstacles
   and advances found in the public policies to implement the
   intersectionality between different inequalities. In this article, we
   analyze recent LGTB equality policies, study in the Catalan case in
   particular, to see how they conceive the relationship between
   inequalities, and to detect which are the main factors that interfere in
   the implementation of a intersectional model.},

Abstract = {Although member states are obliged to transpose directives into domestic
   law in a conformable manner and receive considerable time for their
   transposition activities, we identify three levels of transposition
   outcomes for EU directives: conformable, partially conformable and
   non-conformable. Compared with existing transposition models, which do
   not distinguish between different transposition outcomes, we examine the
   factors influencing each transposition process by means of a competing
   risk analysis. We find that preference-related factors, in particular
   the disagreement of a member state and the Commission regarding a
   directive's outcome, play a much more strategic role than has to date
   acknowledged in the transposition literature. Whereas disagreement of a
   member state delays conformable transposition, it speeds up
   non-conformable transposition. Disagreement of the Commission only
   prolongs the transposition process. We therefore conclude that a
   stronger focus on an effective sanctioning mechanism is warranted for
   safeguarding compliance with directives.},

Abstract = {This paper introduces the mini-symposium on Qualitative Comparative
   Analysis (QCA) and set-theoretic methods, both crisp sets and fuzzy
   sets, and situates the different contributions in a wider methodological
   debate concerning cross-case analysis. The paper argues that QCA is not
   just a set of techniques, but a distinctive research approach, with its
   own goals and set of assumptions. Concerning the wide methodological
   debate, special attention is paid to the added value of QCA and specific
   innovations introduced in the mini-symposium.},

Title = {Where do radical right parties stand? Position blurring in
   multidimensional competition},
Journal = {EUROPEAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-26},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This article questions the utility of assessing radical right party
   placement on economic issues, which has been extensively analyzed in
   academic literature. Starting from the premise that political parties
   have varying strategic stakes in different political issues, the article
   considers political competition in multiple issue dimensions. It
   suggests that political competition is not simply a matter of taking
   positions on political issues, but rather centers on manipulating the
   dimensional structure of politics. The core argument is that certain
   political parties, such as those of the radical right, seek to compete
   on neglected, secondary issues while simultaneously blurring their
   positions on established issues in order to attract broader support.
   Deliberate position blurring - considered costly by the literature - may
   thus be an effective strategy in multidimensional competition. The
   article combines quantitative analyses of electoral manifestos, expert
   placement of political parties, and voter preferences, by studying
   seventeen radical right parties in nine Western European party systems.},

Abstract = {Limited diversity is among the most understudied methodological
   challenges. QCA allows for a more conscious treatment of logical
   remainders than most other comparative methods. The current state of the
   art is the Standard Analysis (Ragin 2008; Ragin and Sonnett 2004). We
   discuss two of its pitfalls, both rooted in the primacy given to
   parsimony. First, the Standard Analysis is no safeguard against
   untenable assumptions. As a remedy, we propose the Enhanced Standard
   Analysis (ESA). Second, researchers should consider including
   theoretically sound counterfactual claims even if they do not contribute
   to parsimony. We label this Theory-Guided Enhanced Standard Analysis
   (TESA).},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {32},
Number = {1},
Pages = {167-173},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This note adapts two models commonly used to estimate the incumbency
   advantage that US members of Congress enjoy - the `slurge' and the
   Gelman-King Index - to provide comparable estimates for UK MPs. The
   results show that Liberal Democrats enjoy extremely large such
   advantages on a par with those of US Congressmen of between 5\% and 15\%
   of the vote. Labour and the Conservatives have incumbency advantages at
   around 2\% and 1\% respectively. The note estimates that effects could
   have changed the outcome in as many as 25 seats in some elections, and
   that they cost the Conservatives the chance to govern alone after the
   2010 election. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In this article I compare the results of Qualitative Comparative
   Analysis (fsQCA) applied to a medium-sized data set on women's
   legislative representation in Asian and Latin American countries to
   those of regression analysis based on the same data set. I find that
   both methods are suboptimal. Explaining the outcome of high women's
   representation, fsQCA suggests complex configurations of conditions with
   low empirical coverage and high sensitivity to coding. While, not
   without shortcomings, OLS regression analysis performs somewhat better
   than fsQCA. On the one hand, this method identifies two statistically
   significant and substantively relevant variables (i.e. quota rules and
   communist regimes), which strongly increase the percentage of women
   deputies. On the other hand, the model's interpretation is not
   completely clear cut, as scholars may disagree over the relevance of the
   one marginally statistically and substantively significant variable, the
   longevity of democracy.},

Abstract = {Over the past 20 years external democracy promotion has become
   increasingly important in the EU. Since the early 2000's it has also
   received growing attention by researchers in the field of Political
   Science. Scientists have developed various models to conceptualize and
   measure external democracy promotion. However, upon closer examination,
   existing models are only partly suitable for comprehensive systematic
   comparative analyses. The aim of this paper is to develop a new
   analytical model that facilitates (1) a comparison of all instruments of
   EU democracy promotion; (2) a precise distinction between as well as an
   exclusive categorization of the various instruments of EU democracy
   promotion and their application in order to be able to take account of
   the specific content of each of these instruments; and (3) the
   consideration of the context of the respective third state when
   assessing the character of the instruments employed. In a second step,
   the model is applied to the exemplary case of EU external democracy
   promotion in Central Asia. The final section summarizes the results of
   this application and concludes with an evaluation of the practicability
   of the analytical model.},

Abstract = {How strong are normative prohibitions on state behavior? We examine this
   question by analyzing anti-nuclear norms, sometimes called the ``nuclear
   taboo,{''} using an original survey experiment to evaluate American
   attitudes regarding nuclear use. We find that the public has only a weak
   aversion to using nuclear weapons and that this aversion has few
   characteristics of an ``unthinkable{''} behavior or taboo. Instead,
   public attitudes about whether to use nuclear weapons are driven largely
   by consequentialist considerations of military utility. Americans'
   willingness to use nuclear weapons increases dramatically when nuclear
   weapons provide advantages over conventional weapons in destroying
   critical targets. Americans who oppose the use of nuclear weapons seem
   to do so primarily for fear of setting a negative precedent that could
   lead to the use of nuclear weapons by other states against the United
   States or its allies in the future.},

Abstract = {A spate of work has demonstrated tensions between ethno-cultural
   diversity and social capital. Some have suggested that attachment to the
   nation can foster cross-group trust, particularly if this national
   self-definition is ``civic{''} in character rather than ``ethnic{''}
   (the Miller thesis). Similarly, others have argued that civic nations
   are less likely to suffer reduced social capital in response to
   increased diversity, as the sense of threat that typically emerges in
   ethnically diverse contexts will be mitigated (the Putnam thesis). The
   authors test these hypotheses on 27 countries using both
   contextual-level data and the latest wave of the European Values Study
   (2008). Though the evidence is mixed on civic nationalism, the authors
   find strong evidence that ethnic nationalism goes hand-in-hand with
   reduced social capital and that it increases the negative social impact
   of diversity. So although this study only partially confirms the
   benefits of civic nationalism, it clearly underlines the costs of its
   ethnic variety.},

Abstract = {The study is about the STC 185/2012, which asserted the
   unconstitutionality the `'favorable'' term as a prerequisite of the
   report of the Public Prosecutor which the legislator established so the
   judge could impose the joint custody of the children by their parents
   separated when they disagreed among themselves for that type of custody.
   The unconstitutionality declared is twofold: because such regulation
   violated the principle of jurisdictional reservation in favor of the
   judges and courts proclaimed in the art. 117.3 CE, and because it quite
   the right to effective judicial protection guaranteed in the art. 24.1
   CE. The decision has a dissenting opinion signed by four judges, which
   denies such studs: on the one side, taking as examples some legal
   determinations envelope whose constitutionality is no doubt and, that
   consequently warrantee the questioned regulation; on the other side, and
   above all, founding that his trial constitutional conformity in the
   Court's doctrine about the notion of `'normative density'', which covers
   the legislator to regulate detail matters. The comment aims to
   demonstrate that the examples that are compared in the dissenting
   opinion declared unconstitutional regulation are not comparable to this,
   and that such a constitutional doctrine about the `'normative density''
   was not applicable either to the same. So the impossibility that the
   judge imposed the shared custody of children in case of disagreement of
   the parents about it if the report of the Prosecutor was opposite (or
   simply neutral or non-existent) was, indeed, non-conforming with the
   jurisdictional exclusivity of the judges and violated the right to
   effective judicial protection at stake in such cases},

Abstract = {This research note shows the demos-enabling elements of the Brazilian
   federal state by examining the decision-making process of 59 legislative
   initiatives regarding the taxes, policies and expenditures of
   subnational units submitted to the Brazilian Congress between 1989 and
   2006. The combination of two political institutions - the federal
   government's broad powers to make decisions on subnational matters
   (right to decide) and the majority principle for approving changes in
   the federal status quo - empowers the center without diminishing the
   rights of subunits. It is not necessary to obtain supermajorities in
   numerous veto arenas in order to approve legislation aimed at providing
   national goods, and regional minorities have few opportunities for
   vetoing. The center is empowered, not weak.},

Abstract = {Purpose - This chapter discusses the increased acceptance of
   biopolitical research by mainstream political science and examines the
   potential causes. It demonstrates that the changing status of
   biopolitics is part of a more general pattern in academia, where
   biological explanations of social phenomena are increasingly viewed as
   acceptable and even necessary.
   Design/methodology/approach - A brief review of the history of the
   literature of biopolitics with a content analysis of the three leading
   general-readership journals of political science and other measures of
   activity in biopolitics.
   Findings - Political scientists until recently have not been receptive
   to the arguments advanced by proponents of biopolitics, but this
   resistance is weakening. This case for a more biologically oriented
   political science is more tenable now in part because of the groundwork
   done by the early generation of biopolitics scholars but mainly because
   of changing circumstances.},

Abstract = {This article reviews Gillian Tett's Fools Gold: How Unrestrained Greed
   Corrupted a Dream Shattered Global Markets and Unleashed a Catastrophe
   (2009), Paul Krugman's, The Return of Depression Economics (2008), and
   Joseph Stiglitz's Free Fall: America, Free Markets and the Sinking of
   the Global Economy (2010). The author's central arguments are elaborated
   when these three mainstream accounts of the current economic crisis were
   critiqued from a Marxist perspective. Gillian Tett's work has the merit
   of unpacking various financial phenomena that are often invoked by
   economic commentators without being fully explained. However, this
   narrow focus ultimately proves her undoing as the underlying structural
   causes of the crisis are left completely unexamined. Paul Krugman works
   from the other extreme, attempting to fit the current crisis into the
   vicissitudes of globalisation. As a primer in mainstream macroeconomics,
   Depression Economics works tolerably well. As an analysis of the current
   crisis it fails absolutely. Stiglitz's book is much better in this
   regard, as it actually attempts to engage with the destructive nature of
   neoliberalism. However, his failure to look beyond capitalism renders
   his analysis shallow and his prescriptions uninspiring. In the end only
   a socialist transformation will be sufficient and the paper ends with a
   brief account of the crisis from a Marxist perspective.},

Abstract = {Tensions between Latinos may undermine support for collective group
   interests. In this paper, we, first, examine the determinants of
   Latinos' perceived intra-group competition. We expected perceived
   intra-group competition to be shaped by Latinos' (1) personal economic
   status, (2) acculturation, (3) experiences with discrimination from
   co-ethnic members, (4) pan-ethnic identity, and (5) neighborhood
   conditions. Second, we explore how perceived competition influences
   their attitudes on policies that address shared group concerns. Using
   the 2006 Latino National Survey, our analysis shows that Latinos who
   experienced discrimination from co-ethnic members felt greater
   intra-group competition. Second, perceived competition is highest for
   Latinos who live in neighborhoods with large proportions of residents
   from their country of origin. Finally, Latinos who felt intra-group
   competition held more negative attitudes toward immigrants than those
   that perceived little competition.},

   prospect. The Taiwan government is likely to open itself more to China

Abstract = {This article analyses Hollandes presidential election campaign and
   victory of 2012, placing them in the historical, organisational and
   ideological context of French Socialism and the French party system. It
   argues that an effective campaign, an unpopular adversary and a French
   party system context unusually conducive to pooling the Lefts electoral
   resources akin to 1981 all aided Hollandes cause. Despite limited
   ideological renewal, Hollandes internal party coalition promised a
   scaled-up reformism in the areas of finance, redistributive taxation and
   ambitious oreindustrialisation' policies. However, the eurozone crisis
   and degraded French public finances will hinder prospects for such
   growth-oriented political economic change.},

Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Pages = {65-87},
Abstract = {Across countries, governments are urging civil society, in particular
   charitable and non-profit associations, to take up a part of the social
   burden, and to produce and provide critical human services and social
   goods, either independently or on governments' behalf. This type of
   privatization, or public-private partnership, is encouraged by many on
   grounds of pluralism and liberty, as empowering individuals and their
   associations. In this paper, I aim to provide a liberty-based normative
   argument against privatization. A common view, supported by both
   conservatives and classical liberals, is that the more social
   responsibility is left or delegated to civil society, the more civil
   society will flourish. I contend, by contrast, that when political
   societies rely on civil society to provide critical goods and services,
   individuals' freedom of association is threatened. The consequence of
   privatization is a multiple loss, in terms of individual freedom, value
   pluralism and the expressive character of civil society.},

Abstract = {Brazilian democratic innovation is gathering considerable international
   attention, spawning a growing interest in replicating the institutional
   designs of its participatory governance institutions in countries with
   very different political histories and cultures of governance. Drawing
   on ethnographic research in the north and north-east of the country,
   sites to which innovations developed in the south of Brazil have been
   institutionalized in very different political and cultural landscapes,
   this article examines the micro-politics of citizen engagement in two
   participatory governance spaces. Understanding the contributions that
   Brazilian experience can make to democratic theory and practice, we
   suggest, requires a more nuanced examination of how democratic spaces
   and cultures of politics are mutually constructed in practice, and how
   different forms of power shape this process.},

Abstract = {Scholars disagree about the nature of the political regime that Hugo
   Chavez established in Venezuela after he came to power in 1999. But in
   the last few years, despite existing disagreements, it has become more
   common to see the regime as a hybrid, meaning that it combines elements
   of democracy and autocracy, with separate authors placing different
   emphases on either of these two aspects. In this paper, we update our
   view on the nature of the regime. We continue to view the regime as a
   hybrid, but one that has become more competitive-authoritarian. Our
   paper: 1. shows that autocratic rules and practices have become more
   salient in the 2009-2013 period. 2. explains why popular support for the
   regime has declined, while it has improved for the opposition. 3.
   discusses how Chavez's death will affect the future of the regime and
   the continuity of his movement.},

Abstract = {I exploit the sudden and dramatic jolt that Osama Bin Laden's capture
   gave to Barack Obama's 2012 re-election prospects to gauge the
   relationship between presidential prospects and stock market valuation
   changes. Using campaign contributions as an indicator of political
   support, I find that following Bin Laden's death, firms that had
   previously supported Democrats registered significant positive returns,
   whereas firms that had supported Republicans registered significant
   negative returns. Across the S\&P 500, the president's transformed
   re-election prospects shifted market capital worth \$101 billion over
   one day and \$245 billion over one week. My findings indicate that the
   relationship between the presidency and firm valuations is associated
   with patterns of past political support, substantively and significantly
   important, and more pronounced for the presidency than for Congress.},

Abstract = {Do people believe the votes they cast are truly secret? Novel items
   added to a nationally representative survey show that 25 per cent of
   respondents report not believing their ballot choices are kept secret
   and over 70 per cent report sharing their vote choices with others.
   These findings suggest that standard models of candidate choice should
   account for the potential effects of doubts about ballot secrecy.
   Consistent with this view, regression analysis shows that social forces
   appear to have a greater effect on vote choices among people who doubt
   the formal secrecy of the ballot. This analysis supports the broader
   claim that the intended benefits of institutional rules may not be
   realized if people's perceptions of these rules differ from their formal
   characteristics.},

Abstract = {Purpose - This study demonstrates that serious episodes of presidential
   ill health can have positive impacts on role performance.
   Design/methodology - The author utilizes both primary source materials
   (personal interviews with White House physicians and several other
   physicians who treated Reagan at the hospital, and the writings of key
   Reagan aides and family members) and secondary source materials
   (writings of political scientists, historians, and journalists).
   Findings - Reagan was at first in critical condition. It was then that
   his Secretary of State appeared to make a bold grab for power, an act
   that contributed materially to the end of his political career.
   Additionally, the administration's failure to invoke the presidential
   disability amendment allowed the official chain of command to be in
   doubt. Finally, the significant increase in Reagan's popularity that
   flowed from his lighthearted demeanor after he was shot is examined here
   in terms of the President's subsequent legislative successes.
   Originality/value - This study suggests strongly that Reagan `s
   impressive legislative achievements in mid-1981 were due significantly
   to his heroic response to having been shot.},

   Academic Performance},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE EDUCATION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Pages = {403-416},
Abstract = {Both students and instructors have somewhat negative perceptions of
   office hours. Students fail to attend office hours on a regular basis
   for substantive and intrinsic reasons. Instructors are often discouraged
   with low attendance in office hours and consequently may fail to invest
   a significant amount of time in reaching out to students. This study
   explores the connection between office-hour attendance and academic
   performance in political science courses. For eight political science
   courses over four years, we record the number of times students visit
   office hours and their course grades (N = 406). Our findings indicate
   that office-hour visits are positively correlated with academic
   performance. In providing quantitative evidence that office hours can
   have a real and significant effect on academic performance, we hope this
   study may encourage instructors to actively invest in office hours. We
   conclude the study by providing four simple strategies instructors may
   implement to encourage engagement with students in office hours.},

Abstract = {Models designed for limited dependent variables are increasingly common
   in political science. Researchers estimating such models often give
   little attention to the coefficient estimates and instead focus on
   marginal effects, predicted probabilities, predicted counts, etc. Since
   the models are nonlinear, the estimated effects are sensitive to how one
   generates the predictions. The most common approach involves estimating
   the effect for the average case. But this approach creates a weaker
   connection between the results and the larger goals of the research
   enterprise and is thus less preferable than the observed-value approach.
   That is, rather than seeking to understand the effect for the average
   case, the goal is to obtain an estimate of the average effect in the
   population. In addition to the theoretical argument in favor of the
   observed-value approach, we illustrate via an empirical example and
   Monte Carlo simulations that the two approaches can produce
   substantively different results.},

Abstract = {Marxists and radical environmentalists have argued that the never ending
   drive for expanded accumulation and production is the fundamental reason
   that capitalism can never solve the environmental crisis, and in effect
   can only make the crisis more severe. Promoters of green capitalism also
   focus on the growth cycle of capitalism, but argue that new
   environmental technologies can out compete and be more profitable than
   the destructive means of production now in use. Both arguments overlook
   the effects of economic crisis as another element in our confrontation
   with environmental calamities, and yet, crisis plays an important role
   in the improbability of capitalism building a sustainable society.},

Year = {2013},
Volume = {1},
Number = {1},
Pages = {4-25},
Abstract = {Focusing on the case of Bolivia, this paper analyzes when and why
   marginalized groups gain access to political power. The country's
   experience is puzzling. Though we would have expected the indigenous-led
   government that came to power in early 2006 to be more receptive to the
   claims of indigenous movements than to women, the opposite occurred.
   Indigenous groups received a mere 5\% of parliamentary seats and women
   got a gender parity law. What explains these different results of
   women's and indigenous demands for political inclusion? Adopting an
   intersectional approach, we view marginalized groups not as a single
   category but as a collection of categories. Rather than a premise of
   politics, group unity is a political achievement. While women overcame
   divisions between white, urban feminists and indigenous women from
   popular sectors to lobby for gender parity, the indigenous movement
   remained divided over reserved seats and the project of indigenous
   autonomy more generally. Our analysis helps explain why quotas have
   brought women into power but not changed other features of politics and
   why empowerment has produced new hierarchies within the indigenous
   movement.},

Abstract = {The term solidarity is lacking a precise definition despite being
   embedded as primary law in the EU treaties and regardless of its pivotal
   role in the current debate on the euro crisis. Once the semantic core is
   unearthed we sketch three dimensions of European solidarity (motives,
   references, level of action). Through this we shall distil three ideal
   types of an intergovernmental European solidarity: a federal, an organic
   and a distributive type. Empirically we assign the most relevant
   measures, which were discussed and partially enacted in the course of
   the euro crisis, to the three ideal types where we identify an
   increasing tendency towards a distributive solidarity. Once the first
   elements will be upgraded to a full-blown distributive solidarity
   through further integration, several risks arise from a normative
   perspective.},

Title = {From Stur to Parasites: Thematic Adaptation of the Far Right in Slovak
   Parliamentary Elections},
Journal = {POLITOLOGICKY CASOPIS-CZECH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Pages = {258-281},
Abstract = {The paper analyzes the far right People's Party Our Slovakia (L'SNS) in
   2006, 2010 and 2012 Slovak parliamentary elections. The main questions
   that the paper seeks to answer are 1) whether and how has the party
   changed its main themes during the periods before elections, 2) what the
   party's position toward the Roma minority has been, and 3) how the
   thematic adaptation has affected electoral results of the party. The
   paper analyzes the changing position of the party toward the Roma
   minority in the context of three electoral periods and it links the
   party's electoral results with the occurrence of so-called Roma
   settlements in the areas, where the party gained a significant share of
   the vote. We found that during the 2006 elections the party mostly
   emphasized the need for the renaissance of the (Slovak) nation and the
   reflection of its roots and national historical figures. In both the
   2010 and 2012 elections the party for the most part sharply criticized
   the Roma minority and the mainstream political parties. We argue that
   this change was reflected in the party's electoral gain. Since 2010 the
   party has changed its focus to an active campaign against Roma and
   electoral results of the party have improved. In 2006 L'SNS gained the
   most votes in areas where the local appeal of its leaders emphasizing
   the nationalistic themes was the largest and in both 2010 and 2012 the
   party gained the most votes in regions with the highest occurrence of
   Roma settlements. We also identified all four features that according to
   Mudde (2000) characterize far right parties in the electoral themes
   emphasized by L'SNS.},

Title = {A `Balkanized' Profession: French Psychologists and the State
   (1945-1985)},
Journal = {POLITIX},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {26},
Number = {102},
Pages = {177+},
Abstract = {This article examines the role of the State in the professionalization
   of psychology in France since the post-war period. It is shown that
   psychologists have used two distinct strategies in their quest for
   professional status. First, they have strived to create labor market
   shelters in various segments of the state apparatus since post-war,
   especially in the fields of health-care and education. Simultaneously,
   professional organizations and trade unions have tried to unify the
   profession, defending the idea of a ``single status{''} and a unique
   regulation for all psychologists, whatever their field of practice.
   These strategies have proved largely incompatible, which explains the
   current difficulties met by the psychological profession to gain
   legitimacy, especially in their jurisdictional disputes with physicians
   and psychoanalysts. In the first section, we show that the emergence of
   professional psychology in post-war France is more the result of the
   growing needs expressed by public welfare administrations, than the
   product of the initiatives of the profession itself, which remains very
   fragmented in the period. From the 1970's onwards, there is a great
   expansion of psychology at the university and social demands increase
   rapidly. However, the attempts to unify the profession are confronted
   with the great heterogeneity of status and regulations within the
   administration: Professional associations manage to unify during a short
   period between 1980 and 1985 and obtain a legal protection of the title
   in 1985, but this minimalist regulation proves insufficient to overcome
   the strong ``balkanization{''} of the profession.},

Year = {2013},
Volume = {6},

Pages = {92-117},
Abstract = {Since 1979, the Animal and Earth Liberation Fronts have claimed
   thousands of attacks worldwide targeting property, yet remained
   relatively impervious to infiltration, disruption and arrest. Since the
   disclosure of the State's targeted surveillance and prosecution of these
   movements - labelled the ``Green Scare{''} by activists - a matrix of
   juridical, legalistic and political mechanisms has criminalised forms of
   political dissent. In order to apply an emergent method of conflict
   analysis to the subject of the violent non-State actor, the Insight
   approach is utilised to examine how counterterrorism strategy serves as
   an articulation of the State's epistemological framework. Though
   examining the State as an entity capable of synthesising experiences and
   generating a perceived ``threat{''}, one can examine a resulting
   juridical ``defense{''}. Utilising the Insight approach to conflict
   mediation as developed by Bernard Lonergan, Robert Fitterer, Cheryl
   Picard, Jamie Price and others, one can understand the State's threat
   perception, narrative construction and finally, policies that emanate
   from such a conflict understanding.},

Abstract = {There is a growing consensus that parliamentary systems with recently
   enacted bills of rights constitute a new model of constitutionalism that
   serves as a middle ground between parliamentary sovereignty and judicial
   supremacy. One of the key features often discussed in relation to this
   `weak-form' or `Commonwealth' model of judicial review is the notion of
   an inter-branch dialogue about rights that permits legislatures to
   respond to court rulings about the policies at stake. This article
   develops a framework for empirically assessing whether and how dialogue
   operates in practice. A systematic examination of legislative responses
   to Supreme Court rulings affecting legislation in Canada finds that
   relatively little genuine dialogue occurs in practice because
   legislatures rarely respond in a manner that departs from the dictates
   of the Court's rulings. The article then explores the implications this
   type of empirical assessment might have for other parliamentary systems.},

Abstract = {The theoretical part of this article defines the most common corruptive
   criminal offences, offences of bribery. Croatian Penal Code contains the
   following criminal offences of bribery: accepting (art. 347) and
   offering (art. 348) a bribe, accepting (art. 294a) and offering (art.
   294b) a bribe in economic business operations and illegal intercession
   (art. 343).
   The analytical focus of the article is on the act of accepting and
   offering a bribe. The author studied the proceedings related to criminal
   offences of bribery in Croatia in the 2002-2010 period. Similar acts in
   economic business operations are new criminal offences in the Penal Code
   and, for that reason, there is not enough court practice material for
   their comprehensive research.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ELECTIONS PUBLIC OPINION AND PARTIES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {23},

Pages = {484-500},
Abstract = {This article analyses the effects of the issue agenda and of party
   competence on party popularity. Based on the salience and the issue
   ownership literatures, shifts in party support may be attributable to
   two factors: changing voter perceptions of issue salience and shifts in
   perceived party competence. We thus hypothesize that (1) a party's
   popularity increases if the public issue agenda changes in its favour
   such that its ``best{''} issues become more important to voters and (2)
   that voters' changing perceptions of party competence account for
   shifting party popularity. Using annual macro data on voter perceptions
   of the issue agenda, party competence and popularity in Austria, we find
   no support for the first hypothesis. Rather, voter perceptions of party
   issue competence vary considerably and this variation accounts for the
   parties' level of popular support. This suggests that party competition
   plays out more by what politicians actually do and what impression they
   give about their deeds and competence than by exercising influence on
   the issue agenda.},

Abstract = {One year after the birth of the 15M movement in Spain, an analysis from
   a sociological perspective can be attempted. To do so, the best approach
   to the phenomenon demands an examination of public perceptions in
   relation to the institutional political system throughout a qualitative
   methodology based on observation and discourse analysis of the
   participants. Meetings have attended and social networks materials have
   been scrutinized. The results show that this movement cannot be
   understood without being familiar to the citizens' previous perception
   of political institutions and making a connection with the results of
   the economic crisis, rising unemployment and the perception citizens
   have of the financial markets.},

Abstract = {The literature identifies two forms of business organization,
   Neocorporatist and firm-level, and the strength of each respective type
   has changed over time; whereas Neocorporatism has remained steady or
   declined, firm-level organization has become stronger in all countries.
   The literature underscores the differential effects of these two forms
   of business organization on employer support for active labor market
   policies and brings new evidence to bear on the implications of the
   relative shift towards firm-level organization on firms' investment in
   active measures. A macro-level study analyzes the differential effects
   of these two types of employer organization on total spending on active
   labor market policies in a pooled analysis of 18 countries between 1985
   and 2000. A micro-level study explores the differing nature of firms'
   investment in active labor market policies in a context with strong
   Neocorporatist organization and weak firm-level organization (Denmark)
   and one with strong Neocorporatist and strong firm-level organization
   (Germany). Comparative European Politics (2013) 11, 22-48.

Journal = {REVISTA ANDINA DE ESTUDIOS POLITICOS},

Volume = {3},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to explore the radical left in government in
   Latin America, particular in Venezuela and Bolivia, and to what extent
   the achieved political and socio-economic policies accomplished by the
   governments have contributed to deepening democracy, either related to
   the concept of liberal democracy or participatory democracy. It is
   argued that democracy both has been weakening and deepening. On the one
   hand, democracy has been weakening, to some extent, if we measure
   democracy as equivalent to liberal democratic institutions such as
   elections, political freedoms and accountability, particular in the case
   of Venezuela. However, on the other hand, it can be argued that new
   participatory dimensions have increased, resulting in deepening of
   democracy, for example as in Bolivia. Still, all radical left
   administrations are facing several obstacles to overcome in order to
   deepen democracy, both when it comes to develop democratic institutions
   in accordance with the liberal as well as the participatory traditions.},

Abstract = {Does campaign duration affect election outcomes? To date, this question
   has largely evaded political scientists, but it is reasonable to expect
   systematic links between campaign length and candidate performance in
   elections. We hypothesize that longer campaigns would help challengers'
   electoral fortunes, thereby curbing incumbency advantage and potentially
   boosting competitiveness in elections. Using two data sources, aggregate
   data from U.S. House elections between 1994 and 2006 and ANES survey
   data from the 2002 election cycle, we find little evidence to support
   contentions that campaign length affects election outcomes or candidate
   familiarity. The results we report suggest the political consequences,
   intended or not, to choices about election timing are likely minimal.},

   to different kinds of obstacles, like corruption, resistance to reforms

   focuses upon changes in official programs of electronic government. Some
   parallels with South Korea, Singapore, and Kazakhstan are made with a
   conclusion that Russia has definitely fallen behind.},

Volume = {6},
Number = {3},
Pages = {392-409},
Abstract = {Work on contemporary instances of ``violent extremist{''} texts tends to
   see these primarily as more or less instrumental extensions of political
   (or political-religious) movements. As a result, there are few studies
   that devote close attention to individual examples of the texts
   themselves. In this article, we offer a detailed analysis of two
   jihadist speeches by the prominent ideologues Adam Gadahn and the late
   Anwar al-Awlaki. We argue that Al-Awlaki's work ultimately succeeds
   where Gadahn's seemingly fails because it is underpinned by a form of
   fundamentalism which, paradoxically, is inherently premised on the
   survival of possibilities for dialogue and polyglossia.},

Title = {Federal Institutions, Declarations of Independence and Civil War},
Journal = {CIVIL WARS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Pages = {261-280},
Abstract = {Countries at civil war differ across a number of dimensions that are
   often used to account for onset, duration or severity. A relatively
   understudied dimension is the role of institutional arrangements on the
   severity of civil wars. We argue that federal systems put in place the
   mechanisms to make civil wars shorter but bloodier because they often
   allow for independent militia, taxation, and infrastructural
   development. Federal systems also make more credible a declaration of
   independence. These factors make civil wars looks much more like
   conventionalwarfare than their guerilla-based counterpart. Werely on the

Abstract = {The experience of the post-colonial State underlines the transformations
   of the modern State. In fact, some features of the post-colonial State
   which were regarded as being overcome or at least inconsistent with the
   constitutional, democratic and rational form of the State, are now
   emerging also in those States that never made experience of
   colonization, or have been colonizers. The essay analyses the
   transformations of the modern State aiming to articulate the concept of
   Global State. In this case, the question of origins does not represent a
   principle of legitimation, as it was with the doctrine of social
   contract. Rather, the symbolic and historical discontinuity defines a
   cut between the origin and the functioning of the State, corresponding
   to a transformation of the legitimating sources of the State itself.
   Within the global State, sovereignty is not anymore a monopoly, but a
   widespread practice enacted by several social structures.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},

Volume = {75},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Legislative earmarks have taken center stage in the popular press in
   recent years as journalists, pundits, the president, and, sometimes,
   even legislators themselves question the economic, representational, and
   general policy implications of this type of federal spending. Some
   scholars suggest that legislators garner either direct or indirect
   electoral benefits from this behavior, but empirical findings are mixed.
   In this article, we place this discussion in the context of the
   literature on the link between campaign contributions and legislative
   services. We argue that MCs use earmarks to reward loyal contributors
   while interest groups attract earmarks by contributing to legislators'
   campaigns. Utilizing a two-stage OLS technique, we find a robust
   relationship between defense earmarks and campaign contributions from
   defense political action committees during the 111th Congress.},

Abstract = {This review essay proposes a crowdsourcing platform that takes advantage
   of technologies that students are already using to generate an exciting
   classroom, to enrich the student experience, and to encourage a sense of
   global civic responsibility in a large introductory lecture class. After
   an introductory lecture on a problem, students choose case studies from
   a predetermined menu. This kind of ``choose their own adventure''
   generative platform is a fresh, stimulating approach that is innovative
   and can be adapted for both on-campus and distance learning. In
   traditional lecture courses, the professor makes all of the decisions
   for what to study, but this platform can enable students to make those
   decisions, to gain responsibility and earn ownership, and to get
   feedback about their choices. Thus, students are not just learning to
   read what someone else chose but learning how to decide themselves what
   is a good case, what is a good source, and what makes a good course.},

Title = {Political Political Science: A Phronetic Approach},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {35},
Number = {3},
Pages = {359-372},
Abstract = {For over fifty years, successive waves of critique have underscored that
   the apolitical character of much of political science research betrays
   the founding mission of the discipline to have science serve democracy.
   The Caucus for a New Political Science was originally based on such a
   critique, and the perestroika movement in the discipline included a call
   for more problem-driven as opposed to theory- or method-driven work that
   would better connect political science research to ongoing political
   struggles. In recent years, movements for a public sociology and public
   anthropology as well as dissonant movements in economics and related
   fields have added to the insistence that social science research was too
   often disconnected from the real world. Phronetic social science has
   emerged out of the ferment for change in the social sciences, starting
   with the much-debated book by Bent Flyvbjerg, Making Social Science
   Matter (Cambridge, 2001). Flyvbjerg critiqued the social sciences for
   mimicking the natural sciences, while proposing an alternative approach
   that focuses research on helping people address the problems they are
   facing. Today, phronetic social science goes beyond the call for an
   alternative approach to social inquiry and its growing adherents are
   providing evidence that this alternative approach to doing research can
   enrich the social sciences by more effectively connecting research to
   efforts to address real world problems as people experience them. This
   article provides a genealogy of efforts to connect political science to
   politics, a review of the major critiques of mainstream research, an
   explication of the rationale for more problem-driven, mixed-methods
   research, a specification of the key principles of the phronetic
   approach, and examples of its application in the public realm. The
   article concludes with implications for realizing a more political
   political science by way of taking a phronetic approach.},

   Two areas of concern seen as contributing to this corruption are voter

Journal = {DEMOCRACY \& SECURITY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {157-176},
Abstract = {The article analyzes the European Union's (EU) migration strategies
   toward the Arab states in the light of the Arab uprisings in a
   comparative context. Going through migratory processes related to Egypt,
   Libya, and Syria, the article discusses Middle Eastern migration and its
   diverse manifestations, critically assessing the relevance of the EU's
   migration policy ambitions vis-a-vis the different challenges in the
   Mediterranean region. In its theoretical approach, the article draws on
   the concept of non-traditional security, demonstrating that migration
   constitutes an anarchistic element in the relations between states,
   which goes beyond traditional foreign policy means. The article
   characterizes recent EU initiatives concerning migration and
   demonstrates that despite the fact that the EU has declared migration
   ``one of the strategic priorities in the external relations of the
   Union,{''} it seems apparent that the EU has not been able to develop
   adequate new approaches regarding migration. Many of the suggested
   initiatives within the framework of the new EU foreign policy setup have
   not been established yet-they remain preliminary works in progress,
   projects in different stages or legislative procedures under negotiation
   between EU institutions. Summing up the cases of Egypt, Libya, and
   Syria, the article concludes that the migration phenomenon since the
   start of the Arab unrest in early 2011 constitutes a highly important
   issue in European-Middle Eastern relations, regarding which, the EU
   foreign and security measures seem to be relevant only to some degree.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to enquire about the relationship between
   globalization and national economic competitivity or efficiency as
   indicated by the rate of unemployment, the inflation rate and the level
   of budget deficit and national debt. In the era of globalization, the
   `Keynesian consensus' of the after-war period, which prevented any
   trade-off between social security and economic growth, cannot resist the
   pressure from the globalization of the world economy. The decline in
   industrial employment created a situation in which-in the Nordic
   countries and in Sweden, especially-full employment could only be
   attained via services and the third economic sector. Conversely,
   globalization has benefited the small open economies in South-East Asia,
   which found themselves most in-sync with the demands of the global age.},

   `Comparison View of Justice' into IR},
Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {16},
Number = {2},
Pages = {249-265},
Abstract = {A central challenge of Amartya Sen's comparative view of justice is to
   bring cultural diversity to bear on conceptualizing global justice,
   which includes building bridges across cultures that enable effective
   action, and rendering compatible the most beneficent of Rawlsian (or
   transcendental) intentions with irreducible cultural diversity. For
   social scientists meeting this challenge requires, first, taking account
   of variation of social practices in the social construction of meaning,
   and second, uncovering invisible frontiers of global justice that remain
   hidden due to conceptual or empirical oversight. The latter is
   especially true for contemporary International Relations (IR) theory,
   which assumes state actors to be the main interlocutors in the global
   realm, and thus precludes consideration of micro-level forms of
   inter-national relations (understood as interaction among all types of
   actors that takes place across country borders and that bears traits of
   national identity). Alternatively, Sen's micro-perspectival approach
   offers a welcome support for pluralist approaches that both appreciate
   non-state access to contestation in the international arena, and account
   for the meaning-in-use of fundamental norms (democracy, rule of law,
   human rights) in different cultural and inter-national contexts.},

Abstract = {How do social scientists generate knowledge about phenomena (such as
   corruption) which are self-concealing and difficult to access and which
   repel research inquiry? This article takes a first step in empirically
   researching the choice of research methods in corruption studies in
   economics and political sciences. We investigate the pluralism of
   research methods employed in empirical corruption studies in two major
   academic disciplines and critically discuss the current state of
   constrained pluralism in corruption research. Ideal-typically,
   methodological pluralists would claim that combining different data
   sources and analytical methods at various stages of the research process
   is requisite to developing adequate and valid knowledge. Using data from
   a quantitative content analysis of a random selection of
   internationally-published research articles in SSCI journals, we
   underline assumptions about the hegemony of quantitative analysis in
   economics and a more pluralistic use of methods in political science,
   note the increasing importance of aggregate data sets as data sources
   since the mid-1990s, and discuss the difficulty of directly measuring
   self-concealing phenomena like corruption. Our findings suggest (i) a
   hegemony of quantitative analysis in economics and a greater pluralism
   of methods in political science, (ii) the increasing importance of
   aggregate data sets as data sources since the mid-1990s, and (iii) the
   difficulty of measuring corruption directly. We conclude by arguing that
   the current state of constrained pluralism in corruption studies leaves
   ample room for exploring both direct and indirect measures to research
   corruption.},

Abstract = {This paper argues that there is a strong relationship between
   geographical patterns of political parties' electoral performance and
   the composition of central government expenditures. When party system
   nationalization is high, the composition of spending will focus more on
   non-targetable expenditures, while targetable expenditures increase as
   the party system distribution of votes across different districts
   becomes less homogenous. However, the effect of party nationalization on
   spending type is conditioned by the size of the presidential coalition;
   targeted transfers will increase if the coalition size decreases, even
   if party nationalization is high. I find support for these hypotheses
   with an empirical analysis of district-level electoral and government
   expenditure data for several countries in Latin America between 1990 and
   2006. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   identify with politics. Specifically, it analyzes whether voters'
   left/right self-identifications over the past 30 years increasingly
   correspond to cultural rather than economic attitudes. This study uses
   longitudinal data from the Netherlands between 1980 and 2006 to
   demonstrate that as time progresses, voters' left/right self-placements
   are indeed more strongly determined by anti-immigrant attitudes than by
   attitudes towards redistribution. These findings show that the issue
   basis of left/right identification is dynamic in nature and responsive
   to changes in the political environment.},

Abstract = {This contribution to the special anniversary edition serves as a framing
   document, taking a macro view and reflecting on all contributions to
   Politikon over the past 40 years. Rather than presenting an objective
   and comprehensive literature review of the entire and disparate corpus
   of scholarship, this article provides subjective reflections on how the
   journal and Political Science scholarship have evolved in their
   operationalisation and presentation of research in South Africa. This is
   done by contextualising the research as products of their specific
   time(s), by considering instances of meta-reflection by South African
   political scientists, and by highlighting remarkable historical and
   intellectual pointers in the evolution of the kind of scholarship that
   has been published in this journal. An appeal is made for a closer and
   more systematic study of South African Political Science (therefore, the
   subject qua object), and for future scholarship to be undertaken with
   greater constitutive (self-)awareness.},

Title = {Rallying intolerance in the valleys: Explaining support for the extreme
   right in Wales},
Journal = {BRITISH POLITICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Number = {4},
Pages = {433-456},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Until its decline at the 2012 elections, the British National Party
   (BNP) was the most electorally successful extreme right party in the
   United Kingdom. Yet, although the party's electoral growth in England
   has attracted attention, individual and contextual drivers of BNP
   support in other areas - namely, Wales - have been ignored. The lack of
   research is puzzling, given that the party has actively campaigned
   beyond England and attracted some support for its ethnic nationalism
   amidst a resurgence of support for Welsh nationalism. Drawing on a range
   of data, we examine the socio-economic, political and demographic
   drivers of BNP support in Wales. At the aggregate level, we find the
   party performs strongest in economically insecure and urban areas that
   have large social housing sectors, high deprivation rates, low education
   levels, large numbers of residents in precarious occupations, and which
   have experienced the largest increases in unemployment rates since the
   onset of the financial crisis. Politically, our findings suggest that
   the BNP has also rallied votes in areas where turnout is low, and where
   support for Labour has traditionally been strong. Individual-level
   analysis of `core' and `soft' supporters reveals that although they
   share a similar profile - less-well educated and middle-aged men who
   tend to be skilled workers - soft sympathy appears more widespread among
   women and younger citizens. Foremost, and despite a broader context of
   comparatively low migration and ethnic diversity rates in Wales, both
   groups of supporters are driven to the extreme right by concerns over
   immigration, which appear to be tied strongly to broader feelings of
   political abandonment. In contrast to results in England, our findings
   suggest that immigration-related concerns do not stem from the actual
   presence or proximity of immigrant and/or minority groups. Rather, it
   appears that structural economic disadvantage, political disenchantment
   and the perceived negative impact of immigration provide a more
   convincing explanation for the limited electoral appeal of the extreme
   right in Wales.},

Abstract = {Secularisation theory carried two implicit implications for Christian
   Democratic parties: either they become secular or they cease to exist.
   Both implications were wrong. Christian Democracy has neither vanished
   from the political landscape nor has it become fully secular. To secure
   its survival Christian Democracy has embarked on a delicate balancing
   act between the modern and the secular. Following up empirically on the
   thesis of Christian Democratic politics as being modern unsecular, the
   paper explores how much of the Christian element is still needed to
   explain Christian Democratic ideology and policy in the twenty-first
   century. By scrutinising the struggle surrounding Christian Democratic
   family policy in Germany, the paper finds that the conflict on the
   repositioning of Christian Democracy in a new cultural environment not
   only unfolds between secular modernisers and religious traditionalists.
   It has also led to the re-eruption of the interdenominational cleavage
   between Protestants and Catholics within the party.},

Abstract = {Several decades of scholarship suggest that by covering male and female
   candidates differently, the news media may influence the success of
   female candidates for higher office. I employ a content analysis to
   assess gender differences in the local television news coverage of 172
   U.S. House candidates in the nation's top 50 media markets in 2002. The
   results of the study suggest that female candidates for the U.S. House
   were covered with the same frequency as male candidates, and received
   equitable issue-based and personal coverage.},

Abstract = {This article explores the connection between political theory and
   political commentary in the editorial stance of Dissent magazine's
   staff, especially Irving Howe, Lewis Coser, and Michael Walzer. It
   argues that central to the political thought of the Dissent circle was a
   rejection of ideological Puritanism on the American left. Dissent's
   theoretical contribution was to develop a space for a policy-oriented
   social democratic platform that draws on both liberalism and communism
   while transforming them. Thus, Howe sought a socialism that drew on
   valuable liberal insights, while Walzer looked for a permanent uneasy
   coexistence between social democracy, liberalism, and communitarianism.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {32},
Number = {4},
Pages = {729-745},

Abstract = {Retrospective economic evaluations are politically biased: across a
   broad range of democratic countries, supporters of the party that
   controls the executive provide evaluations that are systematically more
   positive than those of the rest of the electorate; similarly,
   ideological distance from the ruling party predicts more negative
   evaluations. Yet, during economic downturns, citizens of different
   ideological persuasions and partisan affiliations tend to agree that the
   state of the economy is dire. During recoveries, on the other hand,
   evaluations are polarized along partisan and ideological lines. Due to
   the psychological phenomenon of negativity bias, retrospective
   evaluations respond to economic downturns more strongly than to
   recoveries. As a consequence, the extent of polarization in public
   opinion varies dramatically between good and bad economic times. (C)

Abstract = {This article examines the relationship between national elections and
   the delay in transposition of E.U. directives. It posits that elections,
   on their own, and when compounded with other factors, significantly
   affect transposition. First, it argues that upcoming elections, in
   general, increase the likelihood of nontransposition of directives with
   transposition deadlines around election time. The article further
   contends that economic hardship in the year prior to an election
   increases the likelihood of nontimely transposition of directives with
   deadlines in that election year, and that complex directives with
   deadlines in an election year are also more likely not to be transposed
   on time. Finally, the article posits that a change in the ruling
   coalition reduces the likelihood of transposition delays. Empirical
   analysis finds that upcoming elections, economic hardship around
   election time, and directive complexity in the face of upcoming
   elections all increase nontransposition, while a change in the governing
   coalition decreases nontransposition.},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The study of general election outcomes can be helped by finding better
   approaches for visualizing large quantities of information and asking
   questions about its patterning. We review the Nagayama or all
   possibilities' triangle display, and show that it can only legitimately
   be used to show an overall field' of results that is logically feasible,
   called the effective space of competition, which varies with the number
   of observable parties. We apply this reductionist view to analysing
   outcomes in three leading plurality rule systems (the USA, India and
   Great Britain), focusing on evidence of the Duvergerian psychological
   effect acting on voters during campaign periods. The Effective
   Competition Space view illuminates some key differences across
   countries, and variations with rising numbers of parties competing. We
   next consider a more holistic approach, the crown' diagram, which links
   electoral district outcomes more closely to the most important
   politico-ideological dimension in each country. Both views suggest some
   tentative evolutionary hypotheses for the variegated development of
   plurality rule systems over time. Britain is a highly nationalized party
   system, but one that has moved substantially away from Duvergerian
   predictions of two-party focusing, and towards multiparty politics. The
   USA seems to be a case of stunted development'. India shows a partial
   Duvergerian conformity, yet combined with a substantial vertical scatter
   of non-Duvergerian results. Applications to over-time and regional
   analysis within countries are also sketched.},

Abstract = {This article examines the relationship among a country's democratic
   experience, its level of economic development, and the prevalence of
   clientelistic and programmatic modes of democratic accountability. In
   contrast to the commonly accepted wisdom that clientelistic politics
   will decrease monotonically as a country's economy develops and its
   democracy consolidates, the authors argue theoretically and demonstrate
   empirically that clientelism tends in fact to increase as a country
   moves from low to intermediate levels of democracy and development. They
   also uncover preliminary evidence that a history of regime instability
   may have independent consequences on the prevalence of one or the other
   linkage mechanism. Finally, the results suggest that a country's level
   of economic development and exposure to the international economy are
   more consistent predictors of programmatic effort and coherence than are
   measures of a country's regime type.},

Abstract = {The course of post-socialist transformation in East Germany as opposed
   to Lithuania differed significantly. East Germany represents a sponsored
   transition to capitalism. In Lithuania, the transition to a market
   democracy was abrupt and radical. The biographies of two youths on the
   threshold of vocational training and professional life show the effects
   of altered social realities on their prospects for life and social
   relations. The lack of reliable rules and routines, the social
   acceleration, and all the accompanying uncertainties shaped their
   visions of the future and their values to varying degrees.},

Abstract = {Russia once again has voluntary militias. As in Soviet times, they
   monitor public space, help fight crime, and serve to keep society in
   line. They are also used to suppress political protests. The militias'
   advocates emphasize that the militias give young people an opportunity
   to become model citizens. The people's patrols embody a form of
   state-sponsored engagement on behalf of civil society. The fact that
   hundreds of thousands of young people volunteer for these militias shows
   the extent of conformity on behalf of the Putin regime. The traditional
   theory that government bodies and organisations of civil society stand
   opposite one another does not apply here. The patrols' proponents have
   not succeeded in winning recognition for the voluntary militias as a
   generally accepted model for young people.},

Abstract = {After the World War Two and the advent of the totalitarian phenomenon,
   the problem of evil becomes a central topic of Hannah Arendt's
   reflections. In The Origins of Totalitarianism, Arendt takes the Kantian
   concept of radical evil and redefines it to make reference to the
   actions of Nazi totalitarian regime. Such redefinition is essential
   because she concludes, without explaining or justifying this statement,
   that Kantian reflections on evil are insufficient to understand what
   toke place in Germany during the Nazi regime. Hence, it is necessary to
   resignify the notion of radical evil or to incorporate the concept of
   banal evil. The aim of this paper is to show that it is possible to give
   substance to that claim. The article is structured as follows: at first,
   I introduce the Arendtian reflection on evil. Second, I present the
   Bernstein and Marrades reviews for a critical approach to this problem.
   Finally I will examine Eichmann's attitude in reference to the Kant's
   three propensities to evil.},

Abstract = {This article examines electoral cycles in legislative budget decisions.
   Where local structures play an important role in candidate selection and
   election, legislators' incentives to amend the executive spending
   proposal can depend on the proximity of elections, leading to more
   spendthrift behavior in the run-up to popular votes. However, stringent
   budget institutions can counteract this tendency. Using a unique dataset
   of executive spending proposals and approved budgets in Sweden, I find
   strong empirical support for these predictions. Future studies of
   electoral cycles should pay greater attention to separating the
   contributions of the legislative and executive stages of the budgetary
   process and the conditions that foster electoral cyclicality in
   legislatures.},

Abstract = {Focusing on case studies of five different petitions systems, but also
   drawing on the Coalition governments new e-petitions system, this
   article identifies a number of characteristics of petitions systems. It
   argues that as a tool for participation they have the potential to act
   as a significant input to representative forms of democracy by providing
   a mechanism to enable the public to express their views to those in
   elected representative institutions. While there may be challenges
   associated with this, petitions systems may help underpin the legitimacy
   and functioning of representative institutions.},

Abstract = {Empirical models of spatial voting allow legislators' locations in a
   policy or ideological space to be inferred from their roll-call votes.
   These are typically random utility models where the features of the
   utility functions other than the ideal points are assumed rather than
   estimated. In this article, we first consider a model in which
   legislators' utility functions are allowed to be a mixture of the two
   most commonly assumed utility functions: the quadratic function and the
   Gaussian function assumed by NOMINATE. Across many roll-call data sets,
   we find that legislators' utility functions are estimated to be very
   nearly Gaussian. We then relax the usual assumption that each legislator
   is equally sensitive to policy change and find that extreme legislators
   are generally more sensitive to policy change than their more centrally
   located counterparts. This result suggests that extremists are more
   ideologically rigid while moderates are more likely to consider
   influences that arise outside liberal-conservative conflict.},

Abstract = {Disasters of last 12 years (e.g. 9/11 attacks, influenza, Haiti
   earthquake, Eyjafjallajokull volcano eruption, global financial crisis
   and Japan nuclear disaster) are changing the risk perception of 21st
   century rapidly. The inevitable consequence of this was a remarkable
   breakthrough in the management methodologies developed to better deal
   with disasters, mitigate their impacts and assure the continuity of
   mission critical activities. Business Continuity and Crisis Management
   underpin those methodologies. The primary goal of this study is to get
   to first base with the emergent holistic approach in the community, by
   clarifying concepts frequently causing confusion in praxis. In this
   respect, following the identification of the interference between
   Business Continuity and Crisis Management, the drivers of a successful
   crisis communication - the most critical element of Crisis Management -
   are being studied and exemplified by a case study.},

Abstract = {Previous research suggests that women tend to be marginalized in
   legislatures or denied access to important agenda-setting resources that
   reduce their effectiveness as legislators after gaining office. However,
   previous studies have not been able to disentangle competing theoretical
   explanations for this marginalization. Some suggest it is due to
   explicit gender discrimination, while others suggest institutional norms
   such as incumbency are to blame. We address this puzzle with data from
   the Mexican Chamber of Deputies, an institution without incumbency, by
   examining gender differences in rates of bill sponsorship, bill passage
   rates, and committee assignments before and after the adoption of gender
   quotas. We find little evidence that female legislators are marginalized
   in the Mexican Chamber of Deputies, tentatively suggesting incumbency,
   rather than discrimination, may explain evidence of marginalization in
   other legislatures. Furthermore, we find little evidence to support the
   notion that implementing gender quotas has negative consequences.},

Abstract = {The Russian Orthodox Church hardly deals with sexuality and gender
   issues. Instead, it just refers to tradition. In its ``Social
   Doctrine{''} from 2000, the church condemns homosexuality as a
   perversion. In the meantime, the state has also adopted this position.
   For the state, this has even less to do with religion and morality than
   for the church. Homophobia is rather a part of the regime's anti-Western
   propaganda. It also weakens those circles within the church who are
   betting on a modernisation of theology.},

Abstract = {Many malpractices generate flawed elections which fail to meet
   international standards of electoral integrity, including issues such as
   fraud, malpractice, vote-rigging, ballot-stuffing, and voter
   suppression. Determining when, where and why elections succeed or fail
   is a matter of growing concern for the international community-yet to
   date scholars and practitioners have been hindered by lack of reliable,
   credible and consistent evidence which could be used to compare the
   quality of elections around the world. This paper presents the first
   results of a new pilot study, based on an expert survey of Perceptions
   of Electoral Integrity applied to 20 countries. This data facilitates
   comparison of an overall standardized 100-point PEI index for each
   contest, or the results can be examined in more fine-grained detail for
   eleven dimensions of electoral integrity, or for each of the separate 49
   items. The PEI index demonstrates high levels of external validity,
   internal validity, and legitimacy. The paper concludes that, when
   triangulated with other evidence, PEI can address many research issues,
   such as how best to classify electoral autocracies, as well as proving
   useful for policymakers concerned with evaluating ``what works{''} to
   strengthen electoral integrity.},

Abstract = {Etienne de La Boe ` tie (1530-63) is a central, if enigmatic, figure in
   modern French political philosophy. While his name is most famous for
   his friendship with Montaigne, his Discours de la servitude volontaire
   (Discourse of Voluntary Servitude) is a tour-de-force of humanist
   political writing, a youthful paean to liberty arguing that subjection
   to tyrants is the result of popular corruption. This article argues that
   the text can be read as a reflection on the perils and promise of
   transparency. Reading La Boe ` tie helps us see two radically different
   ways in which members of a polity can be known to one another - two
   models of transparency - and it offers an important, but ultimately
   unsettling, political ideal based on a classical conception of civic
   friendship. The article draws out the importance of this ideal for
   modern anti-corruption efforts.},

Abstract = {Studying the development of stable political attitudes, political
   scientists have argued that repeated voting for a political party
   reinforces initial party preferences, in a seemingly mechanistic process
   of habit-formation. However, the empirical evidence is scarce and the
   theoretical framework underdeveloped. Does the act of voting for a party
   improve an individual's evaluation of this party? If so, is this effect
   simply due to habit-formation, or a more complex psychological
   mechanism? Drawing on cognitive dissonance theory, we examine the act of
   voting as a choice inducing dissonance reduction. We go beyond existing
   research, by focusing on tactical voters-a group for which the notion of
   habitual reinforcement does not predict an effect. The analyses reveal a
   positive effect of the act of voting tactically on the preferences for
   the parties voted for and may thus call for a revision of the
   traditional understanding of the role of voting in shaping party
   preferences.},

Abstract = {Theories of political culture have traditionally been based on how the
   mass public views the role of government, yet scholars have rarely
   studied this issue. Using American National Election Studies(ANES) data
   from 1952 to 2008, I track cultural changes in external efficacy, a
   measure of the public's beliefs about government responsiveness. The
   aggregate- and individual-level results indicate that external efficacy
   varied across political cultures until around 1980, when the differences
   dissipated. These findings should cause scholars to question some of the
   underlying theoretical basis of political culture, as well as the
   measurement of external efficacy.},

Abstract = {This article explores the intellectual roots of Canada's foreign policy
   as conceived and promoted by David Bercuson and Barry Cooper, two
   prominent members of the ``Calgary School{''} and public intellectuals
   credited with influencing the Harper government's view of the world.
   While their notion of Canada's foreign policy can be simply boiled down
   to their belief that Canada should align with the foreign policy of the
   United States, it is, in fact, more complex. Bercuson and Cooper's
   vision of Canada's foreign policy blends in a distinct way their own
   understanding of Canadian history and the original intent behind
   Canadian Confederation; their particular conception of international
   relations; philosophical and anthropological reflections on violence;
   and their typically Western Canadian political consciousness.},

   blame and reward incumbent governments for their perceived economic
   performance? In addressing these questions, the current paper fills an
   important void left by the extant literature by adopting a large-n
   approach with the use of public opinion survey data and by focusing on
   emerging democracies of the developing world. The proposed analysis
   develops a series of incumbent support models to assess the impact of
   economic assessments. It relies on the use of public opinion survey data
   from countries of Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa, South and East
   Asia, and the Arab world. The paper contributes to the extant literature
   at the empirical, methodological, and theoretical levels. Empirically,
   it provides a unique and systematic account of the phenomenon through a
   large-scale comparative approach. Theoretically, it contributes to the
   debate on the value of economic voting to explain electoral behavior in
   the developing world. Methodologically, it shows that using presidential
   approval is a fair alternative to vote choice and that a full model
   specification is not absolutely necessary to estimating the economic
   effect. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The core argument put forward in this article is a criticism of the idea
   of politics undergirding the revival of republicanism. The first two
   sections take issue with Pettit's and Bellamy's versions of
   constitutional republicanism and they show why and how both authors are
   not taking politics very seriously. The third section introduces
   constituent power as a necessary feature of a republican theory and the
   last section, by exploring this intuition, proposes a reflexive
   understanding of republican politics. The main tenet of this reflexivity
   is a radical understanding of disagreement, which turns constituent
   power into the foundation of republican politics.},

Journal = {SCANDINAVIAN POLITICAL STUDIES},

Volume = {36},

Pages = {270-292},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This article nuances the picture given in current research of Swedish
   policy implementation and planning as consistent and predictable, and
   Norwegian policy implementation and planning as more unpredictable and
   fragmented. It does so by adding a discussion of the sources of
   legitimacy in each of the two national settings, arguing that each
   system has its distinct pros and cons. The Swedish planning system and
   local plan practices rest more firmly on a hierarchical mode of
   governance which is strong on operational efficiency, but suffers from a
   weaker sense of ownership to the plan outcome among private and civil
   society actors. In the Norwegian planning system and local plan
   practices, a combination of hierarchical and interactive governance
   measures, boasts a broader anchorage and resource division among public,
   private and civil society actors. However, this system experiences a
   lower operational efficiency due to the willingness to reconsider former
   decisions in order to find a viable compromise among different
   stakeholders in local plan processes, as well as stronger fragmentation
   due to the privatization of Norwegian detail planning. The empirical
   basis of the article is: a comparison of the two countries' plan
   legislation in terms of the inclusion of non-public actors in plan
   provision and plan formulation; and four case studies of planning
   processes concerning the future use of an urban green area.},

Abstract = {Multi-party politics alters the dynamics of party competition in
   Westminster elections. In a case study of the Conservative Party and the
   UK Independence Party (UKIP), theories of niche versus mainstream party
   competition are used to examine the strategies adopted by a soft
   Eurosceptic mainstream party and hard Eurosceptic niche party as they
   compete on the issue of European integration. These theories are also
   extended to look at how niche parties react to their mainstream
   competitors' strategies. In competition with UKIP, the Conservatives
   have both developed a distinctive soft Eurosceptic position and defused
   the EU issue. With Conservative policies diluted in coalition
   government, UKIP has targeted disillusioned Conservative voters. It has
   sought to raise the salience of the EU issue and highlight its radical
   position while also developing a broader narrative. The findings suggest
   that mainstream parties may adopt more than one strategy simultaneously
   and that niche parties may react to mainstream parties' adversarial
   strategies by emphasising differences and attempting to widen their
   appeal.},

Abstract = {Scholars view the domestic and foreign commitments of the New Deal and
   Great Society as embodying rights with quasi-constitutional status. But
   little research has examined whether presidents have encouraged citizens
   to perceive New Deal/Great Society commitments as rights deserving of
   extraordinary veneration. Based on a quantitative content analysis of
   hundreds of major presidential addresses and a qualitative analysis of
   inaugural addresses over the period 1933-2011, this article shows that
   presidents have largely declined to characterize major domestic
   commitments as rights but that they have repeatedly described the United
   States' mission in foreign affairs in terms of protecting human rights.},

Title = {A Way Out of the Civil War in Syria Power Sharing instead of a Regional
   Conflagration},
Journal = {OSTEUROPA},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {63},
Number = {9},
Pages = {3+},

Abstract = {In Syria, the civilian uprising against an authoritarian regime has
   become a civil war and proxy war. There is a risk that the conflict
   could escalate and turn into a regional conflagration. Neither military
   intervention from abroad, nor a one-sided military victory offers a
   solution. Each risks expansion of the conflict. Only a political
   solution with the inclusion of external mediators such as Russia and
   Iran can offer a way out. The goal should first be power-sharing. After
   that, it would be a matter of creating integrating government
   structures. Lebanon offers a model. There, a fifteen-year civil war was
   ended with the compromise formula ``no victor, no vanquished{''}.},

Abstract = {In what has quickly become one of the bloodiest and most protracted of
   the uprisings across the Arab world, Syria's revolution has attracted a
   breadth of coverage and academic research into the now ailing Ba'ath
   party and its historical stranglehold on power. This article will
   explore the use of the image and spectacle as methods of control and
   discipline under the rule of Hafiz and Bashar Al-Assad, and how they
   have been subverted through new media to create a counter-hegemonic
   cultural discourse. The complex relationship between image and
   subversion in Syria will be teased out using the works of Jacques
   Rancisre, Michel Foucault, and Guy Debord.},

Abstract = {This paper attempts to examine the paradigm shift in ASEAN from a
   state-based to a people-based organization. We argue that by adopting a
   people-based organization, ASEAN now enters an era of
   Neo-Communitarianism replacing the Old Communitarianism of the old
   generation of ASEAN. By using communitarian perspectives, we look at the
   continuities and changes in ASEAN with regard to how it deals with
   issues involving their members. Three important issues namely the
   debates on intervention principle; the adoption of the three pillars of
   the ASEAN Community; and the inclusion of human rights are seen as the
   signposts where ASEAN departs from their Old to a Neo-Communitarianism.
   Although there have been a lot of challenges to the realization of the
   people-based organization, we see that the dynamics of debates and the
   active participation of the community in the debates show good prospects
   for the new paradigm to realize. In this paper, we use debate on the
   formation of ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights (ICHR),
   to show the involvements of people in setting the agendas for the future
   ASEAN.},

Title = {THE IMPACT OF STATE POLICY CAPACITY ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF ENERGY POLICY
   IN GERMANY: A CASE STUDY OF THE `NEW ENERGY PARADIGM'},
Journal = {POLITICKA MISAO-CROATIAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {50},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Under the circumstances of increasingly visible climate change, most
   notably in the phenomenon of global warming, it has become more and more
   clear that the energy industry based on the exploitation of fossil fuels
   has significantly contributed to this development. Therefore, many
   countries acknowledge the need for a policy paradigm shift in the field
   of energy policy, which implies an increased relying on renewable energy
   sources and the improvement of energy efficiency. The author conducts a
   case study of Germany - a forerunner in European efforts to link the
   energy industry based on renewable sources and environmental protection,
   and also on maintaining the security of energy supply. The paper tests
   whether this orientation of Germany is based on its policy capacity -
   ``the ability to marshal the necessary resources to make intelligent
   collective choices about and set strategic directions for the allocation
   of scarce resources to public ends{''} (Painter i Pierre, 2005: 2), and
   concludes that it is the internal state determinants, rather than policy
   diffusion, which have played a central role in Germany's attainment of a
   leadership position in the accomplishment of the ``new energy
   paradigm{''}.},

Abstract = {The article identifies a number of fundamental flaws concerning the
   Icelandic government's economic handling and administrative working
   practices, which contributed to the scale of the 2008 crash. At the same
   time, it argues that the authorities altogether failed to take account
   of the risk associated with the country's small size during the
   Icelandic `out-vasion'. It claims that small-state studies need to move
   back to the basics and consider the original small-states literature,
   such as the small domestic market, the use of a small currency and the
   weaknesses associated with a small public administration, in order to
   fully understand the reasons for the Icelandic economic meltdown. A
   small state needs to acknowledge its limitations and take appropriate
   measures to compensate for them.},

Abstract = {The general objective of this research is to analyze the political
   tendency of teenagers in regard to the political party identification of
   their parents in order to reveal the existence, or lack of an
   emotional-affective relationship transmitted from generation to
   generation in constructing a mutual partisan-ideological identification;
   in other words, the transmission of values from parents to children as a
   product of the family socialization. In the methodological aspect, a
   structured interview is applied to teenagers from 17 to 18 years of age
   who are about to get involved in political life, and to their parents.
   The instrument is used separately for each family member. The sampling
   is intentional. Results highlight the following: in the five cases
   analyzed, despite the slight political party and ideological education
   of the parents, there is a general trend indicating that children are
   influenced by their values, loyalties and beliefs in the sphere of party
   interests and sympathies for political action groups or parties, based
   always on an affective-emotional relationship. At the same time, a
   certain influence from a secondary socialization process is in evidence,
   especially from the mass media-television, newspapers and social
   networks-and companions.},

Abstract = {This study aims to analyze the participation of indigenous peoples in
   the popular election processes generated from recognition of their
   political rights in Venezuela's 1999 Constitution of Bolivarian Republic
   and the 2005 Organic Law of Indigenous Peoples and Communities, in the
   framework of election processes for representatives to the Venezuelan
   legislature over a period of about ten years. Analysis of the voting
   behavior of indigenous actors is oriented to an institutional focus on
   the party system category. This is a descriptive, analytical study
   supported by the epistemological approach of phenomenology as a method
   of study that involves interpreting phenomena as perceived. Information
   was collected primarily approaching the members of these cultural
   groups. Analysis reveals that indigenous participation in political
   terms is still limited by a range of social, economic, cultural and even
   political factors; despite the recognized rights, there is no freedom or
   independence when voting or electing representatives, since this is
   still subjected to the influence exercised by the electoral campaigns of
   large partisan groups.},

Abstract = {Historically, the theory of democracy has been separated into useless
   processes which made it, comparatively, less capable to explain the
   reality of the management neither of the public nor of the state
   business. Hence, the entry into the public arena by democracy always
   refers to the democratic issue. Therefore, democracy cannot offer an
   explanation of any electoral process carried out within itself. In this
   article, a review of the major democratic approaches will be presented
   in order to contrast them then with the economic theory of democracy in
   terms of judging its explanatory power given the reality of is Colombian
   history: Based on the last legislative elections, the study of the
   pragmatics of any party is order, in the present case of the Colombian
   Conservative Party, an example of the creation of elites in a democratic
   system, that, rather than rebuilding, comfortably maintained the
   nation's conservative representation in the Congress of the Republic of
   Colombia.},

Abstract = {Recent research on political representation in new democracies indicates
   that the quality of representation in Latin America and Central and
   Eastern Europe is substandard when compared to the older, Western
   democracies. There are, however, theoretical reasons to presume that
   microstates form an exception to this rule, especially in light of the
   natural closeness between citizens and politicians in these states. On
   the basis of an in-depth, qualitative analysis of the characteristics
   and quality of political representation in the microstates of St. Kitts
   and Nevis, Seychelles, and Palau, this expectation is rejected. Instead,
   it is found that the small-scale political dimensions of microstates
   engender a political environment that is marked by personalistic
   politics and the pervasiveness of various forms of particularism.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the question of what shapes a voter's sense of duty
   to vote. We begin with a standard model of turnout at the 2011 British
   electoral system referendum. We show that the respondent's assessment of
   whether it is a citizen's duty to vote on referendums adds substantial
   explanatory power to a basic model of turnout. From here we move to
   examine what drives that sense of duty. We find that assessments of duty
   are structured by evaluations of politics and politicians. Low interest
   in politics, low political efficacy, and low regard for politicians
   correspond with less support for the idea that citizens have a duty to
   vote on referendums and at other elections. These findings have
   implications for accounts of turnout decline that stress the effects of
   a public that is exposed to negative portraits of politics and
   politicians. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {This article tests the density dependence theory on the population of
   Danish patient groups from 1901 to 2011. The theory states that the
   formation of interest groups can be explained by the number of groups in
   the population. The density dependence theory is a population theory,
   and these have successfully been applied to interest group populations
   in pluralist systems such as the American. However, they have only
   rarely been applied to corporative systems. As there are important
   differences between pluralist and corporative systems regarding how
   interest groups are integrated in the policy process, the interest group
   populations can be expected to develop in different ways. Therefore, the
   article explores whether and how population theories work in corporative
   systems by testing the density dependence theory on the population of
   Danish patient groups. The article conducts a graphical and a
   statistical analysis on a new and comprehensive data set with founding
   and disbanding years for all Danish patient groups from 1901 to 2011.
   The findings support the expectations of the theory as the density of
   the population has a positive and curvilinear effect on the founding
   rate. However, they also indicate that corporative structures may
   suppress the population mechanisms that are often found to drive the
   development of interest group populations in pluralist systems. This
   suggests that population theories can also be applied to corporative
   systems and that they can contribute to answer the much discussed
   question about interest group formation.},

   convergence of paths towards the catch-all party. Was there a path
   specific for the Christian Democratic Party strand in Western Europe,
   which has been so far neglected by party theory? By applying a
   periodisation, the initial status of the CDU after its foundation, the
   development of this initial path and its impact on the transformation to
   the catch-all party model are outlined in the article. The results
   challenge the convergence hypothesis showing that the historical path of
   one party family may bring about a specific pattern of party change. The
   evolutionary path of the CDU with its strong continuities from the
   Centre Party started out differently to the ideal-type path. The
   long-term impact of this path produced a specific variety of party that
   was less centralised, less professionalised and less democratically
   rooted than the model implies. Thus party theory needs more explicitly
   to separate the path of the Christian Democrats from the ideal-type
   evolutionary path or paths of any other party family.},

Abstract = {Scholars have argued that U.S. presidents use their judicial
   appointments to advance their political goals. However, on rare
   occasions, presidents nominate people who are not members of their
   political party to the judiciary. This study will examine the factors
   that affect the probability of a cross-party judicial nomination
   occurring, in order to better understand the goals that presidents are
   seeking to advance through these unusual actions. Looking at nominations
   to United States federal circuit courts and district courts between 1977
   through 2004, the study finds that, controlling for a number of relevant
   factors, a greater number of opposition senators from a state and a
   higher level of electoral competition between the Republican and
   Democratic parties in a state increase the probability that a president
   will name someone from outside of his party from that state to a federal
   court vacancy. The findings support the hypothesis that presidents make
   cross-party judicial nominations to further their partisan electoral
   objectives, and as a response to institutional pressure from opposition
   senators through the use of Senate rules.},

   considered to be part of a conceptual geographization process, trade is
   not as important as it is in other areas. Also, China has differentiated
   economic relations with the CACZ countries; this article shows that
   trade is only one dimension of a complex growing relationship.},

Abstract = {The literature on global production networks (GPNs) and global
   commodity/ value chains has generally conceptualised small firms as
   being at the bottom of the commodity chain hierarchy, and thus
   subordinate to larger firms. As a consequence, small firms and their
   employees are typically imagined to be fairly powerless to shape the
   structure of GPNs. By way of contrast, in this paper we argue that small
   firms and their employees are not lacking in the capacity to affect the
   way GPNs and commodity chains develop, but can in fact shape them in
   potentially significant ways. This recognition becomes evident if,
   instead of starting any analysis of small firms in GPNs with the
   governance structures of production networks or managerial strategies,
   we instead start the analysis with the organisation and control of the
   labour process in concrete settings, and tie this to broader
   understandings of uneven and combined development under capitalism.},

Abstract = {This article takes an unconventional approach to the issue of `race'. It
   illustrates the complexity and inter-disciplinarity of the racial
   phenomenon by blending child-like and adult-like perspectives and, as
   such, it is written half as a fable and half as an academic article. It
   puts forward a number of arguments. First, the piece suggests that five
   key dimensions of racism exist-namely, the historical, the
   philosophical, the scientific, the legal and the economic-and that they
   are regularly used to justify and rationalise something (racial
   prejudice) that is often irrational. Second, the article highlights the
   `banality' of racism-an attitude that stems from mankind's diffidence
   towards diversity, exploits such fear and encourages forms of passivity
   that, as Hannah Arendt noted, are the best way of `banalising' evil and
   making it appear tolerable. The fanciful classifications of `races'-such
   as those articulated in South Africa's apartheid, where poor Chinese
   were regarded as `yellows' while wealthy Japanese were classified as
   `honorary whites'-are cases in point. Third, the piece argues that
   racial discrimination is often unrecognised, internalised and
   unquestioned by society: since racial attitudes are learnt in childhood
   and become part of our cultural baggage, they are extremely difficult to
   identify and eradicate. Finally, the article suggests that racism is not
   only `banal' but also highly convenient: racists do not need to know the
   individual, they just need to know the characteristics of the group to
   which that individual is thought to belong. The piece concludes in
   favour of a neglected right for children: the right to be left free from
   racism.},

Abstract = {Disappointment is a familiar experience of political life and often
   blame for perceived political failure is rightly attributed to the
   failures of our politicians or the political system. The aim of this
   paper, however, is to argue that disappointment is an inevitable feature
   of politics because of limitations and constraints that are intrinsic to
   the political sphere. With this in mind the paper explores some of the
   ways in which political conflict unavoidably generates disappointment,
   how it shapes the specific manner in which its corollary of hope and the
   discourse of hope operates in the political sphere, and how
   disappointment relates to questions of political unity. Appreciating the
   inevitability of disappointment should both help overcome some of the
   prevalent illusions regarding political possibility, as well as calm our
   discontent with politics by adapting our expectations and assessment of
   political life accordingly.},

Abstract = {In this essay, we discuss the usefulness and meaning of empirical models
   of economic voting that rely on measures of individual economic
   perceptions. The effort is motivated by the recent reappearance of a
   long-standing critique of the use of economic perceptions data in
   individual level economic voting studies, with a consequent call for the
   use of aggregate data, which suggests that variation in perceptions must
   reflect noise or error because there can be only one ``real{''} state of
   the national economy applicable to all respondents in any national
   survey. We show, however, that this critique (and its corresponding
   prescriptions for how to specify empirical models of economic voting) is
   based on a misunderstanding about (1) the theoretical concepts called
   for by the leading theories of economic voting (and that we should be
   trying to measure), (2) the nature of the economy that individuals can
   actually observe (it is a distribution of possible states, not a point)
   and, consequently, (3) the interpretation of correlations between
   individual economic perceptions and electoral support. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {How does regime change affect the risk of militarized disputes? Within
   the democratic peace literature, there is disagreement over whether it
   is democratization, autocratization, political dissimilarity or
   political instability that is particularly perilous. I distinguish four
   perspectives from this literature and test their attendant hypotheses on
   a dataset of conflict episodes within enduring rivalry from 1816 to 2001
   using survival analysis. I find that both democratization and
   autocratization reduce the hazard of dispute recurrence in enduring
   rivalries. After controlling for selection bias, the effect of
   democratization was robust whereas the effect of autocratization was
   not. Democratization also has the additional property of terminating
   rivalries; autocratization does not. Together, the results imply that
   democratization is better at promoting a transition from rivalry to
   peaceful relations than is the autocratization of a rivalry dyad.},

Abstract = {In theoretical debates about the quality of democratic rule, the core
   question concerns membership, and the adequate constitution of the
   demos: who is entitled to participate in choosing political
   representatives? This article enhances the predominantly normative
   debates on democratic inclusion and boundary making by taking an
   empirical perspective and analysing attitudes of 16-18-year-old
   teenagers regarding preconditions for the distribution of voting rights.
   Based on data stemming from 13 focus groups conducted in three Austrian
   cities in spring 2010, our findings show that principles related to both
   competence (autonomy, knowledge) and community (showing concern, being
   subjected to the law) matter when it comes to democratic boundary
   making. Furthermore, the study reveals that, in trying to explain the
   formation of juvenile attitudes about boundary issues, institutions are
   relevant when related to the conjunctive experiences manifested in the
   group-specific habitus: while young immigrants argue more inclusionarily
   than natives in terms of community-related preconditions, especially as
   far as the roles of language and citizenship are concerned, students
   argue more exclusionarily than apprentices when it comes to
   competence-related preconditions, especially civic education. Boundary
   making affects social groups independent of national origin or
   citizenship and can therefore be considered a permanent process beyond
   international migration.},

Volume = {107},

Abstract = {Theories of instrumental ethnic voting in new democracies propose that
   voters support co-ethnic politicians because they expect politicians to
   favor their co-ethnics once in office. But many goods that politicians
   deliver to voters are locally nonexcludable in rural areas, so the local
   presence of an ethnic group associated with a politician should affect a
   rural voter's assessment of how likely she is to benefit from that
   politician's election. Using geocoded polling-station-level election
   results alongside survey data from Ghana, we show that otherwise similar
   voters are less likely to vote for the party of their own ethnic group,
   and more likely to support a party associated with another group, when
   the local ethnic geography favors the other group. This result helps
   account for the imperfect correlation between ethnicity and vote choice
   in African democracies. More generally, this demonstrates how local
   community and geographic contexts can modify the information conveyed by
   ethnicity and influence voter behavior.},

Abstract = {We offer the first large scale, multiple source analysis of the outcome
   of what may be the most extensive effort to selectively censor human
   expression ever implemented. To do this, we have devised a system to
   locate, download, and analyze the content of millions of social media
   posts originating from nearly 1,400 different social media services all
   over China before the Chinese government is able to find, evaluate, and
   censor (i.e., remove from the Internet) the subset they deem
   objectionable. Using modern computer-assisted text analytic methods that
   we adapt to and validate in the Chinese language, we compare the
   substantive content of posts censored to those not censored over time in
   each of 85 topic areas. Contrary to previous understandings, posts with
   negative, even vitriolic, criticism of the state, its leaders, and its
   policies are not more likely to be censored. Instead, we show that the
   censorship program is aimed at curtailing collective action by silencing
   comments that represent, reinforce, or spur social mobilization,
   regardless of content. Censorship is oriented toward attempting to
   forestall collective activities that are occurring now or may occur in
   the future-and, as such, seem to clearly expose government intent.},

Abstract = {One of the most important events in U.S. congressional history is the
   1910 revolt against Speaker Cannon. The rebellion had myriad
   ramifications for the inner workings of the House of Representatives and
   dramatically altered the chamber's power structure. Despite its
   significance, we do not have a clear understanding of the character of
   the revolt and why the 42 Republican insurgents revoked their allegiance
   to Cannon and their party. Did the insurgents rebel because of their
   strong progressive ideals or for more pragmatic reasons, such as
   political survival or retribution? Using data gathered from Cannon's
   personal papers and other sources, we systematically explore disparate
   explanations credited for the revolt. For the progressive core of the
   insurgency, our analysis indicates that policy differences drove their
   behavior. These early insurgents were later joined by a group of less
   progressive members who appear to have supported the rebellion for
   electoral and retaliative reasons.},

Abstract = {How can the long process of change in Italian democracy (1992-2012) be
   analysed and explained? Answering this question requires placing the
   phenomenon of macro-political change of a democracy within a theoretical
   framework that will give answers to other questions: How should a
   transition from one type of democracy to another be analysed; have there
   been other cases of such a transition; what happened in Italy that
   brought about a change from a democracy to another one? By developing a
   theoretical proposal and providing a set of empirical data, replies are
   suggested to those questions and an explanation is given. Comparative

Abstract = {Zachar Prilepin is a star in his homeland. His first novel, translated
   into German, was enthusiastically received in this country as well.
   Apparently, a crucial role in this reception is played less by the
   literary quality of his work than by his colourful personality. Prilepin
   is considered a ``leftwing radical{''} and staunch opponent of Vladmir
   Putin. In fact, he represents a populist mixture of nationalism,
   resentments, and Soviet nostalgia.},

Abstract = {This article argues that the incentives to spend time and resources
   engaging with non-academic groups are largely absent for early career
   researchers, who are usually focused on acquiring the essential elements
   of a good academic CV, namely publishing articles in peer-reviewed
   journals, gaining teaching experience and presenting papers at
   disciplinary conferences. As a result, early career researchers have
   little reason to undertake training in how to engage with non-academic
   groups, and institutions have no reason to make such training integral
   to a researcher's professional development. However, a survey of early
   career researchers in the UK conducted for this article shows that there
   is a definite appetite among researchers to undertake public engagement
   activities. But if public engagement is to become a routine part of a
   researcher's activities then the weight that potential employers afford
   to these endeavours needs to increase substantially.},

Journal = {FRENCH POLITICS},

Abstract = {Even though the territorial dimension of the European representative
   mandate may be a key element for European Union's legitimization, it
   remains overlooked in academic literature. This article explores this
   statement by analysing the EP's French delegation, which includes
   several interesting features with regard to territorial representation.
   The article is structured around three research questions: how do French
   Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) deal with the territorial
   dimension of their mandate? Why are there some variations regarding
   focus of representation? To what extent does their focus of
   representation affect their role orientation? Relying on the results of
   37 interviews with French MEPs using both closed and open-ended
   questions, we demonstrate that the MEPs develop a composite view of
   representation and display some variations in terms of focus of
   representation. Those variations are explained mostly through the
   actor's political orientations and socio-biographic characteristics. We
   also understand that the focus of representation has some effect on how
   French MEPs conceive their mandate.},

Abstract = {Scholarship on race-and class-based disparities in regulatory outcomes
   has failed to provide a theoretically grounded account of this bias'
   origin. We address this shortcoming by providing a microlevel
   explanation of how demographics influence compliance bias or the failure
   to detect noncompliant firms. We argue that regulatory compliance is
   best understood as a dual-agent-firm and regulatory officer-production
   function, and that community mobilization and agency decision-making
   authority shape bureaucrats' incentives to report noncompliance. We test
   our argument with an original dataset on community mobilization and
   agency structure that delineates the political costs and benefits of
   state regulatory officers implementing the U.S. Clean Air Act. Using
   detection-controlled estimation, we find that while certain communities
   are vulnerable to compliance bias, such bias is mitigated in the
   presence of either politically mobilized communities or decentralized
   enforcement authority within the implementing agency.},

Abstract = {Few people inside or outside government have had a greater impact on
   public policy in Australia than Ross Garnaut. His report in 1990
   provided a blueprint for Australia's economic engagement' with Asia,
   whether or not one agreed with its underlying logic and analysis. The
   reception of his report on climate change in 2011 could hardly have been
   more different. Why is it that some ideas enjoy wide support from
   influential actors and are enthusiastically taken up by policymakers,
   while others struggle to gain traction, even when backed by government?
   This paper provides some possible answers to this puzzle by identifying
   factors that facilitate or obstruct the influence and impact of policy
   entrepreneurs'.},

Abstract = {This article critically examines the assumption that the spread of
   neoliberal policy programs of privatisation, deregulation and
   marketisation is explained principally by policymakers coming under the
   influence of fundamentalist neoliberal ideas and the think tanks through
   which they were proselytised. The article outlines the conditions that
   must be satisfied for this thesis of ideational causation to be
   considered plausible. By examining the relationship between neoliberal
   think tanks and the Howard Coalition government in Australia, the
   article offers indicative evidence against this dominant conceptual
   framework for understanding the rise of neoliberalism. It concludes that
   this narrative offers a poor guide to understanding actually existing
   neoliberalism.},

Abstract = {Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) play an active role in European and
   global governance, and many commentators see them as a link that
   connects the international level with citizens. But not all CSOs active
   at the international level do have a substantial number of members. The
   question we investigate in this article is to what extent membership
   distinguishes these CSOs from other transnational actors. To what extent
   do member and non-member CSOs differ in their roles and activities? Is
   it plausible to argue, as it quite often happens, that CSOs with members
   are more legitimate than others? On the basis of a survey of 60
   exemplary CSOs we find that membership CSOs neither differ substantially
   from non-member CSOs in their political behavior, nor do they differ in
   important aspects of legitimacy, such as transparency or efforts to
   include beneficiaries.},

Abstract = {The oldest definition of semi-presidentialism requires a president
   possessing considerable constitutional power. Subsequent research has
   listed presidential competences, but has not empirically set their
   respective weighting. In order to assess the relevant competences that
   determine presidential power, this article presents an indicator of
   relative turnout in 28 parliamentary democracies with a popularly
   elected president. The core hypothesis is that if presidents have
   considerable power, the turnout is higher for presidential elections
   than for legislative ones. The results show that presidents are deemed
   `strong' when they play a central role in foreign policy. This finding
   is compatible with different analyses of presidential regimes and
   provides a clear and coherent criterion for identifying
   semi-presidential regimes. Comparative European Politics (2013) 11,

Abstract = {Ronald Reagan was a larger-than-life individual, a formidable
   politician, and an important president. But as in all presidents, his
   character was complex, resulting in a presidency of paradoxes, marked by
   some great successes and some unfortunate failures. Both Reagan's
   successes and failures stemmed from his character and style of political
   leadership. Reagan's broad vision and clear direction made his political
   ideals appealing. But paradoxically, what made his policy victories
   possible was his willingness, when faced with political reality, to make
   pragmatic compromises without seeming to abandon his ideals. This
   article will examine these paradoxes by analyzing the Reagan
   administration's transition into office, the contrasting White House
   staffs of his two terms, and the high and low points of his national
   security policies.},

Abstract = {What motivations do voters have to vote for populist parties? How do
   their motivations differ from those of voters for mainstream parties?
   Analyzing new empirical material - the Dutch elections of 2006 and 2010
   - we demonstrate that policy preferences, protest attitudes and
   evaluations of party leaders are important reasons to vote for populist
   parties. Yet only protest attitudes distinguish voters for populist
   parties from voters for mainstream parties; evaluations of party leaders
   turn out to be equally important for both. We theorize how protest
   attitudes and party leader evaluations overlap and employ an exploratory
   simulation technique to test this. We find that populist parties differ
   strongly from each other with regard to the specific patchwork of
   motivations of their voters. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by

Abstract = {Figures from postelection surveys often grossly overestimate election
   turnout. Two distinct phenomena are responsible for this gap:
   overrepresentation of actual voters and vote misreporting by actual
   nonvoters among survey respondents. Previous accounts of turnout bias
   are inconclusive in that they either focus on a single component, or
   fail to separate between the two. In this paper, we formally decompose
   turnout bias in election surveys into its constituent parts, assess
   their empirical prevalence and heterogeneity using an extensive
   collection of 49 vote validation studies from six countries, and employ
   Bayesian meta regression techniques to account for cross-study
   differences. Our results indicate that both election and survey
   characteristics such as actual voter turnout and survey response rates
   differentially affect the components of turnout bias. We conclude with a
   discussion of the threats and potentials of our findings for
   survey-based comparative electoral research. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Women's continued political underrepresentation suggests that women
   candidates might be more likely than men to be `sacrificial lambs' -
   that is, more likely than men to serve as party standard bearers in
   districts where their party has little chance to win. Using data from
   the 2004-2011 Canadian federal elections, we find support for the
   sacrificial lamb hypothesis when district competitiveness is measured
   dynamically, rather than statically. Our dynamic measurement of district
   competitiveness further shows that women incumbents' seats are not as
   safe as are men's. We conclude that these two factors help to explain
   why women remain underrepresented in Canadian federal politics. (C) 2013

Abstract = {When a central government deals with local demands, it may strengthen
   political accountability of the local governments by political
   decentralization or offer benefits through economic assistance. An
   authoritarian regime uses economic assistance policy because political
   decentralization may contradict regime survival. Although economic
   benefits can be used to buy political support, the distribution of these
   benefits is seldom equal. We argue that the unequal distribution is more
   salient in regions where ethnic minorities reside because the unusual
   demographic composition of those areas make it difficult for the
   national government to evaluate the performance of the local government
   who is responsible for the distribution of the economic benefits. As a
   result, economic assistance may backfire in ethnic regions and intensify
   their existing conflicts. We develop a simple formal model to illustrate
   our arguments and explore the cases of Xinjiang and Hong Kong for
   empirical analysis.},

Abstract = {Starting in the 1960s, the Cold War provided only the outer framework
   for contemporary observation of Soviet development and actual historical
   research. Perhaps more influential than the Cold War were the starting
   conditions for the subject ``East European History{''}, which were
   marked by the Nazi era and the Second World War. The field underwent a
   professionalisation from journalistic observation to academia and, in
   terms of methodology, oriented itself away from ``the ethno- history{''}
   to structural and social history. The most important topics covered are
   the Second World War and German occupation, education and social
   stratification, studies on culture and ideology, the tension between
   terror and progress, as well as the comparison of dictatorships in the
   20th Century.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the effects of Mexico's drug war on security,
   migration, and the economy on the eastern U.S.-Mexico border between the
   state of Texas and the Mexican state of Tamaulipas. Both sides of the
   border are analyzed and compared simultaneously. The article shows that
   the extreme violence that Mexico is suffering has benefited U.S. border
   towns while having a negative impact on Tamaulipas. The positive effects
   of Mexico's violent spiral on U.S. border security and the U.S. border
   economy are evident, notwithstanding American public discourse and the
   reporting of U.S. media alleging the opposite.},

Abstract = {To what extent do personal circumstances, as compared to ideological
   dispositions, drive voters' preferences on welfare policy? Addressing
   this question is difficult because a person's ideological position can
   be an outcome of material interest rather than an independent source of
   preferences. The article deals with this empirical challenge using an
   original panel study carried out over four years, tracking the labor
   market experiences and the political attitudes of a national sample of
   Americans before and after the eruption of the financial crisis. The
   analysis shows that the personal experience of economic hardship,
   particularly the loss of a job, had a major effect on increasing support
   for welfare spending. This effect was appreciably larger among
   Republicans than among Democrats, a result that was not simply due to a
   ``ceiling effect.{''} However the large attitudinal shift was short
   lived, dissipating as individuals' employment situations improved. The
   results indicate that the personal experience of an economic shock has a
   sizable, yet overall transient effect on voters' social policy
   preferences.},

Journal = {AFRICAN JOURNAL ON CONFLICT RESOLUTION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {13},
Number = {2},
Pages = {11-37},
Abstract = {By engaging the colonial factor in African conflicts, this article seeks
   to understand the ineffectiveness of efforts at conflict management in
   overcoming the disasters that brought the conflicts to the African
   continent. It claims that conflict in Africa does not always stem
   primarily from crises of national governance and the failure of
   governmental institutions in African countries to mediate conflict, and
   revisits the colonial factor as the root of many conflicts in Africa.
   The article reconsiders the conflict management and conflict resolution
   debate and indicts former colonial powers and powerful organisations for
   maintaining colonial-style approaches to African conflicts at the
   expense of a desire to address the fundamental issues that divide the
   parties to the different conflicts. It argues that the colonial factor
   ought to be a consideration in attempts to address African conflicts
   because the roots of many post-colonial conflicts in Africa remain
   buried in Africa's past and, specifically, in the colonisation and
   de-colonisation processes. Making the claim that conflict resolution is
   more than the suppression or perhaps the elimination of overt violence,
   it argues that envisaging and/or imposing peace-keeping forces at every
   turn on various African conflicts does not provide the desired durable
   outcomes.},

Abstract = {``For sated people no future blooms{''} : this is Weber's warning at the
   end of his text Russia's Transition to Pseudo-Constitutionalism. His
   fear was the coming of the last men, who ``live on bread alone{''} and
   are unable to dedicate their life to ethical powers. This paper will
   focus on the concept of Sattigung in Max Weber's works, providing a
   reconstruction of the occurrences of this semantics, which plays, in my
   opinion, a significant role in Weber's reflection but nevertheless has
   been to date underestimated by the Weberian exegesis. In this way it
   will be possible to outline a different and more complete interpretation
   of Weber's thought and, moreover, to find exactly in the semantics of
   satiation/saturation a conceptual tool that could be useful for a
   diagnosis of contemporary world and contemporary politics.},

Abstract = {The third article in the series Image of Russia and Formation of
   Political Worldview of Young Joseph Goebbels analyzes the last
   (1924-1925) stages of the future Nazi Minister's Russophile views
   evolution. The paper shows that Goebbels continued to view Russia as a
   ``natural ally{''} of Germany even after he stopped studying literature
   and turned to political activity. The diary and early journalist
   publications of the novice Nazi suggest that Lenin's Russia preserved
   its attractiveness for him primarily because it continued to act as the
   same antipode to the liberal West as Dostoevsky's Russia used to be
   earlier. However, now Goebbels' hopes were no longer tied to the
   literary myth of the ``holy country{''} carrying the religious and moral
   expurgation to the world, but to the practice of the Bolshevik ``state
   socialism{''}. Explaining Goebbels' sudden turn to the anti-Soviet
   positions at the beginning of 1926, S.Allenov notes that the
   disagreements on the ``Russian{''} question were the last obstacle in
   the way of his final rapprochement with Hitler, and his kind attitude
   towards Russia was the price he paid for the right of entry into the top
   of the NSDAP.},

   success of Alternativa Galega de Esquerdas ( AGE) in the 2012 Galician
   elections, despite the presence of a lot factors which should be thought
   as playing against. However, the main problems about this coalition
   worked together to add value and helped creating a bigger connection
   with the electors. The explanation of the results is based in AGE's
   discourse ( mostly represented by leader Xos Manuel Beiras) and its
   connection with the most critical sectors of society in a social context
   of crisis and widespread discontent with the system.},

Abstract = {20 years have passed since the breakup of the Czech and Slovak Federal
   Republic. In spite of that it is still the subject of many polemics. The
   proof of this statement is a huge amount of literature dedicated to this
   subject. The reasons of the division of the common state of Czechs and
   Slovaks in 1992 can be viewed from various perspectives. This paper
   focuses on the period of 1918-1989. Its aim is to point out the
   political, economic and psychological factors that significantly
   affected the quality of Czech-Slovak relations in a given period and
   thus played a specific role in the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in
   1992.},

Year = {2013},
Volume = {5},
Number = {2},
Pages = {3-35},
Abstract = {This article applies the debate on the recent emergence of outsider
   candidates in Latin America to independent presidential candidate Marco
   Enriquez-Ominami (ME-O) in Chile in 2009. We test five competing
   hypotheses to explain his electoral success. First, his support is
   explained by the consolidation of democracy, reflected by the
   disposition of voters to disregard the authoritarian/democratic-aligned
   candidates. Second, his support is explained by the decline of
   ideological identification, reflected by the disposition of voters to
   prefer nontraditional candidates. Third, his support is explained by the
   resurgence of the Left, reflected by the disposition of voters to
   identify with anti-Washington Consensus candidates. Fourth, his support
   is explained by the demand for quick government action, reflected in the
   predisposition of voters to consider candidates who will solve problems
   fast even if they do not ask voters for their opinions. Fifth, his
   support is explained by the declining support for established parties,
   reflected by the predisposition of voters to favor antisystemic
   candidates. We use survey data to test these hypotheses. We find no
   evidence to support the claims that ME-O fits any of the explanations.
   Though he was widely referred to as an outsider, his success seems to
   respond to national affairs rather than to a regional pattern.},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Australia and China have evolved a synergistic relationship driven
   largely by the rapidly expanding Chinese demand for Australian
   resources. China's growing political and economic influence, regionally
   and globally, has prompted for different reasons the leadership of both
   countries to develop new channels and forms of communication. It has
   left Australian society with the unfamiliar task of engaging with a
   major center of power whose cultural and political traditions are
   radically different from its own. This article explores the scope and
   limitations of Australia's emerging dialogue with China. It makes the
   case for a sustained and multidimensional dialogue that harnesses more
   effectively the energies of civil society as well as business and
   government, thereby facilitating the task of redefining the relationship
   in a period of far-reaching transition.},

Abstract = {Do distributive benefits increase voter participation? This article
   argues that the government delivery of distributive aid increases the
   incumbent party's turnout but decreases opposition-party turnout. The
   theoretical intuition here is that an incumbent who delivers
   distributive benefits to the opposing party's voters partially mitigates
   these voters ideological opposition to the incumbent, hence weakening
   their motivation to turn out and oust the incumbent. Analysis of
   individual-level data on FEMA hurricane disaster aid awards in Florida,
   linked with voter-turnout records from the 2002 (pre-hurricane) and 2004
   (post-hurricane) elections, corroborates these predictions. Furthermore,
   the timing of the FEMA aid delivery determines its effect: aid delivered
   during the week just before the November 2004 election had especially
   large effects on voters, increasing the probability of Republican
   (incumbent party) turnout by 5.1\% and decreasing Democratic (opposition
   party) turnout by 3.1\%. But aid delivered immediately after the
   election had no effect on Election Day turnout.},

Journal = {REGIONAL AND FEDERAL STUDIES},

Pages = {331-351},
Abstract = {This article studies the political discourses regarding the future of
   Belgian federalism since the year 2000. Analysing party manifestos, it
   intends to identify patterns of preferences about the long-term
   evolution of Belgian institutions and the distribution of competences.
   The quantitative and qualitative analysis shows that the systemic
   duality of Belgian federalism largely explains the preferences of
   political actors: French-speaking parties overall oppose the broad state
   reform that the Dutch-speaking parties collectively support. Yet, each
   party has a specific position on the decentralization cleavage and a
   vision of Belgian federalism that cannot be reduced to its linguistic
   affiliation.},

Abstract = {In the introduction, the editors present the special issue and, in

   Despite the agreement on the sixth state reform, four key issues remain
   for Belgium's future: decision making, distribution of powers,
   intergovernmental relations and the role of the parties. Drawing on past
   and present investigations of this topic, they present the state of the
   federation and, in so doing, they set the stage for the remaining

Abstract = {We begin this chapter by reviewing the literature that debates which
   elements make up a political party. While other scholars have touched on
   the importance of activists, no one has been able to satisfactorily
   define and measure their effect on the presidential nomination process.
   In a polarized general election environment, these activists play an
   important role in mobilizing the party electorate, and disunity almost
   inevitably dooms a party's nominee in the general election. To better
   understand the role of the unity within the party, we utilize Masket's
   idea of the party being a network. To be able to operationalize this at
   a national level, we look at activist as being shared donors between
   candidates in the presidential nomination process.},

   and strategic interests.(1) The claimant countries are Brunei, China,

   economic interests have negatively influenced the peaceful management of
   the maritime territorial dispute. No bilateral or multilateral fisheries
   agreement has so far been negotiated in the South China Sea. Likewise,
   the prospect for the joint development of hydrocarbon resources has been
   under discussion since the early 1990s but no tangible results have so
   far been reached. The recent escalation in tensions as well as rising
   great power competition has further complicated the joint development of
   resources.},

Abstract = {The U.S. foreign policy regarding the Western Sahara is characterized by
   tension between the formal support to the principle of
   self-determination and human rights, on the one hand, and the attempt to
   safeguard the interests of its main ally in the North African region:
   Morocco, on the other. The tension around these objectives has emerged
   with different intensity during the Reign of Hassan II, ending in 1999.
   Despite some initiatives, the U.S. policy has been characterized by its
   lack of support for the principle of self-determination to favor one of
   the conflict parties (Morocco), and by the absence of pressure on
   Morocco to end the systematic violations of civil and political rights
   in the occupied Western Sahara.},

Abstract = {Purpose - Acknowledging that the field of neuroscience is expanding
   rapidly and the implication of recent neuroscientific advances on the
   study of politics is equally vast, this chapter will focus primarily on
   three key areas of convergence that have influenced the direction of
   neuropolitics: first, decision-making (emotions, preferences, and voting
   behavior); second, research on in-group/out-group relations, such as
   coalitional groupings and discrimination and prejudice; and, third, the
   rise of neuroeconomics.
   Approach - This chapter is concerned with the intersection of political
   science and neuroscience and discusses how recent technological and
   theoretical developments in the latter are greatly contributing to the
   field of neuropolitics.
   Findings - The insights generated by neuroscience permit the study of
   politics to be anchored on a scientific foundation for the first time.
   In turn, this opens the door to a renaissance in the political
   psychology subfield of political science, as the scientific origins of
   political behavior are revealed.
   Research implications - The ongoing revolution in neuroscience is
   producing insights into international political behavior that is largely
   unacknowledged by political scientists. Value The implications for
   domestic and international policy are major. Fundamentally, this is
   because neuroscience allows us to comprehend better the origins of human
   political behavior.},
