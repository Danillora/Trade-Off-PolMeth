Abstract = {This article examines the continued predominance of Hugo Chavez in
   Venezuelan politics. The year 2012 was marked by several chavista
   electoral successes, despite growing economic, infrastructural, and
   security problems and a unified coordination effort by the country's
   opposition. To help explain Hugo Chavez's predominance after fourteen
   years of uninterrupted rule, the article points to Venezuelan public
   opinion in the years since the 2006 election. It finds that evaluations
   of Chavez and his government were, at a minimum, ambivalent and for many
   Venezuelans, quite positive. Additionally, ideological weaknesses within
   the opposition prevented it from offering Venezuelans a truly distinct
   alternative. The article suggests, by way of conclusion, that the
   consequences of Chavez's revolutionary project will likely outlast his
   time in office.},

Title = {What Matters to Social Democratic Party Voters? Liberal and Economic
   Interests trump Ethnoreligious Identity in Bosnia and Herzegovina},
Journal = {CIVIS-MONTENEGRIN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Abstract = {Bosnia and Herzegovina possesses both a history marked by ethnic
   differences and a tradition of tolerance and coexistence among religious
   groups. The millet system of Ottoman times depended upon the authority
   of confessional communities. With the rise of nationalism in the 1800's,
   religious identity and organization became complicated by ethnicity.
   Later, the authoritarianism of Tito enabled the state to accommodate
   this multinational, multi-religious character, uniting people as
   socialist Yugoslavs. Thus, the collapse of the socialist, Yugoslavian
   ideals and structures created new and sometimes polarizing choices for
   the population. Previously authoritarian government mediated religious
   and ethnic relations, but now coexistence depended upon elected leaders
   and a democratic polity.
   Bosnia and Herzegovina has struggled (indeed fought) through the first
   two decades of its independence. This research contends, however, that
   tolerance and cosmopolitanism can reemerge. The paper focuses upon the
   perception of voters of the Social Democratic Party as an example of a
   secular, new left party, and an alternative to parties which operate
   based upon ethnoreligious identities. The research uses the European
   Value Study to examine popular views of political parties, and assess
   the issues and interests of their members, concluding that changing
   demographics might dictate a further move from ethnoreligious
   affiliations and toward secular parties.},

Pages = {402-416},
Abstract = {This article intervenes in the emerging field of global citizenship
   studies by following in the footsteps of critical studies of national
   citizenship, which have shown that the seemingly neutral features of
   citizenship are gendered and racialized. The notion of ``global
   citizenship{''} has gained currency in recent years and while there is
   not yet a canonized account of global citizenship, it is possible to
   identify the main shared features of different global citizenship
   accounts. While the ``global{''} of global citizenship could denote the
   universality of the concept in contrast to national citizenship, this
   promise of inclusivity is not fulfilled. This article provides an
   intersectional reading of global citizenship theories and examples.
   Dominant global citizenship accounts, I argue, contain exclusionary and
   marginalizing tendencies and are biased toward a certain type of global
   subject whose responsibility is based on benevolence. A more inclusive
   and radical account of global citizenship can be built by drawing on
   Iris Marion Young's social connection model to rethink responsibility
   and by more firmly grounding it in an understanding of globalization as
   linked to historical and present structural inequalities.},

Abstract = {While previous scholarship suggests that ``American government textbooks
   are more alike than they are different,'' an examination of the market's
   most frequently adopted texts suggests that this consistency does not
   extend much further than the subjects of major chapters. We explore the
   degree to which four major introductory American politics texts provide
   a standardized curriculum concerning the American presidency. We utilize
   five distinct lenses to capture explicit and implicit features of the
   text: organization, emphasis, illustration, evidence, and perspective.
   Findings suggest that texts differ in meaningful ways in terms of
   content, emphasis, and perspective.},

Title = {Uncertainty, Complexity, and Gamson's Law: Comparing Coalition Formation
   in Western Europe},
Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {36},
Number = {1},
Pages = {221-247},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {According to Gamson's Law, the allocation of cabinet portfolios in
   parliamentary democracies is proportional to the legislative seat shares
   of the governing parties. However, portfolio allocation departs
   systematically from perfect proportionality. This paper proposes a
   theory of portfolio allocation that seeks to explain the variance in
   proportionality across different bargaining situations. It argues that
   the degree to which the coalition formation process is characterised by
   uncertainty and complexity influences portfolio allocation. In uncertain
   and complex bargaining situations, parties that otherwise would be in an
   advantageous bargaining position will have a difficult time exploiting
   their bargaining advantage. As a result, portfolio allocation in such
   circumstances will be closer to proportionality. These patterns are
   observed in data on coalition formation in 14 West European
   parliamentary systems in the period 19451999.},

   those less accustomed to walk the paths of political science, various
   relationships between the concepts that refer to the connection between
   common life, human relations, with conflict and political trying to
   understand how and why it happens, in order to assess to what extent the
   response that provides policy is effective, and to what extent the art
   of mediation is an alternative to more traditional institutions that
   emerged to deal with conflict and violence, tracing different routes
   through the development of some very significant of thought to what will
   be cited, where appropriate, to various well known authors, showing, at
   a time, how certain hard evidence presents some of the causes the
   situation-frame-analyzed. Whereas the discredited policy is the one who
   seeks mediation, which must also be implemented with political
   decisions. The tours that take place, especially at first, is through
   the evolution of thought and of political institutions and their purpose
   is to show that the authors and the structures seen, usually known by
   looking at other issues, also address questions to which this test is
   concerned. At last it is generally of certain classics that can be
   analyzed from different perspectives and it is always necessary to
   revisit.},

Abstract = {While new institutionalism with its path-dependence theory has proved to
   be an especially powerful device for explaining the stability and
   inertia of public policies, its focus on the stickiness of institutions
   has contributed to conceptual deficits in grasping and explaining
   actually occurring policy change which have attracted much criticism.
   With reference to the critical case of German labour market reforms,
   policy learning is identified as a key mechanism in the paradigmatic
   transformation of social policy. Pursuing the argument that learning
   does not happen in a vacuum and is institutionally embedded, policy
   learning is conceptually enriched with insights from new
   institutionalism to develop an institutional account of learning. Such
   an approach to policy learning and a stronger emphasis on ideas address
   the stability bias in new institutionalism and its path-dependence
   theory by accounting for knowledge-based institutional change.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to understand the achievement of high agricultural
   growth alongside persistent poverty and a mediocre record of human
   development in West Bengal under the democratically elected Left Front
   over the last 30 years. Contrary to conventional explanations which
   centre on the nature of land distribution and rental arrangements, it
   seeks to explain the contrast between the expansion of agriculture and
   the deprivation of its mainly rural population through an analysis of
   the social relations of the post-harvest marketing system which links
   production with circulation and distribution. Based on field work in
   West Bengal's agricultural commodity markets over the quarter century
   1981-2004, it shows how the seemingly contradictory outcome can be
   explained in some measure through the control over the marketed surplus
   by a handful of oligopolistic firms and their dominance over petty
   producers and labour in the agricultural production and marketing
   system. It also highlights how the Left Front governments, despite their
   attack on large-scale landed property, continued to enhance the
   privileges of the local agro-commercial elite which prevented agrarian
   poverty from being addressed.},

   or shock some viewers are an appropriate use of public monies in a
   depressed economy. While the current debate is grounded in a need for
   balanced budgets and reduced deficits, long-standing unresolved legacies
   fragment arts and culture policy and leave arts and culture funding
   vulnerable to additional cuts. The normative implications for the role
   of the arts and culture sectors in a democratic society need to be

Abstract = {An extraordinary body of scholarship suggests that war, perhaps more
   than any other contributor, is responsible for the emergence of a
   distinctly modern presidency. Central to this argument is a belief that
   members of Congress predictably and reliably line up behind the
   president during times of war. Few scholars, however, have actually
   subjected this argument to quantitative investigation. This article does
   so. Estimating ideal points for members of Congress at the start and end
   of the most significant wars in the past century, we find
   consistentalbeit not uniformevidence of a wartime effect. The outbreaks
   of both world wars and the post-9/11 erathough not the Korean or Vietnam
   warscoincided with discernible changes in member voting behavior that
   better reflected the ideological leanings of the presidents then in
   office. In the aftermath of all these wars, meanwhile, members shifted
   away from the sitting presidents ideological orientation. These findings
   are not confined to any single subset of policies, are robust to a wide
   variety of modeling specifications, and run contrary to scholarship that
   emphasizes ideological consistency in members voting behavior.},

   and Hegemony in The `The 45 Hungarian Knights'},
Journal = {REVISTA ESTUDOS POLITICOS},
Year = {2013},
Number = {6},
Pages = {102-125},
Abstract = {The Gramscian premise that culture is the main field of (re) production
   of domination and subordination as well as of the values that sustain
   inequalities and hierarchies is shared by many strands of political
   thinking, including the field of Cultural Studies. In Brazil, the
   concern with the complex intertwining of culture and politics has been
   object of reflection in various disciplines. In the field of political
   theory, this article draws attention to the thought of Oliveiros
   Ferreira contained in his book The 45 Hungarian Knights. The article
   presents and discusses the theory developed by the author, based on a
   particular reading of Gramsci. Thus, in the first section of this
   article we will show how Oliveiros Ferreira organizes the Gramscian
   thought (I). Next, we will expose the foundations of his remarkable
   ``theory of essential possessions{''}, which purposes to contribute
   towards a ``theory of hegemony{''} inspired by Gramsci (II). It will
   enable us to present the important role of the theory of essential
   possessions in Oliveiros Ferreira's comprehension of the central
   Gramscian notions of civil society, political society, and state as well
   as his interpretation of the crisis of hegemony (III). Finally, we take
   up the question of the relationship between politics and culture in some
   of the exponents of the Cultural Studies, trying to point out the main
   differences between this strand of thought and the explanation offered
   by Oliveiros Ferreira for the same phenomenon.},

   are analyzed. Revealed in the context of such analysis is the tendency
   of individualization of politics as a possible alternative to man's
   ``esape{''} from the world of the political. The authors introduce the
   notion of infomodernity presented as an image of new social reality
   organized by interactive net forms of virtual communication, and

Abstract = {We identify two issues with the current literature suggesting that
   community ethnic diversity undermines social capital: (1) studies
   predominantly use attitudinal indicators of social capital; and (2)
   these attitudinal indicators are neighbourhood specific. We suggest the
   ``size{''} of, and ``frequency of interaction{''} within, individuals'
   social networks form more valid indicators of social capital. Thus it
   remains unknown: (1) whether diversity undermines individuals' social
   connectivity or only attitudes towards neighbours; or (2) whether
   diversity undermines individuals' total levels of social connectivity or
   only neighbourhood connectivity. We demonstrate that diversity
   negatively predicts both local trust and local social connectivity.
   However, diversity does not negatively predict individuals' total levels
   of connectivity. From a social connectivity perspective, diversity may
   undermine local social capital yet exert little effect on individuals'
   total levels of social capital. Instead, individuals in diverse
   communities possess equally sized ( and active) but less
   neighbourhood-centric networks. However, this appears dependent on the
   ability to maintain dispersed social networks: less mobile individuals
   (e.g. the elderly) report both lower local and lower total social
   capital in diverse communities.},

Abstract = {Taking an ecological approach, this article examines the resumption,
   formation, and development of public administration (PA) as a discipline
   in China. Through content analysis and process tracing, we argue that
   the social contexts during China's transition period and existing
   knowledge, both endogenous and exogenous, are major forces shaping the
   nature of the discipline and pushing its development. We also point out
   that Chinese PA now is facing challenges, calling for deeper
   localization and closer integration into global scholarship.},

Journal = {DEMOCRACY \& SECURITY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {177-192},
Abstract = {Security sector reform (SSR) is a new concept that was adopted by
   international institutions at the end of the 1990s as a relevant and
   critical part of development and stabilization processes. It consists of
   reforming the security sector in those states in which security
   structures are not able to protect citizens from security challenges
   facing developing and transitional societies. It includes a large
   spectrum of services and is strongly based on the abandoning of the
   classical conception of security as strictly connected with the
   territorial integrity of a state and the adoption of the broader concept
   of security and a security agenda that considers the well-being of
   populations and the respect of human rights. This article aims at
   analyzing the relevance of SSR in the security relations between
   European Union (EU) and Mediterranean countries. In the first part, a
   definition of SSR will be developed. In the second part, the EU's
   definition of SSR will be stressed, and its links with the security
   concept as it has been developed in EU external action. In the third
   part, the EU missions in Mediterranean countries will be analyzed in
   order to verify if SSR is included in the aims of the missions.},

   Regime},
Journal = {QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Number = {2},
Pages = {127-158},
Abstract = {Lacking the informative feedback provided by competitive elections, an
   unfettered press and an active civil society, authoritarian regimes can
   find it difficult to identify which social groups have become
   dangerously discontented and to monitor lower levels of government.
   While a rise in public protest is often seen as a harbinger of regime
   collapse in such states, this paper uses a formal model and a close
   examination of the Chinese case to show that the informal toleration and
   even encouragement of small-scale, narrowly economic protests can be an
   effective information gathering tool, mitigating these informational
   problems. The analysis demonstrates that protests should be observed
   most frequently where discontent is neither too high nor too low. This
   calls into question the common assumption in comparative politics that
   an increase in protests necessarily reflects an increase in discontent
   or the weakness of a regime.},

Abstract = {Conflict is a central element of industrial relations. Strikes are the
   most relevant aspect of the labor dispute and that the academic
   literature has given greater importance, both for its social
   significance probably strikes have involved more workers than any other
   form of collective action during the twentieth century- as for its
   historical continuity, since the mid-nineteenth century strikes became
   the dominant form of social protest in industrial societies.
   This article examines strike activity in Spain during the twentieth
   century to explain its evolution. In contrast to other works that focus
   primarily on the intensity of strike activity, this research is focused
   on the shape of strikes, which allows observing the transformation
   suffered in its configuration. Therefore be seen as strikes have been
   modernized over the twentieth century. The results show that strikes in
   Spain have followed a logic of political action, and, therefore, not
   limited to the scope of the market.},

Abstract = {This contribution addresses political limits to the processing of policy
   problems in the United States. Our foci are the forces that limit
   policymakers' attention to different aspects of problems and how this
   affects the prospects for problem resolution. We theorize about three
   sets of forces: interest engagement, linkages among relevant
   institutions for policymaking, and partisan conflict. We show how the
   interplay of these forces limits efforts to address complex problems.
   Based on secondary accounts, we consider these underlying dynamics for
   ten complex problems. These include the thorny problems of the financial
   crisis, climate change, and health care; the persistent problems of K-12
   education, drug abuse, and food safety; and the looming problems
   associated with critical infrastructure, the obesity epidemic, ocean
   health, and terrorism and extreme events. From these accounts we
   identify different patterns that we label fractured, allied,
   bureaucratic, and anemic policymaking.},

Abstract = {The European Union is not a State. It is a new kind of political
   organization. It is made up of independent and sovereign States. In any
   case, like other international organizations, the sovereign powers of
   its Member States are limited by the cooperation requirements imposed
   upon them by the international society in our times. In the case of the
   European Union, the limits imposed upon the sovereign powers of the
   Member States are further reinforced by the symbiosis of two separate
   political structures: the traditional structure of the Member States and
   the new Union structure. The Constitutional Law of the Member States is
   thus conditioned by the development of the supranational Law of the
   Union.},

Abstract = {Peruvian political dynamics has often been characterized as an enduring
   continuity. The political and economic regimes, as well as the factors
   that conditioned them, show a stable pattern: governability as the
   result of a low-intensity equilibrium based on weak Executives and
   oppositions that lack linkages with social movements. Therefore,
   different governments -pro-establishment or reformist-, including
   current Ollanta Humala's, got ``trapped by History{''}. An ``automatic
   pilot{''} mode is privileged in the administration of efficient
   (economy, international relations) and inefficient sectors (public
   security). However, recent institutional changes (focused on the
   technocracy of social programs) can be seen as indicators of a more
   popular version of this model of governability.},

   conclusion that activism and interest for politics are in Russia closely
   connected with oppositional attitude toward the power. In this respect
   Russia proves to be contrary to the countries of ``old{''} democracies,
   where activism and interest for politics are typical first of all of

Abstract = {This essay articulates the connections between historical migrations in
   Europe and the Europeanness - in practice, if not in self-identity - of
   its mobile inhabitants. The volume of migration has fluctuated
   dramatically since the seventeenth century; some migrants have stayed at
   destination among almost every group, but their welcome has been
   diminished by war, political change, and economic downturns. History has
   three lessons to offer: it shows that cities are the most certain, but
   not the only, sites of integration; it demonstrates that current
   configurations of migration and constructions of immigrants can change
   significantly; and it reveals great diversity in the migrant experience.},

Abstract = {This article engages with the scholarly debate on the supposed negative
   effect of immigration and diversity, and analyses its effect on two
   different forms of trust - community trust and generalized trust - in
   Spain. Our contribution is twofold. First, with census section level
   data of representative samples of all the Spanish municipalities, we
   test the propositions that relate greater ethnic diversity to social
   trust. Second, we address the limitations intrinsic to the crude
   measurement of diversity of the Herfindahl index with a systematic
   consideration of multiple alternative indicators of immigration-related
   diversity. We find evidence of a negative effect of diversity on
   community trust but none on generalized trust. Hence, our findings lend
   some support to the recent scholarship that questions that increasing
   diversity has a ``hunkering down{''} effect.},

Journal = {BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES OF TERRORISM AND POLITICAL AGGRESSION},

Volume = {5},

Pages = {70-93},
Abstract = {Social network analysis (SNA) conclusions are drawn on terrorist and
   dark network data sets that may provide erroneous results due to an
   indeterminate amount of missing data or data corruption. Compounding
   these effects, information sources reporting on terrorist groups and
   other dark network organizations may intentionally or unintentionally
   provide false data. These introduced errors may be significant as they
   could produce analytic results that are counter to the true situation,
   leading to misappropriation of resources, improper strategy adoption,
   and erroneous actions. Analyst cognizance of the causes of imperfect
   social network data, the importance of proper boundary specification,
   biases introduced via the employed data collection methods, and
   characteristics of social network information sources, particularly
   inherent informant accuracy assumptions, are necessary for SNA analysts
   to ascertain the resultant social network model's limitations and the
   inferences that can properly be drawn from the analysis. Specific to
   investigating terrorist groups and dark networks, trusted and deceptive
   social network information sources are introduced.},

   in 2010 through a threefold approach. On the one hand, the article
   examines the Palace's official view about regionalization through a
   discursive analysis, on the other hand it is analyzed the visions and
   proposals of the main Moroccan social and political forces about it, and
   finally the advanced regionalization system adopted. Also, the article
   examines the scope and changes that this new regional model proposes
   regarding the previous one, the references about regional system in the
   2011 constitutional reform and the implications of new regional model in
   the Autonomy Plan for Western Sahara submitted by Moroccan state as
   solution to the conflict.},

Abstract = {This research extends the theory of the civilizing process of Norbert
   Elias to the gender issue in the Ottoman Empire and thereby in some
   respects provides a test of his original theory. This study is based on
   the assumption that the conscious policy of the Ottoman modernization by
   the ruling elite exhibited many symptoms resembling those of the
   European civilizing process. The socio-historical process of
   bureaucratization of the Ottoman state fostered the changes in manners
   and forms of cultural expression which brought with it the advance of
   the threshold of shame and embarrassment in gender relations during this
   process. Drawing on this assumption, the article looks at the changes in
   the way people control themselves and others in the expression of their
   impulses and emotions. In turn, - the question of how the margins of
   tolerance in sexual matters and in the expression of emotions and
   desires changed during this civilizing process - formulates the major
   concern of this paper. Since manuals on etiquette, manners books,
   diaries and archives are the richest sources for this purpose, this
   project employs the analysis of these cultural texts, in order to make
   inferences from the cultural transformations within the Ottoman Empire.
   The research hopes to offer new perspectives in reorienting the way we
   look at the development of the Ottoman culture within the context of
   figurational sociology.},

Abstract = {The political mediation, as mediation in general, is making its way as
   an effective practice for the improvement and resolution of complex
   conflicts. The progress in its development and its positive estimation
   by the society, are gradually recognized, but as a way to do rather than
   an object of scientific reflection; but this perspective is particularly
   needed to know more and better, both from the perspective of basic and
   applied research. To achieve this it's necessary to present an up to
   date situation of the issue to, at least, determine its boundaries:
   Concepts, processes, problems, difficulties, its negotiating base and
   also its undeniable relationship with politics and political science.},

Abstract = {Will voters punish the government for cutting back welfare state
   entitlements? The comparative literature on the welfare state suggests
   that the answer is yes. Unless governments are effectively employing
   strategies of blame avoidance, retrenchment leads to vote loss. Because
   a large majority of voters supports the welfare state, the usual
   assumption is that retrenchment backfires equally on all political
   parties. This study contributes to an emerging body of research that
   demonstrates that this assumption is incorrect. On the basis of a
   regression analysis of the electoral fate of the governing parties of 14
   OECD countries between 1970 and 2002, we show that most parties with a
   positive welfare image lose after they implemented cutbacks, whereas
   most parties with a negative welfare image do not. In addition, we show
   that positive welfare image parties in opposition gain votes, at the
   expense of those positive welfare image parties in government that
   implemented welfare state retrenchment. Comparative European Politics

Abstract = {In this symposium on overdetermination, Mark S. Silverman proposes that
   in Knowledge and Class the concept is deployed in two distinct but
   related ways that Stephen Resnick and Richard Wolff fail to notice and
   which have important consequences in our appreciation of knowledge
   production. Specifically, in Silverman's view, the implication that no
   outcomes can be predicted in advance does not necessarily follow from
   the recognition ``that an entity's very being is constituted by the
   entire network of relations it has with all other entities.'' Meanwhile,
   Hyun Woong Park proposes that the inconsistencies that Resnick and Wolff
   highlight in Louis Althusser's use of overdetermination are merely
   apparent and that, on the contrary, they have to be seen not as
   inconsistencies between essentialist and antiessentialist moments but as
   the development of a congruent scaffold. Resnick and Wolff reply by
   questioning Park's and Silverman's shared need to anchor themselves in
   some sort or another of determinism},

Abstract = {Primarily due to lack of data, previous cross-sectional studies on
   descriptive representation have not been able to address the temporal
   criticisms about the effects of descriptive representation on Black and
   female political attitudes. We address this shortcoming in the
   literature using the growth curve models and the 2008-2009 American
   National Election Study Panel Survey to assess whether bids for the
   White House by Obama and Palin changed levels of internal and external
   efficacy among Blacks and women. Moreover, we examine internal
   differences within these groups to better understand which factors
   interact with race and gender to produce the largest empowerment
   effects. While still very much a contentious issue, we find that
   descriptive group representation for numerically underrepresented social
   groups, and particularly for Black women, has dynamic and transformative
   effects on political efficacy. Conversely, we find mixed evidence that
   women were empowered by Sarah Palin's candidacy.},

Abstract = {Theories of institutional change help us to understand policy
   transformation, and provide us with a framework for presenting
   transformation narratives retrospectively. By telling the transformation
   narrative of a single case through the lenses of three different

   shortcomings of a single lens, and the value of using complementary
   lenses. It argues for a pluralist approach to provide a richer

Abstract = {This article investigates the main political institutions in the
   sub-national democracies of Austria, Germany and Switzerland. It applies
   Lijphart's approach to these German-speaking countries in Western Europe
   and expands it following recent advances by direct democracy. The main
   finding of the sub-national analysis is that, similar to Lijphart, two
   dimensions of democracy can be distinguished. While the first can be
   considered as the consensual dimension' of democracy, the second
   represents the rules of the game'. Moreover, and in contrast to analyses
   at the national level, direct democracy does not constitute a dimension
   on its own, but forms an important element of consensus decision-making
   in the sub-national units at hand. Finally, based on cluster analysis
   three homogenous national clusters were found, but also one cluster with
   sub-national democracies from Germany and Austria that are more similar
   to one another than to other Lander within their respective federal
   states.},

Pages = {453-482},
Abstract = {In Brazil, indigenous population is about 817 thousand people, and a
   great part of such people lives in the State of Mato Grosso do Sul, and
   only the Guarani people and their variation reach a population of 47
   thousand, distributed in 26 villages spread throughout in 18
   municipalities. Indigenous lands are legally owned by the Brazilian
   nation state, and judicially bonded with each municipality where they
   are located. Besides this legal context, they exceed their physical
   borders and assume identity meanings of each people. Lands and
   territories become territorialities whose meanings require the study of
   several elements of each ethnic group. This research, conducted in
   Francisco Horta Indigenous Land in Dourados municipality, aims to
   understand the figurations of leisure, or alevezar{*}, through the
   reflections that came with the mapping process of their ludic spaces.
   This study approaches the resistances and changes, which contemporize
   the ludic forms in the cultural heritage context. The objectives are:
   (i) to learn the meaning of guarani territoriality; (ii) to identify the
   leisure spaces registered by the indigenous people in their villages'
   maps; and (iii) to establish the relationship between territoriality and
   leisure spaces. The methodology comprises: (a) the bibliographical
   review of texts from the Nobert Elias theory related to the leisure
   matter; (b) the reflection and elaboration of the meaning of leisure to
   the indigenous group, including the option for the term alevezar; (c)
   the selection of maps of alevezar spaces done by indigenous university
   students enrolled on the intercultural indigenous undergraduate course
   at the Faculty of Education, Federal University of Grande Dourados; and
   (d) the establishment of criteria to organize such spaces, associating
   them to the practice of activities. The results have partially broadened
   our understanding about the changes occurring in those people's way of
   living. Such facts represent long-term processes that intervene in the
   guarani tribal world, and reflect the insertion of those people in the
   general society, most of the time under coercive processes of
   self-regulation, including the condition of violence to which they have
   been submitted along the last two centuries.},

   address voting as a scientific problem employing mathematical apparatus
   and method of model situations analysis for its solution. Having
   examined in details the works by Borda and Condorcet in this area,
   V.Volsky draws attention to the fact that it is these works that led to
   realization that the notion of the ``majority of votes{''} is far from
   being unambiguous and its use for determining a winner during elections
   might lead to paradoxical results.},

Pages = {604-626},
Abstract = {Since the mid-1980s, and particularly throughout the first decade of the
   twenty-first century, the imperative of capitalist competition has
   become a totalizing and all-pervasive logic expanding to ever more
   social domains and geographical areas around the world. Sustained by
   neoliberal competition regulation and other regulatory provisions,
   excessive competition (over-competition) in the process of capital
   accumulation has become a major global force with highly detrimental
   social and environmental downsides. From the vantage point of a
   historical materialist perspective, the article provides an explanatory
   critique of capitalist competition and the atomistic and reductionist
   social scientific precepts that serve to legitimize the neoliberal type
   of competition regulation. By critically engaging with principles and
   values central to anarchism, such as equity, solidarity, cooperation,
   mutual aid, and environmental sustainability, the article seeks to
   outline an alternative vision to the ideas and social practices that
   have sustained the existing competition order thus far.},

Abstract = {The politics of identity is important within regional and governance
   policy debates, becoming a mechanism for `filling in' the democratic
   gaps left by the hollowing out of the state, with much discourse about
   constructing identities for governance purposes. This raises questions
   about the feasibility of processes of identity construction, and whether
   it starts from new, or builds on existing identities. We use the case
   study of the Cornish campaign for Objective 1 EU structural funding,
   engaging directly with modernist versus ethnosymbolist accounts of
   nationalism, to explore the binary between instrumental, constructed
   identities and more phenomenological accounts.},

Abstract = {The effect of religion on political behavior and attachment has been a
   topic of intense interest in the United States and elsewhere. Less
   attention has been paid to the issue of secularism. Some analysts have
   viewed secularism as an absence of religious attachment, and a number of
   studies have utilized indices of secularization to analyze such topics
   as economic development or modernization. In this article, we show that
   secularism, like religion, is in fact a multifaceted category, and
   should not be viewed as the antithesis of religiosity. Utilizing a very
   large sample of United States adults, we apply factor analysis to
   demonstrate that secularism is composed of two logically separate
   components, and we use these results to examine the role of secularism
   in political attachments. We suggest that Religious Secularism and
   Social Secularism are different motivations and have different effects
   on political behavior and that, politically, the marginal effects of
   Social Secularism are larger than Religious Secularism in all cases.},

Abstract = {This article investigates possible bandwagons in actual elections rather
   than the usual opinion poll data. Until 1918, British general elections
   were staggered over a fortnight or more. We use the eight general
   elections between 1885 and 1910 to investigate whether there was a
   general bandwagon or underdog effect as the election progressed. We find
   that any bandwagon effect was in favor of the party which eventually won
   the election, not the party gaining seats compared with last time. We
   also find that a typical election featured an initial bandwagon effect
   which peaked about halfway through the election and then declined. Its
   decline appears to be due both to declining enthusiasm for the leading
   party and to later polls occurring in places where voters were less
   prone to get on a bandwagon in the first place. The weakening of the
   bandwagon was correlated to distance of the constituency from London,
   although it revived to some extent in Scotland.},

Abstract = {How has the rise of partisan media outlets changed how citizens perceive
   the other party? In particular, does watching partisan news sources make
   citizens dislike and distrust the other party? Drawing on social
   identity theory, I explain how the slanted presentation of the news on
   partisan outlets leads viewers to perceive the other party more
   negatively, to trust them less, and to be less supportive of
   bipartisanship. Using a series of original experiments, I find strong
   support for my arguments. I conclude by discussing the normative and
   empirical implications of these findings.{[}Supplementary material is

Title = {The Absence of Structural Americanization: Media System Developments in

Abstract = {Several comparative media researchers have hypothesized that the media
   systems of affluent Western democracies are becoming more and more
   structurally homogeneousthat they are becoming Americanized. This
   article uses data on newspaper industry revenues, commercial television
   revenues, Internet use, and funding for public service media from a
   strategic sample of six countries to test the structural version of the
   convergence hypothesis, looking at the period from 2000 to 2009. (The
   countries included are Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the United
   Kingdom, and the United States.) The analysis demonstrates an absence of
   Americanization as the six media systems have not become structurally
   more similar over the last decade. Instead, developments are summarized
   as a combination of (1) parallel displacements, (2) persistent
   particularities, and (3) the emergence of some new peculiarities.
   Theoretically, economic and technological forces were expected to drive
   convergence. The article suggests that the reason these forces have not
   driven convergence in recent years may be that the interplay between
   them have changed as part of a broader shift from the mass media, mass
   production, and mass markets characteristic of twentieth-century Western
   societies and toward the fragmented media landscapes, tailored
   production, and niche marketing increasingly characteristic of
   early-twenty-first century affluent democracies.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on the democratization of civil-military relations
   and the implementation of democratic control of the armed forces in the
   Republic of Serbia. By analyzing the basic parameters of democratic
   civil-military relations, we attempt to evaluate whether civil-military
   relations in the Republic of Serbia can be classified into a type of
   relations that occur in consolidated democracies. Based on an
   examination of legal documents and other data, this article concludes
   that democratic changes since October 2000 have greatly influenced the
   course of relations between military and political elites and that
   civil-military relation in Serbia meet most of the defined parameters.
   However, due to the difficulties in the implementation of this control
   in practice, civil-military relations in Serbia can only partially be
   classified as a type of relations that occur in consolidated
   democracies.},

Abstract = {Objectives. The study examines spatial variation in exposure to toxic
   air pollution from industrial facilities in urban areas of the United
   States in relation to the local distribution of the pollution burden.
   Methods. We conducted between-and within-city analysis of geographic
   microdata from the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency's
   Risk-Screening Environmental Indicators project and data from the 2000
   U. S. Census. Results. Average exposure in an urban area is positively
   correlated with the extent of racial and ethnic disparity in the
   distribution of the exposure burden. Average exposures also tend to be
   higher for all population subgroups, including whites, in urban areas
   with higher minority pollution-exposure discrepancies. Conclusions. The
   correlations could arise from causal linkages in either or both
   directions: the ability to displace pollution onto minorities may lower
   the effective cost of pollution for industrial firms; and higher average
   pollution burdens may induce whites to invest more political capital in
   efforts to influence firms' siting decisions. The analysis suggests that
   improvement in environmental justice could benefit not only minorities
   but also whites.},

Abstract = {Objectives. This study examines the effect of countries' wealth on
   individuals' willingness to pay for environmental protection. Former
   studies using the International Social Survey Programme (ISSP) report a
   positive effect, while studies using the World Values Survey (WVS) or
   the European Values Study (EVS) find the opposite. In this article, we
   explain and reconcile these opposing findings. Methods. First, we
   analyze the three data sets (ISSP, WVS, and EVS) separately by applying
   multilevel analyses and replicate the different findings. Second, we
   take respondents' acquiescence into account and demonstrate that wealth
   has a positive effect on the willingness to pay in the combined data
   set. Results. Respondents in poorer nations in Asia and Eastern Europe
   have higher levels of acquiescence than respondents in richer Western
   nations. This difference conceals the wealth effect of studies analyzing
   the WVS or EVS. If acquiescence is properly taken into account, the
   wealth effect is confirmed. Conclusion. Theory predicts that wealth and
   the willingness to protect the environment should be positively
   associated. This wealth effect is confirmed by our analyses of the ISSP,
   WVS, and EVS.},

Title = {Is Measuring Interracial Contact Enough? Racial Concentration, Racial
   Balance, and Perceptions of Prejudice among Black Americans},
Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {94},

Abstract = {Objectives. Contact theory posits that interracial contact can reduce
   racial prejudice and perceptions of prejudice. This relationship
   typically has been looked at from the perspective of whites' views
   regarding race and racial relations, but few studies have examined the
   implications of interracial contact for blacks' perceptions regarding
   the extent of prejudice and discrimination. Methods. With data from the
   National Survey of Black Workers, I examine whether opportunities for
   contact in settings with varying racial concentrations in youth and
   adulthood are associated with blacks' perceptions of prejudice. I use
   racial concentration-measured here as mostly black settings, half-black
   (racially balanced) settings, and mostly white settings (compared to
   all-black settings)-as an indicator of opportunities for interracial
   contact. Results. Multivariate analyses offer some evidence of the
   benefits of opportunities for contact in mixed-race and mostly white
   settings for blacks' perceptions of prejudice. Conclusion. Although
   having opportunities for contact can be beneficial, this evidence is
   limited to noncompetitive childhood environments, namely residential
   neighborhoods. Findings highlight the important of accounting for the
   racial balance of settings where interracial contact takes place.},

Abstract = {Objective. We examine whether people with disabilities are part of the
   political mainstream, or remain outsiders in important respects, by
   studying political participation and the underexplored topic of how
   disability relates to attitudes toward politics. Method. We analyze new
   disability measures on the 2008 and 2010 Current Population Surveys
   voting supplements, and two other nationally representative surveys for
   2006 and 2007. Results. Citizens with disabilities remain less likely
   than nondisabled citizens to vote. While there are few differences in
   political preferences and party affiliations, people with disabilities
   tend to favor a greater government role in employment and healthcare,
   and give lower ratings on government responsiveness and trustworthiness.
   Conclusion. People with disabilities continue to be sidelined in
   important ways. Fully closing the disability gap would have led to 3.0
   million more voters in 2008 and 3.2 million more voters in 2010,
   potentially affecting many races and subsequent public policies.},

Abstract = {It was previously perceived as a citizen's responsibility to follow the
   news and to keep oneself informed about politics and current affairs.
   Recently, however, it appears as though a growing number of citizens
   ignore the information opportunities given to them. Changes in the media
   environment have given people cross-nationally more of a choice
   regarding the media diet they prefer. For the American case, Prior has
   demonstrated that in an era of cable TV and Internet, people more
   readily remove themselves from political knowledge and political action
   than previously. In this article, we study how the public's consumption
   of news versus entertainment has developed over the last decade in
   countries with significantly different media systems. Is there a general
   increase in preference for entertainment across Europe, and has the gap
   between news- and entertainment-seekers increased such as documented by
   Prior for the U.S. case? Who are the European citizens who remove
   themselves from news and current affairs in the environment of increased
   choice? Based on data from five waves of the European Social Survey
   covering more than thirty European countries from 2002 to 2010, we
   demonstrate how national context or the media environment moderates the
   influence of individual-level factors in news consumption.},

Title = {Blogging in the Shadow of Parties: Exploring Ideological Differences in
   Online Campaigning},

Abstract = {Blogging is an increasingly important practice in election campaigns,
   showing interesting variations across contexts. Recent research has
   shown that the adoption and use of blogs is strongly shaped by national
   institutional settings, that is, the different roles given to parties
   within political systems. However, intra-national differences in the
   practice of political blogging are yet to be explained. This article
   investigates the variation in usage of blogs in electoral campaigns in
   Sweden, a country characterized by strong political parties and a
   party-centered form of representative democracy. The central argument is
   that different parties utilize blogging in different ways. Just as
   blogging is shaped by how institutions support persons or parties, we
   propose that political blogging is shaped by party affiliation and
   ideological positions on individualism and collectivism. The empirical
   analysis, based on a survey among over 600 blogging politicians,
   confirms that ideological positions towards individualism and
   collectivism have a great impact on the uptake and usage of political
   blogs, portraying political blogging as a strongly ideologically
   situated practice of political communication.},

Abstract = {This paper evaluates the impact of the New Cooperative Medical Scheme on
   household savings by quartiles of income in rural China. Thanks to CHNS
   data, we estimate the impact of this health insurance on household
   savings for each quartile of income by using ordinary-least-square and
   two-stage-least-square estimations. We find a significant negative
   impact of the participation in NCMS on savings for middle-income
   households only. This result remains when we control for a possible
   endogeneity arising when we build savings on health expenses. As NCMS
   has no impact on health expenditures for all quartiles of income, we
   conclude that the decrease in savings, associated to NCMS participation,
   results from a reduction of households income risk rather than a
   reduction of health expenses.},

   space, that of the Galician-Portuguese Raya Seca (Dry borderline), the
   representations of the borderland in Terra Fria, Villardevos, O silencio

   Value of Strategic Game and Contestation Framing in Election Campaign
   Coverage},

Abstract = {News frames are patterns of news construction journalists rely on to
   present information to their audiences. While much of the research on
   news frames has focused on their identification and effects, less work
   has investigated the specific contributions these different frames make
   to democratic life. Value judgments about distinct news frames are often
   not generated in a systematic fashion, not grounded in democratic
   theory, and/or not supported by empirical evidence. In this article, we
   address these problems by arguing for and extending normative assessment
   as a standard operating procedure to determine the democratic value of
   political communication phenomena. We demonstrate the usefulness of
   normative assessment by showing how two important generic news frames
   (politics as a strategic game and as a substantive contestation)
   contribute to a deliberative public discourse prior to a general
   election. Using data on television news coverage of the German federal
   election campaign in 2009, we investigate how these frames are related
   to the inclusiveness and civility of public discourse and the extent to
   which it features exchanges of substantive reasons for political
   positions. Results show that mediated democratic deliberation suffers
   consistently from strategic game framing, while contestation frames make
   ambivalent contributions. Implications for political communication
   scholarship as well as journalistic practice are discussed.

Abstract = {The article explores the reform of the Czech military from the
   perspective of the possible blurring of police and military functions.
   The understanding of security has changed in recent years and the
   European militaries have taken up nontraditional tasks both within and
   outside Europe. Moreover, the fiscal conditions have provoked further
   reconsideration of the role of military. The Czech Republic's armed
   forces have undergone a number of reforms since 1989. The article
   focuses on three factors distinguishing the military from the police:
   territorial scope, use of force, and responsibility before the law. It
   concludes that although the Czech military has become more flexible, it
   does not use all its potential in practice, especially domestically. The
   article suggests that despite the adaptation to the new security
   environment, the military continues to be distinct from police.},

Abstract = {Due to strong evidence indicating that tax morale affects actual
   tax-paying behavior, finding the determinants of tax morale could help
   both to understand and to fight tax evasion. In this paper we analyze
   the effect of progressive taxation on individual tax morale using a
   cross-country approach-a research question that has not been
   investigated in the existing literature. Our theoretical analysis leads
   to two testable predictions. First, an individual's tax morale is
   higher, the more progressive the tax schedule is. Second, the positive
   impact of tax progressivity on tax morale declines with income. In our
   empirical analysis we make use of a unique dataset of tax progressivity
   measures, namely the World Tax Indicators, and follow most of the tax
   morale literature by employing the World Values Survey to measure
   individual tax morale. Controlling for a wide range of potential
   confounders, we are able to confirm both hypotheses in our empirical
   analysis.},

Abstract = {Examination of the First Amendment's establishment clause in the post
   World War II period is unique in American constitutional interpretation
   because virtually all voices had agreed on one point, originalism. Few
   if any significant writers on the establishment clause had doubted the
   centrality of the founders' original intent for interpreting the
   clause's meaning. Yet this now has changed. Unlike their predecessors,
   leading advocates of church-state separation have now moved away from an
   original meaning interpretation of the establishment clause. Yet these
   separationists continue to try to ground their normative policy
   prescriptions in establishment clause mandates. They attempt this
   balancing act by employing narrative strategies of evolutionary
   processes in history. They do not simply track changes in constitutional
   doctrine, but characterize changes yielding greater separation between
   church and state through the nation's history as incipient in the
   Republic's founding, an originally inchoate church-state principle only
   fully formed through historical evolution. In the process, they sweep
   myriad separationist ideas into their progressively evolving narratives
   which have never been enunciated as law. Their accounts thus often
   reflect less an attempt to track historical developments in fundamental
   law than an attempt to construct fundamental law narratives. These
   attempts highlight persistent historical problems in the separationist
   endeavor that require attention if the evolutionary narratives of
   leading separationist are to shape the field of establishment clause
   history.},

Abstract = {This article shows that large outmigration of labor leads to finite
   changes in the structure of production at source. We argue that sectors
   may vanish as they cannot pay higher wages consequent to emigration. We
   also inquire whether emigration of one type of labor hurts the other
   non-emigrating type in this setup. Various situations when real incomes
   of the emigrating and the non-emigrating types do not move together are
   demonstrated. This generalizes some of the existing results in the
   literature. In particular, emigration can lead to a drastic change in
   the degree of inequality depending on which of the sectors survive in
   the postemigration regime.},

Abstract = {This article argues that in Italy, at the end of the nineteenth century,
   monarchy played a strong role in the process of politicization. As the
   first institution of the nation, the monarchy, though theoretically
   super partes, was able not only to gather the political forces of the
   elite, but also of populations which as yet had no vote at the national
   level. These liberal-monarchical organizations were not classical
   political parties, but a network of associations acting in the political
   field as well as in charity, education, leisure and participation in
   national festivities. This rather informal way of `making politics' must
   be taken into account in order to understand better the peculiar track
   followed by Italy at the end of the nineteenth century, and more
   generally, politicization before the era of mass parties.},

Abstract = {Somalia has been plagued by political instability and ongoing conflict
   for over two decades. Yet, that does not mean Somalia has been
   completely isolated from modern technologies and new media. The
   construction of cell phone towers and other means of communication is a
   popular and profitable business in Somalia. One of the more recent
   additions to Somali new media is the use of microblogging. On December
   7, 2011, Somalia's al-Shabaab began a Twitter feed in both English and
   Arabic. In its first two months of tweeting, al-Shabaab promoted its
   successes on the ground, condemned what they see as unjustified acts of
   violence perpetrated against them, and engaged in a Twitter war with the
   Kenyan Defense Forces. This chapter seeks to analyze these first few
   months of al-Shabaab's Twitter activity. What are the main goals of
   al-Shabaab's use of Twitter? How effective have they been? How does
   their use of microblogging compare to other extremists' (such as the
   Taliban) use of Twitter? As Somalia is largely considered a failed state
   and internet penetration is not particularly dense, who is the intended
   audience?},

Journal = {ETHICS \& GLOBAL POLITICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Pages = {39-62},
Abstract = {A step towards constructing an ethics of international activism is
   proposed by formulating a series of constraints on what would constitute
   morally permissible agency in the context that involves delivering
   services abroad, directly or indirectly. Perhaps surprisingly, in this
   effort the author makes use of the concept of `force multiplier'. This
   idea and its official applications have explanatory importance in
   considering the correlation between the post-Cold War phenomenal growth
   in the number of international non-governmental organizations and the
   emergence of the US as the sole, unchallenged superpower. Four moral
   constraints useful for morally assessing international activism are
   formulated and defended. The final outcome is an argument in favor of an
   overarching duty for any activist-minded Westerner to go local, while
   developing nations are urged to closely regulate, even criminalize,
   activities by international activists and `human rights organizations'
   on their territory when not in solidarity or in support of local
   movements. The position defended, urging the normative primacy of local
   over international activism, also finds support in Immanuel Kant's Third
   Definitive Article for A Perpetual Peace.},

Abstract = {The history of colonialism, industrialism, and the rise of technology in
   the West has helped generate the rise of globalism and consumerism that
   dominates the modern world. A better view that the world asks for is to
   celebrate differences, expect them, and nurture them. Just as the world
   benefits from hybrid wheat, it benefits from a rainbow of cultures that
   inevitably adds the kind of value on which you cannot place a price tag.
   The danger of suppressing hybridization is all too familiar, as the
   experience of apartheid and its aftermath in South Africa demonstrates.
   When we accept diversity, we may be less inclined to see the other as a
   commodity and more inclined to see people for who they are.},

Journal = {SOCIAL MOVEMENT STUDIES},

Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-22},
Abstract = {Collective protest actions by the unemployed and the precariously
   employed spread throughout the European countries during the late 1990s
   and early 2000s. Social movement scholars became interested in these
   mobilizations because these protest actions challenged the assumption
   that poor people and weak interests rarely engage in such activities.
   This paper deals with these challenges by summarizing and discussing the
   latest research on the mobilization of the jobless in order to present
   available findings from three European countries and to unveil conducive
   conditions. Particular emphasis is placed upon mobilization structures.
   This paper argues that ongoing changes at a societal level-here mainly
   related to grievances, constituencies and organizational
   infrastructures-provide a beneficial background for increasing the
   probability of collective action by the jobless. While local protests
   were much more common, attempts to stabilize and widen political
   mobilization across time and space proved to depend on available
   political opportunities at the national level. Here, apparent
   differences between the European countries become evident.},

Title = {Human Development and Class Struggle in Venezuela's Popular Economy: The
   Paradox of `Twenty-First Century Socialism'},
Journal = {HISTORICAL MATERIALISM-RESEARCH IN CRITICAL MARXIST THEORY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {21},
Number = {4},
Pages = {177-200},
Abstract = {In this paper, I outline what I take to be the most important
   theoretical claims and innovations of `twenty-first century socialism'
   in Venezuela. These, I argue, consist of an emphasis on human
   development through popular-economy initiatives, and the importance of
   building popular power through the state, rather than by ignoring or
   fighting against it. I then present evidence on Venezuela's Socialist
   Production Units, one of Venezuela's newest state-supported
   popular-economy organisations. I argue that, consistent with the
   twenty-first-century socialism approach, SPUs are sites of human
   development in which participants are learning to challenge capitalist
   social relations, while establishing new values and practices.
   Therefore, we can think of Venezuela's popular economy as expressing a
   sharpened class contradiction.
   However, my case study also shows that holding hands with human
   development is class struggle directed against the state. This reveals a
   central theoretical and practical paradox in twenty-first century
   socialism, namely that, while nurturing initiatives that challenge
   capital, the Venezuelan state also emerges as an important barrier to
   overcoming the class relation. This, I argue, is not wholly consistent
   with the views of theorists of twenty-first century socialism that
   understand Venezuela's popular economy as forming a new form of dual
   power or a parallel state, and who therefore downplay the importance of
   struggles against the state within the popular economy. The strategic
   implication is that struggles between popular-economy participants and
   the state cannot be avoided, and indeed will need to be fostered if the
   project for twenty-first century socialism is to continue.},

Abstract = {Research into the communication strategies of legislators has a long
   history. The European Parliament offers an opportunity to add to
   understanding of how legislators prioritize styles of communication,
   with a comparative perspective across 27 nations. Through content
   analysis of online communication, we investigate how the Internet is
   used by members of the European Parliament. Our analysis assesses three
   communication strategies: homestyle, impression management, and
   participatory. We find that a homestyle strategy predominates, followed
   by impression management. Participatory communication is emergent, but
   may earn legislators political capital, as it appears that proactive
   communicators who offer participatory opportunities are more likely to
   build an online following.},

Year = {2013},
Volume = {21},

Pages = {129-158},
Abstract = {Within the agenda of historical-materialist theory and practice
   Sociological Marxism has delivered a compelling perspective on how to
   explore and link the analysis of civil society, the state, and the
   economy within an explicit focus on class exploitation, emancipation,
   and rich ethnography. This article situates a major analysis of state
   formation, the rise of the justice and Development Party (AKP), and the
   growth of a broader Islamist movement in Turkey within the main current
   of Sociological Marxism. It does so in order to critically examine the
   rather bold revision of the theory of hegemony at the heart of Cihan
   Tugal's Passive Revolution: Absorbing the Islamic Challenge to
   Capitalism, which posits the separate interaction of political society,
   civil society and the state in theorising hegemonic politics in Turkey.
   My contention is that the revision of hegemony that this analysis offers
   and its state-theoretical commitments are deeply problematic due to the
   reliance on what I term `ontological exteriority', meaning the treatment
   of state, civil society and the economy as always-already separate
   spheres. The focus of the critique then moves toward highlighting a
   frustrating lack of direct engagement with Antonio Gramsci's writings in
   this disquisition on hegemony and passive revolution, which has
   important political consequences. While praise for certain aspects of
   ethnographic and spatial analysis is raised, it is argued that any
   account of the reordering of hegemony and the restructuring of
   spatial-temporal contexts of capital accumulation through conditions of
   passive revolution also needs to draw from a more sophisticated state
   theory, a direct reading of Gramsci, and broader scalar analysis of
   spatial relations and uneven development under capitalism.},

Abstract = {Decoding the conceptual metaphors embedded in the premises of a
   practical argument highlights the ways in which thinking and speaking
   metaphorically correlates with social action and practice. The empirical
   investigation takes a different turn in this chapter. It is argued that
   agents perceive the world according to their habitus, their instilled
   dispositions, and internalized values which impact upon their use of
   language. The range of argumentation schemes that speakers exploit shed
   some light upon the strategies deployed to defend or to refute a certain
   standpoint. The reconstruction and evaluation of the argument for ending
   the war in Iraq clearly accounts for Lakoff's (2009: 67) idea that
   `framing comes before policy.'},

Series = {Palgrave Pivot},
Year = {2013},
Pages = {35-56},
Abstract = {Given the rent-capturing behaviour of the transit country, which is
   enhanced significantly by its improved position in terms of the
   obsolescing bargain, this chapter reviews critically the basic
   principles of bargaining theory. The objective is to explain the role of
   bargaining in the determination of transit agreements for cross-border
   oil and gas pipelines. More specifically, this chapter investigates the
   sources of bargaining power, how the balance of power shifts along the
   pipeline supply chain, and how (or whether) bargaining power differs
   with respect to the commodity traded (i.e. oil or gas).},

Abstract = {This essay considers the relationship between global sociology and
   sociological theory through an examination of the critique of Northern
   Theory developed by Raewyn Connell. The author accepts many of Connell's
   criticisms of the formation of the Northern Theory canon, and of the
   false universalism of contemporary Northern Theory, but disputes the
   degree to which Connell has succeeded in finding a replacement for the
   ``ethnosociology of the metropole{''} provided by current sociological
   theory. In particular, the author suggests that, in Southern Theory,
   Connell pursues an intellectual history of world philosophies instead of
   the development of theoretical concepts that could provide a more
   adequate global sociology from a Southern perspective. Connell leaves
   the reader with a reconstructed canon of classics, but without a new
   repertoire of middle-range explanatory and interpretive concepts with
   which to reconstruct our understanding of history itself. The former may
   be the necessary first step toward the latter, however, rendering
   Southern Theory an important moment in the global turn in sociological
   theory.},

Abstract = {This article traces the role of the Prime Minister, Joseph Benedict
   Chifley, in Australia's response to the Dutch-Indonesian colonial
   conflict. It argues for Chifley's centrality to the formation of
   Australia's eventual policy to support Indonesian nationalist
   aspirations, a policy often in antithesis to the views of H.V. Evatt.
   This is significant because a focus on Evatt has distracted historians
   from ascertaining the causes of Australia's policy. Examining Chifley's
   attitude and role reveals that Australia's response to revolutionary
   Indonesia stemmed from an application to the Southeast Asian colonial
   question of a labourist and post-war reconstructionist ethos, an idea of
   sweeping reform to rectify deep economic and social grievances.},

Abstract = {ObjectivesThe purpose of this article is to examine the relationship
   between religion and voting behavior and political attitudes. Moreover,
   this work examines the distinction between black and white evangelicals.
   MethodsThis article makes use of regression and logit analysis of the
   American National Election Studies of 1992 through 2008.
   ResultsIdentification with a particular tradition is important, along
   with attitudes concerning the authorship of the Bible. Moreover,
   affiliation with an evangelical tradition works in opposite directions
   for African Americans and whites. African-American evangelicals, perhaps
   because of the messages on economics and civil rights that are preached
   in the traditional black church, are more likely than other African
   Americans to vote Democratic. Looking at differences concerning
   political issues, however, shows much less clarity than does voting
   behavior. The differences between African-American and white
   evangelicals are largely nonexistent, except on issues that deal
   specifically with race.
   ConclusionThe relationship between religion and voting behavior in
   presidential elections is more complex than previously thought.},

Abstract = {This article addresses an underreported aspect of contemporary warring
   in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC): the experiences of women
   soldiers and officers in the Congolese national armed forces (Forces
   Armees de la Republique Democratique du Congo {[}FARDC]). It thus
   addresses an empirical gap in scholarly and policy knowledge about
   female soldiers in national armies on the African continent, and the DRC
   in particular. Based on original interviews, the article explores the
   way female soldiers in the FARDC understand their identities as women
   soldiers and offers new insight into women soldiers' role and
   responsibilities in the widespread violence committed against civilians
   in the DRC. Moreover, it explores how their understanding of themselves
   as women soldiers both challenges and confirms familiar notions of the
   army as a masculine sphere. Such insight is important for better
   understanding the gendered makeup of the military and for contributing
   to a knowledge base for Security Sector Reform in this violent
   (post)conflict setting.},

Abstract = {Many areas of Belfast were considered no-go areas, places where the
   police had lost jurisdiction, whilst the media designated these
   neighbourhoods as terrorist enclaves. The urban scars that remain after
   the signing of the peace agreement, have transformed these marginalised
   areas into places of hospitality for tourists curious about the past
   conflict. This paper highlights the interdependent relationship between
   hospitality and the development of a post-war confidence for a community
   that had long been stigmatised as a violent enclave. For the purpose of
   this paper I bring together a feminist geopolitical analysis, with its
   attention to daily life, with more recent feminist theories of
   hospitality, observant to issues of inclusiveness. A feminist analysis
   of this type not only reflects the complicated gender politics of West
   Belfast, but also exposes a politics of hospitality that helps reframe
   our understandings of security.},

Journal = {PUBLIC CHOICE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {156},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {723-750},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This paper models theocracy as a regime where the clergy in power
   retains knowledge of the cost of political production but which is
   potentially incompetent, quarrelsome, or corrupt. This is contrasted
   with a secular regime where government is contracted out to a secular
   ruler, and hence the church loses the possibility of observing costs and
   creates for itself a hidden-information agency problem. The church is
   free to choose between regimes-a make-or-buy choice-and we look for the
   range of environmental parameters that are most conducive to the
   superiority of theocracy and therefore to its occurrence and
   persistence, despite its disabilities. Numerical solution of the model
   indicates that the optimal environment for a theocracy is one in which
   the ``bad{''} (high-cost) state is disastrously bad but the probability
   of its occurrence is not very high. Quantitative evidence on the rise of
   ancient Israelite theocracy and the current surge of Islamic theocratic
   fundamentalism provides surprisingly strong support for this prediction.
   Lastly, supportive evidence is suggested by two rare instances of a
   theocracy's peaceful demise.},

Title = {Democracy and Climate Change: What Can Deliberative Democracy
   Contribute?},
Journal = {AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICS AND HISTORY},

Volume = {59},

Abstract = {This paper argues that deliberative democracy is best placed to meet the
   challenge that climate change poses to systems of governance, although
   the task of implementing it is challenging. Deliberative democracy
   extends on the basic idea of democracy by emphasising the way in which
   citizens engage with issues, requiring reflection on all relevant
   dimensions. Where climate change is easily crowded-out in the prevailing
   nature of political debate, deliberation helps to make salient less
   tangible and complex dimensions associated with the issue. Evidence is
   presented in support of the capacities of citizens to deliberate on
   climate change, with evidence drawn from a mini-public in the Australian
   Capital Region. The possibilities for scaling up these benefits of
   deliberation to the polity as a whole are then discussed. Although it is
   not straightforward, specific mechanisms for engendering deliberation
   among the wider public are suggested. If successful, deliberation not
   only promises to transform the possibilities for action on climate
   change, but also to build the capacity to respond by improving the
   underlying conditions for environmental governance.},

Abstract = {Objectives. Our objective is to extend previous structural explanations
   of religious belonging and denominational variations concerning ``closed
   communities{''} and the ``divided by faith{''} thesis to the individual
   level by testing the effect of religious affiliation and church
   membership on levels of self-reported social network diversity among a
   nationally representative sample. Methods. Survey data from the Panel
   Study-American Religion and Ethnicity (PS-ARE) were used to examine
   individual-level variations in social network diversity. A multifaceted
   measure of diversity was decomposed to examine racial, gender,
   educational, and occupational variations in network diversity using a
   series of hierarchical linear models. Results. Our results show that
   while previous structural explanations suggest that religious belonging
   is likely to lower the diversity of one's close social network at the
   individual level, the current findings indicate a positive relationship
   between religious membership and the diversity of one's close friendship
   network above and beyond the effects of denominational affiliation.
   Conclusions. The results of the decomposition component analyses along
   with the hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) strategy highlight the
   relatively distinct role of race in understanding the differing dynamics
   associated with the many indicators of diversity and religious
   belonging.},

Abstract = {One objection that has been consistently raised for theorists who are
   committed to the idea that we have a positive duty to aid the global
   poor is the overdemandingness objection. This article is a critical
   discussion of this objection. First, the objection is laid out in some
   detail. A number of influential attempts to meet the overdemandingness
   objection are then discussed, and it is argued that they all fail in
   their intended purpose. The conclusion of the article is not that the
   overdemandingness objection cannot be met. Rather, the conclusion is
   that the overdemandingness objection constitutes a serious challenge to
   anyone who accepts the objection and goes beyond the standard
   libertarian doctrine and commits herself to the existence of positive
   duties to aid the global poor.},

Abstract = {A new form of entertaining news, accessed by most through television,
   has become a privileged domain of politics for the first time in
   countries beyond the West in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. What are
   the political consequences of this development: What is the relationship
   between media and politics in these regions? We answer these questions
   through a case study of India, the world's largest democracy, where two
   decades of media expansion and liberalization have yielded the largest
   number of commercial television news outlets in the world. We show why
   prevailing theories of media privatization and commercialization cannot
   account for the distinctive architecture of media systems in places like
   India. In this article, we first provide an overview of the historical
   and contemporary dynamics of media liberalization in India and the
   challenges that this poses to existing models and typologies of the
   media-politics relationship. We then present a new typology of media
   systems and a theoretical framework for studying the relationship
   between television news and democratic politics in India, and by
   extension in the global South. In the concluding section, we reflect on
   the broader comparative insights of the essay and discuss directions for
   future research. We believe that our alternative comparative framework
   captures more meaningfully the diversity and complexity of emerging
   media systems and their relationships to democratic practice in these
   regions.},

Abstract = {The article traces the rhetorical and symbolic tools that prompted the
   construction and deconstruction of the mythical and charismatic aura of
   Baldomero Espartero, analysed from Weberian conceptual category of
   charisma. War and politics were two main areas where diverse leadership
   models, developed within liberal political cultures, gathered and were
   compared. The analysis of both charismatic scenarios allow us to
   underscore the contradictions and appropriations that marked the fertile
   phase in the creation of stereotypes that began with the emergence of
   liberalism and modernity.},

Abstract = {This essay uses the case of Zanzibar in its complicated relationship
   with the United Republic of Tanzania (of which it is a part) as a lens
   on debates in political geography on empirical and conceptual approaches
   to critical geopolitics. We test the veracity of a multi-faceted
   critical geopolitics in the contemporary public contestation of
   Zanzibar's place in the United Republic from 2008-2012. We analyze
   Tanzanian media, the speech acts of Tanzanian leaders, and the key
   events and processes related to what is termed the Zanzibar problem'
   during the selected years, to make two points about a critical
   geopolitics approach: to strengthen critical geopolitics by broadening
   the analysis of language to engage political acts and languages beyond
   the Global North; and taking subaltern geopolitics' more seriously via
   engagement with critical geopolitical voices on discourses, events and
   processes from the Global South.},

   companies sued the South African government over medicine patent laws.
   The South African lawsuit has been described as a public relations
   disaster for Big Pharma, and a turning point in HIV/AIDS medicines and
   intellectual property rights discourse. This article assesses these
   claims in relation to a corpus-assisted discourse analysis of 1,000
   articles from U.S., U.K., and South African press outlets from 1997 to
   2003. The study finds that a key discourse change to occur over this
   period was the elevation of generic HIV/AIDS medicines from an excluded
   criminal threat to a respected legitimate option. Given subsequent
   policy developments considerably increasing access to generic HIV/AIDS
   medicines in majority world countries, this article argues that the news
   media discourse change was a key transformative moment in addressing the
   global HIV/AIDS epidemic. The study also notes, however, that an
   antigeneric discourse persisted throughout the coverage, signifying the
   ongoing contestation of medicine patent protection that continues to
   characterize global HIV/AIDS medicines access.},

Abstract = {There is a great deal of enthusiasm about the prospects for Big Data
   held in health care systems around the world. Health care appears to
   offer the ideal combination of circumstances for its exploitation, with
   a need to improve productivity on the one hand and the availability of
   data that can be used to identify opportunities for improvement on the
   other. The enthusiasm rests on two assumptions. First, that the data
   sets held by hospitals and other organizations, and the technological
   infrastructure needed for their acquisition, storage, and manipulation,
   are up to the task. Second, that organizations outside health care
   systems will be able to access detailed datasets. We argue that both
   assumptions can be challenged. The article uses the example of the
   National Health Service in England to identify data, technology, and
   information governance challenges. The public acceptability of third
   party access to detailed health care datasets is, at best, unclear.},

Abstract = {How do the members of societies that can't use government or simple
   ostracism produce social order? To investigate this question I use
   economics to analyze Gypsy law. Gypsy law leverages superstition to
   enforce desirable conduct in Gypsy societies where government is
   unavailable and simple ostracism is ineffective. According to Gypsy law,
   unguarded contact with the lower half of the human body is ritually
   polluting, ritual defilement is physically contagious, and non-Gypsies
   are in an extreme state of such defilement. These superstitions repair
   holes in simple ostracism among Gypsies, enabling them to secure social
   cooperation without government. Gypsies' belief system is an efficient
   institutional response to the constraints they face on their choice of
   mechanisms of social control.},

Abstract = {Presidential debates allow candidates to send a message directly to
   voters. We use an experimental design complemented with a content
   analysis of all presidential debates in 1992, 2004, and 2008 to explore
   how candidates should and do use agenda setting, framing, and message
   tone to shape the agenda in debates. We find that candidates are
   differentially attentive to various topics, depending on the comparative
   advantage provided by the topic. Yet, this agenda control occurs only at
   the margins because topic salience in public opinion predicts candidate
   attention and conditions voters' receptiveness to debate rhetoric. Our
   findings thus suggest that topic salience constrains candidates'
   abilities to focus the agenda strategically. {[}Supplementary material

Series = {Advances in Human and Social Aspects of Technology},
Year = {2013},
Pages = {379-401},
Abstract = {Online publications have become critical sites for the expression of
   views alternative to those of the state. This is true in Zimbabwe as in
   many developing states where the mainstream media operate under onerous
   legislative frameworks. However, the real impact of these `new public
   spheres' on the country's democratization agenda is subject to
   contestation. This chapter examines the impact of online publications
   run by exiled Zimbabwean journalists on the country's democratization
   process. The chapter evaluates the extent to which these online
   publications constitute genuine alternative spaces for the mediation of
   national discourses. Data is elicited through focus group interviews,
   in-depth interviews, and textual analysis. The chapter argues that a
   combination of technical, social, and economic factors which limit
   Internet access and professional shortcomings conspire against online
   publications becoming genuine alternative public spheres, thus
   minimizing their role in the democratization of the Zimbabwean state.},

Abstract = {Just like the pictorial portrait allows us to know the physical features
   of so many historical figures, literature also contributes to the
   perpetuation of their image. Nonetheless, even when the authors have
   attempted to be faithful to the model, neither painting nor literature
   portrays the person as he/she was, but the personal view that the author
   of the work of art had of a particular historical figure. This study
   approaches the image of the protagonists of the Peninsular War (Spanish,
   French and British characters) that drama (both the one that emerged
   contemporary to the events and the one that followed up to its first
   centenary) conveyed along the 19th century. The present research will
   put forward the difference in the literary treatment of those
   personalities during and after the war. Furthermore, thanks to this
   study, it is made clear how drama, the most popular literary genre of
   the 19th century, contributed to the establishment of the images of the
   protagonists of the War of Independence among the Spanish population,
   where just a minority could read and, even those, did not always read
   history books.},

Abstract = {Alfred Sohn-Rethel did not just elaborate a materialist theory of
   knowledge, he also introduced the term `real abstraction' into Marxist
   debate. However, he locates the origin of commodity abstraction solely
   in the sphere of circulation, conceiving of production itself as a mere
   metabolism with nature. This conception, in which the critique of
   capitalism aims exclusively at distribution, and which rejects the
   Marxian concept of `abstract labour', remains widespread. It is our
   express intention here to undertake a critique of such a conception for
   the benefit of a critique of the very mode of capitalist production.},

Title = {FROM POLANYI TO DISCOURSE THEORY},
Booktitle = {FROM ECONOMY TO SOCIETY?: PERSPECTIVES ON TRANSNATIONAL RISK REGULATION},
Series = {Studies in Law Politics and Society},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {62},
Pages = {73-101},
Abstract = {This article starts from the assumption that economic sociology,
   including Karl Polanyi's work, can contribute fresh perspectives to
   regulation debates because it opens up new understandings of the nature
   of economic activity, a key target of legal regulation. In particular
   this article examines Polanyi's idea that society drives regulation. For
   Polanyi the ``regulatory counter-movement{''} is society's response to
   the disembedding - in particular through the proliferation of markets -
   of economic out of social relationships. Section One of the article
   identifies three key challenges that arise from this Polanyian take on
   regulation for contemporary regulation researchers. First, Polanyi
   focuses on social norms restraining business behavior, but neglects
   social norms embedded in law as also shaping regulation. Second, he
   seems to imply a clear-cut conceptual distinction between ``economy{''}
   and ``society.{''} Third, his analysis sidelines the role of interest
   politics in the development of regulation.
   Addressing the first of these three key challenges, Section Two of this
   article therefore argues that a Polanyian vision of ``socialized{''}
   legal regulation should build on contemporary accounts of responsive law
   and regulation, which focus attention on social norms informing legal
   regulation. Section Three of this article tackles the second key
   challenge raised by Polanyi's work for contemporary regulation
   researchers, that is, how to transcend a modernist perspective of
   ``economy{''} and ``society{''} as clearly demarcated, distinct fields
   of social action. It argues that discourse theory is an important
   alternative theoretical resource. Drawing on Laclau and Mouffe, the
   article suggests that understanding ``economy{''} and ``society{''} as
   performed by open and relationally constructed discourses helps to
   capture interconnections between ``economy{''} and ``society{''} that
   become particularly visible when we analyze how specific regulatory
   regimes work at a medium- and small-scale level. These points are
   further brought to life in Section Four through a discussion of the
   European Union (EU) regulatory regime for trade in risky, transgenic
   agricultural products, and in particular the current reform debates
   about the consideration of the ``socioeconomic impacts{''} of such
   products.},

Abstract = {In the middle of the 19th century, the debate on the unification of
   Spain and Portugal, the so-called Iberism, brought about rather
   passionate arguments in both countries and triggered a reflection not
   only on the relation between them within the construction of their
   respective liberal states, but also, on their common history. This
   polemic was also present in the theatre, first in historic drama and
   later in its subsequent development, the political theatre. This piece
   analyses the presence of Portugal and Portuguese topics in the Spanish
   theatre of that period and shows that it is not unknown in the Spanish
   imagery and even reaches the 20th century.},

   achievements of value, esp. works of prof. Olsovsky and his team in 50s
   and early 60s. Till the economic reform of Ota Sik was real engagement
   people from the VSE in economic policy limited (Kurt Rozsypal arrived to
   the V E years after his reform was already enacted). 70s were again
   years of high political influence characterized by creation of Institute
   of Marxism-Leninism where consisting of all original social science
   departments. 80s were characterized by the hidden duality of teaching
   when dominating teachings of political economy of socialism was
   supplemented by teachings of political economy of capitalism mostly in a
   guise of history of economic theories. In 90s a full renaissance of
   economic policy as a subject followed.},

Journal = {POLITICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {30},
Number = {1},
Pages = {42-57},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {This article offers empirical evidence supporting a relationship between
   social influence and voter turnout by comparing the effectiveness of
   face-to-face get-out-the-vote visits by canvassers living in a voter's
   local neighborhood against visits by canvassers from other
   neighborhoods. We analyze data from a randomized campaign conducted by a
   local community outreach group during the 2006 general election. We
   utilize natural variations in the assignment of canvassers to determine
   that the effect of being contacted by the campaign is higher in
   precincts where some canvassers were working in their own neighborhood.
   {[}Supplementary material is available for this article. Go to the
   publisher's online edition of Political Communication for the following
   free supplemental resource: alternative specifications of the analysis
   using fixed effects (Table A1), separating out precincts where there was
   any local canvassing from where there was none (Table A2), a balance
   check for the randomization (Table A3), and descriptions of the contact
   rate and treatment effect excluding outliers (Figures A1 and A2).]},

   markets are believed to allow those choices to be expressed. Using
   market mechanisms is appropriate in some cases, but not in others.
   Markets may fail, but beyond that there are many things that they cannot
   do - for example, managing relationships that are not commodifiable, or
   protecting individual rights. Attempts to simulate market mechanisms do
   not necessarily work as markets are supposed to work, and quasi-markets,
   for example in the personalisation of care, can operate quite
   differently. Individualised responses in social policy are not always
   preferable to generalised responses.},

Abstract = {This article looks at the case of the Grillini movement and its
   emergence on the Italian political scene, and discusses its contribution
   to the growing literature on the increasing opportunities offered by the
   Internet for social movement participation and mobilization. My findings
   are that the movement is successful in both mobilizing and promoting
   open debate and participation because of its policies and its use of
   multiple, and fairly open platforms for participation and horizontal
   decision-making. The Grillini have been able to conciliate the
   characteristics of newly emerging, Internet-based, `internetworked
   movements' as well as the more conventional use of the Internet on
   behalf of well-established social and political movements. They have
   been able to do so by articulating issues and mobilizing on a national
   scale, with an increasingly large bureaucratic elite, while retaining a
   vibrant, partly online- and partly offline-based public sphere and
   decentralized organizational forms. My conclusion is that the Grillini
   movement, with its peculiar structure and commitment to participation
   and inclusion, is a crucial example of how the Internet can be used to
   aggregate new political issues and foster continuous debate while
   consolidating a growing electorally driven organization, which is still
   mostly held accountable by the movement's public sphere.},

Abstract = {We examine the effects of subnational variations in corruption and
   democratization on the location decisions of foreign investors in
   Russian regions using firm-level panel data for the period 1996-2007. We
   link these effects to the level of corruption and type of political
   regime in the country of origin of a foreign investor. We find a
   relationship between attributes of foreign investors' home countries and
   attributes of the regions in which investment takes place: foreign
   investors from less corrupt and democratic countries tend to invest in
   less corrupt and more democratic Russian regions, whereas those from
   more corrupt and non-democratic countries tend to invest in more corrupt
   and less democratic regions. An inference is that, in Russian regions
   with high corruption and with autocratic government, foreign direct
   investment appears driven by the personal interests of controlling
   regional political elites who collaborate for mutual gain with foreign
   investors from corrupt and autocratic countries. Our results suggest a
   general conclusion that origin and location of foreign investment are
   linked by common political culture. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Drawing on social identity and social impact theory, this paper is the
   first to investigate the impact of religious preferences on share prices
   and expected returns at the country level. Using data from 12 European
   countries, our findings suggest that religion has a significant effect
   on the share price of companies whose activities are considered
   unethical, i.e., tobacco manufacturers and alcohol producers. The share
   price of these companies (called sin stocks) is depressed when they are
   located in a predominantly Protestant environment (relative to a
   Catholic environment). With investors in Protestant countries being more
   sin averse than in Catholic countries, they insist upon higher expected
   returns on sin stocks. Conversely, religious preferences do not have the
   same impact on the performance of other companies, e.g. socially
   responsible companies. Our results are robust to various methodologies
   and controlling for several firm-specific, industry-specific and
   country-specific characteristics. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {The impact of politics on international trade has often been excluded by
   economists both from theoretical and empirical analysis. In this study,
   we examine empirically the impact of politics on trade flows. Results
   indicate that political differences have an impact on bilateral trade
   that is robust to a wide range of econometric specifications. However,
   the impact of political differences on trade flows vanishes when the
   costs of reducing the latter become fairly important.},

Abstract = {Can presidents influence news coverage through their press conferences?
   Scant research has explored this question leaving two possible answers.
   On the one hand, presidential news management efforts, combined with
   norms of journalistic professionalism and the cost of producing news,
   suggest that the nightly news will cover presidential press conferences.
   On the other hand, the costs of delivering press conferences espoused by
   some scholars insinuate that press conferences will have little impact
   on news coverage. To determine whether the press conference influences
   news coverage, I use plagiarism detection software to assess the
   propensity of television news to incorporate the president's rhetoric
   into stories that cover the president's press conferences. I find that
   news reports on the press conference rely heavily on the president's
   words, indicating that it is an important event for presidential
   influence of the news media and perhaps eventually the public.},

Abstract = {This paper argues for the importance of attending to both affective and
   emotional experience in analysing the origins and effects of border and
   immigration efforts in the US/Mexico border region. We do so by engaging
   with theoretical understands of the politics of affect and emotion among
   cultural and feminist geographers and social scientists. We then examine
   Arizona's SB 1070 and its connection to a larger history of border and
   immigration enforcement in Arizona. Drawing from ethnographic work,
   interviews, and media and policy analysis, we engage with narratives
   provided by border area ranchers to unpack how these ranchers'
   encounters with unauthorised migrants have changed over time. We then
   examine how the everyday fear and anxiety associated with these
   encounters drive political activism and state intervention in the
   region. We conclude by discussing how this intervention, in turn,
   reproduces racial and gender hierarchies, hierarchies that are
   themselves affectively mediated.},

Abstract = {Using real-time data from the annual budgets over the period 1958-2009,
   we explore budgetary planning and implementation in the Netherlands.
   Three fiscal policy regimes are distinguished. Our key findings are the
   following. First, plans are on average unbiased, although they are
   overoptimistic during earlier parts of our sample and overly pessimistic
   during the later parts of our sample, when revenues are under-projected.
   Second, general economic conditions and the state of the public finances
   are important determinants of both plans and their implementation.
   Third, this is also the case for political and institutional factors.
   Expenditure overruns are partly related to political factors, whereas
   cautious revenue forecasts relate to the institutional setting. Fourth,
   under the most recent regime of ``trend-based budgeting{''}
   implementation was strongest relative to planning. In fact, this regime
   may contain some elements that are useful for designing national fiscal
   arrangements elsewhere. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Since the end of World War II, there were two moments when France had to
   face a dramatic increase of German power: the first one corresponded to
   Pierre Mendes France's tenure as Prime Minister, who had to deal with
   German rearmament; the second moment was coincident with Francois
   Mitterrand's presidency, when the question of German unification was
   again on the table. Traditionally, it has been asserted that French
   attitude concerning these problems had been merely reactive and
   incapable of exerting any significant influence on the course of events.
   However, during the last years a new literature has emerged which
   emphasizes the importance of French contribution to the evolution of
   institutional continental architecture. In this article, there has been
   implemented a comparative study on the reaction of both French leaders
   and their influence on European integration. Its conclusions are closer
   to the latter view, because Mendes France was decisive to enhance the
   Anglosaxon compromise in the defence of the continent, with a division
   of labour between the European Communities and NATO. For his part,
   Mitterrand's action helped to anchor united Germany in Europe more
   closely, even though his ability to influence the events was narrower.
   Finally, France evidenced in both moments its reluctance towards
   federalism, and preferred intermediate solutions. These solutions
   provided Paris with a certain autonomy of action, a result that was
   coherent with its objective of preserving its world power status.},

Abstract = {Uganda suffered coups between 1966 and 1985, but has remained stable
   since 1986 despite predisposition to previous coups. Ethnic antagonism,
   weak state institutionalization, and past coups, had made Uganda
   coup-prone. Compared to previous governments, the post-1986 leadership
   effectively applied and undertook coup-prevention strategies consistent
   with James Quinlivan's coup-proofing theory. These include establishing
   a parallel military structure to the mainstream military; formation of
   security services with parallel reporting channels, monitoring over
   society, and other security agencies; and co-optation of the military in
   politics through parliamentary representation. These measures have
   helped the regime to watch over security agencies and prevent possible
   military intervention. Uganda's post-1986 regime stability is
   interesting in its own right. But it provides evidence consistent with,
   and useful for testing the efficacy of, Quinlivan's coup-proofing
   theory: with relevant application and domestication the theory applies
   to Uganda.},

Abstract = {An enduring assumption exists in the United States that past military
   service casts electoral candidates in a positive light. To demonstrate
   how voters understand candidates' military experiences, it is necessary
   to understand how their attitudes about a candidate change when exposed
   to biographic information. This study uses an experimental design to
   evaluate whether voters see candidates with a military background as
   better able to handle defense and security issues, are more capable
   leaders, and whether voters express higher affect toward veteran
   candidates. Using manipulated television advertising and handbills from
   an actual election, along with variation of the party information about
   the candidate, this study finds that voters are unmoved in their
   impressions of leadership and their affect toward a candidate with
   military experience. However, potential voters report markedly higher
   evaluations of candidates' ability to handle defense and security issues
   when exposed to the military cue, irrespective of party affiliation.},

Volume = {12},

Abstract = {All 24 states that permit voters to cast ballots directly on policy
   matters also require that contributions and expenditures on ballot issue
   campaigns be disclosed publicly. Scholars assert that information about
   the financial involvement of interest groups in ballot issue campaigns
   provides voters with valuable cues about how to vote on potentially
   complex and confusing issues. In this article, I argue that the proper
   way to assess the informational benefits of disclosure is to assess
   whether the information gleaned from disclosure reports is beneficial to
   voters at the margin, once other available information is taken into
   account. Using a survey experiment, I show that disclosure information
   provides few marginal benefits for voters, calling into question the
   informational rationale for disclosure laws.},

Title = {Recovery and Reinvestment Act spending at the state level: Keynesian
   stimulus or distributive politics?},
Journal = {PUBLIC CHOICE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {155},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {449-468},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {We examine the US state-level pattern of American Recovery and
   Reinvestment Act (ARRA) spending. We relate spending to (1) Keynesian
   determinants of countercyclical policy, (2) congressional power and
   dominance, and (3) presidential electoral vote importance. We find that
   the ARRA is, in practice, poorly designed countercyclical stimulus.
   After controlling for political variables, coefficients on Keynesian
   variables are often statistically insignificant. When they are
   statistically significant they are often the ``incorrect{''} sign. On
   the other hand, statistically significant effects are associated with
   majority party House of Representative appropriations subcommittee and
   authorization committee membership. One striking result is that the
   elasticity of ARRA spending with respect to the pre-ARRA ratio of
   federal grants and payments to federal taxes paid is estimated to be
   greater than unity in most specifications. States previously capturing
   large amounts of federal funds continue to do so under the ARRA
   stimulus.},

Abstract = {This article develops the argument that the state must provide parental
   subsidies if, and to the extent that, individuals would, under certain
   specified hypothetical conditions, purchase `insurance cover' that would
   provide the funds they need for adequate childrearing. I argue that most
   citizens would sign up to an insurance scheme, in which they receive a
   guarantee of a means-tested parental subsidy in return for an obligation
   to pay a progressive income tax to fund the scheme. This argument from
   insurance bolsters the weaker case that proponents of parental subsidies
   might offer were they to rely exclusively on arguments from fair play
   and efficiency.},

Abstract = {During the Spanish transition to democracy, media liberalization mostly
   affected newspapers and magazines. As for news agencies, the official
   Efe, founded in 1939, was favored by both dictatorial and democratic
   governments, which considered it as a strategic instrument to support
   dictatorship or foster democracy depending on the historical context.
   Europa Press, a private news agency founded in 1957, became its main
   competitor and earned high reputation by taking advantage of the news
   stories that Efe did not dare to cover because of its political ties.
   The Minister of Information attempted to close down the agency but he
   finally was dismissed due to internal political struggles. The
   situation, however, did not change either during the transition to
   democracy (1975-82) or the first Socialist government (1982-86). In both
   periods, the ruling parties boosted Efe through different means and
   sought the economic suffocation of Europa Press. Based on documents from
   the archive of Antonio Herrero, director of Europa Press between 1964
   and 1989, this article analyzes the most significant episodes of
   government pressures on this agency and the arguments used to justify
   them. Conclusions on the relationship between news agencies and the
   State in processes of transition to democracy are also reached.},

Abstract = {One way to approach conflict management is to use a four-dimensional
   political legitimacy criterion, which could set the agenda for enhancing
   peace prospects in Cyprus, Moldova and Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH).
   Here the argument is that through measuring the internal legitimacy of
   conflicting parties and then comparing and contrasting the given
   empirical values on the scales of cohesion/security and
   democracy/performance, we may be able to distinguish conflicting pairs
   either merging together or drifting apart, depending on how the
   secessionist entities position themselves vis-a-vis their parent states.
   Empirical facts on the ground tell us that Cyprus may have the biggest
   chances of reunification, whereas Moldova's perspective looks meagre.
   The BiH, which has preserved its territorial integrity, faces real
   secessionist challenges, given the illegitimacy of the state and a
   manifest dissatisfaction with systemic deficiencies.},

Abstract = {Using prior seminal work that places emphasis on news framing and its
   relevance to sociocultural context, this study describes, maps, and
   explains evolving patterns of communication on Twitter through the
   events of the 2011 Egyptian uprisings, which led to the resignation of
   President Mubarak. Using a multimethodological approach, we conducted a
   network, content, and discourse analysis of randomly sampled tweets from
   approximately one million tweets over a month-long time period to study
   broadcasting and listening practices on Twitter. The findings suggested
   networked framing and gatekeeping practices that became activated as
   prominent actors and frames were crowdsourced to prominence.
   Quantitative findings underscored the significant role of ordinary users
   who both rose to prominence and elevated others to elite status through
   networked gatekeeping actions. In depth, discourse analysis of prominent
   actors and frames highlighted the fluid, iterative processes inherent in
   networked framing as frames were persistently revised, rearticulated,
   and redispersed by both crowd and elite. The ambience and affect
   afforded by the platform further supported conversational practices that
   enabled combined processes of networked framing and gatekeeping. The
   findings point to new directions for hybrid and fluid journalisms that
   rely on subjective pluralism, cocreation, and collaborative curation.},

Abstract = {Using data from the 2002 Wisconsin Advertising Project and a Democratic
   direct mailing firm, we ask if candidates publicly court African
   American and Hispanic voters through the inclusion of these groups in
   their campaign advertisements or through appeals to their substantive
   policy interests. We find evidence that Democratic and Republican
   candidates make symbolic and substantive appeals only when these appeals
   are very unlikely to be viewed by White voters. These findings lend
   credence to studies that conclude that candidates are hesitant to
   publicly court minority voters due to concerns that such activities may
   harm their existing electoral coalitions, particularly their standing
   with White voters.},

Abstract = {Objective I examine how the prevalence of U.S. state legislators
   economically connected to an industry, and the diversity of economic
   connections in a legislature, vary in response to the employment share
   of that industry in the state, the partisan split of the legislature,
   and professionalization (or its components). Methods I use
   conflict-of-interest filings for 19992000, 2000 Census employment data,
   and related data to examine the prevalence of connections to several
   sectors using seemingly unrelated regression. Results The employment
   share of an industry in the state is a powerful predictor of connections
   to that industry among legislators, as is the partisan split of the
   chamber. Professionalization plays a role, dominated by its pay
   component, but to a smaller degree. Professionalization is the primary
   predictor of the diversity of connections. Conclusion Legislators'
   economic connections are driven in part by underlying conditions such as
   the economic makeup of the state.},

Abstract = {This article discusses Abdullahi Ahmed an-Na'im's Islam and the Secular
   State from the perspective of Marsilius of Padua's political theory.
   Both authors share similar concepts of the relationship between
   religion, state policy, and the state, and allow for the integration of
   religious doctrines into state law. Nonetheless, the Marsilian
   conception provides stronger protection of unbelievers' and religious
   dissenters' civic rights. In the broader discourse on political theory
   of rights, Marsilius argues in favors of individual rights and a
   protection of minority rights, while an-Na'im's theory of Shari'a reform
   suggests a preference for a people's self-determination.},

Abstract = {The mean majority deficit in a two-tier voting system is a function of
   the partition of the population. We derive a new square-root rule: For
   odd-numbered population sizes and equipopulous units the mean majority
   deficit is maximal when the member size of the units in the partition is
   close to the square root of the population size. Furthermore, within the
   partitions into roughly equipopulous units, partitions with small even
   numbers of units or small even-sized units yield high mean majority
   deficits. We discuss the implications for the winner-takes-all system in
   the US Electoral College.},

Abstract = {Various politicians and public commentators seek to deny birthright
   citizenship to children born in the United States to undocumented or
   temporary migrants. Among their claims, critics of universal birthright
   citizenship contend that the practice flies in the face of liberal
   principles, in which both individuals and the state should consent to
   membership. From this perspective, citizenship through naturalization is
   valorized, since it rests on the affirmative choice of the immigrant and
   the clear consent of the state. This chapter proposes a different
   approach to these debates, one that underscores the principles of
   inclusion and equality. The argument rests on empirical evidence on how
   those affected by these debates - foreign-born residents and their
   U.S.-born children - understand belonging in the United States.
   Interviews with 182 U.S.-born youth and their immigrant parents born in
   Mexico, China, and Vietnam show that despite a discourse portraying U.S.
   citizenship as a civic and political affiliation blind to ascriptive
   traits, many of those interviewed equate ``being American{''} with
   racial majority status, affluence, and privilege. For many immigrants,
   membership through naturalization - the exemplar of citizenship by
   consent - does not overcome a lingering sense of outsider status.
   Perhaps surprisingly, birthright citizenship offers an egalitarian
   promise: it is a color-blind and class-blind path to membership. The
   Citizenship Clause of Fourteenth Amendment provides constitutional
   legitimacy for the ideals of inclusion and equality, facilitating
   immigrant integration and communal membership through citizenship.},

Abstract = {There are two ways that government activities influence private
   charitable giving: (1) government spending on the provision of public
   goods may cause crowding out of private charitable contributions; and
   (2) tax incentives may boost private charitable giving. From a sample of
   German income tax returns, we estimate the elasticity of charitable
   giving relative to tax incentives, income, and government spending.
   Using censored quantile regression analysis, we derive results for
   different points of the underlying distribution of charitable giving.
   Evaluating overall treasury efficiency, the tax deductibility of
   charitable donations fosters enough private giving to offset foregone
   tax revenues.},

Journal = {SOCIAL MOVEMENT STUDIES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Pages = {96-102},
Abstract = {The world witnessed a startling phenomenon in the spring of 2011.
   Citizens across a set of countries were acting in similar ways to
   initiate negotiations with their governments for political change.
   Rapidly they learnt from each other. They shared a new understanding on
   how power should be organized and how national wealth should be used for
   the good of the public, putting forth a new political arrangement that
   spread, quickly across international borders. Nowhere else was this
   phenomenon more distinct than in the cities, usually centre points of
   cross-border flows of people, money and ideas, and that nurtured a
   certain section of citizenry exposed to external influences. This
   Profile illustrates that globalization facilitates the establishment of
   conditions for citizens to be able to compare themselves to other groups
   and perceive themselves as being relatively deprived. Globalization also
   broadens the range of factors and events that may trigger a social
   movement in a society, and allows actors across social movements in
   different countries to exchange notes, watch out for successful
   strategies and adapt those of others' into their own towards effective
   results. In this way, this Profile examines the transferability of
   recent urban social movements across international borders, particularly
   focusing on the factors leading to the transfer of certain elements from
   the pro-democracy movement of the spring of 2011 in Egypt to an
   anti-corruption movement in India that also took place at the same time.},

Title = {Polarization in the Media During an Election Campaign: A Dynamic Network
   Model Predicting Support and Attack Among Political Actors},

Abstract = {In multiparty election campaigns, many political parties and candidates
   compete for media attention, voters, and a government majority. Negative
   campaigning, which is often newsworthy, is an attractive strategy in the
   competition for media attention. However, political support for another
   party offers an alternative strategy because it signals preferred
   government coalitions. The research question to be addressed here is:
   What is prompting a political party to either support or attack another
   party in a news medium on a specific day in an election campaign? We
   analyze statements of support and attack among politicians and political
   parties reported in the news media during the 2006 Dutch national
   election campaign. Combining hypotheses from research in negative
   campaigning and the mediatization of politics with concepts from social
   network analysis, we predict whether a reported statement expresses
   support or an attack among political actors. Party size, party ideology,
   and incumbency of the political actors are important static predictors.
   Dynamic predictors, which indicate how the campaign has evolved thus
   far, include agreement or disagreement on issues recently raised in the
   media as well as recent attacks and support statements. The dynamic
   predictors are needed to explain polarization among political actors in
   the media during the campaign. The results show that reported statements
   affect the course of the election campaign.},

Abstract = {Representative democracy requires that citizens know the facts about
   political performance, and if more such facts are available in the
   media, citizens have more opportunity to acquire them. In view of
   increasing media choice, such an opportunity may vary from one
   individual media environment to another. However, it remains unclear how
   differences in information acquisition correspond with differences in
   the information available specifically in those sources that citizens
   choose to use on a routine basis. Drawing on data from a two-wave panel
   survey and media content analysis, this article examines if greater
   availability of performance-relevant information in the media
   facilitates acquisition of such information among those reliant on these
   media. It also examines when and how strongly this effect differs for
   people with different levels of learning motivation. Using a multilevel
   model, we find that citizens are more likely to learn facts about
   political performance when their preferred sources offer a greater
   quantity of performance-relevant information. We also find that
   motivation moderates the influence of availability, such that strongly
   motivated individuals gain comparatively the most from a greater supply
   of information. The implications of our findings for representative
   democracy are considered. {[}Supplementary material is available for

Abstract = {The article addresses the influence of U.S. online campaign practices on
   West-European party organizations. The empirical case is the Norwegian
   Labor Party: To what extent did Labor adopt the online practices of the
   Obama campaign, and in what sense was the online strategy adapted to fit
   existing campaign and organizational structures? Based on the diffusion
   of technology and a hybridization perspective on campaign change, it is
   suggested that the literature on political parties and the network party
   model in particular is helpful to understand this process. The findings
   show that the Norwegian Labor Party was highly influenced by Obama's
   online campaign and U.S. online practices. However, the practices were
   adjusted to an existing campaign style and organizational structure.
   Moreover, an essential part of the online strategy was a thematic
   network structure that aimed to lower the threshold for participation
   and thereby engage and activate party members, as well as recruit new
   members. Hence, U.S. campaign practices diffuse to Norwegian electoral
   politics, and the adopted U.S. practices are implemented based on the
   ideals of the network party.},

Abstract = {Can social media facilitate better protest action organization and
   coordination? This question has been at the forefront of discussion
   between media pundits and academic scholars. But what networking
   mechanisms and communication patterns help activists achieve better
   organization and coordination? This study uses social network analysis
   to explore students' Twitter use during the 2010 university occupations.
   It maps the interconnections between Twitter occupation accounts at the
   peak of the online protest network's activity and examines how this
   structure benefited the entire network. It identifies (a) how
   ``closely{''} accounts were connected, (b) which were the best
   connected, and (c) which acted as brokers. Findings show that the
   protest groups used the Twitter network structure to establish
   horizontal, direct lines of communication to efficiently redistribute
   information. Although some accounts played a larger role in distributing
   information than others, occupation accounts could continue to receive
   information from the decentralized network even if well-connected
   accounts were removed.},

Abstract = {For all 60 years of the existence of the University of Economics, Prague
   (UEP) was statistics one of the taught compulsory course, and here also
   took place the specialized studies of statistics, which predecessor was
   Statistical and Actuarial engineering at the University of Special
   Sciences (within the Czech Technical University). The article focuses on
   the 50's, when at the UEP existed the independent Faculty of Statistics
   and when the lessons of statistics were difficulty exempted from the
   Stalinist dogmatism. Between the personalities is mentioned prof.
   Benedikt Korda (1914-2010), who was the most famous person in the first
   period of Faculty, (there will be mentioned his remarkable CV), prof.
   Lubomir Cyhelsky ({*}1929), who was the head of the department in
   1962-1990, and prof. Jiri Likes (1929-1994) as well, who was
   internationally acclaimed scientists in the theory of probability and
   mathematical statistics, whose name is used for one of the greatest
   lecture hall at the University. Since 1991 there exist at the Faculty of
   Informatics and Statistics the Department of Statistics and Probability
   (17 internal teachers and 13 internal PhD students), the Department of
   Economic Statistics (6 + 3) and the Department of Demography (6 + 4).},

Title = {Has Growing Income Inequality Polarized the American Electorate? Class,

Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {94},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1062-1083},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {ObjectivesWe investigate whether growing income inequality has
   heightened differences in economic interests between the haves and the
   have nots and if this class polarization has increased ideological
   polarization in the electorate.
   MethodsWe examine the trend in ideological orientation among low- and
   high-income voters from 1972 to 2008.
   ResultsWhile both income inequality and ideological polarization have
   increased in recent years, this analysis indicates that the growth in
   ideological polarization is not the result of growing income inequality.
   The well-off have not become significantly more conservative and less
   liberal nor have those on the lower rungs of the economic ladder become
   significantly more liberal and less conservative.
   ConclusionThe analysis indicates that ideological polarization is the
   result of the increased polarization of the political parties, not class
   polarization.},

Volume = {94},
Number = {5, SI},
Pages = {1207-1221},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {ObjectivesMarginalization of minority issues from the congressional
   agenda is widely recognized as a hurdle to the functional representation
   of African Americans and Latinos. This article examines whether the
   descriptive representation of minorities in positions of influence helps
   to address this marginalization.
   MethodsLogistic regression analysis of over 27,000 hearings held in the
   U.S. House of Representatives between 1979 and 2008 examines whether
   congressional hearings addressing minority interest issues were more
   likely to occur under Latino and African-American committee and
   subcommittee chairs.
   ResultsFindings reveal hearings chaired by Latinos and African Americans
   were more likely to address civil rights, social welfare, and housing
   issues.
   ConclusionThese findings confirm that descriptive representation in
   positions with influence over committee agendas facilitates
   institutional attention to minority issues, and suggests that the
   acquisition of institutional power by black and Latino representatives
   is critical to the functional representation of minority interests.},

Abstract = {Reforms often occur in waves, seemingly cascading from country to
   country. We argue that such reform waves can be driven by informational
   spillovers: uncertainty about the outcome of reform is reduced by
   learning from the experience of similar countries. We motivate this
   hypothesis with a simple theoretical model of informational spillovers
   and learning, and then test it empirically using an approach inspired by
   the gravity model. We find evidence of informational spillovers both
   with respect to both political and economic liberalization. While the
   previous literature has focused only on economic reform, we find that
   the spillovers are particularly important for political changes. (C)

Title = {The aftermath of an election crisis: Kenyan attitudes and the influence
   of individual-level and locality violence},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {37},
Pages = {5-17},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {How does violent conflict affect social and political attitudes? To
   answer this question I pair Kenyan survey and violence data for the time
   period following the country's December 27th 2007 national election. I
   find that respondents who personally experienced electoral violence are
   less likely to express certain forms of inter-personal and institutional
   trust than those individuals who did not. The association is not
   universally powerful, however. First, noteworthy differences emerge
   between populations who relocated as a result of post-election conflict
   and those who did not. Differences between these groups suggest that
   internal migration in the wake of tragedy influenced the Kenyan social
   landscape. In addition to personal exposure to electoral conflict, I
   test how local level violence may indirectly condition Kenyan political
   attitudes. Across all models, individual-level exposure to violence has
   the most consistent influence upon opinions, although district level
   effects emerge in analyses without survey respondent ethnicity controls.
   This finding suggests that living in a setting of regional insecurity
   does not have as important an effect on certain political views as
   personal victimization. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {PUBLIC CHOICE},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the relationship between fiscal federalism and
   the sizes of local governments. While many empirical studies emphasized
   that grants encourage the growth of local public spending and local
   taxes constrain it, they are more silent regarding the effects of
   different types of tax autonomy. The paper addresses this issue by
   arguing that tax decentralization as organized on tax bases used only by
   local governments (tax-separation), rather than on tax-base sharing,
   would restrain local public expenditures. Using an unbalanced panel of
   OECD countries, the key finding is that only property taxes-mostly based
   on a ``tax-separation{''} scheme-seem to favor smaller local

Abstract = {Objectives. Washington State held its first ``top two primary{''} in
   2008. Under this system, the two candidates receiving the most votes
   move on to the general election, regardless of party affiliation. This
   study empirically examines the potential incentive under this top two
   primary system for each political party to discourage ``excess{''} party
   candidates from entering primary contests. Methods. We examine this
   possibility by looking at the Washington State Legislative Primaries in
   2004, 2006, 2008, and 2010. With these data, we estimate the factors
   impacting the number of primary candidates in a race for each political
   party, including the change in the primary format in 2008. Results. Our
   results indicate that the switch to the top two primary reduced the
   likelihood of having multiple Democratic candidates in a race, reduced
   the number of ``excess{''} Democratic candidates, but did not have a
   significant impact on Republican candidates. Conclusion. With many
   states revising their primary systems, an understanding of the
   incentives present under alternative systems is critical. As such, the
   results presented in this study provide evidence that the top two
   primary gives the political parties an incentive to discourage excess
   primary candidates.},

Title = {Government efficiency, institutions, and the effects of fiscal
   consolidation on public debt},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {31},
Pages = {40-59},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {We study the evolution of the ratio of public debt to GDP during 132
   fiscal episodes in 21 OECD countries in 1981-2008. Our main focus is on
   debt dynamics during 40 consolidation periods. To define these periods
   we use data on the evolution of the underlying cyclically adjusted
   primary balance, and as such avoid biases that may be induced by one-off
   budgetary measures. The paper brings new evidence on the role of public
   sector efficiency for the success of fiscal consolidation. First, we
   confirm that consolidation programs imply a stronger reduction of the
   public debt ratio when they rely mainly on spending cuts, except public
   investment. Government wage bill cuts, however, only contribute to lower
   public debt ratios when public sector efficiency is low. Second, we find
   that a given consolidation program will be more effective in bringing
   down debt when it is adopted by a more efficient government apparatus.
   Third, more efficient governments adopt consolidation programs of better
   composition. As to other institutions, consolidation policies are more
   successful when they are accompanied by product market deregulation, and
   when they are adopted by left-wing governments. By contrast,
   simultaneous labor market deregulation may be counterproductive during
   consolidation periods. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Objectives. In recent years, scholars have become concerned about the
   effects that declining levels of social capital are having on community
   life in the United States. Data suggest that Americans are less likely
   to interact with neighbors and less likely to participate in community
   groups than they were in the past. Nevertheless, researchers have found
   that participation in some types of organizations has a positive impact
   on social capital and civic involvement. Each year, millions of American
   youth participate in programs designed to promote positive youth
   development. Here, we examine the effect that participation in one of
   the largest youth organizations, the Boy Scouts of America (BSA), has on
   adult social capital and community involvement. Methods. Utilizing a
   national survey of adult males, we compare measures of social capital
   and community involvement for former Scouts and non-Scouts. Results. Our
   findings suggest that level of involvement in the Boy Scouts is
   significantly related to measures of adult social capital and community
   engagement. Conclusion. Scouting tends to have a significant impact on
   the lives of its most committed members. Future research must continue
   to explore the long-term effects of participation in youth
   organizations.},

Abstract = {Despite the crucial role it played in the 2008 war between Russia and
   Georgia, the phenomenon of passportisation has not received a great deal
   of scholarly attention. Much of the literature has treated the mass
   distribution of Russian passports to the residents of Abkhazia and South
   Ossetia as little more than a strategy to manufacture an excuse to go to
   war with Georgia. Drawing on recent scholarship on territory and
   territoriality, as well as with literature addressing Agamben's theories
   of exceptional spaces, this paper contributes to a more nuanced
   understanding of passportisation by analysing the territorial effects it
   produced. It argues that the wholesale conversion of Abkhazians and
   South Ossetians into Russian citizens did not merely manufacture a casus
   belli, it also produced exceptional spaces within the territory of the
   Republic of Georgia, where the norms of international law and the modern
   state system were effectively suspended.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the participation of the Philippines in the Cortes
   of Cadiz, through the actions of deputy Ventura de los Reyes, a Creole
   elected in representation of the council of Manila. Studies, first, the
   process by which the Philippines came to be represented in a parliament
   that brought together representatives from all over the empire.
   Analyzes, then, the reform plan for the archipelago that Reyes presented
   in the Cortes and the issues discussed by the sum of members in relation
   to the Philippines: proposals for Philippine trade after the end of the
   Manila Galleon and how that affected the commercial traffic of all the
   empire; the convenience, or not, of differentiating policies depending
   on the state of the provinces; the practical problems for incorporating
   Filipinos into the political life of the empire and the issues that
   hindered the establishment of equality among all the Spaniards of both
   hemispheres; debates on the organization of future elections, the groups
   that should participate in them and the type of representation that the
   Philippines could send to a common parliament. Finally, the paper closes
   by evaluating the impact that these issues had in the archipelago; the
   groups that felt represented by Ventura de los Reyes and the sectors
   that felt excluded; the struggle for political power evidenced behind
   the performances; and how those early political battles of the first
   decades of the nineteenth century were essential for the political
   renewal of the Philippines},

Abstract = {This study examines how power relations between journalism and political
   actors vary across the news production process. Applying a process
   approach, it addresses this issue by exploring journalists' enactment of
   the watchdog role in two key moments of news production: the
   interactional phase and the news-construction phase. The study is
   conducted in the context of press conferences with the Swedish
   Government and involves data from question-and-answer sessions and
   published news content that was initiated by such press conferences.
   With a low or moderate extent of journalistic aggressiveness in the
   interactional phase, the results indicate that this moment is
   characterized by cooperativeness and can be described in accordance with
   an exchange model. By contrast, the analysis of the published news
   content demonstrates a high extent of criticism and is in line with an
   adversary model. Altogether, the findings contribute new evidence to
   suggest that the power relations between journalists and political
   actors vary across the moments of news production, and that journalistic
   autonomy increases in the later phases of the process. The differences
   in the extent of watchdog-role performance are discussed in terms of a
   strategic ritual by which news journalism promotes a favorable image of
   itself as a public watchdog institution.},

Abstract = {In this article, a two-party contest where candidates allocate their
   campaign resources strategically between two salient issues is studied.
   The analysis aims to determine the circumstances under which there is
   issue convergence (both parties emphasizing the same issue) or issue
   divergence (different parties emphasizing different issues) during a
   political campaign. For this purpose, the concepts of a party's absolute
   and comparative advantage are used. A party has an absolute advantage on
   an issue if a majority of voters prefer its position on this issue to
   that of its opponent. A party has a comparative advantage on an issue if
   the percentage of votes that it would obtain if voters cared only about
   that issue is larger than those that it would obtain if voters cared
   only about the other issue. It is shown here that issue convergence can
   occur only if one of the parties has an absolute advantage on both
   issues, but its comparative advantage is not too large. Otherwise, there
   will be issue divergence in the political campaign.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on the interaction between the Australian and
   British governments during the early 1970s over French nuclear testing
   in the South Pacific. It examines the considerations behind the
   Australian government's approach to Britain, and Britain's response to
   initiatives from Australia. Through the presentation of a case study
   demonstrating how Australia's Pacific interests and Britain's European
   concerns inevitably led to different perspectives, I argue that the
   policies of both countries were primarily determined by their
   consideration of regional geopolitical interests, rather than the
   lingering links of Empire.},

Abstract = {From French data, this paper uses a difference-in-differences approach
   combined with propensity score matching to identify the effect of older
   workers employment protection on firm's incentives to sponsor training.
   Laying off workers aged 50 and above between 1987 and 2008, French firms
   had to pay a tax to the unemployment insurance system, known as the
   Delalande tax. In 1999, the measure was subjected to a reform that
   increased due taxes but only in large firms. We find that this exogenous
   increase substantially rises firms' incentives to train the 45-49 age
   group of workers, especially low-skilled workers.},

Abstract = {Although citizens are often exposed to conflicting communications from
   political elites, few studies examine the effects of conflicting
   information on the quality of citizens' decisions. Thus, I conduct
   experiments in which subjects are exposed to conflicting information
   before making decisions that affect their future welfare. The results
   suggest that a version of Gresham's Law operates in the context of
   political communication. When a credible source of information suggests
   the welfare-improving choice and a less credible source simultaneously
   suggests a choice that will make subjects worse off, subjects make worse
   decisions than when only the credible source is available. This occurs
   because many subjects base their decisions upon the less credible source
   or forgo participation. This occurs mostly among unsophisticated
   subjects, who are more easily led astray. These findings reveal
   important limits to the effectiveness of credible information sources
   and suggest how political campaigns might strategically use conflicting
   information to their benefit.},

Abstract = {There is a well-established literature analyzing the effects of fiscal
   institutions on fiscal policy variables such as budget deficits or
   accumulated government debt. We combine this literature with the
   emerging field of positive constitutional economics, which deals with
   the economic effects of constitutional rules. The paper addresses three
   questions: (1) Do budget provisions that are explicitly spelled out in a
   country's constitution have any significant effect on fiscal policy? (2)
   Does the transparency, or lack thereof, of the budget process have any
   significant effect on fiscal policy? and (3) Do these two variables have
   an impact on other variables such as government effectiveness and
   productivity? We find that constitutionally entrenched spending limits
   are correlated with lower total government expenditure and that the
   transparency of a nation's budget is correlated with higher government
   effectiveness as well as lower corruption. If anything, the deficit
   limits entrenched in the Maastricht Treaty are correlated with higher,
   rather than lower, overall government expenditure. (C) 2012 Elsevier

   the news media to changes in economic fundamentals. We examine the
   relationship between media reporting and consumer confidence. Methods
   Using data from the University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment
   and a new data set on media coverage constructed by ourselves, we
   estimate time series regressions that explain changes in consumer
   confidence and media coverage of economic news. Results We find evidence
   of asymmetric reactions by consumers to changes in economic
   fundamentals; however, we find no evidence of a systematic negativity
   bias. We also find no evidence of bias in the media. The findings of
   asymmetric reactions are strengthened when we control for expectations.
   Conclusion Asymmetric reactions in consumer confidence depend on the
   nature of the economic fundamental that is changing. Reference points
   are important in determining consumer reaction, but they do not explain
   asymmetric responses.},

Abstract = {This article aims to move beyond media discourse about ``new atheism{''}
   by mapping and explaining anti-religious zeal among the public at large
   in 14 Western European countries. We analyze data from the International
   Social Survey Program, Religion III, 2008, to test two theories about
   how country-level religiousness affects anti-religiosity and its social
   bases: a theory of rationalization and a theory of deprivatization of
   disbelief. Hypotheses derived from the former are contradicted, whereas
   those derived from the latter are largely confirmed. Anti-religiosity is
   strongest among disbelievers and among the higher educated in the most
   religious countries and among the older generations in today's most
   secularized countries.},

Abstract = {The Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) of the US Department of Defense
   conducted a survey of active duty spouses in 2006. In Notes Regarding
   the 2006 Survey of Active Duty Spouses, Willard C. Losinger suggests
   that ``Severe problems existed with the sampling, weight adjustments,
   and estimation (including variance-estimation) procedures.{''} DMDC's
   review of these claims has revealed that Losinger used a preliminary
   data set with incorrect weighting variables to conduct his analyses.
   This data set was not used in any of DMDC's published results.
   Therefore, the article's claims about the quality of DMDC's published
   data and survey methods lack the necessary empirical support to be
   useful in improving the DMDC survey program.},

Abstract = {This article explores the imperial plans and policies advanced by the
   Dutch Nazi Party (NSB) and its leader, Anton Mussert, from the party's
   inception in 1931 to the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies in
   early 1942. Drawing upon recent discussions concerning `generic fascism'
   and the fascist `ideal type', I argue that the Dutch Nazis consistently
   advanced an imperial agenda that was simultaneously defensive and
   expansionist. Before the war, Mussert sought to reunify all members of
   the Dutch `tribe' presently scattered around the globe, even in those
   territories presently held by other imperial powers. Under German
   occupation, Mussert modified but hardly abandoned his Greater
   Netherlands worldview. If Hitler and the German National Socialists
   intended to forge a new European empire founded on the principles of
   racial purity, the Dutch Nazi leader envisioned a fascist world order
   led by Hitler but nonetheless rooted in more traditional imperial
   practices. Mussert's imperial designs reveal both the powerful tensions
   inherent in Dutch National Socialism and the vexed wartime relationship
   between Mussert and the nation's German occupiers.},

Journal = {SOCIAL MOVEMENT STUDIES},

Volume = {12},

Pages = {335-341},
Abstract = {Years of NGO campaigning resulted in the withdrawal of consent for the
   Via Baltica road to be routed through Bialystok, north-east Poland. In
   light of the current revision of the Trans-European Transport Network
   and ongoing environmental campaigns against infrastructure development
   in Central and Eastern Europe, this profile piece reflects on the Via
   Baltica campaign in Poland. It identifies three factors crucial to its
   success: multi-level collaboration, framing of the campaign and the use
   of both `formal' and `informal' tactics. It argues that in combining
   these elements, NGOs were not only able to ensure success in the case of
   the Via Baltica but also set a precedent for future environmental
   campaigns in the region.},

Journal = {HISTORICAL MATERIALISM-RESEARCH IN CRITICAL MARXIST THEORY},

Volume = {21},
Number = {3},
Pages = {109-116},
Abstract = {Stephen Miller attempts to confute the idea that capitalist accumulation
   characterised the agriculture of the Ile-de-France prior to the
   Revolution. Instead he tries to assimilate the agriculture of the north
   into the Annales model of neo-Malthusian agricultural cycles and
   Chayanovian subsistence economy which is supposedly characteristic of
   the Midi. I argue instead that the notion of a northern capitalist
   agriculture is rooted not only in the extensive modern research of
   Moriceau but in the political-economic writings of Turgot and Marx which
   have been largely ignored. Accumulation in the sense of the growth of
   fixed and variable capital and emerging technological progress
   characterised northern agriculture. The persistence of small producers
   which Miller sees as an index of unchanging stasis might better be
   investigated in terms of the evolution over time of a reservoir of wage
   labour for larger-scale enterprises as pointed out by Kautsky.},

Abstract = {Since the early 1960's, American and British diplomatic services have
   become interested in the problem of who would succeed Franco. The United
   States and Great Britain sought to influence a future regime change,
   which was to be moderate and favorable to their interests in Spain. But
   this required that both countries improve the image that Spanish public
   opinion held about their respective societies. To accomplish that goal,
   several public diplomacy initiatives were launched - the teaching of
   English had a leading role - that were designed to attract specific
   cultural sectors of Spanish society. This article analyzes the outreach
   of English teaching programs implemented by the governments of
   Washington and London, with support from philanthropic foundations and
   other private institutions during the last decades of Franco's Spain.
   The purpose of these programs was to promote the modernization of
   Spanish socio-economic and educational structures; and, consequently, to
   foster a climate of cultural affinity with the middle classes and
   Spanish elites in the face of an eventual replacement of the Franco
   dictatorship for a democratic regime.},

Series = {Advances in Human and Social Aspects of Technology},

Abstract = {This chapter focuses on the mediation of cultural pluralism by the South
   African Broadcasting Corporation's three ethnic minority radio stations:
   Munghana Lonene FM, Phalaphala FM, and X-K FM. 1 By discussing these
   radio stations as case studies focus will be on their contribution to
   democratic ideation, and as forms of political disjunctures and
   continuities in radio broadcasting policy. On disjunctures, the chapter
   provides a microscopic perspective of the disengagement with the
   apartheid period as part of a throwback and as a way of charting a new
   path for a democratic South Africa. Its aim is to show the structural
   arrangements created and enacted into law by apartheid that had to be
   repealed and discontinued after 1994. During apartheid, radio
   broadcasting had been organised along ethnic lines, beginning with two
   broadcasting schedules in 1937; one for English speakers, known as
   service A; and service B for Afrikaans speakers. The 1960s in the South
   African broadcasting landscape marked the establishment of `Bantu radio
   stations', which broadcasted mainly in indigenous ethnic languages. This
   stencil encouraged the creation of more ethnic focused radio stations in
   the `80s, which were later embraced by the post-apartheid leaders as a
   way of engendering cultural pluralism aimed at fostering democratic
   ideation and social transformation.},

Abstract = {The article deals with employee motivation and retention in the
   financial sector. The first part defines the terms motivation and
   retention and introduces the related theories - from the very beginning,
   through the classical theories and the contemporary modern theories. The
   article's author utilizes own extensive research among respondents
   coming from employees in the financial sector, supplemented by the round
   table method. The author analyzes the research results and deals with
   the role of wages in employee motivation - whether and when wage
   functions as a motivator leading to higher employee performance
   according to the Herzberg's two factor theory (an intrinsic needs
   motivator, i.e. satisfier) and when it is a factor, if positive, without
   influence on employee activity while if negative or absent, it causes
   employee dissatisfaction (a hygiene factor known as dissatisfier in the
   same theory). There are recommendations for organizational best
   practices shown at the end of the article.},

   European Parliamentary Elections in Germany in 2009},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY \& POLITICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {10},
Number = {3},
Pages = {310-325},
Abstract = {Content analyses have shown that German political parties make use of
   party Web sites in different ways, leading to unequal levels of
   mobilizing, informing, interacting, and participating features. This
   article examines whether or not the use of party Web sites has an impact
   on voting by using individual-level data from a representative survey of
   Germany in the European parliamentary elections of 2009. Although voting
   behavior was primarily influenced by well-known factors such as party
   identification and issue competence, evidence suggests that the use of
   party Web sites could have positive effects on voting for the Greens and
   the Social Democrats.},

Abstract = {Economic growth of the Czech Republic measured by GDP reached 3,4\% per
   annum in the decade 2001-2010 and was substantially faster than average
   annual growth of the European Union. Strong acceleration in the years
   2005-2007 was followed by stagnation in the years 2008-2012 caused by
   strong decline of GDP in the year 2009 and milder recession in the year
   2012. The modest recovery in the years 2010 and 2011 was pulled namely
   by foreign trade, while final consumption and gross fixed capital
   formation stagnated. Alternative indicator of national income was
   negatively influenced by growing outflow of primary incomes. Real gross
   domestic income indicates different results in comparison with gross
   domestic product because of changes in the terms of trade. Macroeconomic
   stability improved substantially in the field of foreign trade while
   general government deficit contributed to its deterioration.},

Abstract = {We test for the influence of absolute and relative deprivation - proxied
   by anthropometric methods on civil war risk. A comprehensive height data
   set allows us to go back to 1816 for a global sample. We measure
   absolute deprivation using human stature and we use height inequality
   within birth cohorts to measure relative deprivation. We take care that
   selectivity caused by missing values does not bias the results. We find
   that relative economic deprivation within populations (i.e., inequality)
   had a strong and consistent impact on the propensity to start civil
   wars. By contrast, absolute deprivation was significant in most but not
   all specifications. We also attend to potential endogeneity through
   instrumental variables. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {We model purchaser-provider contracts when providers can inflate
   reimbursable activity through manipulation. Providers are audited and
   fined upon detected fraud. We characterise the optimal price and audit
   policy both in the presence and absence of commitment to an audit
   intensity. Under `non-commitment' the audit intensity increases in
   reported activity, allowing the provider to soften it by reducing
   activity together with the underlying service quality and manipulation.
   The purchaser then faces a trade-off between offsetting this tendency by
   raising price and committing to a low audit intensity by reducing price.
   We identify circumstances under which the two forces balance out. (C)

Abstract = {ObjectiveWe have two goals. First, we investigate both the short- and
   long-term electoral impact of involvement in scandals on reelection
   margins of incumbents in U.S. congressional elections. Second, we
   evaluate the impact of scandals on district-level turnout.
   MethodsWe model the impact of involvement in a political scandal on
   incumbents' electoral margins in the election cycle in which the scandal
   comes to light, as well as in future election cycles. We also model the
   impact of scandal on district-level turnout.
   ResultsInvolvement in a scandal exerts not only an immediate, negative
   effect on incumbents' margins, but one that also lingers beyond the
   initial reelection cycle. Elections involving incumbents embroiled in
   scandals experience a small boost in turnout.
   ConclusionIn tandem, these results implicate the mobilization of
   previous nonvoters intent on throwing the bum out as one mechanism
   through which incumbent vote share is depressed in scandal elections.},

Abstract = {The paper asks whether members of central bank decision-making
   committees should communicate with the public in a collegial manner, by
   conveying the consensus or majority view of the committee, or in an
   individualistic way, by providing the diversity of views among the
   committee members. It finds that more active as well as more consistent
   communication by committee members improves the predictability of
   monetary policy decisions significantly. This effect is sizeable as
   communication dispersion across committee members accounts on average
   for one third to one half of the market's prediction errors of FOMC
   policy decisions. Moreover, more active and more consistent
   communication are found to also reduce the degree of uncertainty about
   the future path of interest rates. These findings suggest that a
   collegial communication which stresses the consensus view on policy
   inclinations can enhance the effectiveness of central bank
   communication.},

Abstract = {Using data for a panel of 62 partly to fully democratic countries in the
   period 1984-2008, we provide evidence that political persistence
   (measured as the longest tenure in office of main political entities) is
   negatively associated with growth, after controlling for country and
   time fixed effects, and that this association is stronger in countries
   with low bureaucratic quality, where the cost of red tape is high. This
   evidence can be rationalized by means of a growth model with quality
   improvements where political connections with politicians can be
   exploited by low-quality producers to mitigate red tape costs, defend
   their monopoly position and prevent entry of higher-quality competitors.
   The model implies a negative relationship between persistence in office
   of politicians and economic growth in high red-tape countries, while no
   association is expected where red tape costs are low. (c) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {This article provides a comparative discourse analysis of the climate
   responsibility narratives of Australian and Norwegian political leaders
   during the period 2007-2012. The analysis focuses on how political
   leaders imagine their country's identity and role in the world and how
   they connect (or disconnect) these identities, roles and interests with
   responsibility for climate change, and with their respective energy
   policies. The analysis shows that the striking differences in mitigation
   ambition and responsibility discourses between Australia and Norway are
   clearly related, but cannot be reduced, to differences in their relative
   dependence on fossil fuel. Rather, differences in national identity and
   international role conception provide a far more illuminating account
   than a simple interest-based explanation. However, Australia and Norway
   are not quite so poles apart on their energy policies, and I briefly
   explore the implications of climate policy hypocrisy.},

Title = {An Examination of the Measurement Adequacy of the NES Scales for the
   Measurement of Racially Relevant Attitudes},
Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {94},
Number = {3},
Pages = {865-879},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Objective. The objective of the research reported in this article is to
   determine if the NES scale for the measurement of equalitarianism is
   adequate for the measurement of attitudes toward equality in the mass
   public. Methods. The analysis begins with the conjecture that the items
   are framed in terms that are too abstract for the typical member of the
   mass public to comprehend. As a result, it is argued, each item will not
   measure the same latent variable, equalitarianism. Rather, item scores
   will be saturated with systematic error in the form of response set,
   with the items falling into separate groups depending on how they are
   framed, rendering scores on the items problematic for use in empirical
   analysis. For contrast, responses to the items constituting the NES
   racial resentment scale are also examined. The items comprising this
   scale are framed in more concrete terms. As a result, it is argued that
   items comprising the racial resentment scale should display much less
   systematic error in the form of response set when used in the mass
   public. Using NES data from a national sample drawn in 2008, responses
   to the items comprising the equalitarian and racial resentment scales
   were analyzed via differences of means, correlations, and LISREL
   (C)onfirmatory (F) actor (A)nalyses. Results. The results for the
   equalitarianism scale do not support the conclusion that each item is
   measuring the same latent variable. Rather, the results are consistent
   with the argument that response set is the dominant factor in shaping
   responses. The results for the racial resentment scale support the
   conclusion that each item is measuring what it is designed to measure
   and response set is playing a relatively minor role in shaping
   responses. An additional confirmatory factor analysis of scores on the
   equalitarian scale was done using only highly educated respondents. This
   segment of the population can be expected to deal relatively easily with
   items framed in abstract terms. The CFA for this group of respondents
   yielded results that bear out this expectation and are interpreted as
   buttressing the principal argument of the article that the items
   constituting the scale are not suitable for use in the mass public
   because they are couched in terms too abstract for the typical member of
   the mass public to comprehend. Conclusion. The article concludes with
   the suggestion that it would be useful to develop a new scale for the
   measurement of equalitarian attitudes in the mass public, along with
   some suggestions regarding the nature of such an instrument.},

Abstract = {Recent evidence supports the important political role that political
   network size and distribution plays at both the individual and system
   levels. However, we argue that the evidence is likely stronger than the
   current literature suggests due to network size measurement limitations
   in the extant literature. The most common approach to measuring
   political network size in sample surveysthe name generator
   approachnormally constrains network size measurement to three to six
   individuals. Because of this constraint, research often undercounts
   individual network size and also leads to a misrepresentation of the
   distribution of the underlying variable. Using multiple data sets and
   alternative measurement approaches, we reveal that political network
   hubsindividuals with inordinately large network sizes not captured by
   name generatorsexist and can be identified with a simple summary network
   measure. We also demonstrate that the summary network size measure
   reveals the expected differences in communicative, personality, and
   political variables across network size better than name generator
   measures. This suggests that not only has prior research failed to
   identify network hubs, but it has likely underestimated the influence of
   political network size at the individual level.},

Abstract = {The ambivalence of borders, as both bridges and barriers, is analysed in
   the South American borderlands, in the cross-border region between
   Bolivia, Peru and Brazil. The main hypothesis behind this work is that
   borders not only refer to the state but they are also a result of a
   social construction. Through their practices and narratives, the actors
   involved shape the border configuration. Through a multi-scalar approach
   (from a continental to a local level) and by collating practices and
   representations of various social agents (from continental organisations
   to the complexity of social groups on the border), I show that different
   territorial complexes converge on the border and I explain the spatial
   dialectic of the latter. Two ideas emerge as a conclusion to this study:
   the co-existence of territorialities that are not so exclusive and the
   key role played by the state despite the changes it undergoes.},

Abstract = {In this paper we present a research about the journal Los Cuadernos de
   la Gaya Ciencia, published in Spain between 1975 and 1976. Our approach
   uses a sociophilosophical methodology (Pierre Bourdieu, Randall Collins)
   in order to explore the historical context where this journal was born.
   Secondly, we place Los Cuadernos in the field of the Spanish
   philosophical journals in order to understand his singularity. At the
   same time, we make some remarks about the social origin of the journal's
   contributors. Finally we focus in the contents, taking account of the
   main arguments, philosophical figures and intellectual trends invoked in
   the journal's articles. In this way, we point specifically to the
   political subtext suggested by the journal essays},

Abstract = {How did post-communist transformations affect people's perceptions of
   their economic and political systems? We model a pseudo-panel with 89
   country-year clusters, based on the aggregation of about eighty thousand
   interviews conducted in 14 countries between 1991 and 2004, to identify
   the macro and institutional drivers of the public opinion. We find that:
   (i) When the economy is growing, on average people appreciate more
   extensive reforms and dislike unbalanced reforms. They dislike reforms
   when they are associated with higher unemployment. (ii) Nostalgia for
   the past regime increases when worsening income distribution or higher
   inflation interact with more privatizations of state enteprises. (iii)
   Cross-country differences in the attitudes towards the present and
   future are largely explained by differences in the institutional
   indicators for the rule of law and corruption. (iv) Cross-country
   differences in the extent of nostalgia towards the past are related to
   differences in the deterioration of standards of living. (C) 2013

Abstract = {Digital technologies keep track of everything we do and say while we are
   online, and we spend online an increasing portion of our time. Databases
   hidden behind web services and applications are constantly fed with
   information of our movements and communication patterns, and a
   significant dimension of our lives, quantified to unprecedented levels,
   gets stored in those vast online repositories. This article considers
   some of the implications of this torrent of data for social science
   research, and for the types of questions we can ask of the world we
   inhabit. The goal of the article is twofold: to explain why, in spite of
   all the data, theory still matters to build credible stories of what the
   data reveal; and to show how this allows social scientists to revisit
   old questions at the intersection of new technologies and disciplinary
   approaches. The article also considers how Big Data research can
   transform policymaking, with a focus on how it can help us improve
   communication and governance in policy-relevant domains.},

   intergovernmental fiscal transfers and associated vote changes in

   increases in transfers by the central government to municipalities

Abstract = {This article deals with the effects that employment protection may have
   on the level of domestic activity in a context of oligopolistic
   international competition. Firms compete in quantities and their
   location choices result from a trade-off between on the one hand, the
   informational advantage due to the output flexibility afforded by the
   location in the country with the weakest employment protection
   legislation (EPL), and on the other hand, the strategic advantage of the
   quantity commitment which credibility is ensured by the location in the
   country with the strictest EPL. Although the analytical framework is
   very favorable to the flexibility - which is costless -, the country
   with the strictest EPL may nevertheless attract firms even for
   relatively high levels of demand uncertainty. Moreover, when a
   dispersion equilibrium emerges, the level of activity (and hence the
   level of employment) is higher - on average - in the country with the
   strictest EPL. Finally, contrary to what might be expected, if firms
   competed in prices instead of in quantities, they never would
   agglomerate in the country with the weakest EPL.},

Abstract = {What are the main causes of international terrorism? Despite the
   meticulous examination of various candidate explanations, existing
   estimates still diverge in sign, size, and significance. This article
   puts forward a novel explanation and supporting evidence. We argue that
   domestic political instability provides the learning environment needed
   to successfully execute international terror attacks. Using a yearly
   panel of 123 countries over 19732003, we find that the occurrence of
   civil wars increases fatalities and the number of international
   terrorist acts by 45\%. These results hold for alternative indicators of
   political instability, estimators, subsamples, subperiods, and
   accounting for competing explanations.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a simple endogenous growth model in which the
   financial sector improves the efficiency of the savings transformation
   into investment. The model suggests that multiple endogenous growth
   paths can exist and the possibility of non-linear relationship between
   financial development and economic growth in the long-run. The empirical
   estimation realized using PSTR (Panel Smooth Threshold Regression)
   models on 71 countries over the period 1960-2006, confirms the
   theoretical threshold effects. Furthermore, our empirical results show
   that the relationship between financial development and growth is
   positive for low level of financial development, but become
   indeterminate in financially developed economies. These results are
   confirmed using the GMM dynamic panel technique.},

Abstract = {This paper takes a political economy approach to fiscal centralisation
   through federation formation. We analyse a two-region model of
   federalism with inter-regional policy spillovers. Departing from a state
   of independence with decentralised provision of public policy, we
   analyse the proposed formation of a federation to internalise the
   spillovers. We consider equilibrium allocations under alternative
   institutional environments involving: simple majority voting, a
   restriction of uniform taxation, and regional bargaining through a
   bicameral legislature. Bicameralism facilitates federation formation for
   the largest set of parameter values of the model, which is consistent
   with the observation that bicameralism and federalism often appear
   together.},

Abstract = {The democratic transition in Egypt post 25th of January Revolution
   reveals a correlation between popular perceptions of election fairness
   and views of local election monitors regarding election procedures. The
   changes in popular perceptions of the political environment in which the
   democratic transition is taking place seems to cast a shadow over the
   perception of election fairness. A relationship which in turn reveals
   the unresolved dilemma in the region between both the philosophy of
   democracy and the mechanisms of democracy; a factor that would be
   determinant to the democratic transition in the region as manifested in
   the example of Egypt. Different levels of election fairness were
   perceived despite similar Election Day procedural violations in both
   pre- and post-Arab Spring Egypt.},

Title = {Cross-Border Consumption of Informal and Underground Goods: A Case Study
   of Alternative Consumerism in South Texas},

Abstract = {Objective To explore the determinants of informal consumption of
   cross-border goods from the South Texas-Mexico border. Twelve select
   informal and underground goods are examined. Methods Derived from
   extensive interviews, a unique (and purposive) data set of 357 consumers
   from the South Texas borderlands was collected in the summer of 2010.
   Results Nearly two-thirds (64.6 percent) of borderlands consumers have
   engaged in, at one time or another, the purchase and consumption of
   cross-border informal goods. The rate is 44.1 percent for the
   consumption of cross-border underground goods. An important determinant
   in the cross-border consumption of informal goods is one's self-reported
   morals for buying off the books. This relationship is inversely bound.
   Immigration status, Spanish-language ability, education, civil status,
   and residence location all inform participation in the consumption of
   informal cross-border goods. Conclusion The South Texas-Mexico border
   clearly acts as a lever for the cross-border consumption of informal and
   underground goods.},

Journal = {POLITICS AND RELIGION},

Abstract = {American Buddhism is a phenomenon that allows for the testing of a
   number of generally-held assumptions about how religion operates within
   the American context. Due to the fairly de-politicized character of the
   religion in the United States, Buddhism allows for the examination of
   religion-quareligion insofar as its role in the political mobilization
   of believers. This study finds that Buddhist political engagement is
   driven in general by private religious practice rather than by communal
   or small-group religious participation, as social capital-oriented
   theories of religio-political engagement suggest. Furthermore, this
   appears likely to be due to the nature of Buddhist adherents in the
   United States (who are predominantly Caucasian converts to the faith and
   who enjoy a generally high socio-economic status.) Closer examination of
   the situation of Buddhists in the United States suggests that the
   resource-model of civic skill acquisition does hold among the most
   economically disadvantaged, but that other explanations help us better
   understand political engagement among more advantaged Buddhists.},

Abstract = {After the 2005 Declaration of Principles for International Election
   Observation, another key milestone in election observation history was
   marked in 2012 with the signing of the ``Declaration of Global
   Principles for Non-Partisan Election Observation and Monitoring by
   Citizen Organizations.'' This Declaration highlights an irreversible
   shift toward a process-oriented approach by citizen groups in their
   assessments and their desire to be accountable - and be perceived as
   such - to a highly ethical and forceful set of principles. In the past,
   this ability has not always been recognized to them by the democracy
   assistance community. The reached awareness of the potential enshrined
   in citizen observation is further underlined by the usage of new digital
   tools, particularly crowd-sourcing techniques. This trend will open up a
   whole field of new possibilities, provided that citizen observers
   continue to maintain central to their assessments the international
   obligations for democratic elections.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY \& POLITICS},

Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {369-388},
Abstract = {The article focuses on online content regulation in France and Germany.
   We examine institutional characteristics and actor constellations that
   led to different policy choices and situate these in the broader
   discussion on Internet content regulation. While in the early 1990s
   courts were settling disputes regarding problematic content by applying
   existing regulation to the digital realm, both countries have since
   chosen separate regulatory paths. France opted for legislative control,
   while Germany developed a system of ``regulated self-regulation,{''} in
   which private actors self-regulate with limited state supervision. Both
   cases provide insights into the possibilities and limits of state
   intervention on the Internet.},

Abstract = {Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) that measure the concentration of the
   industry belongs to well-known special indices. The paper is devoted to
   the sensitivity of the HHI values, which allows simulations of changes
   in concentration of the relevant market in case of new entry into the
   market. Let assume model situation in which a new entity has entered the
   industry with a relevant market share while keeping the total production
   of the industry unchanged and the production of subjects operating on
   the market is proportionately reduced. Based on this assumption, it is
   possible to derive relations that allow to set the boundaries in which
   the characteristic of the sector remains the same (levels
   unconcentrated, moderately concentrated, concentrated on the base of
   methodology of European Commission). Derived relations of the HHI
   sensitivity can be successfully used as a tool in assessing the entry of
   a new subject in any industry. It may be difficult to use analysis based
   on the methodology of the European Commission in case of smaller
   economies with a smaller number of subjects. Therefore we proposed our
   approach of setting of the border ranges to characterize the
   concentration of the industry. Also, empirical analysis of the Slovak
   banking sector, in which currently operate 14 banks, was conducted on
   the basis of the methodology of the European Commission.},
