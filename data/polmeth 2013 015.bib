Abstract = {In this article, the intricate relationship between the logic of damage
   as an act of political communication and its mediation is addressed. The
   mediation of protest by mainstream media is often deemed to be
   one-sided, biased in favor of the establishment and predominantly
   antiprotest, focusing on the spectacular crowding out real debate on the
   issues. A content analysis of the 2010 U.K. student protests as reported
   by four U.K. newspapers found this to be only partially true. The use of
   symbolic damage tactics by the protesters did not squeeze out attention
   for the issues, rather it increased media attention and coverage
   considerably. Militant voices were more quoted and given more space in
   articles than moderate voices. In all newspapers there was a degree of
   understanding for the anger of the students, but the use of symbolic
   damage tactics did produce much negative exposure. The use of symbolic
   damage tactics not only relates to a mainstream media opportunity
   structure, creating spectacle and drama, but also potentially produces
   division, negative representation, and delegitimization. Finally, the
   use of insurrectionary symbolic damage is a reminder of the failings of
   representative democracy in how it deals with political conflicts.},

Abstract = {Scholarship at the development-security nexus has called for greater
   attention to space to better understand grounded encounters with
   security and insecurity. Through an examination of embodied engagements
   with space, this paper details the way migrant women in Southeast Turkey
   experience security and insecurity in their day-to-day lives in regards
   to gendered violence. Against the backdrop of state investment in
   gendered development as a mechanism of conflict mitigation, the reach
   and mobility of women in and across new spaces in the city has grown. At
   the juncture between these spaces - the classroom, courtroom, and home -
   lie conflicting narratives about nation, community, and family that pose
   implications for the physical well-being of women. To this end,
   interviews with migrant women and development administrators and
   teachers suggest that (human) security be understood as embodied and
   relational, experienced differentially across time and space.},

Abstract = {This article explores two features of cultural life in France during the
   era of the Popular Front, with a special focus on the Paris world's fair
   of 1937 - mass gymnastics and large stadium projects designed to host
   both sporting and political spectacles. These developments are
   considered in the light of both transnational exchange, and the
   widespread unease expressed in interwar France towards spectator sport
   on the one hand and totalitarian' political mobilization on the other
   hand. It is argued that a double attitude' towards spectacle emerged,
   where disdain for commercial spectator sport sat alongside an often
   grudging admiration for large-scale political spectacle. The article
   examines the reception in France both of the Bohemian Sokol physical
   culture movement and the Berlin Olympic Games of 1936, showing how
   French commentators across the political spectrum negotiated their sense
   of the value of spectacles - normally by reclaiming them for
   identifiably French' democratic traditions and by blurring the
   distinction between spectatorship and participation. In doing so, the
   article takes issue with the reductionist nature of the notion of a
   fascist aesthetic', stressing that the wide purchase of both mass
   gymnastics and monumental neo-classical stadium design suggests that the
   political meaning of such things lies in their use and not their form.},

Title = {Delegating decision rights for anticipated rewards as an alternative to
   corruption: An experiment},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {31},
Pages = {188-204},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {We study experimentally whether anti-corruption policies with a focus on
   bribery might be insufficient to uncover more subtle ways of gaining an
   unfair advantage. In particular, we investigate whether an implicit
   agreement to exchange favors between a decision-maker and a lobbying
   party serves as a legal substitute for corruption. We find that even the
   pure anticipation of future rewards from a lobbying party suffices to
   bias a decision-maker in favor of this party, even though it creates
   negative externalities to others. Although future rewards are not
   contractible, the benefitting party voluntarily compensates
   decision-makers for partisan choices. In this way, both earn more at the
   expense of others. Thus, the outcome mirrors what might have been
   achieved via conventional bribing, while not being illegal. (c) 2013

Volume = {18},

Abstract = {I introduce geographical specificity to world-systems concepts of core
   and periphery to develop a structuralist approach on semiperipheral
   development in the world-economy. I apply this approach to the
   historical trajectory of economic growth in Russia and east-central
   Europe since 1900. I find circumstantial support for Wallerstein's
   classic assertion that mercantilist semi-withdrawal is a potentially
   effective development strategy for semiperipheral countries and show
   that Russia raised its economic output above historical trend levels
   during the Soviet period. In contrast, east-central Europe fell short of
   historical trends during the Soviet period, suggesting that Russia's
   gains may have been made at the expense of its satellite empire. With
   the end of communism, both Russia and the countries of east-central
   Europe quickly returned to their long-term historical output levels
   relative to the core countries of western Europe.},

Abstract = {The Treaty of Boundaries between Spain and Portugal, signed in Lisbon in
   1864, is paradigmatic of the modern treaties of inter-state borders. In
   this article it is studied first the works of the Mixed Commission of
   Boundaries created to this object, and its relation with the population
   of the ``line{''} (raya) -local name for the adjacent zone to the
   border-, then we analyze the diplomatic negotiations and the final text
   of the Treaty. The identity discourses on which the demarcation of
   border is based are specified in order to show its relation with the
   processes of national identification. It is necessary to differentiate
   three levels in these discourses: the ``palace{''} discourse of the
   central authorities and diplomats, the technical and progressive
   discourse of the military engineers and topographers of the Commission,
   and, finally, the local people discourse.},

Abstract = {Do terror attacks have an impact on public opinion, even if the terror
   attacks happen far away? We exploit the fact that the fourth round of
   the European Social Survey was conducted in several West European
   countries at the time of the 2008 terror attacks in Mumbai, India, in
   order to identify the causal effect of the Mumbai attacks on public
   opinion. We identify a clear jump in fear of terrorism at home as a
   consequence of the terror attacks, but despite the increase in fear of
   terrorism, we find no significant effect of the attack on support for
   illiberal interrogation techniques or for liberal immigration policies.
   We do find indications of a shift in conservative direction on the
   left-right scale, but this shift is not significant in all time windows.
   Our findings suggest that a terror attack needs to have a very large
   impact on the fear of terrorism before people change their policy
   preferences.},

Title = {How to get the snowball rolling and extend the franchise: voting on the
   Great Reform Act of 1832},
Journal = {PUBLIC CHOICE},

Abstract = {This paper suggests a new approach to analyzing the causes of franchise
   extension. Based on a new dataset, it provides a detailed econometric
   study of the Great Reform Act of 1832 in the United Kingdom. The
   analysis yields four main results. First, modernization theory receives
   limited support. Second, the reform enjoyed some measure of popular
   support. Third, the threat of revolution had an asymmetric impact on the
   voting behavior of the pro-reform Whigs and the anti-reform Tories.
   While the threat might have convinced reluctant reformers among the Whig
   politicians-and among their patrons-to support the bill, it seems to
   have hardened the resistance to reform among the Tories. Fourth,
   ideology played a critical role. Nevertheless, it also appears that
   self-interest and political expedience explained the votes of many
   Members of Parliament.},

Abstract = {This paper studies the political economy of fertility. Specifically, I
   argue that fertility may be a strategic choice for ethnic groups engaged
   in redistributive conflict. I first present a simple conflict model
   where high fertility is optimal for each ethnic group if and only if the
   economy's ethnic diversity is high, institutions are weak, or both. I
   then test the model in a cross-national dataset. Consistent with the
   theory, I find that economies where the product of ethnic diversity and
   a measure of institutional weakness is high have increased fertility
   rates. I conclude that fertility may depend on political factors.},

Abstract = {Several recent spatial modeling studies incorporate valence issues-e.g.,
   voters' evaluations of the candidates' competence, integrity, and
   charisma-that may give one of the candidates an electoral advantage that
   is independent of his policy positions. However to date all such models
   assume that while voters value positive valence characteristics, the
   candidates themselves do not. We develop a spatial model where the
   candidates are valence-seeking, i.e.-like the voters-the candidates
   prefer that the winning candidate possess qualities, such as integrity,
   diligence, and competence, that will enhance his job performance. We
   analyze a spatial model where the candidates value both the valence
   qualities and the policies of the winning candidate, and we show that
   the candidates' optimal policy choices typically diverge as the valence
   differential between them increases, and in particular that the
   valence-disadvantaged candidate normally has incentives to become more
   extreme as the valence advantage of her opponent increases.},

Abstract = {Whether a country is able effectively to address collective action
   problems is a critical test of its ability to fulfill the demands of its
   citizens to their satisfaction. We study one particularly important
   collective action problem: the environment. Using a large panel dataset
   covering 25 years for some countries, we find that, overall, citizens of
   European countries are more satisfied with the way democracy works in
   their country if (a) more environmental policies are in place and if (b)
   expenditures on the environment are higher, but environmental taxes are
   lower. The relation between environmental policy and life satisfaction
   is not as pronounced. The evidence for the effect of environmental
   quality on both satisfaction with democracy and life satisfaction is not
   very clear, although we find evidence that citizens value personal
   mobility (in terms of having a car) highly, but view the presence of
   trucks as unpleasant. We also document that parents, younger citizens,
   and those with high levels of educational attainment tend to care more
   about environmental issues than do non-parents, older citizens, and
   those with fewer years of schooling.},

Abstract = {There is no consensus on the properties of voting power indices when
   there is a large number of voters in a weighted-voting body. On the one
   hand, in some real-world cases that have been studied the power indices
   have been found to be nearly proportional to the weights (e.g., the
   EUCM, US Electoral College); this is true for both the Penrose-Banzhaf
   and the Shapley-Shubik indices. It has been suggested that this is a
   manifestation of a conjecture by Penrose (known subsequently as the
   Penrose limit theorem, that has been shown to hold under certain
   conditions). On the other hand, we have the older literature from
   cooperative game theory, due to Shapley and his collaborators, showing
   that, where there is a finite number of voters whose weights remain
   constant in relative terms, and where the quota remains constant in
   relative terms, while the total number of voters increases without
   limit, the powers of the voters with finite weight tend to limiting
   values that are, in general, not proportional to the weights. These
   results, too, are supported by empirical studies of large voting bodies
   (e.g., the IMF/WB boards, corporate shareholder meetings). This paper
   proposes a restatement of the Penrose limit theorem and shows that, in
   general, both the `classical' power indices converge in the limit to
   proportionality with weights as the Laakso-Taagepera index of political
   fragmentation increases. This new version reconciles the different
   theoretical and empirical results that have been found for large voting
   bodies.},

Abstract = {This article is an exploratory study of the factors influencing the
   management of diversity at the unit level. This management is carried
   out through ongoing negotiations between troops and commanders and is
   heavily influenced by the character of the unit within which bargaining
   takes place and involves the active role of both sides. The most
   important factors are the unit's structural characteristic (dominant
   military roles or social composition) and ethos of action (a combat or
   service orientation). Diversity is thus simultaneously managed as formal
   policy (intentionally organized) and is self-organized as phenomena
   emerging at the local level through agreements between the military and
   individuals and groups serving within it. The analysis is based on
   qualitative research carried out within the Israel Defense Forces within
   combat, white-collar, and service units.},

Abstract = {The article analyses how nineteenth-century Spanish Democrats understood
   democracy, what were the issues at stake, how they were debated, and how
   political and social discourses evolved. It focuses on Democrats'
   conceptions of citizenship, freedom, equality, sovereignty, political
   activity and the nation, as well as on their ideas on the most
   convenient form of government and organization of the State. It traces
   the process through which their original idea of democracy as an active
   and immediate exercise of power evolved into another centred on the
   control and limitation of power and the promotion of individual
   autonomy. It finally points out their holistic vision of society and
   their difficulty accepting a plurality of interests and parties, which
   had considerable influence on their political practice and their
   attempts at self-organization.},

Title = {The Struggle for La Sierra: Sovereignty, property, and rights in
   the San Luis Valley},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {33},
Pages = {11-20},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In 2002 the Colorado Supreme Court reversed decades of precedent in
   Lobato v. Taylor by awarding Hispano heirs to the Mexican-era Sangre de
   Cristo Land Grant renewed access rights to that grant's former communal
   land for grazing, timber, and firewood. Placing Lobato in historical
   context, this paper examines the contingent emergence of sovereignty and
   private property in the San Luis Valley of Southern Colorado through
   acts of violence, land loss, and dispossession. The paper argues that
   sovereignty and property, as forms of boundary drawing, are unfinished
   and contested projects rather than abstract, achieved universals. U.S.
   sovereignty in the San Luis Valley has emerged contingently through the
   iteration of private property, as struggles over resource access have
   produced sovereign effects. Such a perspective makes visible how Lobato
   has reiterated private property rights and U.S. sovereignty in ways that
   create new exclusions, even as the case returns access rights to the
   commons. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The goal of this study is to explore different facets of exposure to
   television news-from the regularity of exposure via viewing durations to
   deliberate news selection and avoidance behavior. Using Dutch
   people-meter data on the individual viewer level, nine different
   exposure measures are compared. Our results suggest that exposure to
   news entails a three-dimensional construct consisting of the amount of
   watching the news, modes of program selection, and the share of viewing
   news. In addition, the ability of different aspects of news exposure to
   be predicted by relevant viewer characteristics is assessed. The amount
   of exposure is most strongly and most consistently related to those
   characteristics. Implications for public opinion research are discussed.},

Abstract = {We investigate a phenomenon which we have experienced as common when
   dealing with an assortment of Italian public and private institutions:
   people promise to exchange high-quality goods and services, but then
   something goes wrong and the quality delivered is lower than had been
   promised. While this is perceived as `cheating' by outsiders, insiders
   seem not only to adapt to, but to rely on this outcome. They do not
   resent low-quality exchanges; in fact, they seem to resent high-quality
   ones, and are inclined to put pressure on or avoid dealing with agents
   who deliver high quality. The equilibrium among low-quality producers
   relies on an unusual preference ranking which differs from that
   associated with the Prisoners' Dilemma and similar games, whereby
   self-interested rational agents prefer to dish out low quality in
   exchange for high quality. While equally `lazy', agents in our
   low-quality worlds are oddly `pro-social': for the advantage of
   maximizing their raw self-interest, they prefer to receive low-quality
   goods and services, provided that they too can in exchange deliver low
   quality without embarrassment. They develop a set of oblique social
   norms to sustain their preferred equilibrium when threatened by the
   intrusion of high quality. We argue that high-quality collective
   outcomes are endangered not only by self-interested individual
   defectors, but by `cartels' of mutually satisfied mediocrities.},

Abstract = {This article offers a critical survey of the recent contributions on the
   ``tariff-growth paradox{''} (also known as ``Bairoch paradox{''}). The
   publication in 2000 of an important article by K. O'Rourke has sparked a
   lively debate on the linkages between trade policy and economic growth
   during the ``first globalization{''} (1870 to 1914). The question was
   explored using new econometric techniques, often with references to
   recent inroads in the theoretical foundations for economic growth. The
   consensus view among various scholars tends to confirm a positive
   correlation between tariffs and growth for the most advanced European
   countries as well as overseas European Offshoots (Canada, Australia,
   Argentina...) - but not necessarily for periphery countries. Two factors
   seem to have played an important role: the quality of institutions of
   countries embracing protection and their legislators' ability to
   handpick the protected industries (those with extensive externalities).
   But the hypothesis of an efficient sectoral protectionism cannot be
   validated by the observation of effective protection rates, an approach
   which remains at the present stage, very fragmented, limited to a
   handful of sectors, for selected benchmarks and which does not take into
   account the dispersion of tariff rates by country of origin for
   identical goods.},

Pages = {119-137},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The literature on congressional committees has largely overlooked the
   impact of jurisdictional fights on policy proposals and outcomes. This
   paper develops a theory of how legislators balance the benefits of
   expanded committee jurisdiction against preferred policy outcomes. It
   shows why (a) senior members, and junior members in safe seats, are most
   likely to challenge a committee's jurisdiction; (b) policy proposals may
   be initiated off the proposer's ideal point for jurisdictional gains;
   (c) policy outcomes will generally be more moderate with jurisdictional
   fights than without these turf wars. We empirically investigate these
   results examining proposed Internet intellectual property protection
   legislation in the 106th Congress.},

Title = {Open Governance and E-Rulemaking: Online Deliberation and Policy-Making
   in Contemporary Greek Politics},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY \& POLITICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Pages = {104-124},
Abstract = {The Internet and its innovative communicative codes stand at the center
   of a discussion regarding a new, more participatory, direct, and
   ``strong{''} democracy. The widespread use of the Internet and its
   applications has profound implications on several facets of political
   life, such as the procedure of rulemaking. In modern, ``large-scale{''}
   democracies, the complexity and plurality of political interests seem to
   be under-represented in official parliamentary procedures. The model of
   open governance enables citizens to contribute toward how decisions are
   taken and accordingly democratize rulemaking. At the same time, it
   increases citizens' ability to exercise control over the elected
   political representatives.
   One recent implementation of the idea of an open (e-) government in
   Greece is the Web site http://www.opengov.gr that was launched by the
   newly elected government of the Socialist party (PASOK) in October 2009.
   In this Web site, draft laws per ministry are uploaded, and citizens can
   upload their comments on every article, expressing their opinion or
   their disagreement. This online deliberative procedure provides a forum
   for constructive civic engagement on rulemaking and, moreover, given
   that the comments are incorporated into the final legal document, gives
   citizens the chance to affect policy-making to a certain degree. The Web
   site also provides the opportunity to watch videos of cabinet councils
   as a fulfillment of transparency in political procedures.
   This article examines how the premise of open governance is being
   implemented by the e-rulemaking process on the specific Web site, and
   assesses its impact on legislation and policy-making issues.},

Abstract = {Treating the five years before the outbreak of World War II, this
   chapter considers Pound's turn toward writing gratis propaganda on
   behalf of Fascist Italy and the British Union of Fascists. Textual
   discussion of 65 texts written between winter 1935-36 and spring 1940 is
   also treated with an eye to the synergy between Pound's propaganda and
   ideological points raised by European fascist movements, ranging from
   the invasion of Abyssinia to the increased endorsement of anti-Semitism
   in the later 1930s. Pound's propaganda writings for the BUF (Action,
   British Union Quarterly) and Fascist Italy (the British-Italian
   Bulletin), respectively, are further contextualized through his
   extensive correspondence with leading figures in both movements.},

Abstract = {The vote share of the 2010 UK general election is forecasted here by
   applying twice the concept behind Galton's predictive ``wisdom of the

   Twitter Sentiment, YouTube, Google) the political opinion of the
   audience and second, by averaging at the media level each prediction.
   The auto regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model performs
   predictions for the Labour Party, Liberal-Democrats, and Conservatives
   that are respectively only 0.48, 0.83, and 0.19 percentage points off
   the real vote share, thus well exceeding the predictive power of more
   traditional and expensive polls.},

Abstract = {Although deliberative democratic theory values the principle of
   publicity, few empirical studies systematically assess the public
   communication of civic groups that deliberate over policy. The
   proliferation of such groups in contemporary politics, and of
   uncertainty about their legitimacy, suggests the need for such study.
   Drawing on contemporary deliberative theory, we derive a set of
   legitimate publicity indicators for assessing how well groups report
   their deliberative processes and policy conclusions. We demonstrate the
   reliability and utility of these measures in a comparative content
   analysis of the final reports of three common kinds of deliberative
   bodies: a government-stakeholder task force, an activist strategy group,
   and a citizen consensus conference. We conclude by suggesting an agenda
   for further research on the perceived legitimacy of publicity about
   deliberative processes, outcomes, and impacts on the policy process.},

Abstract = {In 1854-55, France belonged to a coalition fighting the tsarist Russia
   in Crimea and actively participated in the conflict which ended with the
   victory of the allies and the fall of Sevastopol. Even if Spain did not
   really entered the conflict, a few members of its armed forces went
   there, either because they had asked for (and got) a leave or because
   they had been designated to be part of an observation commission
   financed by the government, as happened for example to General Prim. In
   this context, the Crimean war apparently worked as a sort of experiment
   for the different strategies, in politics as well as in texts, which the
   different participants in the Spanish-Moroccan war used five years
   later. Among them, General Prim who did his best to be in the limelight
   in the African war and get a very personal benefit from his command. The
   numerous links that can be found between both wars are echoed in the
   patriotic theatre aimed at glorifying them, making the Crimean and the
   African wars much closer conflicts and scenes than could have been
   thought first.},

Abstract = {Deliberative democracy by the people themselves is a distinctive form of
   democratic practice. It can be distinguished from deliberative democracy
   practiced by elites or representatives as well as from other forms of
   democracy that do not emphasize deliberation. In this article I explore
   ways this kind of democracy can be realized and then inserted into our
   current democratic institutions. The idea is to explore possible entry
   points in our political system for deliberative democratic designs
   involving ordinary citizens. In doing so I draw on recent experiments
   with Deliberative Polls and other mini- publics. I focus on four entry
   points: a) the evaluation and/or selection of candidates in the
   nomination phase; b) the evaluation and/or formulation of ballot
   propositions; c) public input into policy and legislation; and d) public
   input into processes of constitutional change.},

   Deliberative Democracy},

Volume = {12},

Pages = {468-489},

Abstract = {Deliberative democracy offers a distinctive and appealing conception of
   political life, but is it one that might be called into service to guide
   actual reform of existing American election law? This possibility seems
   remote because American election law and deliberative democracy are
   built around different priorities and theoretical premises. A
   foundational area of disagreement lies in the treatment of majorities.
   Election law is structured, at both the legislative and constitutional
   levels, so as to privilege majorities and systematically to magnify
   their power, whereas deliberative democracy aims at privileging
   minorities (or at least de-privileging majorities). The main purpose of
   the election law now on the books is to narrow electoral choice; it
   seeks at every step to exclude views from public conversation in a
   process of winnowing out those that command the support only of a
   minority. Deliberative democracy's goals and methods, in contrast,
   stress at every turn the inclusion of many voices, especially those of
   minorities and of the socially and politically excluded. Deliberative
   democracy's goal is not to identify a majority entitled to rule, but to
   destabilize and transform that majority by exposing its members to
   opinions and beliefs they do not already hold. Election law resists such
   a process. As a result, any attempt to incorporate principles of
   deliberative democracy into the design of election law faces serious and
   deeply entrenched obstacles.
   On the other hand, deliberative democracy may well have a valuable role
   to play by helping to make the process of public opinion formation
   outside election campaigns fairer, better informed, and more
   deliberative. This is in any case where most of the real action takes
   place: public political opinion is not formed to any significant degree
   during the brief season of elections and their formal campaigns-within,
   that is to say, the small slice of political life that falls within the
   domain of election law proper. On the contrary, public political opinion
   is formed continually, and therefore mainly between elections.
   Consequently, if the process of public political opinion formation falls
   short of deliberative ideals, deliberative democracy can do the most
   good by addressing itself to the arena of quotidian, non-electoral
   politics.},

Abstract = {This study examines the influence of citizens' use of online mass media
   on levels of trust in government, shedding light on the process by which
   citizens' use of online mass media serves to influence their levels of
   trust in government. I hypothesize that citizens' use of online mass
   media influences the relationship between citizens' predispositions
   toward government in general, and their levels of trust in government in
   particular, with perceptions of government performance acting as a
   mediating factor. To test this hypothesis a mediated moderation analysis
   is conducted using data from a sample of 907 Seoul citizens. The results
   suggest that citizens' use of online mass media has a positive indirect
   influence on their levels of trust in government. However, the strength
   of this influence decreases with more frequent use of online mass media.},

   in the numbers of sex partners over the past year.
   MethodsHPI scores were available for 48 nations from the International
   Sexuality Description Project (Schmitt, 2005), and were used to test
   three hypotheses: (1) human polygyny should be associated with increased
   intrasexual competition (e.g., high male-male aggression and resource
   competition), (2) human polygyny should be associated with features of
   natural and intersexual selection (e.g., high pathogen stress and an
   emphasis on physical attractiveness in mate choice), and (3) human
   polygyny should be associated with early and more prolific reproduction.
   ResultsAll three hypotheses received at least partial support.
   ConclusionsDiscussion focuses on the limitations and implications of the
   current findings.},

   BROKERAGE UNDER THE SECRET BALLOT},

Year = {2013},
Volume = {25},

Abstract = {Throughout much of mankind's experience with elections, vote brokers -
   local elites who direct the voting decisions of a subset of the
   electorate - have been able to make or break political careers. In
   various polities, brokers have thrived in spite of the secret ballot, a
   surprising outcome given that vote secrecy would ostensibly allow
   citizens to pocket the inducements offered by such individuals and vote
   their consciences anyway. To address this puzzle, we develop a framework
   for understanding the persistence and demise of vote brokerage under the
   secret ballot. In our model, a broker contracts with voters using an
   outcome contingent contract: some fixed benefit is promised to all
   voters sharing one of several observable profiles should the broker's
   candidate win the election. Using this framework, we demonstrate that
   the existence of brokerage depends on the size of the electorate
   contained within the jurisdiction controlled by the broker, with large
   jurisdiction sizes tending to drive brokerage out of existence.
   Moreover, we detail the manner in which the strategies employed by
   brokers depend on their economic power, the size of social groups, and
   ideological polarization. Empirical evidence from Minas Gerais, Brazil
   is used to evaluate the performance of the model.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC OPINION RESEARCH},

Volume = {25},

Month = {FAL},
Abstract = {The current study uses experimental data (N = 265) to assess the impact
   of exposure to interviews from political comedy and cable news programs
   on information recall and anticipated political expression. The results
   highlight higher recall rates for political comedy as opposed to cable
   news exposure. The study then considers the differential impact of
   exposure to two different types of comedy interviews, comparing how
   viewers evaluate the more straightforward satire of The Daily Show's Jon
   Stewart with the parody-driven presentation of The Colbert Report's
   Stephen Colbert. The study then considers the relationship between
   interview exposure and anticipated political expression. The results
   suggest that viewing political comedy interviews from The Daily Show is
   positively related to anticipated political expression.},

Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {94},
Number = {3},
Pages = {840-864},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Objective. Previous studies demonstrate that campaigns play an important
   role in mobilizing citizen participation in elections. The present
   analysis examines the effects of campaign spending on voter turnout in
   the state legislative setting where our knowledge of campaign effects is
   quite limited. Method. In an examination of state legislative elections
   across 20 states over two election cycles, the analysis considers the
   influence of candidate spending on voter turnout. Results. The findings
   demonstrate that campaign spending has a strong influence on voter
   participation; however, this effect is mitigated by contextual features.
   Legislative professionalism reduces the influence of spending, while the
   presence of a high-stimulus statewide election enhances it. In addition,
   challenger spending is more effective at stimulating participation than
   incumbent spending. Conclusions. Higher levels of campaign spending
   increase voter participation in state legislative elections; however,
   these effects vary according to context. These findings have important
   implications for theories of participation in American democracy as well
   for normative issues concerning the role of money in elections.},

Abstract = {Every person who sends email, text messages, tweets, or simply surfs the
   Web leaves a digital trace. Researchers are just starting to comprehend
   the possibilities of ``big data{''} for creating a new picture of social
   behavior. The potential for innovative work on social and cultural
   topics far outstrips current data collection and analysis techniques for
   a variety of reasons, including researchers' lack of access to corporate
   data sets, technical skills, and analytical lenses. This article draws a
   distinction between ``horizontal{''} trace data sets that aggregate a
   specific type of trace, such as all tweets with a certain hashtag, and
   ``vertical{''} trace data sets, which are organized around research
   participants. Although both types of data are observations of real-world
   digital behavior, they each have distinct advantages and disadvantages
   for the researcher. Combining these two forms of data provides a richer
   picture of online activity, and adding other types of data such as
   interviews, surveys, and experiments can contextualize online activity
   within broader social processes.},

Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},

Volume = {94},
Number = {3},
Pages = {715-731},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Objective. This research addresses the effect of interruptions on task
   groups; interactions and individual group members' feelings about the
   task and the group itself. The interruptions that we consider are not
   generated from within the group, but have their source outside the
   group. Emphasizing the theories of structural ritualization, relational
   cohesion, and productive exchange, we predict that interruptions that
   have positive, negative, or neutral effects on the group all cause
   problems with the resolution of routine. Methods. We design and conduct
   a four-condition experiment to test our predictions. Results. There was
   more stability in group procedures when there was no interruption than
   when there was any kind of interruption. There were no differences in
   efficiency or activities between positive and negative interruptions.
   However, there were more agreements in positive interruption groups than
   in negative interruption groups. Additionally, group members'
   perceptions varied by the type of interruption: those in positively
   interrupted groups reported higher levels of competence and feelings of
   success. Conclusions. We find that interruption, in and of itself,
   creates problems with resumption of group processes. Whether the
   interruption is positive or negative, however, does create interaction
   differences and differences in group members' perceptions and affect
   related to the group and each other.},

Abstract = {Hillel Steiner's left-libertarian theory of justice is the most serious
   recent attempt to reconcile the ideals of (luck-egalitarian) equality
   and freedom. This attempt consists in an argument that a universal right
   to equal freedom, which in Steiner's view means also a universal right
   to maximal freedom, implies a universal right to self-ownership and to
   an egalitarian share of the world's natural resources. In this article,
   I argue that this argument fails on Steiner's own terms. I argue that,
   on Steiner's conceptions of freedom, self-ownership, and an egalitarian
   share of the world's natural resources, insofar as the right to equal
   freedom implies the right to self-ownership and to an egalitarian share
   of the world's natural resources, it is incompatible with
   (luck-egalitarian) equality.},

Title = {Geopolitical Subjectivity in Iran-GCC Relations: The Three Islands Issue
   Since 1979},

Year = {2013},
Volume = {18},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {This article enters into the debate about geopolitical subjectivity
   between Iran and the members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) on
   the three islands issue. The islands at the Western entrance to the
   Strait of Hormuz have so far been examined as an issue between Iran and
   the United Arab Emirates from historical, sovereignty and law
   perspectives, but this article examines the argument that the GCC has
   become a geopolitical subject through its support for the US policy of
   isolating Iran. Geopolitical subjectivity, a concept building on Pami
   Aalto's conceptual scheme, is the concept of goal-oriented ordering of
   territories and political space. We can use it to identify the GCC
   institution as a subject with the ability to act (and abstain from
   acting) and to examine Iran's response to the GCC's willingness to order
   the three islands. The conclusion is that the GCC became a subject in
   this context as soon as it felt the benefits of US support and the

Abstract = {This article describes agendas as ``packages{''} of topics of varying
   salience, set by the Russian Internet users on Russia's leading blog
   platform LiveJournal. The research involved modeling LiveJournal's topic
   structure, viewed as an important component of what is termed here
   self-generated public opinion. Topic modeling was performed
   automatically with the LDA algorithm, and complemented with hand
   labeling of topics. Data were collected by software created by the
   authors to generate a relational database storing all posts by the top
   2,000 LiveJournal users from three one-month periods: two during the
   Russian parliamentary and presidential elections 2011-2012, and one
   control period. We find that LiveJournal top users share their attention
   evenly between ``social/political{''} and ``private/recreational{''}
   issues, the proportion being very stable. However, the substitution of
   diverse public affairs issues by the topics related to national street
   protests in the politicized periods compared to the control period was
   found both automatically and manually. The group of topics centered
   around social issues demonstrates the biggest volatility in terms of its
   composition and may serve as the foundation for monitoring
   self-generated public opinion by further application of
   sentiment/opinion mining methods to these topics.},

Abstract = {Objectives During the 2008 presidential election, questions about Barack
   Obama's religious affiliations spread rapidly over the Internet and
   became a regular story in the national news. Despite Obama's repeated
   testimony that he is a Christian, surveys indicated that a sizeable
   portion of the public believed that he was a Muslim, while others
   indicated that they were unsure of his religious allegiances. We
   evaluate the extent to which racial attitudes played a role in how the
   public viewed Obama's religious affiliations. Methods We used nationally
   representative surveys conducted by the Pew Foundation and a state-level
   survey conducted in Arkansas. Results Our findings suggest that
   attitudes about Obama's religious affiliation were significantly
   influenced by symbolic racism. Conclusions These findings suggest that
   the American public dialogue about racial politics has evolved in recent
   years to include religious denominations.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the effect of central bank independence on fiscal
   deficits. Previous literature finds a negative relationship between bank
   independence and deficits in OECD countries. No such relationship is
   found for developing countries. We argue that independent and
   conservative central bankers prefer budget discipline due to the long
   run connection between deficits and inflation and can enforce their
   preference through interest rate hikes and refusal to lend to the
   government. The claim, however, is that the legislated independent
   status of the central bank is cheap talk in the absence of democratic
   institutions. We test empirically the conditional effect of central bank
   independence on a sample of 23 democratic and undemocratic
   post-communist countries from 1990 to 2002. Results show that
   independent central banks restrain budget deficits only in democracies.
   Also, democracies that have not granted independence to their central
   banks have the worst fiscal discipline.},

Abstract = {Liberals argue that economic policy reforms will benefit most in terms
   of better access to goods, less inflation and better economic
   opportunities. Critics of market reforms, among them Marxists, critical
   theorists, skeptics of globalization as well as a large portion of the
   NGO community, see the majority as losers from such reform, expecting
   resistance that would lead to political repression. They suggest that
   free-market policy reforms are analogous to ``swallowing the bitter
   pill.{''} We make use of the change in the Index of Economic Freedom as
   a measure of market liberalizing reforms, employing data from a panel of
   117 countries for the period from 1981-2006. Our results show a strong
   positive association between reforms towards more free markets with
   regard to governments' respect for human rights, controlling for a host
   of relevant factors, including the possibility of endogeneity. The
   results are robust in relation to sample size, alternative data and
   methods, and a sample of only developing countries; and they are
   substantively quite large. Our results support those who argue that
   freer markets generate better economic conditions and higher levels of
   social harmony and peace, and it seems as if getting there is less
   problematic than people generally think-in fact, halfhearted measures
   and backsliding that prolong crises could be more dangerous to human
   rights.},

Abstract = {Public opinion research has demonstrated that minority religious and
   ethnic groups hold distinctive preferences on foreign policy issues,
   including military interventions in the Cold War and post-Cold War eras.
   There has been little scholarly research in Britain into the attitudes
   of minority groups on foreign policy issues. This article uses a
   nationally-representative survey of the ethnic minority population in
   Britain to examine the sources of public opinion towards the war in
   Afghanistan. Using multivariate analysis, it finds strong effects for
   religious affiliation, religiosity and political alienation. There is
   also evidence of a ``gender gap{''} and age-related differences. The
   paper contributes to the literature on the impact of religion on public
   opinion and foreign policy and to analysis of the political attitudes of
   minority groups in Britain.},

   determined lottery is always superior to an all-pay-auction; it yields
   larger expected efforts (revenues) for the contest designer. If the

Abstract = {In the early 1990s, Victoria reformed its state sector along New Public
   Management (NPM) lines. Drawing on interviews with key policy-makers of
   the time, including chief executives, ministers and key officials from
   both jurisdictions, and using archival material and secondary sources,
   this article shows that New Zealand developments were a key source for
   Victoria's reforms even down to seemingly copying passages of
   legislation. Policy transfer took place within a supporting framework of
   an Anglo-American diffusion of NPM rhetoric and neoliberal ideas. But
   New Zealand's experiences gave content, form and legitimation to
   Victoria's reforms, while providing a platform and experience for
   learning and divergence, and a group of transferable experts. We
   underline the importance of the Australia-New Zealand relationship and
   trans-Tasman elite networks in understanding the governance of both
   countries.},

Title = {Disapproval of Homosexuality: Comparative Research on Individual and
   National Determinants of Disapproval of Homosexuality in 20 European
   Countries},

Abstract = {In this contribution, we elaborate on disapproval of homosexuality in 20
   European countries. We mainly focus on the explanation of differences in
   the disapproval of homosexuality at the individual and the national
   level. Data from four waves of the European Social Survey are used,
   using multilevel techniques to test our hypotheses. Individual
   differences in disapproval of homosexuality can be derived from theories
   of socializing agents (religious institutions, schools) and socializing
   circumstances as well as from psychological theories on conventionalism
   and tradition. We find that religious people, people who support
   conventionalism, and those who attach to traditions disapprove of
   homosexuality more, whereas highly educated people disapprove less.
   Differences between countries can be explained by socializing
   circumstances of the national context as the countries' religiosity and
   laws on homosexuality turned out to be important determinants of the
   disapproval of homosexuality. We found that disapproval of homosexuality
   is the least in countries where law permits homosexuals to marry. In
   addition, people who live in more religious countries disapprove of
   homosexuality more than people who live in secular countries.},

Abstract = {This article interrogates the bureaucratization of war, incarnate in the
   covert lethal drone. Bureaucracies are criticized typically for their
   complexity, inefficiency, and inflexibility. This article is concerned
   with their moral indifference. It explores killing, which is so highly
   administered, so morally remote, and of such scale, that we acknowledge
   a covert lethal program. This is a bureaucratized program of
   assassination in contravention of critical human rights. In this
   article, this program is seen to compromise the advance of global
   justice. Moreover, the bureaucratization of lethal force is seen to
   dissolve democratic ideals from within. The bureaucracy isolates the
   citizens from lethal force applied in their name. People are killed, in
   the name of the State, but without conspicuous justification, or
   judicial review, and without informed public debate. This article gives
   an account of the risk associated with the bureaucratization of the
   State's lethal power. Exemplified by the covert drone, this is power
   with formidable reach. It is power as well, which requires great moral
   sensitivity. Considering the drone program, this article identifies
   challenges, which will become more prominent and pressing, as technology
   advances.},

Abstract = {This essay critically assesses Connell's Southern Theory. Operating from
   the premise that knowledge is a ``project{''} embedded in power
   relations, the essay suggests that while the scope of ideas surveyed in
   Southern Theory is an important accomplishment, two main dilemmas can be
   found. The first is that Southern Theory inadvertently puts ``Northern
   theory{''} at the center. The second is that the southern theorists
   examined tend to be educated elites from the Global South, thereby
   overlooking other actors in the Global South and their ways of doing
   theory. Struggling to change, not just the ideas, but also the
   ownership, vested interests and institutional actors of social theory as
   knowledge project might create space for much needed dialogues across
   differences in power.},

Abstract = {The objective of the article is to identify impact of economic policy
   implications on current financial and economic crisis. The analysis
   examines a hypothesis that the main causes of financial and economic
   crisis include unbalanced developments of the macroeconomic sphere as
   well as existing weaknesses of banking systems, which often do not
   evolve in line with the development of economy fundamentals. The article
   is going to inspect three areas: (i) What development trends and
   economic policy were registered in the pre-crisis period in order to
   identify the main causes of economic fluctuations of economy; (ii) How
   economic policies responded to the course of the financial and economic
   crisis; (iii) What was the effect financial crisis had on the real
   economy development? The main task for after-crisis periods is to
   improve setting of monetary and fiscal policy, bank risk management
   system and also system for monitoring and analysing the business cycle.},

Title = {The Philosophical Leninism and Eastern `Western Marxism' of Georg Lukacs},
Journal = {HISTORICAL MATERIALISM-RESEARCH IN CRITICAL MARXIST THEORY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Pages = {69-93},
Abstract = {This essay centres on the English translation (2000) of Georg Lukacs's
   Tailism and the Dialectic (written in either 1925 or 1926). Lukacs is
   generally heralded as a founding theoretician of a `Western Marxism', in
   opposition to `Eastern' Soviet Marxism, and his most impressive and most
   influential work, History and Class Consciousness (1923), is generally
   treated as having rehabilitated Marxist concern with questions of
   subjectivity. It might therefore come as a surprise when Lukacs in
   Tailism states that the purpose of History and Class Consciousness was
   to demonstrate `that the organisation and tactics of Bolshevism are the
   only possible consequence of Marxism'. In my view, however, this should
   already be abundantly clear from History and Class Consciousness. For
   Lukacs's absorption with proletarian subjectivity was motivated by an
   obsession with what he saw as its immaturity. And he coined the category
   of `reification' in order to explain his disappointed expectations, to
   explain, that is, why the proletariat did not make a `socialist'
   revolution in the `objectively ripe' situation of an `imperialist war'
   created by `moribund capitalism'. In short, Lukacs did raise anew the
   question of the subjective, but only to then declare that workers, not
   even `the most revolutionary among them', could never attain proper
   class consciousness, which he attributed instead to the `revolutionary
   party' bearing the properly revolutionary theory. For this reason I
   agree with Slavoj Zizek's characterisation of Lukacs as the `ultimate
   philosopher {[}my emphasis] of Leninism' - although I do think that
   Lenin himself would have found, as he did in connection with one of
   Lukacs's other works, Marxism `present only at a verbal level'. My
   concern is two-fold: with a critique of the methodological short-cuts
   that Lukacs made in his purely conceptual derivation of the concept of
   reification, and his purely conceptual attribution of it as the
   necessary form of working-class consciousness `in its immediacy'; and
   with the dangerous political consequences that Lukacs derived from his
   assessment of the reified character of working-class subjectivity,
   mainly a theoretical guarantee that the party with the proper
   revolutionary theory must always be right, or at least more right than
   anyone else.},

Abstract = {This study examines labor market status of Veterans of the
   Iraq/Afghanistan-era and previous eras, and variations by age and by
   health status, using the Current Population Survey (CPS) March
   supplement from 2006 to 2011. Although this observational study does not
   demonstrate a causal effect of military service on labor market
   outcomes, the authors find that Iraq/Afghanistan-era service among the
   youngest Veterans (ages 18-24) was associated with higher earnings and
   greater odds of being enrolled in school, but also higher odds of
   unemployment. Military service in previous eras by older Veterans,
   particularly those in fair or poor health, was associated with higher
   odds of unemployment and lower earnings than their nonveteran
   counterparts. Future research should examine the reasons for the higher
   unemployment rates of the youngest Veterans and should examine whether
   receipt of services such as health care services, disability benefits,
   and military reintegration programs are associated with improved labor
   market outcomes.},

Abstract = {In 2011 the UK Parliament introduced a new set of rules and timetable
   for the redistribution of Parliamentary constituencies, which also
   included a new procedure for public consultation on the Boundary
   Commissions' proposals. The first redistribution under this new regime
   began in 2011, and an extensive series of Public Hearings and submission
   of written representations took place in late 2011 and early 2012.
   During the consultation, the political partiesas under the previous
   regimes-sought changes to the proposals that would better serve their
   electoral interests. This paper evaluates the extent to which their
   counter-proposals were able to achieve that end, given the reduced
   degrees of freedom provided by the new rules and other geographical
   constraints. At best, each party might have been able to change the
   number of seats it might win by about 10-12, out of 600.},

Abstract = {This chapter analyzes the role of new media, especially Internet-based
   communication, in accelerating the process of political transformation
   and democratization in Egypt. It analyzes the Egyptian media landscape
   before, during and after the 2011 revolution which toppled the regime of
   President Hosni Mubarak. In the pre-revolutionary phase, the eclectic
   and paradoxical political and communication landscapes in Egypt, and the
   role that new media played in paving the way for the revolution, is
   discussed. During the 2011 revolution, the role of new media, especially
   social media, such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, is highlighted in
   terms of the multiple roles they play as catalysts for change, avenues
   for civic engagement, and platforms for citizen journalism. In the
   post-revolutionary phase, the multiple changes and challenges exhibiting
   themselves after the revolution are analyzed, especially the
   divisiveness between different players in the Egyptian political arena
   and how it is reflected in the communication landscape.},

Abstract = {The geopolitics of the Arctic region is viewed as a race for resources
   between coastal states. Yet, alarmist assessments are tempered by the
   reality that the most economically viable hydrocarbon reserves are
   entirely contained within the uncontested EEZs of the littoral states.
   Given this situation, confrontational rhetoric coming from Ottawa and
   Moscow seems not only troubling but peculiar. This article attempts to
   explain this peculiarity. It argues that leaders in both states seem
   willing to emphasise the ideational salience of disputed space to
   domestic audiences while downplaying their cooperative track record. The
   article finds mixed evidence of the instrumental use of national
   identity politics in Arctic issues, which often conflate distinct
   elements of Arctic geopolitics. While this dynamic has not yet prevented
   cooperation over disputed boundaries, perpetuation of these narratives
   may erode domestic support for dispute settlement.},

Abstract = {Do the deviant acts carried out by the collective known as Anonymous
   qualify as vigilante activity, and if so, can they be justified?
   Addressing this question helps expose the difficulties of morally
   evaluating technologically enabled deviance. Anonymous is a complex,
   fluid actor but not as mysterious as popularly portrayed. Under a
   definition of vigilantism that includes reprobative punishment rather
   than violence as a key element, Anonymous are vigilantes. Many of its
   Ops can be justified in view of the mismatch between formal norm
   enforcement practice and Internet natives' experience of it. Anons are
   more like eco-warriors than terrorists. While their actions are
   contentious, their force is framed in a vision of common good that is
   not unreasonable. Engaging with online deviants is shown to be a
   productive way of identifying the weaknesses in concepts underpinning
   moral evaluation of Internet-enabled phenomena.},

Abstract = {This article explores the effects of borders on the making of trade
   union policies and on their capacity to act. It takes as an entry-point
   the reform of Luxembourg's system of family allowances and financial
   support for students in 2010, which redefined the group of beneficiaries
   and partly excluded cross-border workers from neighbouring countries.
   This led to heated debates in Luxembourg and in the Greater Region
   (comprising Luxembourg, Saarland, Rhineland-Palatinate, Lorraine and
   Wallonia) during which trade unions played an important part. The author
   explores the contradictory logics of both competition and cooperation
   within the Greater Region. These lead to a gap between integration as a
   discourse and what it means for local populations, in particular
   regarding labour market competition. The debates within trade unions on
   the issue of social entitlements for cross-border workers offer insights
   into the dynamics of this dichotomy and into the everyday fabric of
   cross-border social relations.},

Abstract = {While the beneficial effects of social trust on economic performance
   have been largely recognized, we analyze whether these effects can be
   generalized for economies at different stages of economic development.
   Contrary to previous studies on this issue based on average effects
   (mostly considering ordinary least squares estimations), we follow a
   quantile regression approach that enables us to capture heterogeneous
   effects of trust for different development levels. By considering data
   for 80 countries, and using trust indicators from five different waves
   of the World Values Survey (WVS), our results by quantile indicate that
   trust is not relevant for the poorest economies, showing the existence
   of a social poverty trap. In addition, results suggest that the impact
   of trust on income decreases as an economy becomes richer. This would
   suggest not only that trust benefits cannot be generalized for all
   countries, as some previous studies have proposed, but also that the
   extent of its implications are heavily dependent on the level of
   development. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Oppression is commonly deemed a problem of freedom. How though should we
   conceptualise the freedom-restricting nature of oppression? This paper
   aims to show that the unfreedom in oppression may be understood in terms
   of individual negative liberty. The controversial concept of collective
   unfreedom is not needed. Non-cooperation among the oppressed generates
   constraints on individual freedom. This non-cooperation is ultimately
   attributable to the exercise of social power by oppressors. It is in
   this sense that the resultant states of individual unfreedom are due
   relations of oppression.},

Abstract = {In the last two decades, many U.S. states introduced policies to promote
   electricity generation from renewable energy sources (RES-E). Renewable
   portfolio standards (RPS) are considered to be the key RES-E policy tool
   to date. This article tackles the question on why some state legislators
   were front-running the trend of RPS implementation whereas others
   adopted policies just recently, and why others have not adopted them at
   all. We compile data on financial contributions of conventional energy
   interest groups (CEI) and renewable energy interest groups (REI) to
   state-level policy-makers between 1998 and 2010. By means of hazard and
   tobit regressions, we test the effect of these financial contributions
   on the probability of RPS adoption and on RPS stringency. The article
   provides evidence in favor of interest group theory. First, CEI have
   donated more to state-level legislators affiliated with the Republican
   Party than to Democrats while contributions from REI went largely to the
   latter. Second, there are statistically significant links between the
   likelihood of RPS adoption and private interest contributions.
   Contributions from CEI have a negative effect on the likelihood of RPS
   adoption whereas REI contributions have a positive effect.},

Abstract = {I first characterize a moral mistake in coercion. The principle of
   independence with which I criticize coercion seems also to condemn
   exchange. I propose an account of exchange from which it follows that
   exchange upholds independence after all. In support of that account I
   argue that, of the accounts of exchange that occur to me, only this one
   has the consequence that, on general assumptions, a person can take part
   in exchange while acting, intending, and believing with sufficient
   reason. I argue that the hiring of very poor people by very rich people
   for labor from which the rich draw a substantial surplus does not give
   rise to an exchange of this kind. These instances of the wage labor
   relation resemble coercion insofar as they violate independence.},

Title = {Geopolitics at the margins? Reconsidering genealogies of critical
   geopolitics},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {37},
Pages = {20-29},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Critical geopolitics has become one of the most vibrant parts of
   political geography. However it remains a particularly western way of
   knowing which has been much less attentive to other traditions of
   thinking. This paper engages with Pan-Africanism, and specifically the
   vision of the architect of post-colonial Tanzania, Julius Nyerere, to
   explore this overlooked contribution to critical engagements with
   geopolitics. Pan-Africanism sought to forge alternative post-colonial
   worlds to the binary geopolitics of the Cold War and the geopolitical
   economy of neo-colonialism. The academic division of labour has meant
   that these ideas have been consigned to African studies rather than
   being drawn into wider debates around the definitions of key
   disciplinary concepts. However Nyerere's continental thinking can be
   seen as a form of geopolitical imagination that challenges dominant
   neo-realist projections, and which still has much to offer contemporary
   political geography. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRESS-POLITICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {18},
Number = {4},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The article discusses the negative consequences of globalization in the
   new international arena that arose following the Great Recession of 2008
   that enabled emerging economies such as China, Russia, and Angola to
   take center stage, reconfiguring power relations between Western and
   non-Western countries. As new global flows of capital in media
   industries have been emerging, it is relevant to consider how investors
   from autocratic political regimes with illiberal views on the media
   articulate with Western culture's founding prerogatives of media and
   journalism. To do this, we singled out the Angola-Portugal relationship.
   Results show that the clientelistic dynamics in Portugal's media system,
   enhanced by the economic crisis, facilitate the entrance of the Angolan
   capital, which, in turn, may perpetuate clientelism and drive the
   reversal of media democracy in the country.},

Volume = {12},

Abstract = {Widespread public mistrust of legislative redistricting begs the
   question: Can (presumably) neutral and independent courts produce more
   competitive districts that preserve the integrity of the democratic
   process? The regime politics perspective suggests not, portraying courts
   as partisan collaborators whose rulings help their regime allies in the
   other branches. Conversely, recent congressional elections research
   suggests that non-legislative approaches to redistricting (such as
   independent commissions) encourage experienced candidates to mount
   serious electoral challenges to incumbents. We extend this literature by
   focusing on the impact of judicial participation in the redistricting
   process. Using data for the 2000 apportionment cycle, we test whether
   judicial redistricting enhances the competitiveness of congressional
   elections, as some studies suggest, or if it instead serves to promote
   the interests of the party with which the judge is affiliated, as the
   regime politics literature would lead us to believe. Our findings
   suggest that judicial redistricting does enhance competition in
   congressional elections, but we fail to find evidence that it confers
   any partisan advantage.},

Abstract = {This article presents an empirical study of the developments in the
   regulation of privacy in Denmark over the past decade, from 2000 to
   2011. During this period, technologies for harvesting, storing, and
   analyzing logs of personal data, often compiled by digital systems in
   so-called big data archives, have gradually become central resources in
   contemporary business intelligence. Through a historical analysis of
   cases decided upon by the Danish Data Protection Agency, we develop an
   empirical baseline for assessing changes to the regulatory practice
   concerning privacy. We use Bordewijk and Kaam's (1986) classification
   scheme of information flows as a conceptual model to examine which kinds
   of information flows give rise to regulatory consolidation and change,
   and identify practices of personal data processing that seem to escape
   regulatory action.},

Abstract = {Technological innovation is the most politically palatable avenue for
   governments to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. It avoids less
   palatable alternatives, such as regulating social behaviour. However,
   technological innovation in advanced, liberal capitalist states such as
   Australia is the product of the interaction of science possibilities
   with market demands, and is primarily reliant on the choices of
   profit-seeking corporations. Therefore, interviews were conducted with
   key office-holders in Australia's most carbon-intensive industry
   sectors. The perspectives they offered challenge the conventional wisdom
   that Australian business desires less government intervention. Instead,
   corporate representatives expressed a desire for stronger, clearer and
   more strategic long-term government support. This is because a liberal
   economic basis for capitalism in Australia means government, more than
   the market, is central for climate innovation as opposed to normal
   market innovation.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we study the dynamics of legal rules in a model with two
   nation-states playing a non cooperative game. For each country, changing
   the legal system is a costly process. At the same time, the existence of
   different legal systems is also costly for all nation-states. We show
   that despite the non cooperative behavior of countries, a process of
   legal convergence is achieved in the long run through small step by step
   changes. This result depends neither on the number of players in the
   game, nor on the time horizon of policy makers. Complete legal
   convergence can be obtained in a finite time. Coordinated efforts to
   achieve legal convergence are then unnecessary. We show that they might
   even be counterproductive, in the sense that the welfare of
   nation-states is higher under legal competition, compared to cooperative
   legal unification.},

Title = {Himalayan border citizens: Sovereignty and mobility in the Nepal-Tibetan
   Autonomous Region (TAR) of China border zone},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {35},
Pages = {25-36},

Abstract = {For over half a century, a border zone mandated by bilateral treaty has
   existed along the full length of the international border between Nepal
   and China's Tibetan Autonomous Region (TAR). Since 2002, people
   classified as ``border inhabitants{''} who live within 30 km of the
   border on both sides have been issued ``border citizen cards{''} which
   allow them to cross the border without a passport or a visa, and travel
   up to 30 km on the other side. This article explores historical and
   contemporary experiences of life in the Nepal -TAR border zone for such
   border citizens. Their state-sanctioned cross-border mobility
   complicates existing work on Tibetan refugee citizenship, and expands
   previous models for understanding ethnopolitical identities and
   sovereignty in the Himalayan region. The legally recognized category of
   border citizenship between Nepal and China's TAR provides a compelling
   example of how states may create alternative categories of citizenship
   in response to practices from below, while further shaping such
   practices through regimes of differentiated citizenship. I argue that
   this form of border citizenship emerges out of non-postcolonial
   trajectories of state formation in the Himalayan region, which offer
   important contrasts with other parts of South Asia. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {In India's Jammu and Kashmir State (J\&K), the politicization of
   religious identity over the course of the twentieth century has become
   part of life in complex and contradictory ways tied to geopolitical
   uncertainty and contested borders. In this case study set in J\&K's Leh
   District, I argue that border life and attendant vulnerability have
   charged both bodies and buildings with territorial potential. Fraught
   relations between Leh District's Buddhist majority and Muslim minority
   reproduce a border sensibility in the center of Leh town: restrictions
   on inter-religious marriage and fears of demographic change play out
   against a backdrop of religious structures being remodeled in ways that
   stake out territory at the heart of town and reference
   globally-identifiable religious architectural styles. How are
   inter-religious boundaries between people re-imagined to fit a shifting
   geopolitical context? What remains of an embodied past of
   inter-religious family ties? Through this case, I argue for attention to
   when and how political borders are recalled and embodied in
   relationships between people, in the spaces that we inhabit, and in the
   interpretation of those spaces. This article draws on seventeen months
   of research conducted during 2004, 2007-2008, and 2010, including a
   survey of 192 women's family decision-making, interviews, and youth
   photography and oral history projects to trace the interplay of memory,
   monumentalized religion in the built environment, and intimate life. (C)

Abstract = {We study how corruption affects economic activities of households in
   rural Liberia. A proxy of corruption of community leaders is obtained by
   directly monitoring the diversion of inputs associated with a
   development project. We measure quantities of these inputs twice; before
   and after the chief stored them, and interpret any `gaps' between these
   measurements as indicative of diversion by the chief (or corruption). We
   use this `gap' proxy to explain variation in economic behaviour across
   respondents, and find that corrupt community leaders cause reduced
   levels of income generating activities that are economically important:
   corruption leads to a 50\% reduction in rice planted and to nearly
   equally large reductions in trade activity. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {This paper models the interaction between individuals' identity choices
   and redistribution. Both redistributive policies and identity choices
   are endogenous, and there might be multiple equilibria. The model is
   applied to ethnicity and social class. In an equilibrium with high
   taxes, the poor identify as poor and favor high taxes. In an equilibrium
   with low taxes, at least some of the poor identify with their ethnic
   group and favor low taxes. The model predicts that redistribution is
   highest when society is ethnically homogeneous, but the effect of ethnic
   diversity on redistribution is not necessarily monotonic.},

Abstract = {We conduct an experiment to assess the effects of different decision
   rules on the costs of decision making in a multilateral bargaining
   situation. Specifically, we compare the amount of costly delay observed
   in an experimental bargaining game under majority and unanimity rule.
   Our main finding is that individual subjects are more likely to reject
   offers under unanimity rule. This higher rejection rate, as well as the
   requirement that all subjects agree, leads to more costly delay. This
   result provides empirical support for a classic argument in favor of
   less-than-unanimity decision rules put forth by Buchanan and Tullock
   (The calculus of consent: logical foundations of constitutional
   democracy, University of Michigan Press, Ann Arbor, 1962).},

Title = {Anticipating Army Exit: Identity Constructions of Final Year UK Career
   Soldiers},
Journal = {ARMED FORCES \& SOCIETY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {39},
Number = {2},
Pages = {284-304},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {There is recent concern about what becomes of Armed Forces leavers. This
   is most apparent among leavers themselves and is a feature of short
   careers that compel individuals to find replacement jobs and lifestyles.
   Concern for one's civilian future rises to prominence in the preexit
   period and is confronted in resettlement processes during this time.
   Based on qualitative analysis of interviews with twenty-eight UK regular
   Army career soldiers and officers, the article argues that the final
   year of service-though mostly a practical endeavor-is also an important
   time for tackling matters of identity. The work is underpinned
   theoretically by a combination of Mead's pragmatism and Ricoeur's
   hermeneutics and constructs a typology of preexit orientation. This is
   an approach that casts some doubt about the utility of projecting
   oneself into unknown civilian futures from the context of distinctive
   and familiar Army relations.},

Abstract = {This article investigates economic factors and non-economic factors of
   individual attitudes toward free-trade agreements with different
   countries. Based on the StolperSamuelson theorem, highly skilled workers
   in Taiwan should be more supportive of free trade with China and less
   supportive of free trade with the United States than should unskilled
   workers in Taiwan. Using survey data from Taiwan, we find that highly
   educated people in Taiwan are more supportive of free trade with both
   the United States and China, and the effects of education are much
   stronger with respect to free trade with China. We also find that
   individual risk attitudes, national identity, and ethnicity play
   important roles in explaining trade preferences.},

Title = {The effects of financial crisis on fiscal positions},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {29},
Pages = {197-213},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The recent financial crisis was characterized by the sizeable fiscal
   cost of banking sector bail out operations and the significant automatic
   and discretionary fiscal policy response to shrinking output, which have
   put increased pressure on public finances in many industrialized
   countries. This paper tries to evaluate the impact of financial crisis
   episodes on debt developments. The findings indicate that severe
   financial crisis episodes increase the stock of debt by 2.7\%-4.0\% of
   GDP, on average in the 20 OECD countries examined. In countries with big
   financial sectors it ranges from 4.2\%-5.3\% of GDP and in countries
   with smaller financial sectors it is about 1.4\%-1.7\% of GDP. The
   primary balance and the cyclically adjusted fiscal policy stance ease by
   about 2.6\% of GDP and 1.6\% of potential GDP, respectively, in the
   event of a severe financial market crash. Expansionary fiscal
   interventions are more pronounced in countries with sizable financial
   sectors. I find significant evidence that a financial market collapse
   paves the way for a subsequent deterioration in debt ratios. (C) 2012

Pages = {3-19},
Abstract = {To grasp current trends within capitalism without abandoning the
   framework of Marx's Capital we need to return to the category of
   `fictitious capital' and make it central to our explanations. Based on
   the 2012 Isaac and Tamara Deutscher Memorial Lecture, this essay
   combines reflections on Marx's account of `fictitious capital'; an
   investigation of the role of bills of exchange; and an analysis of the
   recent turmoil in British and US banking. It looks at the way the opium
   trade, financed through the London bill market, integrated a
   constellation of interests in the City with the labour of peasant
   households in India as parts of a unified accumulation process. Opium
   was vital to the fortunes of British capitalism for most of the
   nineteenth century. The merchant banks that were the mainstay of
   Britain's form of capitalism were also the key element in the
   re-emergence of global finance in the postwar period. The concluding
   part of the paper deals with the current banking crisis and follows
   Hilferding in arguing that by providing liquidity to the markets for
   fictitious capital, speculation plays a crucial role in sustaining
   profitability for the bigger capitals.},

Abstract = {Turning to World War II, this shorter chapter approaches serial
   misunderstandings in the `Pound case', many of which are derived from
   the patchy historical record on his wartime activism. In setting out the
   areas to be discussed over the second part of this book, this chapter
   introduces many of the key figures with whom Pound worked at Fascist
   Italy's EIAR, in addition to emphasizing both the difficulty of
   separating Pound's poetry from his other writings, as well as his
   general importance to the Axis war effort - particularly Anglophone
   radio broadcasting.},

Abstract = {This chapter gives an exploratory overview of the emergence and growth
   of new media in Uganda and how the alternative nature of new media is
   scaffolding the notion of citizenship and deliberative democracy. The
   chapter also suggests that despite the new found vigour, it is too early
   to say whether the Ugandan new media landscape have so far become a true
   alternative or complementary participatory space or a genuine platform
   for the distribution of uncensored information. It concludes that
   Ugandans use new media more for social interaction and dissemination of
   information (in a limited way) than as an alternative political public
   sphere. However, there are signs that online media is emerging and the
   anecdotes presented in this chapter indicate the potential of this media
   to be a place of participation and deliberation and reducing the
   authoritarian control of the communicative space.},

Abstract = {In the past several decades, the US military has increasingly relied on
   civilian contractors to provide a variety of core functions. Lagging
   behind this increased reliance on contractors is an understanding of how
   the presence of contractors influences civilian and military personnel.
   This research addresses this question using a unique study of US
   Department of Army civilians and military personnel serving in Iraq and
   Afghanistan. We find a substantial degree of ambivalence among both
   groups regarding the impact of contractors on the military and
   comparisons with contractors, but we also find a noticeable trend of
   comparative discontent beneath this apparent ambivalence. Results are
   discussed in the context of using ambivalence as a starting point for
   building a theoretical approach to more systematically understanding the
   role and effects of contractor integration in the military.},

Abstract = {The article deals with circumstances in which finance as a branch of
   study at the University of Economics, Prague (UEP) has been developed.
   Finance is taught both as a theoretical part of economic science and as
   a subject preparing students for practical work in the field of finance.
   Finance is one of the oldest branches existing at the UEP established at
   the same time as the University, in September 1953. At that time the
   soviet economic model was applied on the Czechoslovak economy including
   the field of finance. So the translations of soviet textbooks were used
   in addition to the Czech ones. In the sixties the problems in
   development of the Czechoslovak economy intensified and the necessity to
   strengthen the role of money in the economy was emphasized. This
   tendency reflected in the contents of teaching process. The period of
   normalization broke these efforts, but the teaching had never been
   completely restored to the position it had in the sixties. After 1989
   the teaching concentrated on the role of finance in the conditions of
   market economy. Study program provides knowledge of the issues of
   financial markets, banking, insurance, national and local budgets and
   public finance.},

Abstract = {This article examines Army spousal attitudes toward senior civilian
   leaders in the United States. Based on the 2004 Military Families
   Survey, it investigates the demographic, political, and institutional
   factors that structured the job approval ratings of then-President
   George W. Bush, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and Secretary of
   State Colin Powell. Partisanship, race and ethnicity, and opinions about
   the war in Iraq were consistently significant predictors; experiences
   directly related to the Iraq war were not. For instance, while
   Republicans and Latinos were highly likely to support the leadership,
   past and present deployments were not significant. In addition, Army
   spouses appear to have distinguished between the three leaders. The
   results have implications for researchers interested not only in
   military families but also the role of race and ethnicity in the armed
   forces, retention dynamics, the civil-military gap, and the Army in a
   time of war.},

Title = {`Do I Still Belong Here?' The Body's Boundary Work in the Israeli Fat
   Acceptance Movement},
Journal = {SOCIAL MOVEMENT STUDIES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {12},
Number = {3},
Pages = {280-297},
Abstract = {Boundary work is important in all social movements, but the instability
   of bodily-based categories makes boundary work particularly complicated
   in movements where bodily attributes are key to identity formation. Many
   Anglo-American fat acceptance groups have attempted to draw boundaries
   on the basis of two `ideal fat subjects': one with a stable, unitary
   `resisting' consciousness and/or one based on excluding those who are
   not `really' fat or fat `enough.' The former excludes members who
   display ambiguity or ambivalence in relation to accepting their bodies,
   while the latter excludes members seen as not fat enough to participate.
   In contrast, the Israeli fat acceptance community establishes its
   boundaries based on shared negative social reactions to body size. This
   increases its ability to tolerate ambiguity and contradictions among
   members, and to accept members who do not fit into fixed bodily identity
   categories. Simultaneously, this collective identity poses other
   problems, like reducing members to their identity as fat and encouraging
   constant preoccupation with weight or social oppression based on body
   size.},

   Bureaucracy},
Journal = {SOCIAL MOVEMENT STUDIES},

Volume = {12},

Pages = {121-137},
Abstract = {Over the past 30 years, transnational space has emerged as a key locus
   of social transformation. Activist networks and movement coalitions span
   the globe in an attempt to build an alternative politics. Many
   transnational activist networks (TANs), however, are meeting sites of
   two very different entities-movements and organizations-and must thus
   contend with a crucial divide in the political arena. While social
   movements usually act extra-institutionally and are often bound together
   by strong emotions, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), by virtue of
   their legally encoded form, often proceed within prescribed channels and
   must remain accountable to outside stakeholders. What happens when
   social movements encounter organizations? Can the tensions between
   social movements and NGOs be harnessed to create a lasting convergence
   aimed at building a more equitable democratic politics? My aim in this
   article is to contribute to a further texturing of our ideas of
   transnational space by raising some questions and concerns regarding the
   `actually existing democracies' being enacted there. I focus on the
   tension between the more emotive aspects of mobilization and the
   inevitable day-to-day bureaucratic procedures meant to ensure
   transparent and equitable democratic practice. These two forces, though
   complementary parts of any well-functioning TAN, are also forces of
   attrition. How close they are, and how they can both focus activists'
   energy and grind that energy to a halt, is shown by the example of the
   Amazon Alliance, a network of indigenous activists and conservation,
   human rights and environmental justice organizations, working to protect
   indigenous territories and the Amazonian ecosystem.},

Booktitle = {FROM ECONOMY TO SOCIETY?: PERSPECTIVES ON TRANSNATIONAL RISK REGULATION},
Series = {Studies in Law Politics and Society},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {62},
Pages = {135-159},
Abstract = {The social protests on the streets of indebted sovereigns in crises
   across the Eurozone have made debt restructuring an imperative. Further
   delay in achieving this expeditiously and equitably significantly
   exacerbates the social costs of crises from which current and future
   generations will struggle to recover. This article examines the
   feasibility of the drastic and widespread debt restructuring needed to
   resolve the problem in the face of existing private law sanctions that
   protect individual creditor rights. It relies on an analysis of US
   policy in the transition to a securitized market and of key sovereign
   debt cases to reveal the historical contingency of private law
   protections. It concludes by showing that the effectiveness of private
   law protections have always been constrained by the overriding
   imperative to achieve debt sustainability with negotiated and consensual
   workouts. This can be achieved in the Eurozone with statutory
   constraints on enforcement action pending the settlement of debt
   workouts as suggested in a recent proposal.},

Abstract = {This article combines two sources of data to shed light on the nature of
   transactional legal work. The first consists of stories about contracts
   that circulate among elite transactional lawyers. The stories portray
   lawyers as ineffective market actors who are uninterested in designing
   superior contracts, who follow rather than lead industry standards, and
   who depend on governments and other outside actors to spur innovation
   and correct mistakes. We juxtapose these stories against a dataset of
   sovereign bond contracts produced by these same lawyers. While the
   stories suggest that lawyers do not compete or design innovative
   contracts, their contracts suggest the contrary. The contracts, in fact,
   are consistent with a market narrative in which lawyers engage in
   substantial innovation despite constraints inherent in sovereign debt
   legal work. Why would lawyers favor stories that paint them in a
   negative light and deny them a potent role as market actors? We conclude
   with some conjectures as to why this might be so.},

Abstract = {In spite of its importance for civil society, we know relatively little
   about the way in which individuals spend their time and money in the
   charitable provision of goods and services. In this paper, we provide a
   comprehensive picture of the philanthropic behavior in Europe by
   analyzing both, the correlates of individuals' charitable cash donations
   and volunteer labor as well as their interdependence. Using data from
   the European Social Survey, we document a positive correlation between
   time and money contributions on the individual as well as on the country
   level. In addition, we find evidence that individuals substitute time
   donations by money donations as their time offered to the market
   increases. Moreover, analyzing philanthropic behavior on the
   disaggregated level reveals large differences in the determinants and
   the relationship of time and money donations in Europe - both across
   different types of voluntary organizations and across different welfare
   regimes. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {From the second half of the 1980s onward, Western governments have been
   pursuing vigorously the implementation of digitalization policies. As a
   result, political institutions and administrative procedures have been
   progressively computerized. Even non-Western countries like China,
   India, and Russia have started reform processes aiming at the creation
   of ``virtual states.{''} Concurrently, developments in the Internet and
   related technologies have affected international relations, either
   heightening conflict or strengthening cooperation. e-Democracy and
   e-government projects and policies have generated numerous case studies,
   leading to a solid research tradition investigating the extent to which
   politics has been transformed. However, theoretical development to
   understand the geopolitical strategies designed by states in order to
   control and regulate digital networks has lagged behind. This article
   analyzes the main trajectories followed by states in their
   digitalization processes, highlighting their constitutional and
   geopolitical relevance. It explores the relationships between the state
   and information and communication technologies and proposes a set of
   typologies of digital regimes.},

Abstract = {This paper explains the secular increase of nonstandard workers in
   Japan, whose share of employment increased from 17 to 34\% between 1986
   and 2008. Changes in labor force and industrial compositions account for
   one quarter of the increase of nonstandard workers. Product-demand
   fluctuation and the introduction of information and communication
   technologies increased firms' usage of nonstandard workers, but its
   quantitative effects are limited. The increase of nonstandard workers
   was concentrated among new entrants to the labor market, male workers of
   younger cohorts, and female workers of all cohorts, suggesting that the
   declining importance of the long-term employment relationship is a major
   cause for the increase of nonstandard workers.},

Abstract = {Objectives. Despite growing efforts to assess the views of Chinese
   citizens toward environmental issues, a crucial question remains
   unanswered: Do Chinese have a coherent system of environmental attitudes
   and beliefs as has been found among North Americans, making it
   appropriate to speak of ``environmental concern{''} or ``environmental
   consciousness{''} in China? To answer this question we use the belief
   system perspective and examine the degree of constraint among various
   environmental attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors reported by Chinese
   citizens, and also examine the social bases of their environmental
   concern. Methods. We use data from a 2003 nation-wide survey in China
   and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to test a relatively
   comprehensive model of environmental concern. Then we construct a
   structural equation model (SEM) to examine the social bases of such
   concern. Results. The CFA results suggest that Chinese citizens have a
   reasonably coherent sense of generalized environmental concern, and the
   SEM results show that the higher educated, males, government employees,
   residents of large cities, and those affiliated with the Chinese
   Communist Party are more environmentally concerned than their
   counterparts. Conclusion. The general public in China possesses a
   relatively coherent environmental belief system, similar to that found
   among North Americans, and education is a powerful predictor of
   environmental concern among the Chinese.},

Abstract = {Political sex scandals are largely absent in some democracies but
   proliferate in others. However, there have so far been few if any
   comprehensive attempts to document the actual number of sex scandals
   that have occurred and to explain their presence (and, indeed, absence),
   and the one study that has (Barker's 1994 study) ended in the early
   1990s and had numerous problems in relation to defining and documenting
   such scandals. Based on extensive research, this article documents the
   number of sex scandals in eight advanced industrial democracies and
   tries to explain their occurrence using Charles Ragin's fuzzy set
   qualitative comparative analysis. The article has three goals: to
   determine the number of sex scandals in different democracies, explain
   why this might be, and demonstrate the utility of fuzzy set qualitative
   case analysis for small- and medium-N comparative research.},

Title = {Efficiency in the provision of pure public goods by private citizens},
Journal = {PUBLIC CHOICE},
Year = {2013},

Number = {1-2},
Pages = {31-43},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This paper raises an old question and proposes a new answer. The
   question is, ``Must public goods be produced by governments?{''} The
   consensus answer is ``Yes,{''} on the grounds that transaction costs
   related to group size prevent all potential consumers of a public good
   from entering into voluntary arrangements to produce efficient levels of
   that good. Government intervention thus is required to achieve
   efficiency.
   Yet many obvious examples of public goods are not financed or even
   subsidized by government. Conspicuous examples of this phenomenon
   include the development of important innovations in technique in fields
   such as music (Bach and Beethoven), literature (Defoe, Dickens and
   Shakespeare, not excepting Homer or Adam Smith), and the visual arts
   (Cezanne), not to mention many crucial scientific discoveries. Indeed,
   the obvious public-good aspects of scientific knowledge induced many
   private societies to offer prizes for particular innovations. Two
   questions are raised by the private, voluntary provision of nonrival
   outputs or inputs: (1) what conditions contribute to this phenomenon,
   and (2) can voluntary provision come ``close{''} to efficient provision?
   We suggest in this paper that, under certain conditions, the gains from
   many public goods whose benefits reach nationwide populations are
   largely realized at group sizes far smaller than even county or
   municipal jurisdictions.},

Abstract = {In the wake of the Single European Act of the mid-1980s and a series of
   follow-on initiatives aimed at fostering greater integration in Europe,
   a number of commentators began describing Europe as a truly novel
   political-territorial arrangement. By the middle of the 1990s, however,
   the adoption of a common currency came to dominate the European
   integration agenda. The embrace of monetary union reflected a view of
   European integration that was firmly embedded in the logic of the modern
   territorial state system. That logic led many commentators to view the
   success or failure of integration in terms of the degree to which powers
   were being transferred from state governmental and economic institutions
   to the central decision-making bodies of the European Union. Such an
   approach cast the EU as a super-state rather than as a new type of
   political-institutional entity. As a result, the integration project was
   less subversive of the state system than it might otherwise have been -
   bolstering the view of the European Union as a distant bureaucracy not
   adequately attuned to the needs of everyday Europeans and fueling
   nationalist sentiments: a social force with deep roots in the modernist
   territorial order. Moving the European integration process forward will
   likely require embracing conceptions of progress that are less tethered
   to modernist territorial ideas and assumptions.},

Abstract = {Over the past decade, the issue of election auditing has become
   prominent in election administration. One component of such auditing is
   whether voted ballots should be available for public review by any
   interested individuals. In this article, we discuss the potential
   problems that might arise from public accessibility to executed election
   ballots. Specifically, we note that the public disclosure of voted
   ballots may compromise the secrecy of individuals and alter their
   election choices. Such violations of privacy-or even the appearance of
   such violations-could open a wide array of opportunities for election
   fraud, dissuade marginal voters from election participation, and
   potentially distort democratic outcomes.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the utility of using information contained within
   Twitter posts in predicting electoral outcomes. Particularly, we are
   interested in patterns in Twitter communications that can help explain
   differences between published opinion polls and the actual vote. We
   consider three categories of models. The first is a mentions model that
   examines the correspondence between the prevalence of communications
   about a candidate and electoral outcomes. The second series of models
   treat Twitter similar to a prediction market, aggregating not candidate
   preferences but predictions of the electoral result. Last, we consider
   whether the rediffusion of tweets about a candidate is a reliable
   predictor of the candidate's performance. The results find inconsistent
   support for the predictive value of Twitter mentions as an estimate of
   the overall vote, but these communications provide some evidence of
   otherwise undetected shifts in momentum with respect to the aggregated
   predictions of candidate performance and message rediffusion via
   retweets containing information about a particular candidate. Given the
   nature of the information extractable, these data are most sensitive to
   detecting changes in momentum.},

Abstract = {This paper develops an intra-industry trade model with skilled and
   unskilled labor as factors of production, endogenous accumulation of
   skilled labor and firm heterogeneity in factor intensities to examine
   the effect of trade reforms on factor prices. Since exporters are more
   skill intensive than nonexporters, a decrease in trade barriers
   initially increases wage inequality between skilled and unskilled
   workers, as a result of an increase in the relative demand for skilled
   labor. Over time, however, as agents respond to the change in relative
   wages by investing in skilled labor, the relative wage of skilled labor
   decreases. Evidence from Chilean plantlevel data supports the idea of
   factor price overshooting with trade liberalization.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the ontological constitution of the neoliberal
   state. By enriching Michel Foucault's work on neoliberal governmentality
   with Heideggerian reading of the ontological conditions involved in the
   process, the paper argues for an understanding of neoliberalism as a
   mono-political process of enframing', through which things and human
   capabilities are revealed as an array of reserves' set available for the
   market rational utilisation. It is argued that the neoliberal state is
   not based on the ideological or discursive turn in political practices,
   but on the extending drive, through which the real itself, including the
   ethical constitution of human conducts, natural entities, and life (with
   its possibilities), is ontologically positioned to serve the interests
   of profit-making. The paper concludes by showing how the neoliberal
   state and the economisation of everyday life are fundamentally based on
   the ontological violence of concealing the openness of being, and thus,
   the possibility for ontological politics.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to investigate the dual nature of
   agenda-setting processes as they can either occur on a deliberate level
   or on an automatic one. At present, the factors that lead to one of the
   processes rather than to the other are almost unknown. From studies on
   dual processing theories comes evidence that whether information is
   processed with high or with low cognitive effort strongly depends on the
   involvement with a certain issue. For that, we assume that the duality
   of agenda-setting reflects an involvement-determined duality of the
   underlying learning processes. In line with dual processing theories, we
   assume a more thoughtful agenda-setting process, if issue involvement is
   high and a more automatic one, if issue involvement is low. We tested
   these assumptions with two experimental panel studies. It can be
   concluded that the duality of agenda-setting processes is a result of
   different types of information processing.},

Abstract = {Recent research in the United States has found candidates for elected
   office are able to use a rhetorical form of closed-circuit communication
   with evangelical Protestants - ``God Talk{''} - that communicates
   valuable political information without alerting other constituencies.
   Close observation of the 2010 parliamentary elections in the United
   Kingdom (U.K.) uncovered what appeared to be a form of God Talk in use
   by David Cameron and the Conservative Party, especially the use of
   ``broken{''} to describe the state of Britain. Thus, we assess whether
   God Talk is an efficacious communication strategy in the U.K. using an
   experiment that selectively exposes participants to God Talk statements.
   The mixed results suggest that some forms of God Talk are better than
   others in conveying to U.K. evangelicals that a candidate is
   conservative and religious without triggering the same associations by
   non-evangelical voters. We close with a discussion of the normative
   impact of such communication strategies.},

Pages = {389-403},
Abstract = {Governing public expression has historically constituted a key element
   of public policy, and in the 20th and the 21st century has remained an
   important tool for both state and nonstate actors. The following article
   will look at two specific cases of expression governance-the content
   regulatory regimes in the U.S. and on Facebook-in order to understand
   how the process of content regulation plays out in public and private
   contexts. This institutional distinction between public and private, and
   the manner in which content regulatory practices traverse it, has
   important implications for both outcomes and process of content
   regulation.},

Abstract = {Foreign and Internal Trade as the main disciplines in the field of
   research and study have developed theoretical systems that reflected
   historical development of international economic and business
   environment, governmental trade policy and international and domestic
   businesses. They created a basis, on which the Faculty of International
   Relations after 1989 has designed a new profile discipline International
   Trade{''} in the framework of the International Economic Relations{''}
   program. Very important features of the discipline, both of study and
   research areas, are a deep internationalization and an interdisciplinary
   approach. The discipline's development reflects world trends,
   international scientific knowledge and domestic specificities and
   introduces new terminology for new qualitative processes of
   international business to the Czech economy. To the discipline's
   development, very many excellent teachers and important personalities of
   the Czechoslovak and Czech economy contributed. The modern discipline
   comprehends analysis of global economic and institutional relations and
   of theoretical concepts, together with practical managerial branches. A
   prove of high standards of teaching and research is a prestigious
   accreditation EPAS by which the discipline ``International Trade{''} has
   been awarded by the European Foundation of Management Development in
   2012.},

Journal = {SOCIAL MOVEMENT STUDIES},

Volume = {12},

Pages = {138-154},
Abstract = {This paper considers some political and ethical issues associated with
   the `academic intellectual' who researches social movements. It
   identifies some of the `lived contradictions' such a role encounters and
   analyses some approaches to addressing these contradictions. In general,
   it concerns the `politico-ethical stance' of the academic intellectual
   in relation to social movements and, as such, references the `theory of
   the intellectual' associated with the work of Antonio Gramsci. More
   specifically, it considers that role in relation to one political
   `field' and one type of movement: a field which we refer to, following
   the work of Peter Sedgwick, as `psychopolitics', and a movement which,
   since the mid- to late-1980s, has been known as the `psychiatric
   survivor' movement-psychiatric patients and their allies who campaign
   for the democratisation of the mental health system. In particular,
   through a comparison of two texts, Nick Crossley's Contesting Psychiatry
   and Kathryn Church's Forbidden Narratives, the paper contrasts different
   depths of engagement between academic intellectuals and the social
   movements which they research.},

Abstract = {The traditional postcolonial focus on the modern and the European, and
   pre-modern and non-European empires has marginalized the study of
   empires like the Ottoman Empire whose temporal reign traversed the
   modern and pre-modern eras, and its geographical land mass covered parts
   of Eastern Europe, the Balkans, Asia Minor, the Arabian Peninsula, and
   North Africa. Here, I first place the three postcolonial corollaries of
   the prioritization of contemporary inequality, the determination of its
   historical origins, and the target of its eventual elimination in
   conversation with the Ottoman Empire. I then discuss and articulate the
   two ensuing criticisms concerning the role of Islam and the fluidity of
   identities in states and societies. I argue that epistemologically,
   postcolonial studies criticize the European representations of Islam,
   but do not take the next step of generating alternate knowledge by
   engaging in empirical studies of Islamic empires like the Ottoman
   Empire. Ontologically, postcolonial studies draw strict official and
   unofficial lines between the European colonizer and the non-European
   colonized, yet such a clear-cut divide does not hold in the case of the
   Ottoman Empire where the lines were much more nuanced and identities
   much more fluid. Still, I argue that contemporary studies on the Ottoman
   Empire productively intersect with the postcolonial approach in three
   research areas: the exploration of the agency of imperial subjects; the
   deconstruction of the imperial center; and the articulation of bases of
   imperial domination other than the conventional European ``rule of
   colonial difference{''} strictly predicated on race. I conclude with a
   call for an analysis of Ottoman postcoloniality in comparison to others
   such as the German, Austro-Hungarian, Russian, Persian, Chinese, Mughal,
   and Japanese that negotiated modernity in a similar manner with the
   explicit intent to generate knowledge not influenced by the Western
   European historical experience.},

Abstract = {Civil-military relations and the autonomy of the military profession in
   Sweden have varied over time depending on the perceived level of
   external threats. In this article, we set out to conduct an analysis of
   Swedish civil-military relations over a period of more than twenty-five
   years from 1984 to 2011. Our analysis is made from the perspective of
   civil-military control of (1) the military officer rank system and (2)
   the professional officer education system, for all three services. The
   analysis is based on Samuel Huntington's and Morris Janowitz's
   theoretical discussion of ``objective{''} and ``subjective{''} civilian
   control over the military and will give answers on how the Swedish armed
   forces have been effected by objective and subjective civilian control
   during the late Cold War era and after the fall of the Berlin Wall in
   1989. The findings of this study confirm the assumption that
   civil-military relations vary over time because of perceived external
   threats but also because of new threats, new tasks, and increased
   globalization and cooperation in multinational international operations.},

Abstract = {History has made it difficult for Hong Kongers to learn to belong to a
   nation. Their distinctive local identity had been formed before the
   handover and recognised by institutions such as Basic Law. The influx of
   Mainlanders into Hong Kong in 2012 became a tipping point for public
   anger as the locals feel they are ``strangers in their homeland{''}.
   This sentiment is fanned by political figures' use of local identity
   issues for popular support.},

Pages = {675-690},
Abstract = {The paper deals with an analysis of economic impacts of ICT
   implementation within the public administration, which is called
   e-Government. The current situation in the Czech Republic is discussed
   using data about particular implemented tools, such as the contact
   points of public administration, data mailboxes or basic registries of
   public administration and more. In the paper there are evaluated impacts
   of these projects not only on public administration and public sector,
   but on the overall economic environment of the state including
   discussion of the rate of bureaucratic burden, transparency of the legal
   system or cyberspace security. In spite of the fact that a number of
   significant e-Government projects has been already implemented in the
   Czech Republic, there is still unused potential of other projects, whose
   adaptation could have positive economic impacts.},

   sociology might look like since it argues that postcolonial difference
   can be used to extend theory, point to earlier theoretical
   misrecognitions, and to illuminate hitherto unseen logics of social
   organization by shifting the center.},

   of individuals as moral actors; some writers consider property rights to
   be paramount. The welfare of individuals is sometimes identified with
   choice, and sometimes with rights, but it is more complex than either;
   the interests of individuals are closely affected by their relationships
   with other people.},

Abstract = {This article explores the construction of anticlerical collective
   identities among Spanish workers from the late nineteenth century,
   outlining the ways in which the daily experience of the Church generated
   and intensified anticlerical sentiment. From the turn of the century,
   political, social and cultural changes sparked by industrialization and
   rural-urban emigration altered the face of `traditional' Spanish popular
   anticlericalism; newly politicized workers increasingly identified the
   Church as part of the repressive machinery of the Restoration Monarchy's
   political system. As workers struggled to fend off the ever-expanding
   central state's intrusions into their domestic space and the Church's
   influence over innumerable aspects of everyday life (including,
   crucially, its control of public spaces) they constructed their own,
   strongly anticlerical `workers' public sphere' grounded in alternative
   forms of socialization, cultural activities, and new secular rituals.},

Journal = {POLITICKA EKONOMIE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {61},
Number = {6},
Pages = {834-851},
Abstract = {The paper aims at the correspondence of the health care financing
   systems to the social models (welfare regimes) as defined in the social
   theory and policy, including the trends in the OECD and CEE countries
   and utilizing the lessons from typical countries. We compare the
   liberal, social-democratic, conservative and neo-liberal models of
   health care financing, mentioning the Communist model and the
   single-payer system as well.
   The National Health Service model may also today be considered as a
   viable, social-democratic model of the basic health protection. The
   social health insurance model was markedly modified by the transition to
   the universal health care provision to all residents and there are
   strengthening tendencies to the split-off of the health insurance from
   the social insurance system; the result might be a transition to the NHS
   model or, on the contrary, to the neo-liberal mandatory private
   insurance system. The choice of the health care financing is a question
   a political, economic and social choice and the particular solution is
   not seldom also substantially influenced by the stakeholders. That is
   why there are also substantial deviations of the paradigmatic reforms
   from the corresponding theoretical models.},

   both education and the quality of institutions, and that education and

Abstract = {Deliberative democrats tend to be skeptical about elections as
   mechanisms for deliberation, and with good reason. But the reality is
   that elections will likely persist as the primary means by which we make
   decisions- indirectly-about how we are governed. By contrast,
   deliberative democracy will likely continue in a supplementary role
   because of its feasibility problem, something that many pragmatic
   deliberative democrats now accept. It therefore pays to reflect on what
   kinds of elections best serve deliberative ideals and sensibilities.
   Although some deliberative democrats have rejected the idea of
   compulsory voting, I argue that they should be more open to the idea due
   to the fact that compulsory voting elections are more inclusive and less
   subject to distortions of unequal political power than are voluntary
   ones. They are also better able to reflect the objective interests of
   voters and to protect the conditions necessary for deliberation to
   occur.},

Abstract = {Sir John Kerr's dismissal of the Whitlam government ensured that he
   became Australia's most controversial Governor-General and the one seen
   to have taken vice-regal powers to their limit. While this is
   understandable, Kerr's notoriety has obscured a wider appreciation of
   the significant activism and even intrusiveness which characterised
   Richard Casey's 1965-1969 term as Governor-General. This article draws
   on Casey's extensive diaries to paint a broader picture of the man and
   to examine his activist view of the role. Casey's version of the
   vice-regal role is almost certainly at the extreme end of any Australian
   vice-regal activity spectrum, and is consistent with patterns in his
   overall career.},

   FINANCE IN CALIFORNIA},
Journal = {ECONOMICS \& POLITICS},

Volume = {25},
Number = {3},
Pages = {335-359},

Abstract = {Although local electoral accountability should be stronger when
   responsibilities are clearly assigned to local governments, the
   involvement of higher tiers of government is often associated with
   policies specifically designed to improve local accountability. This
   article investigates the impact of centralization on local electoral
   accountability in the context of California's school finance system.
   Results show that voters are responsive to differences in dropout rates
   and pupil-teacher ratios, at least in some contexts, and that local
   electoral accountability is affected by a district's degree of
   centralization. Dropout rate regressions reveal that the No Child Left
   Behind Act of 2001 appears to have sharpened local electoral
   accountability.},

Abstract = {During the last 50 years, political polarization in the US House of
   Representatives has intensified. One explanation for this trend
   emphasizes the importance of congressional redistricting. This paper
   analyzes the relationship between political polarization and
   redistricting in the context of two trade liberalization bills. The
   results of the paper indicate that redistricting has not contributed
   significantly to party polarization over trade policy although it has
   produced a partisan shift in favor of trade liberalization.
   Redistricting does not appear to impact political polarization largely
   because district-level characteristics currently are dominated by
   broader, national factors such as party affiliation. The results of the
   paper clearly demonstrate this point by showing that changes in party
   affiliation have a much greater impact on voting behavior than changes
   in district characteristics. The paper also finds, however, that
   institutional control of the redistricting process at the state level
   has influenced political polarization with respect to trade policy.},

Abstract = {This paper develops the concepts of the climate discourse complex, and
   national climate policy regime, in order to analyse significant patterns
   in Australian national climate politics over the twenty-five years from
   1988 to 2013. Six major discursive fields scientific, ethical, economic,
   technological, political/legal, and everyday life contribute to the
   ensemble of discourses that constitute a climate discourse complex. The
   climate discourse complex in turn serves to frame and discipline climate
   debate and the articulation of a national climate policy regime. The
   composition of Australia's climate discourse complex has been dominated
   by the economic discursive field. Debates over old and new economic
   discourses have been the key drivers of and constraints on the
   trajectory of Australia's climate policy regime for much of the period
   under consideration. These debates have diminished and sometimes
   marginalized the influence of scientific, ethical and other discourses,
   contributing to Australia's weak mitigation ambition. The paper also
   suggests that significant changes in Australian climate discourses and
   Australia's climate discourse complex have largely been initiated by
   factors external to Australia, with the major shift occurring in the
   period 2006/2007.},

Abstract = {Many countries use centralized exit exams as a governance devise of the
   school system. While abundant evidence suggests positive effects of
   central exams on achievement tests, previous research on
   university-bound students shows no effects on subsequent earnings. We
   suggest that labor-market effects may be more imminent for students
   leaving school directly for the labor market and, on rigid labor
   markets, for unemployment. Exploiting variation in exit-exam systems
   across German states, we find that central exams are indeed associated
   with higher earnings for students from the school type directly bound
   for the labor market, as well as with lower unemployment. (c) 2013

Abstract = {Political budget cycles (PBCs) can result from the credibility problems
   office-motivated incumbents face under asymmetric information, due to
   the temptation to manipulate fiscal policy to increase their electoral
   chances. We analyze the role of rules that limit public debt, because
   borrowing is a necessary condition for aggregate PBCs. Since the
   legislature must typically authorize new debt, divided government can
   make these fiscal rules credible. Commitment is undermined by either
   unified government or imperfect compliance with the budget law, which
   can help explain why PBCs are stronger in developing countries and in
   new democracies. When divided government affects efficiency, voters must
   trade off electoral distortions and government competence.},

Abstract = {During the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) the Portuguese-Spanish border
   was an instrument of protection and resistance, an imaginary line that
   demarcated the life and death of thousands, surviving Salazar's
   reinforcement of control and surveillance. The article analyses the
   cross-border solidarities that took place during the war, questioning
   the opposition between the logic of the State and the logic of the local
   populations (in regards to the border), electing as its empirical and
   historiographical object, the case of refugee fluxes to the Portuguese
   village of Barrancos. Methodologically we seek to intertwine documentary
   sources, oral sources and field work conducted between 2006 and 2010 in
   Barrancos (Baixo Alentejo), and in the neighboring Spanish villages of
   Encinasola (Andalusia) and Oliva de la Frontera (Extremadura). The
   analytical approach to historical memory, borders and power relations,
   explains the strategies of resistance of social actors, defining them as
   a cultural praxis conformed throughout the historical process.},

Abstract = {In this article, the authors offer a comprehensive review of the item
   count technique (ICT) and a detailed application of the method in voter
   turnout drawing on a three-wave national panel survey. They critically
   discuss the methodological and practical problems occurring throughout
   the implementation of ICT design in a survey research. Furthermore, the
   authors use ICT to estimate the social desirability bias in
   self-reported turnout and to evaluate the effectiveness of using ICT to
   reduce turnout over-reporting and to estimate the real turnout. Results
   align to the expected direction: By using ICT, the estimation of
   self-reported turnout is reduced by about 10\%. Moreover, social
   desirability bias varies with respondents' socio-demographic
   characteristics.},

Abstract = {This paper uses panel data drawn from the Household, Income and Labour
   Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey to provide new evidence of the
   links between unemployment, wages, job security, financial security and
   workers' well-being for workers in flexible employment. Our findings
   indicate that workers in flexible employment encounter more unemployment
   and experience increased job insecurity; unemployment is associated with
   wage penalties. Lower wages, job insecurity and financial insecurity
   affect well-being. However, these negative outcomes are mitigated by
   longer job tenure. Our results have implications for moves towards a
   flexicurity model of employment},

Abstract = {An adversarial game is used to model a firm's intrinsic and exerted
   influence over a regulator. Data from the World Business Environment
   Survey provide strong evidence in support of model hypotheses across a
   wide range of government agents, countries, and regulatory areas. Of
   particular relevance to public debate, the theory and econometric
   analysis show that large firms are more likely to be influential and to
   benefit from subsidies and low tax constraints. However, large firms are
   also likely to face greater regulatory constraint from environmental and

Abstract = {Since the early 2000s, the European Commission has put online
   e-participation and e-government platforms related to various
   institutional strategies. These participative mechanisms, which are both
   policy instruments and communication tools for the Commission, are used
   by activists as political opportunities to make their voices heard by
   the European institutions. In this paper, we describe how these
   activists use Web technical resources, and foremost hyperlinks, to
   mobilize individuals and run online collective actions in order to make
   their causes public on European scenes. We show that hyperlinks can be
   considered as aggregative mechanisms which allow individuals to gather
   around a common project, and that these mobilization practices lead to
   the constitution of strategic public spheres on the Web.},

Abstract = {In the past decade, parliaments in industrialized countries have been
   pressured to adopt more restrictive legislation to prevent unauthorized
   file-sharing and enforce higher standards of digital copyright
   enforcement over entertainment media and computer software. A complex
   process of supranational and national lawmaking has resulted in several
   legislatures adopting such measures, with wide variations in content and
   implementation. These policy developments offer an interesting research
   puzzle, given their high political salience and the amount of
   controversy they have generated. Specifically, the introduction of
   harsher intellectual property regulations has resulted in intense
   ``online{''} and ``offline{''} collective action by skilled activists
   who have significantly altered the digital copyright policy field over
   the years. In France, grassroots movements have turned the passing of
   digital copyright infringement laws through Parliament into highly
   controversial episodes. Similarly, at the European level, the Telecoms
   Package Reform has given rise to an intense protest effort, carried by
   an ad hoc coalition of European activists. In both cases, online
   mobilization was an essential element of political contention against
   these legislative initiatives. In both cases, our analysis shows that
   online mobilization and contention can substantially affect policymaking
   by disrupting the course of parliamentary lawmaking at both the national
   and European levels. We provide an analytical framework to study these
   processes, as well as an analysis of the frames and digital network
   repertoires involved in the two cases under scrutiny, with reference to
   the nascent research agenda formed by the politics of intellectual
   property.},

Abstract = {This article provides an overview of recent efforts by the Carter Center
   to establish an analytical framework for election observation
   assessments based in public international law. The authors argue that by
   basing the framework on international legal commitments that states have
   accepted freely, election assessments can be more transparent,
   objective, and acceptable to host countries. The authors also argue that
   an obligations based approach to election assessment provides a
   promising avenue for fostering consensus on the elements of democratic
   elections, as well as the assessment criteria used by observer groups.
   This article includes details of the practical tools used by Carter
   Center observation missions including the Database of Obligations for
   Democratic Elections, and forthcoming publications such as the Center's
   methodology handbook.},

Abstract = {Since the financial crisis of 1997-1998, East Asian countries have
   developed many initiatives for monetary and financial cooperation. The
   global crisis that began in 2007 has further accelerated the process of
   cooperation. The Multilateralization of the Chiang Mai Initiative in May
   2010 became the key element in establishing an Asian Monetary Fund. This
   strengthening of institutional integration, coupled with an increased
   economic interdependence, raises issues regarding the possible creation
   of a de facto currency bloc in the region. The aim of this paper is to
   explore this hypothesis using nonstationary panel data. The tools of
   convergence are translated to the exchange rates and we test, after
   having defined it, the hypothesis of a currency bloc using the three
   generations of panel unit root tests. Our results show, firstly, a
   decoupling of East Asian currencies vis-a-vis the dollar and, secondly,
   the emergence of a convergence towards regional targets.},

Abstract = {From April 1986 to February 1990, the supporters of the City of London
   Anti-Apartheid Group {[}City Group] maintained a Non-Stop Picket outside
   the South African Embassy in London calling for the release of Nelson
   Mandela. Whilst the Non-Stop Picket was one of the most visible
   expressions of British anti-apartheid activism at the time, the Picket
   was never endorsed by the national Anti-Apartheid Movement. Positioned
   on the pavement directly outside South Africa House, the Picket was
   strategically placed to draw attention to apartheid and bring pressure
   to bear on the regime's representatives and allies in the UK. The
   Embassy repeatedly brought pressure on the British Government to ban the
   protest, and for nearly two months in 1987 (6th May-2nd July), the
   Picket was removed from outside the Embassy by the Metropolitan Police.
   During this period, the Picket relocated to the steps of nearby St
   Martin-in-the-Fields Church and activists repeatedly risked arrest to
   break the police ban and defend their right to protest outside the
   Embassy.},

Abstract = {This study measures the relationship between media freedom and
   corruption, accounting for elements of vertical accountability
   (electoral competitiveness, civil society, and voter turnout) and
   horizontal accountability (judicial independence and political system).
   Results suggest a strong association between media freedom and
   corruption that runs from high levels of media freedom to low levels of
   corruption. This study also implies that media freedom might have a
   stronger indirect effect on corruption when coupled with powerful
   institutions of horizontal accountability. The data suggest that the
   association between media freedom and corruption is strongest in
   countries with parliamentary systems than in those with presidential
   systems, and that this impact amplifies as the judiciary independence
   increases.},

Abstract = {This study performs a content analysis of 207 YouTube videos and 45,759
   comments about the Proposition 8 campaign in California. Specifically,
   we examine how a video's tone and focus are related to comment features.
   We find consistent support for the flow of information from topics
   mentioned in the video to topics addressed in commentary, as well as
   uptake of an uncivil tone from the video to the comments. Implications
   are discussed for promoting higher quality online information exchanges
   and the democratic merits of social media.},

Abstract = {An individual is sensitive to its context if his actions are greatly
   affected by the manner in which a decision is framed. Such individual
   violates the foundation of all the theories of choice, i.e. the
   invariance principle. Sensitivity to context is now well documented, but
   its definition remains vague. This paper revisits the invariance
   principle and discusses its importance in the rational choice theory. It
   then proposes a taxonomy of the invariance principle to discriminate
   between different types of preference reversals. This taxonomy enables
   to focus on each type of inconsistency separately in order to understand
   its causes, which may lead to a more accurate theoretical reflection.},

Title = {When Sector Meets Territory: The Case of European Union Wine Policy},
Journal = {TERRITORY POLITICS GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {1},
Number = {2},
Pages = {203-222},
Abstract = {Studies of sectorial government seldom theorize its relationship to
   territory, i.e. to constructed, institutionalized but nevertheless
   contingent political spaces. This is particularly problematic in
   research on European integration-a process largely driven by the
   progressive institutionalization of sectors and its considerable
   reterritorializing effects. This article seeks to relaunch debate on
   sector-territory relations by proposing a constructivist and
   institutionalist approach to the `political work' of sectorial and
   extra-sectorial actors. Territory impacts upon this work by being
   simultaneously a jurisdiction, a constituency for political
   representation and a stock of symbolic resources. This three-pronged
   definition is then applied to explain a recent reform of the European
   Union's wine policy that was 20 years in the making. Contrary to
   material determinist or organizational readings of this change, its
   causes are to be found in how actors strove to reinstitutionalize the
   European wine sector's relationship to territory, and this whilst
   legitimating both this political project and themselves.},

Abstract = {The colonization of discourses (Chilton \& Schaffner, 2002) is a
   wide-spread phenomenon of globalization and naturally affects politics.
   The power of business-speak over politics and the media seems to be
   steadily increasing. Most vulnerable to that development, which the
   author calls businification, seem to be countries in transition that
   have to assert themselves rhetorically on a global scale while keeping
   traditional voters content at home. In an application of critical
   discourse analysis, the chapter seeks to trace this businification by
   comparing three presidential state-of-the-nation-addresses (SoNA) of
   three South African presidents after one year in office (1995, 2000, and
   2010). Through contextualizing these texts with their media reception
   from a corpus of 15 newspaper articles reporting on the speeches, the
   outer influences on the core text become transparent. The findings
   suggest a parallelism between a growing professionalism in politics and
   the businification of political rhetoric whose development cannot be
   viewed as exclusively negative.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to contribute to the study of political violence during
   the Spanish Second Republic by analyzing one of its lesser-known
   aspects, electoral violence. This is an important factor to understand
   how it was articulated in interparty competition during those years. The
   article deals with electoral violence during the two elections that
   repond to a pattern of movement typical of interwar democracy: the
   general elections of 1933 and 1936. It does this by providing new data
   on the type, frequency and impact of this kind of violence and comparing
   it to other countries.},

Pages = {342-348},
Abstract = {Mass protests in China in recent years have been more frequent and
   widespread than in other authoritarian settings and have thus become a
   serious source of concern for the party-state. Many believe that a
   rising tide of protest has the potential to impose a significant
   political challenge to the stability of the regime in comparison to the
   fragile situation of 1989 the Tiananmen incident. However, the motives
   behind today's protests are clearly not revolutionary. The growing
   protest movements do not serve as a severe threat to the continued rule
   of the Chinese Communist Party for three reasons. First, the nature of
   recent protests has not been that of pro-democracy; rather, the
   participants are aggrieved citizens who have suffered economic losses
   and who demand concrete and practical rights for unfair and unjust
   treatments. They are politically weak despite their huge numbers.
   Second, the characteristics of recent protests do not constitute any of
   the features that would involve serious political risk. Instead,
   protests are focused on local issues and target specifically at local
   authorities. Third, the shifting international environments and China's
   rise to international power change the political visions of educated
   Chinese and further undermine their potential to initiate protests that
   would have more serious political implications.},

Abstract = {We compare a uniform voucher regime against the status quo mix of public
   and private education, focusing on the distribution of welfare gains and
   losses across households by income. We argue that the topping-up option
   available under uniform vouchers is not sufficiently valuable for the
   poorer households, so the voucher regime is defeated at the polls. Our
   result is robust to partial voter turnout and efficiency differences
   between public and private schools, but depends critically on the

Pages = {232-250},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The recent global financial crisis placed new economic and fiscal
   pressures on donor countries that may have long-term effects on their
   ability and willingness to provide aid. Not only did donor-country
   incomes fall, but the cause of the drop the banking and financial-sector
   crisis may exacerbate the long-term effect on aid flows. This paper
   estimates how donor-country banking crises have affected aid flows in
   the past, using panel data from 24 donor countries between 1977 and
   2010. We find that banking crises in donor countries are associated with
   a substantial additional fall in aid flows, beyond any income-related
   effects, at least in part because of the high Fiscal costs of crisis and
   the debt hangover in the post-crisis periods. Aid flows from
   crisis-affected countries are estimated to fall by 28\% or more
   (relative to the counterfactual) and to bottom out only about a decade
   after the banking crisis hits. In addition, our results confirm that
   donor-country incomes are robustly related to per-capita aid flows, with
   an elasticity of about 3. Findings are robust to estimation using either
   static or dynamic panel data methods to account for possible biases.
   Because many donor countries, which together provide two-thirds of aid,
   were hit hard by the global recession, this historical evidence
   indicates that aggregate aid could fall by a significant amount (again,
   relative to counterfactual) in the coming years. We also explore how
   crises affect different types of aid, such as social-sector and
   humanitarian aid, as well as whether strategic interaction among donors
   is likely to deepen or mitigate the fall in aid. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {This article examines how the principles of deliberative democracy
   should apply to electoral management bodies through the case study of
   Australian electoral commissions. It focuses on three functions of the
   commissions (administering electoral rules; making electoral rules; and
   fostering democratic deliberation regarding electoral rules); it also
   grounds its analysis in the principles of independence, impartiality and
   fairness, and accountability.
   The article argues that, as decision makers administering electoral
   rules, electoral commissions should generally be subject to the
   principles of deliberative democracy in relation to their decisions but
   not in relation to their decision-making processes. As decision-makers
   making electoral rules, however, the commissions should be subject to
   these principles both in relation to their decisions and the
   decision-making processes. Electoral commissions should also be active
   participants in the legislative process of electoral rule making but
   should exercise caution when participating in the executive process of
   rule-making. Lastly, electoral commissions can perform a valuable public
   role by fostering democratic deliberation of electoral rules by
   enhancing the deliberation occurring in other institutional contexts
   such as the legislature and the media, and by auspicing their own forums
   of deliberation.},

Abstract = {The right to private property was first written into the Constitution of
   the People's Republic of China in March 2004. This study takes advantage
   of the 2004 amendment and uses a difference-in-differences approach to
   empirically test the impact of private property rights security on
   investment patterns and thereby on asset structure. Employing the
   Chinese Industrial Enterprises Database from 2000 to 2007 to implement
   the analysis, we find that private property rights security has not only
   led enterprises to boost investment in both fixed assets and intangible
   assets but also induced them to allocate available resources more
   towards intangible assets. We address two potential concerns about our
   empirical design.},

Abstract = {Scholarship aiming to describe the wrongness of exploitation, especially
   when it is voluntary and mutually beneficial, has increased greatly in
   recent years. In this paper, I expand the scope of this discussion by
   highlighting a set of additional ethical concerns associated with many
   cases of mutually voluntary and beneficial exploitation. Specifically, I
   argue that the phenomenon of persons desperately seeking out and
   gratefully accepting exploitative interactions raises special moral
   concerns. The element of voluntariness is key to understanding how and
   why some exploitative interactions are degrading to exploitees. When an
   exploitative offer does not allow the exploitee sufficient progress
   toward a decent minimum of human functioning, these offers can create
   what I call a `demeaning choice', where the exploitee may either accept
   the status quo or accept an offer that improves the exploitee's
   insufficiently. In these cases, the exploitee's participation in the
   interaction contributes to its demeaning quality, creating a form of
   `surface endorsement' of the treatment that she receives.},
