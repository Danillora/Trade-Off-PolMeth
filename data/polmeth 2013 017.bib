Abstract = {Major powers often deploy troops abroad with the consent of host states.
   The stated aim of these deployments is often both to protect the host
   state and to foster stability in the region. Drawing from an extension
   of Palmer and Morgan's two-good theory of foreign policy, the authors
   explore some of the (perhaps unintended) effects of troop deployments
   abroad on the foreign policies of the host states. In particular, the
   authors focus on the effects of US deployments. The authors argue that
   as the number of US troops deployed to a host state increases, we should
   expect the host state to reduce its own troop levels, be more likely to
   initiate militarized interstate disputes, and be less likely to be the
   target of interstate disputes. The authors test these hypotheses using
   data on US troop deployments abroad from 1950 to 2005 and discuss
   implications that their findings may have for US foreign policy.},

Abstract = {The growing cost of oil, driven by rising demand and instability in

   of the resistance, placing it within the broader context of
   environmentally focused protest in New Zealand and the response of the

Journal = {HISTORICAL MATERIALISM-RESEARCH IN CRITICAL MARXIST THEORY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {21},
Number = {2},
Pages = {117-147},
Abstract = {This article aims at contributing to current debates on the `new
   imperialism' by presenting the main results of a reading of Marx's
   Capital in light of his writings on colonialism, which were unknown in
   the early Marxist debate on imperialism. It aims to prove that, in his
   main work, Marx does not analyse a national economy or - correspondingly
   - an abstract model of capitalist society, but a world-polarising and
   ever-expanding system. This abstraction allows the identification of the
   laws of development of capitalism and its antagonisms, and reflects the
   tendency of the capital of the dominant states, by making permanent
   recourse also to methods of so-called `primitive accumulation', to
   expand and increase the exploitation of workers worldwide, and, at the
   same time, the cooperation between them. What, for Marx, was later
   defined as imperialism is the concrete form of the process of
   `globalisation' of the capital of the dominant states. With the
   development of his analysis, Marx became increasingly aware of the
   economic and political consequences of imperialism. In his activity
   within the First International, with regard to the question of Irish
   independence, he affirmed the fundamental importance of building a real
   solidarity between class struggles in imperialist countries and
   anti-colonial resistance in colonised and dependent countries. His
   examination of imperialism and internationalist perspective were
   downplayed, denied, if not completely reversed in the interpretation and
   systematisation of his thought by reformist leaders within the Second
   International. In their attempt to react against this tendency and
   develop an analysis and a political strategy adequate to the new phase
   of generalised imperialist expansion, increased inter-imperialist
   rivalries and rising anti-colonial resistance, Rosa Luxemburg and Lenin
   reaffirmed the centrality of the critique of imperialism at the economic
   and at the political levels. Even if they were partially unaware of
   this, they thus developed and expanded on some aspects already present
   in Marx's work.},

Abstract = {We use survey data from 2006-2007 to explore the implications of
   Internet use on political opinion in the Middle East, arguing that the
   Internet has had an equalizing effect when government filtering is low.
   Specifically, the findings indicate that Internet use had a positive
   effect on political knowledge, political participation, and attitudes
   about the United States/West and a negative effect on trust in
   government in Middle Eastern countries with relatively low government
   filtering practices. Conversely, there were no significant effects in
   countries with high filtering. Thus, the Internet has the potential to
   serve as an equalizing force in the region but only if filtering is at a
   minimum.},

Volume = {12},

Pages = {414-428},
Abstract = {Radical student protest has declined in the USA since the 1960s, but
   less militant forms of campus activism have continued to be a
   substantial part of larger social movement efforts. However, little
   research examines participation by today's youth in these moderate
   campus-based social movement organizations. This study addresses our
   lack of knowledge about less sensational forms of student activism with
   fieldwork and semi-structured interviews that illuminate the reasons for
   undergraduate participation in a student-led environmental group. The
   data show how school and employment considerations, career goals and
   social networks influence student decisions to join the organization.
   Moreover, the findings demonstrate the importance of organizational
   outcomes to participatory decisions. Students were led to actively
   participate according to their determination of the social movement
   organization's ability to achieve tangible goals and the perceived
   necessity of their contribution.},

Title = {Focusing on Differences? Contextual Conditions and Anti-immigrant
   attitudes' Effects on Support for Turkey's EU Membership},

Abstract = {A key predictor of support for Turkey's EU membership is citizens'
   attitudes toward immigrants. How anti-immigrant attitudes relate to
   support is not obvious and has remained unclear thus far. We argue that
   the presence of immigrants in a country reduces support for Turkey's
   membership. Second, the stronger this presence, the stronger the effect
   of anti-immigrant attitudes on support. Third, the more salient
   immigration issues in a country, the stronger the effect of
   anti-immigrant attitudes on support. Using cross sectional survey data
   (N = 26,344) from 20 EU member states, we find support for these claims.
   Our findings provide a prime example of how politicians and media can
   influence citizens' thinking about specific issues, and, in doing so,
   can influence public opinion.},

Abstract = {Using survey data from the Latin American Public Opinion Project (LAPOP)
   and Encuesta Nacional Sobre la Inseguridad (ENSI) from Mexico during the
   period of 2004-2010, this paper analyses the impact of insecurity and
   crime victimization on support and satisfaction with democracy and trust
   in institutions. The analysis shows that perceptions of higher
   insecurity decrease support and satisfaction with democracy. We also
   find that perceptions of insecurity and crime victimization reduce trust
   in institutions, particularly in those that directly deal with crime
   (police and judicial system). There is regional variation in relation to
   trust in institutions that are associated with drug-trafficking
   activity. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Allusions to holy scriptures and quotes from sacred texts appear in
   hundreds of political science articles. Yet while we treat other ancient
   texts with reverence and diligence, we have not extended a similar care
   to the holy scriptures of the world's religions. Political scientists
   often refer to biblical events, statements, and turns of phrase but
   rarely cite them, chapter and verse. They are careless about referencing
   the precise translation of the holy texts used, tend to cite religious
   passages out of context, and disregard the role of religious tradition,
   interpretation, and practice in shaping and reshaping the meaning of
   holy texts. I offer examples for these trends, provide evidence for
   their harmful implications and offer guidelines for the appropriate
   treatment of sacred texts as formal scholarly sources.},

Abstract = {Human capital accumulation is usually held to generate positive
   externalities. However, the empirical evidence on human capital
   externalities has been scarce and inconclusive. The missing evidence
   appears to be caused by misleading comparisons between private and
   social rates of return, by incorrect interpretations of regression
   coefficients, or by an inappropriate level of aggregation. Our own
   estimates point to relatively robust empirical evidence for a human
   capital externality that is about twice as large as a benchmark
   estimate, which is derived from a standard parameterization of a simple
   growth model. We ponder a possible causal link from human capital to
   social capital in the context of alternative views of long run
   development and argue that the grand transition view (Paldam 2002) is
   compatible with the existence of a large human capital externality.},

Abstract = {State-owned enterprises continue to play a considerable role in many
   economies. In this study we empirically investigate the connections
   between these enterprises and inequality as mediated through political
   ideology. Using cross-country data on the relative size of the
   state-owned enterprise sector, we find strong empirical support for an
   inverted U-shaped relationship between its size and income inequality.
   We also find strong evidence that left-wing (vis-a-vis right-wing)
   governments are associated with a larger state-owned enterprise sector
   in countries with higher inequality. This result is robust to using
   cross-sectional vs. panel data, different identification strategies, and
   various controls.},

Abstract = {Ronald Coase's 1974 article on lighthouses and the Trinity House case,
   in particular, has triggered extensive debate on the notion of a public
   good, but also on the possibility of private production of public goods.
   The resultant literature has discussed the concept of private property
   and the characteristics of a public good, and offered an economic
   analysis of the status of lighthouses.
   This contribution sets out to situate the debate in the context of an
   economic policy for which the lighthouse is an asset subject to
   political rent seeking. Thus, it highlights the fact that the
   characteristics of rivalry and exclusion, which define the public good,
   are in fact influenced by governments, which decide the nature of the
   services produced by lighthouses.
   The weight of the institutional setting, together with political
   competition for the control of lighthouses, calls for interpretation
   relating to rent seeking. In this respect, the lighthouse, prior to
   being a capital asset, has already emerged as a political object that is
   a source of revenue for certain individuals.},

Title = {How Quickly We Forget: The Duration of Persuasion Effects From Mass
   Communication},
Journal = {POLITICAL COMMUNICATION},

Volume = {30},
Number = {4},
Pages = {521-547},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Scholars do not usually test for the duration of the effects of mass
   communication, but when they do, they typically find rapid decay.
   Persuasive impact may end almost as soon as communication ends. Why so
   much decay? Does mass communication produce any long-term effects? How
   should this decay color our understanding of the effects of mass
   communication? We examine these questions with data from the effects of
   advertising in the 2000 presidential election and 2006 subnational
   elections, but argue that our model and results are broadly applicable
   within the field of political communication. We find that the bulk of
   the persuasive impact of advertising decays quickly, but that some
   effect in the presidential campaign endures for at least 6 weeks. These
   results, which are similar in rolling cross-section survey data and
   county-level data on actual presidential vote, appear to reflect a mix
   of memory-based processing (whose effects last only as long as
   short-term memory lasts) and online processing (whose effects are more
   durable). Finally, we find that immediate effects of advertising are
   larger in subnational than presidential elections, but decay more
   quickly and more completely. {[}Supplementary material is available for
   this article. Go to the publisher's online edition of Political
   Communication for the following free supplemental resource(s):

Abstract = {I study how the possibility of voters contributing to candidates in
   response to the candidates' policy proposals affects the equilibrium
   policy in winner-take-all political competition. More specifically, I
   allow each partisan voter to contribute to her preferred candidate where
   the amount contributed depends on the relative positions of the two
   candidates. Candidates then use the donations to build valence through
   campaigning, which in turn affects the voting decision of impressionable
   voters. Since candidates are concerned with raising money as well as
   picking a policy position preferred by the median voter, I show that
   campaign contributions may lead to divergent equilibria in
   winner-take-all elections when politicians are policy-motivated, albeit
   only under stylized utility functions and donor densities. Further,
   under symmetric voter and donor densities, if either the donor density
   is single-peaked or the voter utility is concave, a unique equilibrium
   exists in which both candidates propose the ideal policy of the median
   voter.},

Abstract = {The press had great potential to influence perceptions of Sarah Palin
   during the 2008 campaign, given her relative obscurity when picked to be
   the Republican vice-presidential nominee. Prior literature on press
   treatment of women running for national office suggests that Palin was
   likely to receive coverage that disadvantaged her due to her gender. We
   scrutinize press coverage of Palin's campaign for evidence that she was
   treated differently and that these differences affected public opinion.
   Our sample of over 2,500 individual newspaper articles published during
   the campaign is paired with the 2008 National Annenberg Election Survey.
   We demonstrate that Palin's coverage differed in significant ways from
   that of her male counterpart. Her gender, appearance, and family status
   were disproportionately mentioned in her coverage, and such mentions
   tended to dampen public opinion about her. In addition, the tone of
   Palin's coverage was markedly negative, increasingly so over time, and
   was significantly related to reader opinion about her. While Palin was a
   unique candidate for national-level office, these findings should give
   pause to those concerned with equitable press treatment of women on the
   campaign trail.},

Abstract = {Previous research indicates the importance of interpersonal
   communication in the political socialization process. Investigations of
   political talk have mostly been restricted to frequency, and the
   theorizing of its effects centered on cognitive outcomes such as
   knowledge and ideological identification. This study examined the part
   played by private political talk in promoting expressive forms of
   political participation among adolescents. Recent survey panel data from
   Swedish 13-18-year-olds were analyzed. Results showed that frequency of
   private political talk predicted the extent of public political
   expression even when self-selection and previous levels of political
   expression were accounted for. Data offered some support for an expected
   interaction of private political talk and political interest in
   predicting public expression. The overall findings are consistent with
   the theoretical idea that political talk offers adolescents
   opportunities to enact participation in safe settings, and that this is
   a mechanism that can explain why talking about politics is favorable for
   political development during adolescence.},

Abstract = {Objectives. I test the importance of demographic and economic contextual
   variables for the success of extreme right parties. Methods. I employ
   subnational data from the crucial case of Latvia to capture the effects
   of minority group size and economic change on the extreme right vote.
   Ethnic Latvians constitute a bare majority of the Latvian population and
   GDP dropped by 18 percent in 2009. Results. I find that localities with
   high or rising unemployment were less likely to support extreme right
   parties. The dampening effect of unemployment on the extreme right was
   greater in localities with large minority populations. Conclusions.
   These counterintuitive findings raise questions about the logic and
   generalizability of existing explanations of extreme right voting. The
   study of the extreme right is hampered not only by ill-suited measures
   of group size and economic conditions, but also by overarching theories
   that predict group-based outcomes.},

Title = {Articulated sovereignty: Extending Mozambican state power through the
   Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {36},
Pages = {1-11},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Since its inception in 2001 and subsequent integration into the
   tri-national Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park (GLTP), Mozambique's
   Limpopo National Park (LNP) has been progressively transformed into a
   functioning wildlife park. Standing behind this transformation has been
   a profound expansion of Mozambican state power over and through the
   park. While this reinforces predictions in the early transfrontier
   conservation literature, it stands in tension with observations that
   these projects threaten state power. I address this tension by
   developing the concept of articulated sovereignty, which understands
   sovereignty as a heterogenous set of powers that are produced through
   often unequal interactions with other actors, including foreign or
   extra-territorial actors. In short, sovereignty is articulated through
   these interactions. I draw from this to show that the same partnerships
   that seem to threaten sovereignty in some respects in fact shore up the
   power of the Mozambican state in other respects. I focus in particular
   on the foreign-assistance-enabled extension of state power through the
   development of legal and technical capacity, park administration and
   infrastructure, a ranger force, and the relocation of communities beyond
   park borders. I additionally draw on articulated sovereignty to show
   that the state and territory, like sovereignty, are built through
   various articulations with extraterritorial partners, thus drawing into
   question the sovereignty-state-territory triad. I close by reflecting on
   the utility of articulated sovereignty beyond the realm of conservation.
   In short, articulated sovereignty sheds light on both the sovereignty
   complexities of transfrontier conservation projects like the LNP/GLTP
   and how sovereignty actually plays out in the world. (C) 2013 The

Journal = {PUBLIC CHOICE},

Volume = {156},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {45-60},

Abstract = {During the conquest and early administration of Spain's American
   colonies the most controversial policy was the granting of temporary
   encomiendas, or temporary rights to collect tribute from Indians, as a
   reward for conquest. The contribution of the encomienda to the
   destruction of Indian populations was recognized by Spanish authorities
   at the time, yet the Crown persisted in introducing the most destructive
   form of the institution during the early stage of each colonial venture
   for over 200 years. Because the Crown financed the defense of its
   colonial possessions against other European imperialists, an addition to
   colonial capital, by increasing the return to an aggressor, imposed a
   defense-cost externality on the Crown. Since the cost of defending
   additional assets was higher in the Americas than in Spain, an efficient
   policy would have been to encourage the rapid transformation of human
   services into durable assets that could be transported to Spain.
   According to our defense-externality argument, the temporary encomienda
   and its parallel modification in each colonial episode becomes a
   rational Crown policy. The administration of Spain's distant colonial
   possessions, especially the adjustments in the restrictions on
   encomiendas, required information about the local conditions, and we
   argue that the Church, as designated ``protector of the Indians,{''} may
   have played an unwitting role in the communication of information.},

Abstract = {This article interprets the mediatization of television news generally
   and political news specifically in United Kingdom (U.K.) public and
   commercial evening bulletins. We argue that routine conventions (edited
   packages or two-ways) reflect different types of journalistic
   interventions, with the use of live, unscripted, and interpretive news
   practices representing a greater degree of mediatization, since they
   resemble the style and format of 24-hour media rather than fixed time
   bulletins. Our content analysis (N = 902) found more live news on
   commercial bulletins, but all broadcasters exhibited a degree of
   immediacy and interpretation in their editorial practices. This was most
   apparent in live two-waysnotably on Channel Fivewhich produced less
   source-driven political journalism than edited packages, with political
   editors playing the role of primary definer. The concept of
   mediatization, we suggest, can help interpret whether fixed time
   bulletins conform to their own media logic or adopt the values of 24/7
   media.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the present article is to analyze a little known period
   of the trajectory of the philosopher and politician Manuel Sacristan
   Luzon, his years as a young Falangist. For that, we analyzed his
   collaboration with two magazines of the Sindicato Espanol Universitario
   (SEU), Estilo magazine and Quadrante magazine. The methodology used
   implies a double perspective which covers and relates not only the
   textual analysis, but also the contextual analysis. This approach allows
   to appreciate the boom and decadence of the reception of the Falangist
   utopia in the postwar generation and gives some hints needed to
   understand the historical conditions of the Marxism introduction into
   Spain.},

Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},

Abstract = {Objectives We examine the connection between pork-barrel projects and
   the election returns of members of the U.S. Congress. While previous
   researchers have uncovered little evidence of a direct link, we refine
   the perspective that pork has electoral implications by advancing the
   argument that its effects differ across geographic and partisan
   contexts. Methods Our empirical analysis focuses on the Senatewhich has
   largely escaped attentionand utilizes a measure of pork that includes
   only those projects inserted by legislators as line items in
   appropriation bills from 1996 to 2004. Results We find a direct
   relationship between pork and electoral performance, albeit one that is
   conditioned upon ideological congruence, constituency size, and the
   political ideology of the legislator. Conclusions Electoral payoffs for
   pork-barreling accrue to some but not all senators. Moreover, our
   findings demonstrate the pragmatic rationale for conservative opposition
   to earmarks.},

Abstract = {This is a study of the comparative outcome success experienced by 2748
   participants in government-funded faith-based and community-based
   intervention programs for at-risk and adjudicated Latino youths run by
   28 providers in five western cities. The Latino Coalition, an
   intermediary faith-based organization, subcontracted with 28
   sub-grantees that provided the services from 2005-2008. The study found
   similar outcomes were experienced by youths in the faith-based versus
   the community-based programs, but it did find significantly different
   outcomes by the comprehensive versus non-comprehensive nature of the
   programs. The study places its findings in the context of faith-based
   and community initiatives and draws conclusions concerning the public
   policy implications of the government partnering with faith-based and
   community-based organizations to provide public services to needy, and
   especially minority, populations.},

Abstract = {This article presents a small state's perspectives on military
   socialization by examining military interactions at political and
   strategic, operational, and tactical as well as educational tiers.
   Transnational military socialization creates learning and socializing
   environments for militaries. However, the transnational military
   socialization process in Asia has received little scholarly attention,
   although its nature changed dramatically after the Cold War and 9/11. A
   small state often enters into asymmetric socialization with major
   powers. Mongolia presents an interesting case to capture these changes
   and impacts of transnational military interactions. The Mongolian
   military internalized Soviet military norms, ideas, and values during
   its seventy-year military socialization process. Since then, it has been
   attempting to disconnect from its communist past by internalizing the
   Western military norms, ideas, and culture even though it is isolated
   from the Western world. Interactions between Sino-Mongolian militaries
   over the past two decades have not resulted in any in-depth exchanges of
   ideas due to political, historical, and cultural factors. In the absence
   of explicit pressures from these three major powers, today the Mongolia
   military has consolidated a new identity, similar to a Western military.
   It has increased its contribution to peace support operations while
   attempting to disconnect its Soviet past and avoiding absorption from
   the growing Chinese military initiatives toward Central Asia. At the
   same time, Mongolia's military socialization with Russian or American
   militaries often triggers uncertainty for Chinese security.},

Abstract = {We review existing methods for sampling an adult from a household and
   highlight the strengths and weaknesses of these methods with respect to
   issues relevant for sampling in the Middle East and developing
   countries. We then develop a new, flexible within-household sampling
   scheme that takes full advantage of the fact that household size must be
   obtained to produce unbiased estimates. The proposed method randomly
   selects an adult conditional on the number of adults in the household.
   The method was applied in a national sample in Qatar and it proved it
   was effective in a country where large household sizes are common and
   the information required for other sampling methods is generally not
   known.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes and tests a mechanism through which natural
   resources can affect democracy. I posit that, in the presence of high
   natural resource rents, leaders lower the burden of taxation on citizens
   in order to reduce the demand for democratic accountability. The theory
   is corroborated using micro-level data from public opinion surveys
   across 15 sub-Saharan countries, in addition to country-level data on
   natural resource rents. Results are robust to a range of alternative
   specifications. A supplementary analysis reveals that, consistent with
   the two-period model proposed, the effects are more acute closer to
   national elections.},

Abstract = {The prediction that economic freedom is beneficial in reducing
   corruption has not been found to be universally robust in empirical
   studies. The present work reviews this relationship by using firms' data
   in a cross-country survey and argues that approaches using aggregated
   macro data have not been able to explain it appropriately. We model
   cross-country variations of the microfounded economic freedom-corruption
   relationship using multilevel models. Additionally, we analyse this
   relationship by disentangling the determinants for several components of
   economic freedom because not all areas affect corruption equally. The
   results show that the extent of the macro-effects on the measures of
   (micro)economic freedom for corruption, identified by the degree of
   economic development of a country, can explain why a lack of competition
   policies and government regulations may yield more corruption.
   Estimations for Africa and transition economy subsamples confirm our
   conjectures. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {For `emotional fieldwork' in critical geopolitical research on violence
   and terrorism},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {33},
Pages = {31-41},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In recent years, there have been exhortations for scholars working in
   the area of critical geopolitics to be more committed in initiating
   `primary fieldwork'. These appeals are predicated on the belief that the
   subdiscipline's apparent over-reliance on secondary (re)sources neglect
   the ways in which political processes and dynamics `play out' on the
   ground. Not denying the validity of such observations, I further argue
   that critical geopolitics needs to take into account the fieldwork
   process which can arguably shape the progression and outcomes of
   research. Drawing on my `field' research on violence and terrorism in
   the Philippines, I propose that thinking critically about how emotions
   are intertwined in the conduct of fieldwork can provide a pathway to
   appreciate the unpredictable nature of the research process and the
   wider contexts/agencies that shape research outcomes and knowledges
   produced. Crucially, the witnessing of violence/terror is emotionally
   demanding, often bequeathing the researcher with fully embodied
   experiences of the `real' situation on the ground. It opens up the
   researcher to different emotional engagements and connections with
   his/her respondents, which in turn allows for critical reassessments of
   issues pertaining to danger, ethics and responsibility. In this sense,
   `emotional fieldwork', as I term it, has much to offer to critical
   geopolitics if incorporated as part of the subdiscipline's
   methodological consciousness. It not only provides researchers with
   useful navigational guidelines to traverse the tricky research terrains
   of working in `dangerous', conflict-plagued regions but it also provides
   the basis for weaving more accurate and situated narratives that
   complements and advances deconstructivist critiques of dominant
   geopolitical discourses in and around certain locales. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {Public deliberation has been defended as a rational and noncoercive way
   to overcome paradoxical results from democratic voting, by promoting
   consensus on the available alternatives on the political agenda. Some
   critics have argued that full consensus is too demanding and inimical to
   pluralism and have pointed out that single-peakedness, a much less
   stringent condition, is sufficient to overcome voting paradoxes.
   According to these accounts, deliberation can induce single-peakedness
   through the creation of a `meta-agreement', that is, agreement on the
   dimension according to which the issues at stake are `conceptualized'.
   We argue here that once all the conditions needed for deliberation to
   bring about single-peakedness through meta-agreement are unpacked and
   made explicit, meta-agreement turns out to be a highly demanding
   condition, and one that is very inhospitable to pluralism.},

Abstract = {We document two stylized facts of US short-term and long-term interest
   rate data seemingly incompatible with the expectations hypothesis: low
   contemporaneous cross-correlation and relatively slow adjustment to
   long-run relationships. We explain these features in a small structural
   model with three types of randomness: While a persistent monetary policy
   shock implies immediate identical reactions through the term structure,
   both a transitory policy shock and an autocorrelated risk premium allow
   for sustained deviations. Indeed, we find important impacts and
   persistence of risk premia and considerable contribution of transitory
   policy shocks to short rates. Results of standard expectations
   hypothesis tests can be rationalized.},

Abstract = {Copyright, as currently understood, is justified by the belief that the
   protection it grants to creators incentivizes the continued creation of
   works deemed culturally beneficial to society. However, its use can be
   less altruistic, as a means of suppressing embarrassing or controversial
   information. The ability to disseminate sensitive material quickly
   through the Internet concerns both state and non-state actors, and there
   are indications that, through the use of private intermediaries,
   copyright can be used to suppress speech. This article seeks to explain
   how the current neoliberal system of governance blurs the line between
   public and private actors, creating a diffused and decentralized system
   of copyright enforcement that allows for the suppression of speech in a
   way that avoids discussion of censorship.},

Abstract = {From 1919 to 1929, the great Hungarian Marxist philosopher Georg Lukacs
   was one of the leaders of the Hungarian Communist Party, immersed not
   simply in theorising but also in significant practical-political work.
   Along with labour leader Jeno Landler, he led a faction opposing an
   ultra-left sectarian orientation represented by Bela Kun (at that time
   also associated with Comintern chairman Zinoviev, later aligning himself
   with Stalin).
   If seen in connection with this factional struggle, key works of Lukacs
   in this period - History and Class Consciousness (1923), Lenin:A Study
   in the Unity of His Thought (1924), Tailism and the Dialectic (1926) and
   `The Blum Theses' (1929) - can be seen as forming a consistent,
   coherent, sophisticated variant of Leninism. Influential readings of
   these works interpret them as being ultra-leftist or proto-Stalinist
   (or, in the case of `The Blum Theses', an anticipation of the Popular
   Front perspectives adopted by the Communist International in 1935). Such
   readings distort the reality. Lukacs's orientation and outlook of 1923-9
   are, rather, more consistent with the orientation advanced by Lenin and
   Trotsky in the Third and Fourth Congresses of the Communist
   International.
   After his decisive political defeat, Lukacs concluded that it was
   necessary to renounce his distinctive political orientation, and
   completely abandon the terrain of practical revolutionary politics, if
   he hoped to remain inside the Communist movement. This he did, adapting
   to Stalinism and shifting his efforts to literary criticism and
   philosophy. But the theorisations connected to his revolutionary
   politics of the 1920s continue to have relevance for revolutionary
   activists of the twenty-first century.},

Abstract = {Social media in its various forms drew international attention to
   Zimbabwe during the most intense period of the Zimbabwe crisis up to
   2008. It is arguable that social media activism was contributory to the
   current dispensation of Government of National Unity between ZANU PF and
   the former opposition Movement for Democratic Change. Social media
   induced revolution and mass rejection of the status quo of the magnitude
   seen in the Arab Spring might be difficult to replicate in Zimbabwe. A
   similar revolution with different magnitude but critical results unfolds
   in Zimbabwe, especially since the disputed 2008 presidential elections
   and the mayhem that followed. The use of new communication technologies
   helped publicize extra-legal activities and human rights abuses often
   blamed on ZANU PF affiliated militia groups and the security forces.
   International attention has led to diplomatic intervention.},

Abstract = {This paper focuses on the Finnish Border Guard, a professional law
   enforcement authority responsible for the control and surveillance of
   the Finnish and Schengen borders, and its performances of border
   security. Performativity approach means that the analysis of the
   material, consisting of the bulletins and reports that have been
   published by the Border Guard service, is not merely focused on the
   representation of borders but the bulletins themselves are understood as
   performances of border security. The paper argues that new technological
   innovations, together with new legislation and institutional procedures,
   now steering the governance of the Finnish/Schengen border, are bound up
   with a new culture of border management in which border security is not
   (just) conceptualised in terms of territorial sovereignty but in terms
   of international cooperation, prevention and economic profitability.},

Abstract = {ObjectiveAlthough prior research has demonstrated the multiple pathways
   through which socioeconomic attainment occurs, one unexplored avenue
   regards the role of psychological mechanisms such as self-esteem in this
   process.
   MethodsUsing three waves of data from the National Survey of Families
   and Households (N = 1,952), we employed structural equation models to
   examine the relationship between parenting practices and attitudes,
   socioeconomic status, offspring's self-esteem, and the likelihood of
   offspring college attendance.
   ResultsSelf-esteem was positively related to the likelihood of
   offspring's college attendance. Additionally, self-esteem was found to
   be a modest mediator of the relationship between parental educational
   expectations and parental income, respectively, and the likelihood of
   offspring completing or being currently enrolled in college.
   ConclusionSelf-esteem may constitute one previously unconsidered
   mechanism for reproducing the class structure in the United States.},

Abstract = {ObjectivesThis study examines the impact of substantive
   representationmeasured by pro-minority policies enacted in the United
   Stateson political participation among Latinos.
   MethodsTo deal with the reverse causality that might flow from political
   participation to substantive representation, this study employs
   instrument variable regression analysis.
   ResultsThe results of the analysis show that Latinos in states with many
   pro-minority policies are more likely to take part in politics.
   ConclusionsThe previous studies on empowerment have mainly focused on
   descriptive representation as the source of empowerment, ignoring
   another dimension of minority representationsubstantive representation.
   This study attempts to add to this literature by considering the effect
   of substantive representation on empowerment. The results indicate that
   Latinos respond to substantive representation in a positive way.},

Abstract = {ObjectivesResearch has shown that government spending can affect GDP
   growth rates, yet there is no comprehensive study that looks at how a
   country's choice of political institutions affects government spending.
   This article focuses on how the choice of regime type (presidential,
   parliamentary, or mixed), legislative chamber structure (bicameral or
   unicameral), legislative chamber size, and electoral rules affect the
   level of government spending.
   MethodsThe methodology used is pooled ordinary least squares for an
   unbalanced panel of 92 democracies between 1975 and 2007.
   ResultsThe results show that the relationship between legislative
   chamber size and government spending is linear in unicameral countries
   but nonlinear in bicameral countries, plurality electoral rule is always
   associated with less spending than any other type of electoral rule, and
   unicameral and bicameral countries should not be modeled together.
   ConclusionsWhile countries that have long-standing political
   institutions are less likely to change the characteristics of those
   political institutions in order to change the level of government
   spending, the results of this article suggest that countries that are
   establishing new political institutions (e.g., South Sudan and Libya)
   stand to benefit from knowing what types of institutions are conducive
   for growth.},

Abstract = {Most modern welfare states offer an extensive array of services and
   benefits that are wholly or partly financed by tax revenue. One missing
   link in explaining the long-run sustainability of such comprehensive
   welfare states could be the already-existing stock of trust. Indeed, our
   cross-country results suggest that trust determines the size of welfare
   states as well as three features that are arguably necessary for their
   preservation: high levels of political confidence, strong legal
   institutions protecting private property rights, and low levels of
   bureaucratic corruption.},

Abstract = {This study builds on research about political humor, press metacoverage,
   and intertextuality to examine the effects of news coverage about
   political satire on audience members. The analysis uses experimental
   data to test whether news coverage of Stephen Colbert's Super PAC
   influenced knowledge and opinion regarding Citizens United, as well as
   political trust and internal political efficacy. It also tests whether
   such effects depended on previous exposure to The Colbert Report
   (Colbert's satirical television show) and traditional news. Results
   indicate that exposure to news coverage of satire can influence
   knowledge, opinion, and political trust. Additionally, regular satire
   viewers may experience stronger effects on opinion, as well as increased
   internal efficacy, when consuming news coverage about issues previously
   highlighted in satire programming.},

Abstract = {Despite the centrality of voting costs to the paradox of voting, little
   effort has been made to measure these costs accurately, outside of a few
   spatially limited case studies. In this paper, we apply Geographic
   Information Systems (GIS) tools to validated national election survey
   data from New Zealand. We calculate distance and travel time by road
   from the place of residence to the nearest polling place and combine our
   time estimate with imputed wages for all sample members. Using this new
   measure of the opportunity cost of voting to predict turnout at the
   individual level, we find that small increases in the opportunity costs
   of time can have large effects in reducing voter turnout.},

Title = {War and the political zeitgeist: Evidence from the history of female
   suffrage},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {31},
Pages = {60-81},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Despite the upheaval associated with warfare, empirical evidence linking
   conflict with institutional development is limited. This paper examines
   the hypothesis that international wars accelerated democratization by
   fostering political inclusion. Employing survival analysis, I find that
   during the 20th century, nations engaging in external conflict were more
   than twice as likely to extend the franchise to women in the
   post-conflict period, even after controlling for other commonly cited
   determinants of suffrage adoption. I explore several potential
   mechanisms for this association and find evidence consistent with
   stories which connect war with increased national unity, ideological
   fervor, and international posturing. Finally, examining conflict-induced
   changes in sex ratios and female labor force participation suggests that
   the underlying determinants of suffrage expansion at the national and
   sub-national level differ. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In the United States, Evangelical Protestants' political attitudes have
   been attributed to their conservative theological beliefs. As this
   religion's membership has increased around the world, other Evangelicals
   would logically be expected to demonstrate a similar conservatism in
   their political views. And yet, this anticipated result does not hold.
   In Brazil, for example, Evangelicals maintain moderate-to-liberal
   attitudes on several issues. To address this anomaly, this article
   relies on the Pew Forum's Multi-Country Religion Survey to examine the
   impact of religion on Evangelicals' ideology as well as attitudes on
   moral and economic issues in the United States and Brazil. While
   doctrinal orthodoxy predicts Evangelicals' moral conservatism, neither
   religious component examined significantly predicts Brazilian
   Evangelicals' ideology or economic attitudes. Significant differences in
   Brazilian and American attitudes on these dimensions in general suggest
   that the political environment plays a much larger role in whether - and
   how - religion influences these political attitudes.},

   of justice on two axioms concerning self-ownership and homesteading,
   which are bolstered by two key arguments: reductio ad absurdum and
   performative contradiction. Each of these arguments is designed to
   demonstrate that libertarianism is the only theory of justice that can
   be justified. If either of these arguments were valid, it would prove
   the libertarian claim that the state is an unjust political arrangement.
   Giving due weight to the importance of the libertarian anarchist claim,
   this article exposes and criticizes the arguments that substantiate it.},

Abstract = {The European Regulation 834/2007, responsible for the definition of the
   European Organic Label since 2009, allows a non-intentional presence of
   authorised GMOs limited to the threshold of 0.9 \% in organic
   production. Such a threshold, when strictly positive, allows organic
   producers to keep the organic label in case of a small GM contamination.
   However, it may bring discredit on the organic agriculture which can no
   more be understood as ``GMO-free{''}. The European Commission in its
   recommendation 2003/556/CE proposes that GM-producers-should bear the
   cost of the measures decided to limit the dissemination of the GM gene
   the so-called ``newcomer principle{''}. European countries are however
   free to adopt such a principle and can proceed differently. This article
   presents an economic analysis of the determination of the optimal GMO
   threshold maximizing society's wellbeing when the newcomer principle is
   implemented and when it is not. This optimal GMO threshold in both cases
   is decided by an impartial regulator facing heterogeneous consumers, and
   is intended to ensure the coexistence between GM and organic
   agricultures, taking into account of the potential discredit it implies
   on organic agriculture and the flexibility it allows for the
   preservation of the organic label. We first establish the conditions for
   coexistence. We then show that the GMO threshold can be different from
   zero if the organic producers bear the cost of the coexistence measures
   and ii) the GMO threshold should be zero under the newcomer principle.},

Title = {Narrating boundaries: Framing and contesting suffering, community, and
   belonging in enclaves along the India-Bangladesh border},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {35},
Pages = {37-46},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This paper explores the politics of community making at the
   India-Bangladesh border by examining the public and private narratives
   of history and belonging in a Bangladeshi enclave-a sovereign piece of
   Bangladesh completely territorially surrounded by India. Drawing on
   framings of political society, this paper argues that understanding
   populations at the margins of South Asia and beyond requires attention
   to two processes: first, to the ways that para-legal activities are part
   and parcel of daily life; and second, to the strategies through which
   these groups construct themselves as moral communities deserving of
   inclusion within the state. Border communities often articulate
   narratives of dispossession, exceptionality, and marginalization to
   researchers and other visitors-narratives that are often
   unproblematically reproduced in academic treatments of the border.
   However, such articulations mask both the complicated histories and
   quotidian realities of border life. This paper views these articulations
   as political projects in and of themselves. By reading the more hidden
   histories of life in this border enclave, this article reconstructs the
   notion of borders as experienced by enclave residents themselves. It
   shows the ways that the politics of the India-Bangladesh border are
   constitutive of (and constituted by) a range of fractures and internal
   boundaries within the enclave. These boundaries are as central to
   forging community-to articulating who belongs and why-as are more public
   narratives that frame enclave residents as victims of confused
   territorial configurations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Financial contributions to the EU budget depend basically on official
   GDP. This means that countries with higher shadow economic activity
   contribute less than they should contribute in a system based on actual
   GDP and therefore could reduce their incentive to fight against such
   activities. In this paper we investigate if the EU financing system
   really has an influence on the intensity with which governments in EU
   member states fight against shadow economic activity. We find that the
   EU net contributors significantly fight more intensively against shadow
   economic activity while EU net receivers fight less. As a result, shadow
   economic activity is higher in net receiver and lower in net contributor
   countries than it were in comparison with a scenario of nationally
   balanced EU funding. Quantitatively and averaged over the time period
   2001-2007, the diagnosed effect amounts to a stimulation of hidden
   economic activity by almost 10\% for particular economies.},

Abstract = {The Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA) was intended to create more
   consistency in election administration, but the United States still has
   a highly decentralized system. Almost 8,000 local jurisdictions have
   primary responsibility for administering elections, with significant
   discretion in how they conduct them, and there is a dramatic skew in the
   size of these jurisdictions. A very small number of heavily populated
   local jurisdictions serve the vast majority of voters while a large
   number of lightly populated jurisdictions serve the rest of the
   electorate. The interaction of local discretion and size disparities
   leads to very different experiences for election officials and voters in
   large versus small jurisdictions. Election administrators in large
   jurisdictions encounter the most difficult problems in conducting
   elections and in large jurisdictions the need for innovation is acute.
   At the same time, there is little push for election modernization due to
   the size disparity, which we discuss in detail. HAVA has not changed
   this fundamental dynamic, and policy makers and researchers should take
   size into account when examining the performance of elections and when
   considering ways to make elections operate more effectively.},

Abstract = {Australia's main parties have experienced rapid deterioration in levels
   of membership but most have been reluctant to follow the lead of many of
   their counterparts in Western Europe and embrace more radical, inclusive
   pre-selection formats to arrest declining numbers. This paper offers a
   partial explanation of why the Liberal and Labor parties have been
   disinclined to look to reforming candidate selection as a strategy to
   combat their shrinking rank-and-file membership. It argues that
   compulsory voting in conjunction with high levels of party
   identification has reduced the imperative for Australia's major parties
   to resort to candidate selection reform as a device to stabilise their
   voter base. This study underscores the important role of the
   institutional setting in affecting the incentives for parties to use
   pre-selection reform to combat a shrinking membership base.},

Abstract = {The annual United Nations (UN) Framework Convention on Climate Change
   conferences provides a transnational mediation opportunity structure for
   activist networks to contest policies that favor market-based models for
   solving the climate crisis. Online technologies, including commercial
   social media, have arguably increased possibilities for being involved
   in protests on a transnational level. However, this article shows how
   online modes of action privilege lobbying tactics over civil
   disobedience tactics, arguing that the former is often incommensurate
   with an anticapitalist climate approach to climate change activism. This
   impedes possibilities for using online media to protest at the radical
   end of the climate justice movement spectrum. This article explores this
   interrelationship between activist demands and (online) modes of action
   through a focus on the mobilization efforts of London-based activists
   for the 17th UN climate conference in 2011.},

Abstract = {The rejection of the `dialectics of nature' has long been thought of as
   the most fundamental factor distinguishing Western Marxism from official
   Soviet-style Marxism. Yet, in Tailism and the Dialectic, Georg Lukacs -
   perhaps the most influential figure in Western Marxism strongly endorses
   the existence of an objective dialectic in nature. A close examination
   of Lukacs's main writings on science shows, however, that he still in
   effect denied the possibility of applying dialectical method to nature.
   This paradox is bound up with a dualistic conception of natural and
   social science with distinctly adverse implications for the development
   of an ecological Marxism.},

Abstract = {The paper analyzes the impact of natural resource abundance on selected
   governance indicators. We use a panel data set with observations on a
   large number of countries over an extended period of time and employ an
   instrumental variable technique to account for endogeneity. The results
   show that exports of natural resources have, above all, led to an
   increase in corruption. This result is robust to both different model
   specifications and an alternative indicator for natural resource
   abundance. For other governance indicators, such as law and order and
   bureaucratic quality, we either find no results or results that lack
   robustness.},

Abstract = {This article examines how music functions as a vehicle by which people
   may place themselves in social movements. Centering questions of
   culture, the article describes how an environmentalist group based in
   the northeastern USA used music to: (1) assert a collective identity;
   (2) project a past, present and future; and (3) forge relationships
   among group members and between group members and the general public.
   Against this background, the article considers how a young activist used
   music to take on and adapt a movement identity and position himself
   within the movement's traditions and social relations. In a discourse
   analysis of a song this young activist composed and performed at the
   group's summer music festival, the article shows how he adapted a range
   of cultural resources to reimagine and place himself within the group's
   relations of time and social space.},

Abstract = {The essay studies the introduction and use of audio-visual media in
   contemporary Swedish courtroom praxis and how this affects social
   interaction and the constitution of judicial space. The background to
   the study is the increasing use of video technology in law courts during
   the last decennium, and in particular the reformed trial code regulating
   court proceedings introduced in Sweden in 2008. The reform is called A
   Modern Trial (En modernare rattegang, Proposition 2004/05:131). An
   important innovation is that testimonies in lower level court
   proceedings now are video recorded and, in case of an appeal trial, then
   are screened in the appellate court. The study of social interaction and
   the constitution of judicial space in the essay is based in part on an
   ethnographic study of the Stockholm appellate court (Svea hovratt)
   conducted in the fall 2010; in part on a study of the preparatory works
   to the legal reform; and in part on research on how media technology
   affects social interaction and the constitution of space and place.},

   of liberal democratic nuclear deterrence in the post-Cold War era as
   found in The Law of Peoples. Rawls's justification overlooked how
   nuclear-armed liberal democracies are ensnared in two intransigent
   ethical dilemmas: one in which the mandate to secure liberal
   constitutionalism requires both the preservation and violation of
   important constitutional provisions in domestic affairs, and the other
   in which this same mandate requires both the preservation and violation
   of the liberal commitment to international legal arrangements and to the
   rule of law generally. On this view, the choice to violate
   constitutional provisions and international legal arrangements is
   evidence of nuclear despotism. Moreover, this choice does not imply that
   the ethical foreign policy dilemmas were resolved. Instead, it implies
   that the dilemmas force liberal democratic governments into implementing
   ethically paradoxical policy outcomes.},

Abstract = {Following on from the historiographical reappraisal in the previous
   chapter, the discussion here is focused upon Pound's propaganda themes
   and strategies - some of which were clearly inspired and refined by his
   reading of Hitler's Mein Kampf in 1942. By considering key documents in
   Pound's FBI files and neglected manuscripts at Yale's Beinecke archives,
   this chapter suggests that Pound was far more influential, and far more
   respected, as an Axis propagandist than has been previously argued.
   Derivatively, his ideological views, in both EIAR broadcasts and less
   frequent journalism, are in close keeping with the views of key
   functionaries no less than the wider Axis trajectory during World War II
   - from declarations of a `new order' in Europe to calls for vengeance
   against `traitors' and `Jews' by the time of Mussolini's 1943 arrest and
   Pound's contemporaneous indictment for treason by US authorities.},

Journal = {SOCIAL MOVEMENT STUDIES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {12},
Number = {3},
Pages = {264-279},
Abstract = {This article examines the explanatory capacity of Pierre Bourdieu's work
   in relation to social movements and, in particular, identity movements.
   It aims to provide a theoretical framework drawing on Bourdieu's central
   concepts of field, capital and habitus. These concepts are viewed as
   providing a theoretical toolkit that can be applied to convincingly
   explain aspects of social movements that social movement theories, such
   as political process theory, resource mobilization theory and framing,
   acknowledge, but are not able to explain within a single theoretical
   framework. Identity movements are approached here in a way that relates
   them to the position agents/movements occupy in social spaces, resources
   and cultural competence. This enables us to consider identity movements
   from a new perspective that explains, for instance, the interrelatedness
   of class and identity movements.},

Title = {AFTER A ROMANTIC ASPIRATION TO SOCIETY: HARNESSING THE REGULATORY
   CAPACITY OF A SOCIAL SPHERE},
Booktitle = {FROM ECONOMY TO SOCIETY?: PERSPECTIVES ON TRANSNATIONAL RISK REGULATION},
Series = {Studies in Law Politics and Society},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {62},
Pages = {1-21},
Abstract = {This introduction unpacks the key question that informs the articles in
   this special issue. How does a social sphere inform regulation and, more
   specifically, how can the regulatory capacity of a social sphere be
   harnessed, as an alternative or significant complementary force to state
   regulation and reliance on the self-regulatory capacity of markets? This
   question is salient and topical also in light of the search for new
   regulatory strategies and perspectives in the aftermath of the 2007
   financial and subsequent EU sovereign debt crises, which have led to a
   major realignment of economy and society in a number of countries.
   This introduction argues that economic sociology is a crucial reference
   point for understanding more about the social practices that constitute
   business behavior. It enables to explore the scope and significance of
   often interlinked social and legal norms for regulating various
   transnational risks that economic activity can give rise to. The
   introduction therefore locates the quest for understanding more about
   the regulatory capacity of a social sphere in debates that draw on Karl
   Polanyi's analysis of the embedding, disembedding, and re-embedding of
   economic activity into social norms.
   The introduction highlights one of the key themes developed in this
   special issue, the idea of society within economy which questions an
   assumed conceptual distinction between economy and society. This
   introduction concludes by specifying how the accounts of risk regulation
   developed in this special issue chart a path that is different from
   recent explorations of the role of a social sphere in regulation, which
   were conducted under the banner of ``the sociological citizen,{''}
   ``regulatory sociability,{''} and ``collaborative governance.{''}},

Abstract = {Linguistic heritage, cultural similarities, and experiences as ethnic
   minorities link Latinos in the United States, but distinctions on
   national origin, nativity, and geographic distribution may yield
   political differences. Previous investigations of Latino heterogeneity
   as a catalyst for unity or division are limited to narrow issue domains
   and the set of elections characterized by within-group diversity. It
   remains unclear whether Latinos will respond cohesively to co-ethnic
   cues in national politics. Using data state-level Web search volumes
   related to Sonia Sotomayor's nomination to the Supreme Court, we assess
   the extent to which Latino national origin within the states corresponds
   to expressed interest in her. We find the relative size of the Puerto
   Rican population predicts interest in Sotomayor's nomination above the
   positive effects predicted by panethnic Latino population. The results
   indicate heterogeneity in Latino political orientations and
   simultaneously show that differential responses to co-ethnic cues among
   Latinos may be reinforcing rather than oppositional. {[}{[}Supplementary

Journal = {TERRITORY POLITICS GOVERNANCE},

Volume = {1},

Pages = {118-131},
Abstract = {The global diffusion of public policies is never just the conduct of
   rational agents looking for the best solutions that `work', but is
   always embedded in political and institutional interests. Dominant
   models of policy diffusion tend to ignore the role of oligarchic wealth
   in policy diffusion. Oligarchic diffusion's defining feature is lack of
   democratic accountability. Mayor Michael Bloomberg's appropriation of
   the Mexican conditional cash transfer model for ending poverty
   undermined the political accountability of urban policy-making in New
   York City. Some of the prevailing diffusion models elide the
   historically specific political and institutional interests driving the
   diffusion of the neoliberal policy solutions now in global circulation.
   Oligarchic diffusion is a dominant mechanism implicit in the other
   typologies. Fortunately, elite-driven policy diffusion models are not
   the only game in town. More democratic modes of global policy diffusion
   exist and show promise of better things to come.},

Abstract = {This work examines the dynamic relationship among elites, media, and the
   public during authoritarian rule. Using Brazil's military regime
   (1964-85), it investigates whether changing press censorship influenced
   public support for military rule during the period of political
   liberalization. This paper uses the exposure-resistance model of opinion
   formation, in which a person's probability of supporting a position
   depends first on her probability of exposure to and reception of an
   elite cue advocating that position, and secondarily on the probability
   that she resists that position once exposed. Her likelihood of exposure
   to and reception of elite cues increases with her attention to news
   media and the extent of her political awareness; her odds of accepting
   the positions advocated by elites depends on her political ideology and
   her critical capacity to evaluate the content and source of the cue.
   Using three public opinion surveys carried out between 1972 and 1982,
   and an analysis of newspaper content during the dictatorship, this
   research demonstrates that censored media convinced Brazilians to
   support military rule initially, only later during political
   liberalization, to expose them to increasingly critical coverage of the
   regime, convincing many to abandon their support for the regime.},

Abstract = {This article builds on Habermas's hypothesis of a post-secular world
   society and on Voegelin's philosophy of consciousness. It first analyzes
   the genesis of the post-secular hypothesis in the work of Habermas. It
   then looks at the historical roots of the post-secular world society
   since the Axial Age. Finally, it delineates the evolution of religious
   actors in modern societies, at the political and cognitive levels,
   focusing on the European Counter-revolutionaries, the Islamist and
   post-Islamist movements of the Middle East, and the Hindu Nationalists.
   The article concludes that Habermas's hypothesis provides a plausible
   alternative to neo-Schmittian theory of the Clash of Civilizations
   proposed by Huntington.},

Abstract = {ObjectiveWe examine (1) whether black migration trends from the final
   few decades of the 20th century continued during the first decade of the
   21st century, (2) whether the black southern migration stream continues
   to be demographically distinctive, and (3) whether incorporating
   subjective/motivational factors into our models advances our
   understanding of race and interregional migration.
   MethodsUsing data from the 2000 to 2010 Current Population Surveys, we
   employ descriptive and inferential statistics to (1) map recent patterns
   of interregional migration in the United States by race and (2) estimate
   the effects of race, other sociodemographics, and
   subjective/motivational factors on people's propensity to migrate to the
   United States South.
   ResultsWe find that the rate of black migration to the South continues
   to exceed that of whites, and that black migrants differ from their
   white counterparts both demographically and motivationally. We also
   observe selected gender differences within the black southern migration
   stream.
   ConclusionsOur results underscore the need for more research on race,
   gender, and interregional migration in the United States. We suggest
   directions for such work, with particular focus on possibilities for
   further inquiry when 2010 census materials become more widely available.},

Abstract = {Critical Islam is an intellectual orientation that prizes timeliness and
   broad-mindedness and a political sensibility that tends to honor
   majority rule, minority rights, and the good of pluralism. This essay
   considers how an important European Muslim scholar, Tariq Ramadan,
   promotes critical Islam in his call for a moratorium on stoning, his
   argument for the reformation of fatwa committees, and his analysis of
   the Arab Awakening. The essay argues that the art of controversy and the
   building of civil societymore so than political revolutioncan cultivate
   a critical sensibility among Muslim scholars and publics.},

Abstract = {This study, using survey data (N = 529), examined perceived immigration
   ``threat,{''} subjective knowledge, support for punitive and
   assimilative immigration policies, and opinions about media coverage
   effects. Perceived threat was not related to a third-person effect;
   however, perceived threat of immigrants was related to support for
   punitive immigration policies, and a strong ``hostile media
   perception{''} was confirmed. There was a significant belief among
   respondents that others would view immigration negatively, if only media
   were not biased in favor of immigration. Internet use, age, race, and
   education predicted threat perception; perceived threat, perceived
   favorableness of coverage, and daily newspaper reading predicted
   presumed influence of news coverage.},

Abstract = {Estimating the impact of turnout on House election results is
   problematic because of endogeneity and omitted variable bias. The
   following study proposes an instrumental approach to correct for these
   problems by using a series of fixed effects two-stage least squares
   panel-data regression models covering three congressional apportionment
   cycles (1972-1980; 1982-1990; 1992-2000). The analysis tests whether
   voter participation decreases the House incumbent's electoral support,
   regardless of the level of competition in the district. The study also
   aims to determine if an increase in participation benefits Democratic
   candidates and whether this effect is constant across apportionment
   cycles. The results show that the influence of turnout on incumbency
   vote share is conditional on the level of presidential support in the
   district. This finding is explained by the surge and decline thesis of

   analysis},

Abstract = {This paper extends the empirical literature about the effects of fiscal
   decentralization on the growth of government along three dimensions. It
   distinguishes between the effects of the level of decentralization from
   the way local governments finance their expenditures (common pool versus
   own resources); it uses a panel cointegration approach to separate the
   long run effects of decentralization from the short run dynamics; and it
   extends and revises the datasets generally used in these empirical
   analyses. The results show that the amount of revenue raised by
   sub-national governments leads to a long-term fall in the size of
   government but grants have the opposite effect. In addition, a greater
   decentralization of expenditure leads to greater overall spending. When
   the short-term is considered these influences work slowly, as the speed
   of adjustment towards the desired government size is relatively
   sluggish. In addition, in the short run, there is also a clear effect
   from the role of local revenue raising powers that stimulates the growth
   of government. These results appear robust to changes in the composition
   of the variables, countries and periods included the sample.},

Title = {Religiosity-of-Interviewer Effects: Assessing the Impact of Veiled
   Enumerators on Survey Response in Egypt},

Abstract = {While public opinion research has expanded rapidly in the Islamic world
   since 2001, little scholarly work has examined interviewer effects
   related to an enumerator's religious adherence. We find that the
   perceived religiosity of an interviewer impacts respondents' expressions
   of personal piety and adherence to Islamic cultural norms in a sample of
   approximately 1,200 women in Greater Cairo. Muslim women indicate that
   they are more religious and adherent to Islamic cultural norms when
   interviewed by an enumerator donning the Islamic headscarf. Conversely,
   members of Egypt's minority Coptic Christian community report that they
   are less adherent to Christianity when interviewed by a veiled
   enumerator. Through psychological processes of strategic
   self-presentation of identity and impression management, the veil may
   trigger Muslim respondents to express what they perceive to be socially
   desirable (i.e., more devout) responses; in contemporary Egypt, being
   perceived as pious may elicit social and economic benefits. Christians
   appear to deemphasize their religious identity to avoid appearing at
   odds with the dominant, Muslim majority to which the enumerator appears
   to belong. Younger, poorer and less educated women - who may be most
   susceptible to concerns about social desirability - show the largest
   effects.},

Abstract = {The effects of religious belief and religious social behavior on support
   for democracy are investigated in a priming experiment conducted among
   Turkish Muslims and Israeli Jews. By varying the question order of World
   Values Survey (WVS) items, which measure religious belief and religious
   social behavior, it was demonstrated that priming religious social
   behavior facilitates, while priming religious belief impedes, support
   for democracy, compared with a control group of no prime. These results
   were independent of participants' intensity of religious belief or the
   frequency of their religious social behavior and held for the most part
   across both religious affiliations and political contexts.},

Abstract = {This article proposes an alternative research design using geographic
   discontinuity to assess the performance of voting systems, focusing on
   InkaVote, a voting system employed in Los Angeles County, California. It
   also demonstrates how a geographic information system (GIS) can be
   integrated with statistical analyses to improve causal inference. With
   this new methodology, the article compares the performance of the
   InkaVote system in the 2004 and 2006 elections and examines whether the
   introduction of a paper ballot reader (PBR) in 2006 improved the
   performance of the system. The findings show that the PBR implementation
   was effective, as it reduced the residual vote rate by about one
   percentage point.},

Abstract = {State religions form one of the main features of the international
   political landscape, but scholarly research into their dynamics and
   effects remains limited. This article aims to address this deficiency
   through a comparative examination of state religions and levels of
   political and religious freedom. The findings show that countries with a
   state religion have substantially lower levels of freedom across a range
   of measurements than countries with no state religion. The absence of
   any clear correlation to levels of human development, religious
   diversity and religiosity indicates a key causal role for the
   institutional mechanics of state religion itself.},

Abstract = {This paper studies the determinants of scientific productivity from an
   original database of French academic economists observed in 2009 and
   2010. All these individuals were involved in the first and second
   experiences of an academic competition, the ``Prime excellence
   Scientifique{''}. This tournament was introduced by the French academic
   system to select best publishers. For this competition, the scientific
   productivity was observed in a same period from 2005 to 2010 and
   competitors are selected and ranked by their relative performance in
   publications using the same criteria (National Scientific Research
   Center ranking). We construct a scientific production index and estimate
   productivity regressions using quantile regression. We control for
   individual characteristics, environmental context, initial publication
   performance (h index), in line with stylized facts and theoretical
   foundations like Lotka law and scientific life cycle productivity. The
   paper brings two novel dimensions in the literature. The first is done
   by controlling for the multi-task activities of tenure and associated
   professor when evaluating their scientific production. The second
   outcome of the paper consists to evaluate the impact of network
   spillover externalities induced by local competences accumulated in
   economics departments on each individual performance.},

Abstract = {The irruption of social media in the political sphere is generating
   repositories of ``Big Data,{''} which can be mined to gain insights into
   communication dynamics. The research reported here relies on a large
   data set from Twitter to examine the activity, emotional content, and
   interactions of political parties and politicians during the campaign
   for the Spanish national elections in November 2011. The aim of this
   study is to investigate the adaptation of political parties to this new
   communication and organizational paradigm originating in the evolution
   of the Internet and online social networks. We analyze the reply and
   retweet networks of seven political parties with significant offline
   differences to assess their conversation and information diffusion
   patterns. We observe that political parties, and especially the major
   traditional parties, still tend to use Twitter just as a one-way flow
   communication tool. Moreover, we find evidence of a balkanization trend
   in the Spanish online political sphere, as observed in previous research
   for other countries.},

Abstract = {We analyze the implications of the governance structure in academic
   faculties for their recruitment decisions when competing for new
   researchers. The value to individual members through social interaction
   within the faculty depends on the average status of their fellow
   members. In recruitment decisions, incumbent members trade off the
   effect of entry on average faculty status against alternative uses of
   the recruitment budget if no entry takes place. We show that the best
   candidates join the best faculties but that they receive lower wages
   than some lesser ranking candidates. We also study the allocation of
   surplus created by the entry of a new faculty member and show that
   faculties with symmetric status distributions maximize their joint
   surplus under majority voting.},

Abstract = {Objectives This study investigates the effect of Hurricane Katrina on
   adolescent feelings of social isolation. Much anecdotal evidence
   suggests that individuals who continued to reside in New Orleans after
   Hurricane Katrina struck felt isolated from the rest of the country.
   Based on Durkheim's concept of anomie, we suggest that adolescents in
   New Orleans (and the Gulf region) may experience social isolation as a
   result of the hurricane. Methods We test this hypothesis with data from
   the Adolescent Substance Abuse Prevention Study, a multisite
   longitudinal study of adolescents in six cities around the United
   States. Results We find that students in New Orleans are no different
   from students in the other five cities in their level of social
   isolation prior to the hurricane. In contrast, our posthurricane survey
   reveals significant differences between New Orleans (and Gulf region)
   students and students in the other five (comparison) cities in social
   isolation. Conclusions Our findings lend contemporary support to the
   concept of anomie and suggest the importance of mental health
   interventions for adolescents immediately following a natural disaster.},

Abstract = {Individuals save for their old days, but not all of them enjoy the old
   age. This paper characterizes the optimal capital accumulation in a
   two-period OLG model where lifetime is risky and varies across
   individuals. We compare two long-run social optima: (1) the average
   utilitarian optimum, where steady-state average welfare is maximized;
   (2) the egalitarian optimum, where the welfare of the worst-off at the
   steady-state is maximized. It is shown that, under plausible conditions,
   the egalitarian optimum involves a higher capital and a lower fertility
   than the utilitarian optimum. Those inequalities hold also in a
   second-best framework where survival conditions are exogenously linked
   to the capital level.},

Abstract = {To better understand the way social networks operate in the labor
   market, we propose two simple models where individuals help each other
   finding a job. In the first one, job information flows between
   individuals having a link with each other and we show that an
   equilibrium with a clustering of workers with the same status is likely
   to emerge since, in the long run, employed workers tend to be friends
   with employed workers. In the second model, individuals interact with
   both strong and weak ties and decide how much time they spend with each
   of them. As in Granovetter, this model stresses the strength of weak
   ties in finding a job because they involve a secondary ring of
   acquaintances who have contacts with networks outside ego's network and
   therefore offer new sources of information on job opportunities. We then
   discuss some policy implications showing how these models can explain
   why ethnic minorities tend to experience higher unemployment rate than
   workers from the majority group.},

Abstract = {The proportion of votes cast before election day has risen steadily over
   the last two decades. Previous research asked how early voting has
   impacted voter participation. In this article, we ask how early voting
   has affected the flow of information to voters through the mass media.
   By increasing the number of days voters are able to vote, are we also
   increasing the number of days that candidates and campaigns continuously
   disseminate campaign-related information to the news media? Is news
   coverage of campaigns quantitatively and qualitatively different when
   opportunities to vote early are available and utilized? Our expectation
   is that early voting significantly influences the volume and nature of
   campaign news coverage. We study the effects of early voting on campaign
   news coverage of gubernatorial and Senate races in 2006 and 2008. Our
   findings reveal that the volume and content of campaign news coverage is
   significantly influenced by early voting. {[}Supplementary material is

Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to empirically determine the effects of
   political instability on economic growth. By using the system-GMM
   estimator for linear dynamic panel data models on a sample covering up
   to 169 countries, and 5-year periods from 1960 to 2004, we find that
   higher degrees of political instability are associated with lower growth
   rates of GDP per capita. Regarding the channels of transmission, we find
   that political instability adversely affects growth by lowering the
   rates of productivity growth and, to a smaller degree, physical and
   human capital accumulation. Finally, economic freedom and ethnic
   homogeneity are beneficial to growth, while democracy may have a small
   negative effect. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This article argues that the economic, political, and cultural spheres
   of society are not separate but rather mutually embedded in one another.
   The market is not just an economic phenomenon, but a political and
   cultural one as well. Markets, in this reframing, include not just the
   convenient fiction of atomized buyers and sellers but trade and
   professional associations and a field of public actors including
   assorted regulators and courts. It is the interaction of these parties
   that creates a market culture. These cultures exhibit contradictory
   tendencies that are generated by exchange relations and resolved by
   power dynamics. The contradictory tendencies reflect the tension between
   accumulative and regulative norms in market cultures. These include
   opportunism versus restraint, innovation versus standard practice, and
   growth versus stability. The resolution of the cultural contradictions
   of markets is not a natural tendency toward equilibrium, but rather an
   ideal of public policy to be attained by countervailing power in
   effective legal and regulatory institutions.},

Abstract = {The United Nations and its specialized agencies have formulated and
   transferred communication policies to Africa since the late 1950s. These
   United Nations policies emphasized the roles of the mass media as
   catalysts for development. The advent of the Internet led to a transfer
   of these policies from real space to cyberspace. At the turn of the 21st
   century, the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) emphasized
   reduction of the digital divide between Africa and the rest of the
   world, and encouraged Internet connectivity as the panacea for the
   continent's development problems. With the development of
   telecommunications and broadband infrastructures in Africa, information
   and communication technology policies need to go beyond infrastructural
   development and connectivity. Technology literacy, production of online
   content in African languages, communication as a human right, freedom of
   expression, and respect for individual privacy need to be emphasized as
   part of policy transfer initiatives.},

Abstract = {Technology has proven Thomas Malthus wrong in the short run, and food
   production has grown geometrically. But our growth in agricultural
   productivity may be reaching a limit, and the lure of overconsumption
   may create widening famine by unchecked greed. ! e true value of our
   theologians has been forgotten, replaced by consumerism, misplacing
   value on acquisition. Globalism takes on the visage of a bandit economy,
   where the only way the poor can escape is by emigration, or by
   rebellion. As the creed of consumerism spreads to newly wealthy lands,
   the poverty of the exploited lands increases. Further, the disappearance
   of the Cold War reduces the political value of these countries for the
   west, so that all that is left is their economic value.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY \& POLITICS},

Pages = {223-240},
Abstract = {This article investigates the use of social media by the 53 candidates
   for governor at the last Italian regional elections in April 2010 and
   further explores the two hypotheses on the role of online technologies
   for political parties-the ``politics as usual{''} and the
   ``equalization{''} hypotheses-which begin from two different points of
   view: first, regional elections, and second, the candidate's
   appropriation, negotiation, or resistance to the convergence and
   participatory culture distinctive of the contemporary media ecology. The
   aim of this article is to address the following research questions: (a)
   Which are the different degrees of appropriation of convergence and
   participatory culture among Italian candidates during the 2010 regional
   elections according to political parties' dimension in terms of members,
   voters and resources?; and (b) Are different degrees of appropriation of
   convergence and participatory culture positively associated with
   political parties dimensions?},

Series = {Palgrave Pivot},

Pages = {12-38},
Abstract = {Chapter 2 starts with a summative view of the central tenets in
   conceptual metaphor theory and its further developments and lays the
   foundation for the analytical framework of the research. It is advocated
   a combination of critical discourse analysis, argumentation theory, and
   cognitive semantics (conceptual metaphor theory) to account for the
   production and reconstruction of meaning in political discourse.
   Insights into transpersonal psychology (Maslow, 1954/1970), social
   sciences (van Dijk's theory of `contextual models' (2008)), and
   neuroscience (Lakoff, 2009) provide further evidence to support metaphor
   embedding in argumentation and the construction of argumentative
   patterns.
   The mental permeability of political discourse stems from its capacity
   to fit frames, moral frames (Lakoff, 2009: 68), and thereby to narrow or
   to enlarge the mental void engendered by people's needs and
   frustrations. People act according to the category of needs they pursue;
   thus, Maslow's needs hierarchy contributes a focus to the value premises
   of a practical argument.},

Abstract = {Evidence of an actual or perceived gap in ideological beliefs between
   civilian and military communities informs current debates on the
   military and its relationship to broader society. The authors examine
   one cohort of the military and its members' perception of their own
   ideology in relation to their civilian counterparts using a 2009 survey
   of cadets at the United States Military Academy. The authors ascertain
   cadet perceptions of (1) cadet ideological leanings on individual and
   aggregate levels, (2) the ideological leanings of the civilian
   population, and (3) the civilian population's assessment of the
   military's ideological leanings. The authors attempt to discern whether
   or not this military subpopulation perceives itself as different from
   the rest of society. The authors find that while members of the Army's
   future officer corps perceive themselves as more conservative than their
   civilian peers and society writ large, as a group they hold rather
   moderate political views.},

   South Africa},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {32},
Pages = {32-41},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Countries emerging from societal conflicts and division engage in
   simultaneous processes of citizenship and nation formation. Citizenship
   education programmes have become a pillar in these efforts, as youth are
   imagined as being amenable to new ideas and may not be deeply scarred by
   past division and conflict. In many countries, international
   organisations, charitable foundations, and consultants work with
   governments to imagine a shared future for the country based on human
   rights and economic development, such that citizens will be
   selfsufficient and not place demands on the state. Yet these efforts do
   not necessarily address the causes of conflict or its lingering effects.
   The interaction between these general efforts and the specific histories
   of countries means that contradictions and tensions become part of the
   fabric of citizenship and nation. Using interviews, analysis of policy
   documents and participant observation, this paper examines efforts in
   South Africa to imagine a new future for the nation, and in which a new
   education system accessible to all youth instils values associated with
   cosmopolitanism, self-sufficiency and responsibility, but often avoids
   direct confrontation with the past. We argue that the education system
   helps, perhaps, to heal some wounds of apartheid, but in no small
   measure by ignoring them. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The paper aims to show a comprehensive insight into the history of
   business economics science in the-Czech-Republic, marginally also on-the
   European continent and worldwide. It depicts-business economics in its
   beginning as a doctrine that was largely underestimated. This science
   was, for a very long time, a part of economics (national/public); only
   slowly has it gradually become an autonomous branch of science. This
   article shows historical attitudes to the theory of business in Bohemia
   as well as abroad since the end of the nineteenth century up to this
   day. It describes the period of statism in Bohemia within the context of
   business economics, it focuses on fundamentals of this science and
   depicts consecutively aspects from which the theory of business
   economics as a science arises in the transition period to free market
   economy. The paper discusses the future of business economics as a
   science that, considering current economic conditions worldwide, has a
   huge potential to grow. The article contributes to the worldwide
   discussion about its further development.},

Abstract = {Based on focus groups and in-depth interviews with young leftist
   political party activists in Uruguay, this article analyzes the dilemmas
   faced by young people as they use images from the past to interpret and
   orient their situation in the present and their aspirations for the
   future. They are the heirs to a highly romantic image of what it means
   to be a political activist on the Left; in this sense, the shadow of the
   radical Sixties and the omnipresent image of armed struggle and military
   dictatorship define them. But the reality of politics in contemporary
   democratic Uruguay is that of pressing for incremental and routine
   social reform inside a `Broad Front' where ideological definitions for
   the future have become hazy. This paper explores the various ways that
   young Uruguayan Leftists work to reconcile these different senses of
   time and how these mediate their relationships with `significant
   generational others'. In so doing, I place the concept of time, of the
   perceived and socially constructed sense of acting in the current of a
   particular historical time, at the center of analysis.},

Title = {Voter preferences, direct democracy and government spending},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},

Volume = {32},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This article uses unique voting data on 331 federal propositions to
   estimate voter preferences in Swiss cantons. We document that
   preferences vary systematically with cantonal characteristics. In
   particular, cantons whose voters are more conservative, less in favor of
   redistribution and less supportive of public spending tend to have
   stronger direct democracy. We show that voter preferences have a stable
   and sizable effect on government spending even conditional on many
   observable cantonal characteristics. We then revisit the relationship
   between direct democracy and public spending. Once we fully control for
   voter preferences, the cross-sectional correlation between direct
   democracy and government spending declines by roughly 20\%. The results
   in this article provide empirical support for models, in which both
   voter preferences and direct democratic institutions are important
   determinants of the size of government. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

   Deliberation in Australia},

Abstract = {This article examines the feasibility of popular deliberation in
   relation to proposals for modest constitutional amendment. Much of the
   literature on deliberation and constitutional referendums focuses on
   major constitutional reform issues which, by their nature, raise broad
   questions about democracy or national identity which are likely to have
   popular appeal. Examples include proposals for electoral reform and the
   Australian republic debate. In Australia, however, it is often the case
   that referendums will be held on matters that are relatively narrow and
   technical, often concerning the machinery of government. The proposal to
   give financial recognition to local government, widely discussed during
   the 2010-13 federal parliamentary term, falls into this category. This
   article argues that proposals for modest constitutional amendment pose
   particular challenges for proponents of citizen participation and
   deliberation. It contends that they attract little public interest,
   which in turn discourages governments and media organizations from
   devoting resources to initiatives and coverage that might support public
   awareness, learning, and participation. The article also argues that
   modest reforms will often not be suitable as subjects of a deliberative
   micro-forum. The article then considers the implications of this
   analysis for the design of referendum process in Australia, and argues
   that a robust legal and institutional framework is essential to
   fostering deliberative ideals with respect to modest amendments.},

Abstract = {Corruption is harmful for public finances and appears closely related to
   fiscal deficits. We open a new avenue in addressing the effects of
   corruption on public deficits through fiscal decentralization. For a
   sample of 31 OECD countries over the period 1986-2010, we find that
   fiscal decentralization contributes to mitigating the adverse effects of
   corruption on public deficits. In addition, our findings indicate
   diversity in the effects of fiscal decentralization, in that it appears
   related to lower deficits in countries with higher levels of corruption
   but not in less corrupt countries. Our results suggest that bringing the
   government closer to the people through fiscal decentralization in
   relatively corrupt countries leads to more responsible fiscal
   management. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {We investigate whether the impact of institutions depends not just on
   their current state but also on how they came to be. In particular, we
   hypothesize that while economic freedom that emerges spontaneously may
   be growth promoting, economic freedom that emerges as a result of costly
   lobbying efforts may be less fruitful. In an extreme case, costly
   lobbying efforts may even negate the growth-enhancing effect of economic
   freedom. To the extent that lobbying efforts constitute an opportunity
   cost of resources diverted away from investment and production, our
   hypothesis also implies that greater the opportunity cost of lobbying,
   the more efficient is the institutional environment. Panel data analysis
   reveals the expected positive relation between economic freedom and
   growth, and consistent with our hypothesis, the findings indicate that
   the impact of economic freedom on growth does indeed diminish as
   lobbying efforts increase. In addition, we find that lobbying is more
   harmful to growth at greater levels of economic freedom.},

Abstract = {An insight from dynamic political economy is that elected officials may
   use state variables to affect the choices of their successors. We
   exploit the staggered timing of local and national elections in Norway
   to investigate how politicians' re-election probabilities affect their
   investments in physical capital. Because popularity is endogenous to
   politics, we use an instrumental variable approach based on regional
   movements in ideological sentiment. We find that higher re-election
   probabilities stimulate investments, particularly in programs preferred
   more strongly by the incumbent parties. This aligns with theory where
   capital and current expenditures are considered complementary inputs to
   government production.},

   World},
Journal = {POLITICS AND RELIGION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {6},

Abstract = {Of the 45 Muslim majority countries in the world, 42 have signed the
   Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against
   Women. While this does indeed signal a motive to improve women's rights,
   there is wide disparity in terms of which countries expand rights and
   which do not. Social science literature suggests that in addition to
   economic factors like wealth and oil resources, or political factors
   like the quality of democracy in the country, Islamic culture may be at
   odds with the Western conception of women's rights. We posit that Muslim
   countries are unique in this regard due to religious pressures that
   often conflict with conventional measures of human rights. Using data
   from the Cingranelli-Richards Human Rights Dataset and the Religion and
   State Project, we find that Muslim countries that restrict the influence
   of fundamentalist religion in the government and population improve
   women's economic and social rights.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we investigate regional differences in the gender pay gap
   both theoretically and empirically. Within a spatial model of
   monopsonistic competition, we show that more densely populated labour
   markets are more competitive and constrain employers' ability to
   discriminate against women. Utilizing a large administrative data set
   for western Germany and a flexible semi-parametric propensity score
   matching approach, we find that the unexplained gender pay gap for young
   workers is substantially lower in large metropolitan than in rural
   areas. This regional gap in the gap of roughly 10 percentage points
   remained surprisingly constant over the entire observation period of 30
   years.},

Abstract = {In the following paper, we compare and study the reciprocal images from
   Portugal and Spain, which appeared in two publications, the Spanish
   Revista de Estudios Politicos (REP) and the Portuguese Revista Estudos
   (RE), since 1941 until 1950. Both publications are academic, following a
   nationalist and catholic approach and close to the franquista and
   salazarista regimes. During this period, both journals recognized this
   peninsular sisterhood, expression of the catholic identity, raison
   d'etre of each State. However, the intensity of this sisterhood presence
   will depend on coetaneous variations of foreign policy in each country.
   Therefore, only briefly and exceptionally this sisterhood will match,
   showing the wrongly historicist vision of this sisterhood that both
   publications proclaim safeguard.},

Abstract = {Whereas traditionally religion has played a central role in shaping the
   shared values in a society, secularization, privatization of religion,
   and pluralism are changing the values that personnel bring to the
   Canadian Forces. This late modern reality means that many people who
   have rejected traditional forms of religion in order to interpret their
   personal spiritual beliefs for themselves are uncertain about their core
   values. Differences in values among military personnel are further
   complicated by the realities of modern military engagements that require
   a greater need for ethical thinking and moral decision making. This
   article examines the nature of religion and values in late modern
   Canadian society and identifies religious leadership as a source of
   moral and ethical direction as well as consolation in the face of moral
   anomie. Finally, it highlights the need for greater education about the
   role of religion and values for military personnel.},

Abstract = {When political unrest spread from Tunisia to neighboring countries early
   in 2011, established global broadcasters were quick to provide
   commentary on the part played by social media in mobilizing dissent,
   exploiting the same technology in their own reporting of the protests as
   they did so. In this article, the relation of old to new media is
   explored in a comparison of televised coverage of the Arab Spring in Al
   Jazeera English, Russia Today, CNN International, and British
   Broadcasting Corporation World (BBCW) News. Building on notions of
   mediapolis and connectivity and mediatized crisis, it seeks to map the
   shared communicative space opened up by global broadcasters, and how
   established media actors are adapting to new media ecologies. The
   empirical analysis shows that social media do not play the prominent
   role in global television discourse one might expect, and that their
   prominence and deployment vary from one channel to the other.},

   relationship: that Australian dependency entailed unequivocal support
   for American foreign policy. It uses a particular Cold War event the
   Cuban Missile Crisis to examine the extent to which the reaction of the
   Australian government conformed to the general perception of immediate
   and absolute endorsement of the Kennedy administration's position. The
   paper will argue that the actual response of the Menzies government, as
   distinct from its public pronouncements, was constrained rather than
   unconditional, considered rather than reflexive, and shaped by strategic
   calculations of Australian interests.},

Abstract = {The project of public-reason liberalism faces a basic problem: publicly
   justified principles are typically too abstract and vague to be directly
   applied to practical political disputes, whereas applicable
   specifications of these principles are not uniquely publicly justified.
   One solution could be a legislative procedure that selects one member
   from the eligible set of inconclusively justified proposals. Yet if
   liberal principles are too vague to select sufficiently specific
   legislative proposals, can they, nevertheless, select specific
   legislative procedures? Based on the work of Gerald Gaus, this article
   argues that the only candidate for a conclusively justified decision
   procedure is a majoritarian or otherwise `neutral' democracy. If the
   justification of democracy requires an equality baseline in the design
   of political regimes and if justifications for departure from this
   baseline are subject to reasonable disagreement, a majoritarian design
   is justified by default. Gaus's own preference for super-majoritarian
   procedures is based on disputable specifications of justified liberal
   principles. These procedures can only be defended as a sectarian
   preference if the equality baseline is rejected, but then it is not
   clear how the set of justifiable political regimes can be restricted to
   full democracies.},

Abstract = {Recent accounts of epistemic democracy aim to show that in some
   qualified sense, democratic institutions have a tendency to produce
   reasonable outcomes. Epistemic democrats aim to offer such accounts
   without presupposing any narrow, controversial view of what the outcomes
   of democratic procedures should be, much as a good justification of a
   particular scientific research design does not presuppose the hypothesis
   that the research aims to test. The article considers whether this aim
   is achievable. It asks, in particular, whether accounts of epistemic
   democracy can be reconciled with the commonly held view that
   disagreement about which laws and policies should be enacted is a
   fundamental, permanent feature of democratic politics and imposes
   constraints on how we justify democratic procedures.},

Abstract = {The military benefits from fostering an ``us-feeling{''} among its
   members. On what basis is this formed? Rooted in the discipline of
   religion, the following article explores how religion feeds into the
   selective conscription practices of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).
   Combining legal documents with data gathered through interviews with
   thirty-four soldiers in a combat battalion, it is argued that the IDF's
   conscription practices are sensitive to the contents of religion. The
   IDF applies a multifarious concept of religion with significant impact
   on the IDF's ability to foster a sense of ``us.{''} The IDF recruits
   draftees on the basis of a twofold definition of Judaism, either as an
   ethnic group or as a theological concept. Both definitions help
   determine whether one is drafted. Interviews with soldiers expand on
   this definition, drawing attention to the integrative as well as
   disintegrative consequences of this notion of religion within the IDF.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},

Volume = {29},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In a much-cited paper Fernandez and Rogerson (1995) suggest that public
   spending on higher education is politically sustained by middle- and
   high income groups voting for a policy which is positive but not
   generous enough to allow lower income families to overcome the financial
   constraints that prevent their participation. Using a quantitative
   model, calibrated to the UK economy, we find that current public
   spending on post compulsory education corresponds to a political
   equilibrium. Support for the equilibrium policy comes primarily from
   low- and middle income groups, indicating that the policy needn't be
   highly regressive. Credit constraints play a minor role. Crown Copyright

Abstract = {It is often argued that countries with a high population share of
   children and young workers should attract large capital inflows from
   aging industrialized economies. However, many of these countries deter
   foreign investors by a high risk of creeping or outright expropriation.
   In this paper we explore whether the correlation between countries'
   demographic structure and the perceived security of property rights
   reflects a causal relationship. We show that, in low-income countries,
   the ratio of young to old workers has a positive effect on the perceived
   security of property rights if the political system is sufficiently
   democratic. By contrast, this relationship cannot be observed in middle
   income countries. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Objective Voters are more likely to reelect incumbents when political
   outcomes are positive. Although most scholars assume this is because
   voters explicitly credit politicians for good outcomes, this article
   investigates whether some voters simply opt for the status quo when they
   feel happy. Methods To distinguish these two voting models, I propose
   professional sports records as a proxy for electorate happiness
   unrelated to political performance. I test the impact of sports
   performance on incumbent mayoral elections in 39 American cities from
   1948 to 2009. Results Winning sports records boost incumbents' vote
   totals and likelihoods of reelection, exceeding in magnitude the effect
   of variation in unemployment. In contrast, sports records following
   elections display no such relationship. Conclusion Retrospective voting
   is partly driven by feelings of happiness unrelated to political
   appraisal. However, I argue that the implications for democratic
   accountability are not as dire as many authors claim.},

Title = {Moral autonomy in Australian legislation and military doctrine},
Journal = {ETHICS \& GLOBAL POLITICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {6},
Number = {3},
Pages = {135-154},
Abstract = {Australian legislation and military doctrine stipulate that soldiers
   `subjugate their will' to government, and fight in any war the
   government declares. Neither legislation nor doctrine enables the
   conscience of soldiers. Together, provisions of legislation and doctrine
   seem to take soldiers for granted. And, rather than strengthening the
   military instrument, the convention of legislation and doctrine seems to
   weaken the democratic foundations upon which the military may be shaped
   as a force for justice. Denied liberty of their conscience, soldiers are
   denied the foundational right of democratic citizenship and construed as
   utensils of the State. This article critiques the idea of moral agency
   in Australian legislation and military doctrine and is concerned with
   the obligation of the State to safeguard the moral integrity of
   individual soldiers, so soldiers might serve with a fully formed moral
   assurance to advance justice in the world. Beyond its explicit focus on
   the convention of Australian thought, this article raises questions of
   far-reaching relevance. The provisos of Australian legislation and
   doctrine are an analogue of western thinking. Thus, this discussion
   challenges many assumptions concerning military duty and effectiveness.
   Discussion will additionally provoke some reassessment of the
   expectations democratic societies hold of their soldiers.},

Title = {Building the Capacity to Play on Multilevel Policy Processes: French
   Environmental Movement Organisations and the European Union},
Journal = {SOCIAL MOVEMENT STUDIES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {12},
Number = {3},
Pages = {298-315},
Abstract = {The European Union (EU) is a relevant case to address the dynamics of
   transnational politics, given the significance of the EU environmental
   legislation in member states. Infranational, national and
   supranational/EU decision-making arenas still co-exist, without
   completely overlapping. This study explores how the multilevel nature of
   the EU policy-making process is exploited by national environmental
   movement organisations (EMOs). Diverging from the explanation in terms
   of political opportunity structure or their resource basis, we examine
   EMOs that do not automatically adapt to the EU multilevel policy
   process. The discussion takes up the classic debate between grievances
   (intentionality) and resources (capacity) hypothesising that both are
   constructed in EMOs' actions and through their interactions with public
   authorities, allies and members. Within the analytical framework
   developed in this study, the organisation is viewed as a factor
   explaining EU activism by combining an endogenous action approach with
   classical resource mobilisation concepts. The ensuing longitudinal
   analysis compares the case of three French EMOs:
   France-Nature-Environnement, Friends of the Earth-France and
   Greenpeace-France.},

Abstract = {This article introduces the study of photographs of politicians as an
   object of geopolitical analysis. It does this through exploring the
   holiday photographs of Vladimir Putin released by the Kremlin in 2007,
   2009, and 2010. Putin's biography provides a backdrop to a detailed
   analysis of the geopolitical representations contained in the
   photographs of him. In the same fashion as other images, the photographs
   seek to provide a contemporary view of events and, at the same time,
   serve as a medium through which particular political scripts are
   narrated. The photographs also help to reproduce (and question)
   hegemonic discourses about public forms of masculinity in Russia. This
   article is intended to contribute to the debate on how visual images can
   help make sense of the geopolitical world.},

Abstract = {The European Union's recent experimentation with forms of partnership
   and co-ownership has found its most ambitious expression in its southern
   neighbourhood in the form of the Union for the Mediterranean (UfM).
   Initially pioneered by Nicolas Sarkozy in an attempt to reaffirm a
   leading role for France within Europe, the experiment has foundered on
   the difficulty of creating effective governance structures in a
   Euro-Mediterranean space noted for geopolitical complexity, uncertain
   and shifting boundaries and cultural hybridity. The UfM experience
   illustrates how region-building can regress when its focus area becomes
   too extended and overambitious or inappropriate forms of
   institutionalisation are attempted. Yet, once offered to partners,
   co-ownership may be difficult to retreat from. The EU has side-stepped
   the UfM in its initial response to the Arab Spring, but the latter
   itself may bring southern demands for more effective co-ownership in
   future regional cooperation frameworks.},

Abstract = {In this paper I focus on one very influential argument for open borders,
   the freedom of movement argument, which says that if we value freedom of
   movement we must demand open borders. I begin the paper the paper by
   discussing Joseph Carens' well known version of the argument. I then
   consider, and reject, David Miller's response to that argument. Finally,
   I develop my own reply to Carens. Both Carens and Miller, I argue, are
   mistaken about the proper grounds for freedom of movement. Once we see
   this, it is clear how we can value freedom of movement without being
   committed to open borders.},

Abstract = {Theories of political entrepreneurship usually focus on the construction
   of coalitions necessary to change policy. We argue that political
   entrepreneurs who are unable to secure favored policies may redirect
   their efforts to a ``higher tier,{''} attempting to change the rules of
   the game to enable the exploitation of future political profit
   opportunities. We present a taxonomy of three levels of political
   rules-pre-constitutional, constitutional, and post-constitutional-and
   identify the salient characteristics of institutional entrepreneurship
   that targets rules at each level. The development of the congressional
   committee system is explored as a case study in entrepreneurship over
   post-constitutional rules.},

Abstract = {This chapter demonstrates how Argentine law court sentences have
   constructed a ``legal truth{''} regarding the unlawfully appropriated
   children of people ``disappeared{''} during the last military
   dictatorship (1976-1983). There are two discursive processes involved in
   the construction of that truth. On one hand, the courts reinterpret the
   crime of ``abduction of minors{''} to emphasize the damage done to
   families in the exercise of their rights, and on the other hand, they
   link illegal appropriation to the military government's
   counterinsurgency policies. Lastly, in the construction of this ``legal
   truth,{''} the sentences employ other discourses, particularly those of
   genealogy, psychoanalysis, and human rights.},

Abstract = {The sociology of transnational activism and of the Global Justice
   Movement have paid scarce attention to Southern transnationalisations. A
   good way of understanding the material and symbolic logics that underlie
   such processes is to study the way Southern activists participate in
   transnational events. Based on a collective ethnographic survey
   conducted at the World Social Forum (WSF) held in Nairobi in 2007, this
   article examines the practical modalities of access of African
   participants to the WSF, i.e. how they actually managed to travel to
   Nairobi, through what material help and to what extent they depend on
   the NGO sphere. It aims to show that the concept of career is a relevant
   lens to underline both activism and internationalisation as a process,
   which helps to avoid binary qualifications of internationalisation of
   Southern participants, reduced to being either simply part of the `civil
   society' or `unauthentic' because of their very internationalisation. It
   then examines how this internationalisation process reveals some
   affinities, albeit critical ones, with the former colonial sphere, but
   also how their engagement with the international sphere transforms their
   daily existence, through processual stages ( as internationalisation is
   not always an effect of a cosmopolitan socialisation, but can also be
   encouraged by Northern partners' stance and orientation towards sending
   `authentic' grassroots people to the North), and how the `NGOisation' of
   social movements in the global South may in turn be understood as a
   specific form of political enterprise.},

Abstract = {We analyze the changes in Czech economic higher education after February
   1948, focusing on the policy of the Communist Party, the role of
   individual politicians and the process of a multiple reorganization of
   universities which were dedicated to educate future economists. The
   study deals with specific circumstances in which the University of
   Economics, Prague was founded. The findings are based primarily on
   non-released documents from the records office of the University of
   Economics in Prague, Archives of the Czech Technical University in
   Prague, interviews with eyewitnesses and released sources of personal
   provenience. We came to the conclusion that the University of Economics
   in Prague emerged from a massive reform of the economic education system
   which had been commenced by the Communist Party after 1948. The new
   university was a result of a political decision and squaring with the so
   called Slanism of the University of Political and Economic Sciences. It
   also was a content and personnel continuation of the earlier University
   of Economic Sciences CTU. The guarantors of this reorganization were
   Felix Oliva and Vladimir Sedlak, the first chancellor of the University
   of Economics, Prague.},

Abstract = {Until recently, most research on political budget cycles was based on
   the (often implicit) presumption that these cycles do not differ across
   countries. However, more recent studies focus on heterogeneity. This
   paper surveys studies examining the factors conditioning the occurrence
   and strength of manipulation of fiscal policy for electoral purposes, at
   the aggregate level or at the level of a particular type of government
   expenditure. Conditioning factors discussed include: the level of
   development, institutional quality, age and level of democracy,
   electoral rules and form of government, transparency of the political
   process, the presence of checks and balances, and fiscal rules.},

Abstract = {Nannestad and Paldam (Public Choice 79:213-245, 1994) published herein
   an extremely influential review of the literature linking economics and
   elections, what they called the ``VP functions.{''} In that work, they
   offered a number of conclusions, in proposition form, about the state of
   the evidence in this field. We present the key ones (16 in all), and
   assess the extent to which they continue to hold, in light of the new
   evidence about what has come to be known as economic voting. As shall be
   shown, Nannestad and Paldam were prescient in their early establishment
   of many of the principal results explaining how the economy moves the
   vote choice.},

Abstract = {ObjectiveThis study examines how religious affiliations, salience,
   beliefs, and practices influence engagement in interracial dating or
   romance.
   MethodsBivariate and multivariate analyses are employed using data from
   the 2007 Baylor Religion Survey (N = 1,268). Logistic regression models
   are estimated in order to determine how certain dimensions of religious
   life predict whether one has engaged in interracial dating or romance,
   net of sociodemographic and ideological controls.
   ResultsRelative to evangelicals, mainline Protestants are less likely to
   have engaged in interracial romance. Those who frequently attend church
   and affirm biblical literalism are less likely to have dated across
   race, but those who engage in devotional practices such as prayer and
   sacred text reading are more likely to have interracialy dated.
   ConclusionThe relationship between religion and interracial romance is
   more complex than previously thought. Future studies should both
   acknowledge and account for this complexity in their analyses.},

Abstract = {Suicides in the US military were observed rising in 2004, most notably
   in the Army and Marine Corps, and particularly, in the Army National
   Guard (ARNG). Alarmed, Army leaders and researchers have offered various
   explanations and prescriptions, often lacking any evidence. In the
   present study, three data sets were used to examine evidence for various
   perspectives on suicidedispositional risk, social cognitive,
   stressor-strain, and social cultural/institutional, each having
   different emphases on relevant explanatory variables and underlying
   mechanisms of suicide. Primary risk factors associated with having
   committed suicide among the 2007-2010 ARNG suicide cases were age
   (young), gender (male), and race (white), supporting the dispositional
   risk perspective on suicide. Some evidence supported the stressor-strain
   perspective in that postdeployment loss of a significant other and a
   major life change showed statistically significant, yet weaker
   associations with increased suicide intentions. Implications of results
   are discussed for future research and preventive strategies.},

Abstract = {To what extent are groups selectively exposed to news that affects their
   self-interest? We theorize that having an interest at stake in an issue
   increases the importance of related information, promoting selective
   exposure to politics. The framework we develop generates hypotheses we
   test with data from 29 U.S. public opinion surveys conducted between
   1997 and 2007 with a combined sample size of over 40,000 respondents. We
   find that though the propensity to follow news is a general
   predisposition, people's exposure to specific issues varies based on
   whether or not information is relevant to their interests, as defined by
   social group (or issue public) membership. While general awareness of
   political matters is normatively desirable, exposure to issues relevant
   to one's self-interest is an equally important and necessary
   precondition for political engagement and issue public formation.
   Evidence from this study suggests that citizens with low levels of
   general news exposure may, nonetheless, attend to personally relevant
   information, enabling democratic accountability across dynamic
   information environments. {[}Supplementary material is available for

Title = {Interactions of News Frames and Incivility in the Political Blogosphere:
   Examining Perceptual Outcomes},
Journal = {POLITICAL COMMUNICATION},

Pages = {456-473},

Abstract = {The anonymity and flexibility of the online world allows the free
   expression of views. This same anonymity and unconstrained expression
   can initiate uncivil debate. The political blogosphere is thus replete
   with uncivil discussions and becomes an apt context to examine the
   influence of incivility on news frames. Moreover, although there is an
   increasingly growing literature on framing, few have examined framing
   effects in the contemporary media landscape. Thus, the present study
   brings in literature from incivility and framing effects to examine the
   influence of incivility on news frames for perceptual outcomes. The
   study uses an experiment embedded in a Web survey. Findings show that
   incivility increases the credibility of a news article while decreasing
   political trust and political efficacy. Further, results demonstrate the
   interactions of incivility and news frames. For instance, news
   credibility is increased only in the value framed condition. And a
   combination of strategic frames and incivility results in the least
   political trust and external efficacy. Implications are discussed.

Abstract = {This paper critically assesses the CIA's drone programme and proposes
   that the use of unmanned aerial vehicles is driving an increasingly
   dronified US national security strategy. The paper suggests that
   large-scale ground wars are being eclipsed by fleets of weaponised
   drones capable of targeted killings across the planet. Evidence for this
   shift is found in key security documents that mobilise an amorphous
   conflict against vaguely defined al-Qa'ida affiliates. This process is
   legitimised through the White House's presentation of drone warfare as a
   bureaucratic conflict managed by a disposition matrix. These official
   narratives are challenged by the voices of people living in the tribal
   areas of Pakistan. What I term the Predator Empire names the
   biopolitical power that digitises, catalogues, and eliminates
   threatening patterns of life across a widening battlespace. This
   permanent war is enabled by a topological spatial power that folds the
   distant environments of the affiliate into the surveillance machinery of
   the Homeland.},

Abstract = {What does it mean when activist networks describe themselves as
   European' or Global'? Existing studies into the geographic character of
   such networks have focused on the interplay between multiple levels'.
   However, there is a need for greater research on the discursive function
   played by geographic descriptors within the formation of activist
   networks. This article examines the use of multiple geographic
   descriptors to articulate a particular activist network - the Seattle to
   Brussels' (S2B) network - consisting of European-based groups contesting
   the form of multilateral trade governance embodied in the WTO. To map
   out how groups forged relations with one another under a European'
   identity, the article applies a discourse theoretical analysis to
   extensive empirical data including interviews with activists and
   participant observation at key events. The article has relevance to
   understanding both how transnational protest networks are formed and the
   role of multiple geographic signifiers in global politics.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the question of whether corruption might `grease
   the wheels' of an economy. We investigate whether and to what extent the
   impact of regulations on entrepreneurship is dependent on corruption. We
   first test whether regulations robustly deter firm entry into markets.
   Our results show that the existence of a larger number of procedures
   required to start a business, as well as larger minimum capital
   requirements are detrimental to entrepreneurship. Second, we test
   whether corruption reduces the negative impact of regulations on
   entrepreneurship in highly regulated economies. Our empirical analysis,
   covering a maximum of 43 countries over the 2003-2005 period, shows that
   corruption facilitates firm entry in highly regulated economies. For
   example, the `greasing' effect of corruption kicks in at around 50 days
   required to start a new business. Our results thus provide support for
   the `grease the wheels' hypothesis.},

Abstract = {In recent years, profound media environmental changes have sparked a
   controversy regarding whether we are entering a new era of minimal
   effects. Focusing on one of the most important media effect theories,
   agenda setting, this study combines a panel survey and a media content
   analysis to test three claims derived from the new era of minimal
   effects discussion: (1) that recent media environmental changes have
   reduced the agenda setting influence of traditional news media to
   non-significance, (2) that increased opportunities for media choice have
   made partisan selective exposure the key mechanism behind media effects,
   and (3) that the availability of alternative online news sources reduces
   susceptibility to agenda setting effects from the traditional news
   media. Among other things, the results show that traditional news media
   still exert agenda-setting influence on both the aggregate and
   individual levels, but that these effects are weakened by use of
   multiple online news media. Overall, the results suggest that a
   generalized ``we{''} have not (yet) entered a new era of minimal
   effects, and that certain media system characteristics are likely to
   condition the pace of any potential transition to a new minimal effects
   era.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the role of objects in the constitution and exercise
   of state power, drawing on a close reading of the acclaimed HBO
   television series The Wire, an unconventional crime drama set and shot
   in Baltimore, Maryland. While political geography increasingly
   recognizes the prosaic and intimate practices of stateness, we argue
   that objects themselves are central to the production, organization, and
   performance of state power. Specifically, we analyze how three prominent
   objects on The Wire - wiretaps, cameras, and standardized tests -
   arrange and produce the conditions we understand as `stateness'. Drawing
   on object-oriented philosophy, we offer a methodology of power that
   suggests it is generalized force relations rather than specifically
   social relations that police a population - without, of course, ever
   being able to fully capture it. We conclude by suggesting The Wire
   itself is an object of force, and explore the implications of an
   object-oriented approach for understanding the nature of power, and for
   political geography more broadly. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {This paper argues that although our understanding of politics in
   colonial New South Wales in the period after 1856 has increased in
   recent times there is little appreciation of the political rhetoric
   employed to justify those politics. It contends that the key to
   understanding that rhetoric is an appreciation that politics was not
   understood in terms of institutional design but focused rather on the
   quality of political leaders. In particular, as exemplified by the case
   of Henry Parkes, it involved being British and being able to work
   British institutions. This emphasis on personal politics, rather than
   institutional matters such as the creation of checks and balances,
   helped to shape the nature of democratic institutions in Australia. In
   particular it encouraged a form of democracy that concentrated power.
   The refusal of members of the Legislative Council to oppose the Influx
   of Chinese Restriction Bill is an early indication of the consequences
   of that form of democracy.},

Abstract = {We use Granger causality tests within a conditional Gaussian Markov
   switching vector autoregressive (MS-VAR) model using monthly data for
   G-7 countries covering the period 1959:122008:10 to examine the
   relationship between inflation and inflation-uncertainty. The MS-VAR
   model allows us to model parameter time-variation so as to reflect
   changes in Granger causality, assuming that these changes are stochastic
   and governed by an unobservable Markov chain. Inflation uncertainty is
   measured as the conditional variance generated by a Fractionally
   Integrated Smooth Transition Autoregressive Moving Average-Asymmetric
   Power ARCH (FISTARMA-APARCH) model. The distinguishing feature of our
   approach from the previous studies is the determination of the sign of
   the Granger causality relationship between inflation and its uncertainty
   over time. First, using a rolling VAR model, we show that the
   relationship between inflation and inflation uncertainty is time varying
   with frequent breaks. Second, using the MS-VAR model, we obtain strong
   evidence in favour of the Holland's stabilizing Fed hypothesis for
   Canada, France, Germany, Japan, United Kingdom, and the United States.
   We also find evidence in favour of the Friedman hypothesis for Canada
   and the United States.},

Abstract = {This article aims to persuade its reader that libertarianism, at least
   in several of its varieties, is a species of the genus that Michael
   Oakeshott referred to as `rationalism in politics'. I hope to
   demonstrate, employing the work of Oakeshott as well as Aristotle and
   Onora O'Neill, how many libertarian theorists, who generally have a
   sincere and admirable commitment to personal liberty, have been led
   astray by the rationalist promise that we might be able to approach
   deductive certainty concerning the `correctness' of some political
   programme. The article will argue that a concept such as Pettit's
   freedom as non-domination is more robust and inclusive of all that we
   value about freedom than is the libertarian concept of freedom as
   non-interference.},

Abstract = {Research on social movement networks has been defined by an emphasis on
   structural determinism and quantitative methodologies, and has often
   overlooked the spatial dimension of networking practices. This article
   argues that scholars have much to gain if (1) they move beyond the
   understanding of networks as organisational and communication
   structures, and analyse them as everyday social processes of human
   negotiation and construction, and (2) they pay attention to how networks
   between different organisations create multiple and overlapping spaces
   of action and meaning that define the everyday contexts of social
   movements. Drawing on ethnographic research within the Cuba Solidarity
   Campaign, this article explores the everyday dimension of political and
   communication networks. It shows that everyday networking practices are
   embedded in processes of identification and meaning construction, and
   are defined by a politics of inclusion and exclusion; introducing the
   concept of ethnographic cartography, it demonstrates that social
   movement networks are incorporated into everyday practices and
   narratives of place-making.},

Title = {AN INTERPRETATION OF INTEREST RATES VARIABILITY IN DEALER'S MODEL OF
   OPTIMAL INTEREST MARGIN},
Journal = {POLITICKA EKONOMIE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {61},
Number = {3},
Pages = {299-320},
Abstract = {The paper deals with interest rate volatility interpretation in the
   dealer's model of optimal interest margin. It defines main sources of
   interest rate volatility and studies how specific source of volatility
   influences optimal interest margin. Special attention is focused on
   unexpected shock in liquidity of banking system, actual central bank's
   decision on targeted level of interest rate, long-term deviation of
   inflation and output from central bank's targeted values and potential
   impact of these factors on term premium instability. Sources of interest
   rates are discussed in term of bank's refinancing/reinvestment risk with
   an attempt to formalize interest rate volatility for further empirical
   research. Our conclusion is that dealer's model of optimal interest
   margin is consistent with only permanent shocks to banking system
   liquidity and long-lasting central bank's surprises with its monetary
   policy that increase a level of refinancing/reinvestment risk faced up
   by banks. On the other hand it is not consistent with interest rate
   volatility caused by transitory liquidity shocks, expected current
   changes in central bank's targeted main policy rate and long run trends
   in main policy rate based on disinflation.},

Abstract = {While positive effects of social interaction on political participation
   have been widely confirmed, questions have been raised about whether the
   relationship holds in the online environment. This article uses data
   from the 2007 Australian Election Study to address this debate by
   testing whether greater online social interaction predicts increased
   political engagement, and whether this differs for interactions within
   homogenous (bonding) versus heterogeneous (bridging) networks. The
   findings show that bonding, and not bridging, online social contact
   predicts offline participation, suggesting that online interactions that
   do not build on existing offline networks are not as effective in
   mobilizing ``real world{''} participation.},

Abstract = {The evolution of the Fair Trade movement offers an apposite case through
   which to examine the idea of regulating risk through a ``social
   sphere.{''} An analysis of Fair Trade through the lens of ``defiance{''}
   reveals discrete models and actors of risk regulation that evolve in an
   iterative fashion. These findings not only add complexity and
   heterogeneity to the social actors and mechanisms of regulation in the
   social sphere, but also highlight the challenges this diversity poses
   for the project of alleviating market risk. In turn, the framework of
   defiance offers a fertile analytical framework for the study of
   transnational risk regulation by capturing the dynamic actor and
   institutional complexities that underpin, and embody challenges for, the
   regulation of risk through the social sphere. The article begins with an
   overview of the Fair Trade movement and consideration of Fair Trade's
   approach to regulating market risk. It then introduces the notion of
   defiance, focusing on two of its subtypes: game playing and resistance.
   Following a short overview of the methodological framework employed to
   analyze these dynamics, the third section applies these analytical
   categories of defiance to explore primary data gathered on Fair Trade's
   evolution. The article shows that the motivational posture of game
   playing, through its continued experimentation and entrepreneurship in
   transnational risk regulation, is pregnant with potential to mitigate
   the risks generated by economic activity.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY \& POLITICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {10},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {444-461},
Abstract = {This article analyzes the political form of Occupy Wall Street on
   Twitter. Drawing on evidence contained within the profiles of over
   50,000 Twitter users, political identities of participants are
   characterized using natural language processing. The results find
   evidence of a traditional oppositional social movement alongside a
   legitimizing countermovement, but also a new notion of political
   community as an ensemble of discursive practices that are endogenous to
   the constitution of political regimes from the ``inside out.{''} These
   new political identities are bound by thin ties of political solidarity
   linked to the transformative capacities of the movement rather than
   thick ties of social solidarity.},

   stock market and verify whether bonds can be taken as stock indicators.
   A detailed study of financial time series of both countries is
   performed. Different stages of each financial time series which is
   called bear, normal and bull state are presented. The conclusion is that
   all three stages have different means return and they are in accordance
   with financial theory. For the division of time series into each state
   Markov-Switching model is used.},

Pages = {5-26},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The creation, propagation and mythologization of heroes, or rather, the
   images of heroes, have recently attracted a good deal of attention from
   historians. This article aims to contribute to this discussion through a
   study of the cult of the Hungarian independence leader Lajos Kossuth and
   his reception in Britain in 1851. Why was a Hungarian national hero so
   widely celebrated in far away England and how was Kossuth's heroic image
   created? While historical research has not completely overlooked the
   subject, little attention has been paid to Kossuth's own part and
   perhaps even more importantly, that of his representative in England
   prior to his arrival, Ferenc Pulszky, in these events. As this article
   will argue, Kossuth's image was in fact purposefully manufactured by
   these two men and others. The role of Pulszky, Kossuth's backstage
   manager cannot be overstressed; without him Kossuth might have remained
   an obscure Central European revolutionary leader. During the two years
   prior to the Magyar leader's arrival, the ground was being carefully
   prepared for him, so that when Kossuth arrived, all he was required to
   do was employ his uniquely powerful oratory and continue to equate the
   Hungarian movement with certain universal values, a process that had
   already been set in motion by Pulszky. But specific Englishmen were also
   instrumental in the creation of Kossuth's hero cult. A small group of
   liberal intellectuals and middle-class radicals, including Lord Dudley
   Stuart and Richard Cobden amongst others, eagerly engaged in first
   helping Pulszky popularize the Hungarian question and then coaching
   Kossuth by giving advice on maintaining his heroic appeal. Thus it was a
   multi-sided affair-the joint Hungarian duo of Pulszky and Kossuth and
   their English `sympathizers' were all creators of Kossuth's hero cult in
   England. But we must not forget that the adulation of Kossuth in 1851
   was also down to more abstract notions: the receptiveness of
   contemporary English minds to the celebration of heroes and the
   importance attached to English national identity, with which the Kossuth
   cult was deeply intertwined in the eyes of all those Englishmen that
   celebrated him.},

Abstract = {Cybersecurity proponents often rely on cyber-doom scenarios as a key
   tactic for calling attention to prospective cyberthreats. This article
   critically examines cyber-doom scenarios by placing them in a larger
   historical context, assessing how realistic they are, and drawing out
   the policy implications of relying on such tales. It draws from relevant
   research in the history of technology, military history, and disaster
   sociology to examine some of the key assertions and assumptions of
   cyber-doom scenarios. The article argues that cyber-doom scenarios are
   the latest manifestation of fears about ``technology-out-of-control{''}
   in Western societies, that they are unrealistic, and that they encourage
   the adoption of counterproductive, even dangerous policies. The article
   concludes by offering alternative principles for the formulation of
   cybersecurity policy.},

Abstract = {Previous research has explored the definitional features of the
   processes of scientific expert activism but has been less clear
   regarding the dynamics of this scientific activism. This paper addresses
   these gaps in understanding by using an exploration of the state-based
   efforts and mobilizations to regulate the chemical Bisphenol-A (BPA) to
   identify and analyze the dynamics of interactions between scientists and
   activists as they collaborate in pursuit of movement objectives. Drawing
   primarily from interview data and participant observation, I explore how
   scientific experts-through collaboration and work with activists-impact
   the processes of movement framing, and how, in turn, the collaborative
   dissemination of these frames may contribute to movement goals. I argue
   that the relationships and coordination that developed between BPA
   scientists and activists resulted in a collaboratively crafted set of
   frames that were both scientifically rigorous and highly resonant to a
   public audience.},

   engine results from the 2008 U.S. presidential election. Analyses show
   that the sources and content generated by three search engines differed
   among the search engines. The top-three results from each search engine,
   however, originated from large, well-trafficked sites. The results
   indicate that search engines act according to a market model by
   providing access to mainstream sites rather than diverse, less familiar
   information. These results allow scholars to understand the types of

Abstract = {This chapter reviews and analyses the literature on the economics of
   pipelines in general. The primary intention is to identify and define
   the economic characteristics of cross-border and transit pipelines. The
   technical, economic, and political factors discussed in this chapter are
   relevant to an understanding of how pipelines work. The impact of these
   factors on the transit fee is examined. The aim is to provide a basis
   for generalisations regarding transit fees, and to provide the basic
   tools to answer the question of whether a pipeline agreement that is
   reasonable, objective, transparent, and non-discriminatory does exist or
   can exist in the long term.},

Abstract = {The previous chapter showed that the motives behind the construction and
   operation of a pipeline, the relevance of the project to the
   participants, equity participation in the project, and the availability
   of alternatives are all important factors in the balance of bargaining
   power among the parties involved. The problem highlighted at the
   beginning of this research is that the Energy Charter Treaty and the
   draft Energy Charter Protocol on Energy Transit cannot overcome the
   possibility of opportunism. The extent to which the factors identified
   in Chapter 4 are incorporated into the philosophy of the Treaty as a
   whole is not clear at this point. The objective of this chapter,
   therefore, is to analyse the relevant provisions of the Treaty and the
   draft Protocol in the context of the findings from this research, with a
   view to characterising the role of the Energy Charter Secretariat (or
   indeed any form of international regulation) in cross-border oil and gas
   pipelines involving transit.},

Abstract = {The paper takes the form of a reflection on the explanatory status of
   neoliberalism, before and since the global crisis of 2008. Prior to the
   crisis, political-economic conceptions of neoliberalism as a hegemonic
   grid and as a relatively robust regime of state-facilitated market rule
   were being received with growing skepticism by some poststructural
   critics, while some ethnographers found the accompanying conceptual
   tools rather too blunt for their methodological purposes. The fact,
   however, that the global crisis-far from marking an inauspicious end to
   the regime of market rule-seems to have brought about something like a
   redoubling of its intensity and reach has prompted a reconsideration, in
   some quarters, of the explanatory and political status of neoliberalism.
   This, in turn, has opened up some new avenues of dialog between
   structural and poststructural treatments of neoliberalism, and between
   ethnographic and political-economic approaches, while at the same time
   highlighting a series of continuing tensions, both epistemological and
   ontological. The paper provides a critical commentary on this emerging
   terrain.},
