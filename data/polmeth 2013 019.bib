   PANEL VAR MODEL FOR OECD COUNTRIES},

Abstract = {The article is focused on the mutual relationship among effective tax
   burden, size of government spending and economic growth. Its aim is to
   verify the effect of taxation and government spending on economic
   growth, but also to verify the effect of taxation and economic growth on
   the size of government spending. The analysis is methodologically based
   on a panel VAR model where taxation is approximated by standard Tax
   Quota as well as an alternative World Tax Index (WTI), which was
   compiled by the authors. The data cover the period of 2005 - 2010 for
   the OECD countries. The results of empirical analyzes show that economic
   growth is positively influenced by government spending, while the effect
   of taxation is negative for all types of taxes. Government expenditures
   are negatively influenced by both economic growth and the size of the
   taxation. We come also to the conclusion that WTI is preferable
   approximator of the tax burden than the Tax Quota, and may be used in
   further empirical analyzes.},

Abstract = {Before the close of 2011, Kenya launched its own local version of a `war
   on terror' following persistent border incursions by the al-Qaida
   affiliated al-Shabaab militant group. In a conflict that was seen by
   many to be fought largely through modern military hardware, the
   emergence and effective use of social media as yet another site of this
   warfare reflected the growing influence of new media in mobilizing,
   debating and circulating issues of public interest. Specifically, this
   chapter reveals the particular frames that were used in Twitter to keep
   members of the public informed on the front line developments of the
   Operation Linda Nchi. Secondly, the study also investigates how the
   entrance of al-Shabaab into Twitter shaped the media framing of a war
   previously dominated by the more `legitimate' Kenya Defence Force
   Twitter account. Finally, in a situation where the Twitter discourse was
   perceived and defined by the KDF as the official account of the war,
   this paper shows how the new and the old media converged in news reports
   in Kenya's main newspapers and the resultant frames from this
   convergence.},

Abstract = {Over three decades after China ventured onto the market path, the
   Chinese state's reform programme, which was intended to invigorate
   socialism, has instead led the country down a capitalist path. This
   paper situates China's post-Mao transition in the context of the crisis
   of the party-state during the Cultural Revolution. Using Gramsci's idea
   of `passive revolution', it examines the state's tactics of crisis
   management aiming to contain and neutralise emergent opposition and
   pressure from below. As the combined result of state repression,
   ideological appropriation and socioeconomic incorporation, a new reform
   paradigm emerged to rearticulate popular demands and initiatives to an
   official socialism centring on economic modernisation and market
   liberalisation.},

Abstract = {This article presents an experimental model for citizen deliberation
   that bridges the gap between developments in normative deliberative
   theory, and online participation and deliberation in practice. The
   Social Web for Inclusive and Transparent democracy (SOWIT) model is
   designed for integration into policy-making processes. It is currently
   being developed in consultation with citizens, civil society
   organizations, and Councilors in an Irish local authority and will be
   implemented in 2014. Our approach is rooted in Dryzek and Niemeyer's
   (Dryzek and Niemeyer {[}2008]. American Political Science Review 102(4):
   481-93) innovations in discursive representation and meta-consensus as
   well as Ba ``chtiger et al.' s (Bachtiger et al. {[}2010]. Journal of
   Political Philosophy 18: 32-63) sequential approach to deliberation.
   SOWIT pioneers a dynamic implementation of a meta-consensus framework
   for structuring and incentivizing policy deliberations. In this article,
   we present the model, explain its normative rationale, and outline the
   experimental framework.},

Title = {The Influence of Race, Class, and Metropolitan Area Characteristics on
   African-American Residential Segregation},
Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},

Number = {5, SI},
Pages = {1414-1437},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {ObjectivesSociologists and other scholars have debated the causes of
   continuing residential segregation for several decades. Social class has
   been largely discounted as a substantial determinant of residential
   segregation by race, but recent studies have brought renewed attention
   to class variables. The present study reassesses the role of social
   class, using household income, while also considering metropolitan area
   characteristics.
   MethodsThis study expands on prior research by examining residential
   segregation between black-alone and white-alone households with 2000
   decennial Census data for all U.S. Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs)
   with at least 200,000 or more black population or 1,000,000 total
   population (60 MSAs total), using both spatial unevenness
   (dissimilarity) and two types of experiential (i.e., contextual)
   indicators (exposure indices), measuring socioeconomic status (SES) with
   a greater range and number of income levels than in past research, and
   using multivariate models to account for metropolitan area
   characteristics.
   ResultsWe find that both dissimilarity and exposure measures are
   significantly associated with household incomeblack households with
   higher household incomes live in neighborhoods with greater exposure to
   whites and lower isolation from other blacks than do black households
   with lower incomes. Additionally, a number of MSA-level
   characteristicsseveral of which have not been considered in previous
   researchare substantially associated with black/white residential
   segregation.
   ConclusionWe interpret these findings in the context of spatial
   assimilation and place stratification perspectives, and conclude that
   racial segregation is at least partly based on class.},

Abstract = {Many students of trust see it as a way to mitigate risk through the
   development of strong institutions that create trust. I offer an
   alternative view of trust, moralistic or generalized trust, that depends
   upon a psychological foundation of optimism and control. This form of
   trust, in contrast to arguments by Paldam and others, has ``value{''}
   independent of experience. Using data from a survey of metropolitan
   Philadelphia in 1996, I show that if you believe that ``most people can
   be trusted,{''} you are substantially more likely to see your
   neighborhood as safe at night even controlling for both the objective
   level of crime as well having been the victim of a crime, having had
   parents who were the victims of crime, watching local television news
   (which exposes people to violent events), where you live (central city
   and suburb), and gender. Trust thus ``reduces{''} perceptions of risk
   independently of personal experience.},

Abstract = {This paper examines whether the European integration process, by
   transferring policy instruments to supra-national authorities, has
   affected voters' evaluations of governments' economic performance at
   elections. The analysis is implemented on a panel of 15 EU countries,
   from 1970 to 2011. Results suggest that before the Maastricht Treaty,
   citizens held incumbents responsible for GDP growth and for the
   evolution of inflation, particularly when measured relative to the EU
   average. After the Maastricht Treaty, there was a significant reduction
   in the impact of economic variables, especially inflation, on electoral
   outcomes. During the current economic crisis the capacity to control the
   budget deficit appears to be the main determinant of incumbents' vote
   shares.},

Abstract = {The presumed higher productivity of foreign firms and resulting
   spillovers to domestic firms has led governments to offer financial
   incentives to foreign firms. We investigate if there is any productivity
   or wage gap between foreign and domestic firms in the UK and if the
   presence of foreign firms in a sector raises the productivity of
   domestic firms. Our results indicate that foreign firms do have higher
   productivity than domestic firms and they pay higher wages. We find no
   aggregate evidence of intra-industry spillovers. However, firms with low
   productivity relative to the sector average, in low-skill low foreign
   competition sectors gain less from foreign firms.},

Abstract = {This paper addresses two empirical questions. Is fiscal policy affected
   by upcoming elections? If so, do election-motivated fiscal policies
   enhance the probability of re-election of the incumbent? Employing data
   for 65 democratic countries over 1975-2005 in a semi-pooled panel model,
   we find that in most countries fiscal policy is hardly affected by
   elections. The countries for which we find a significant political
   budget cycle are very diverse. They include `young' democracies but also
   `established' democracies. In countries with a political budget cycle,
   election-motivated fiscal policies have a significant positive (but
   fairly small) effect on the electoral support for the political parties
   in government.},

Abstract = {I study diversity in views expressed by economists regarding appropriate
   economic policies. The dataset is for voting by economists on the German
   Council of Economic Experts, over the period 1971-2011. The results show
   that the best predictor of minority voting is having been nominated by
   the trade unions, which results in being some 70 percentage points more
   likely to vote against the majority opinion. The voting pattern confirms
   that ideological identity through the channel of political appointment
   influences economists' voting behavior. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Partisan selective exposure, the tendency for citizens to select
   political information agreeing with their predispositions, has been
   widely demonstrated. This study draws from research on how citizens
   process information to evaluate whether satirical versus serious news
   influences selective exposure. The analysis also examines whether
   exposure to satirical news affects partisan tolerance compared with
   serious news or no news at all. An experiment was conducted where
   participants were randomly assigned to view a comedic and satirical
   political Web site, a serious Web site, or no Web site. Respondents'
   article selections were unobtrusively tracked. Results document that
   satirical news may lead people away from articles opposing their views
   and that it reduces tolerance for partisan views unlike one's own.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the relationship between rights and capabilities
   in order to get a better grasp of the kind of consequentialism that the
   capability theory represents. Capability rights have been defined as
   rights that have a capability as their object (rights to capabilities).
   Such a definition leaves the relationship between capabilities and
   rights to a great extent underspecified since nothing is said about the
   nature of those rights. Hence, it is not precluded that they are mere
   negative liberties, something that capability theorists deny. On the
   other hand, to say that all capability rights are substantive in the
   sense that they themselves are capabilities (rights as capabilities)
   will in a significant number of cases fail to match well with our
   intuitions. This article presents an account of the relationship between
   rights and capabilities that avoids these problems of underspecification
   and of plausibility, respectively. First, it is argued that to take the
   idea of capability rights seriously, three new list issues' need to be
   addressed. Second, developing a point made by Nussbaum, it is argued
   that capability rights are to be defined as being purely instrumental.
   Whereas the resulting analysis of capability rights solves the problems
   of underspecification and plausibility, it raises doubts about the claim
   that the capability approach gives more importance to rights than do
   traditional forms of consequentialism.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the impact of the electoral calendar on the
   composition of tax revenue (direct versus indirect taxes). It thus
   represents an extension of traditional political budget-cycle analyses
   assessing the impact of elections on overall revenue. We appeal to the
   opportunistic political budget model of Drazen and Eslava (2010) to
   predict the relationship between taxation structure and elections. Panel
   data from 56 developing countries over the 1980-2006 period reveals a
   clear pattern of electorally-related policy interventions. Taking the
   potential endogeneity of election timing into account, we find robust
   evidence of lower indirect taxes being applied by incumbent governments
   in the period just prior to an election. Indirect tax revenue in
   election years is estimated to be 0.3 GDP percentage points lower than
   in other years, corresponding to a fall of about 3.4\% of the average
   figure in the sample countries, while there is no such relationship with
   direct tax revenue.},

Abstract = {Contributions by investor-owned companies play major roles in financing
   the campaigns of candidates for elective office in the United States. We
   look at the presidential level and analyze contributions by companies
   before an election and their stock market performance following US
   presidential elections from 1992 to 2004. We find that companies
   experienced abnormal positive post-election returns with (i) a higher
   percentage of contributions given to the eventual winner and (ii) with a
   higher total contribution given. Hypothetical portfolios of the 30
   largest corporate contributors formed according to (i) the percentage of
   contributions given to the winner in a presidential election and (ii)
   the total contribution (divided by market capitalization) would have
   earned significant abnormal returns in the two years after an election.
   While all results hold for Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, they are
   stronger by a magnitude of two to three under W. Bush.},

Abstract = {Political scientists are interested in the influence of the news media
   on politics. However, relatively few studies investigate whether or not
   ideological slant in news coverage changes systematically over time. If
   it changes systematically, what factors explain the changes? This study
   argues that external conditions, such as national political and economic
   situations, influence ideological media slant at the aggregate level. To
   examine this argument, macro media bias is measured quarterly by gauging
   the relative size of liberal and conservative news stories regarding
   domestic issues from 1958 through 2004. Utilizing ARIMA models, this
   study reveals that the news media tend to negatively react to government
   spending. Also, economic conditions, such as unemployment and inflation,
   significantly explain changes in the relative number of liberal and
   conservative news stories. {[}Supplementary material is available for

Abstract = {The question this article addresses is how and to what extent
   international military forces can support nongovernmental organizations
   (NGOs) in armed conflicts and postconflict arenas. As non-state actors,
   NGOs have serious security problems and their current protection is not
   sufficient to secure humanitarian operations. The Afghanistan NGO Safety
   Office (ANSO) was established in 2002 to solve this problem. The ANSO
   innovation resulted in a new NGO-military security collaboration
   mechanism. In particular, the article examines whether the NGO-military
   security collaboration mechanism established between NATO International
   Security Assistance Force, the United Nations Assistance Mission in
   Afghanistan, and the ANSO could be a fourth way in narrowing NGOs'
   security gap in addition to the existing three ways (judicial,
   theoretical, and practical). I would argue international military forces
   need to take into account ANSO model organizations for fulfilling their
   responsibility to secure NGOs in armed conflicts and postconflict
   arenas.},

Abstract = {During the early 1930s the private trading banks came under sustained
   attack from sections of the Australian Labor Party and the Country
   Party, and from supporters of Major C.H. Douglas. Repeated calls for
   bank nationalisation or socialisation of credit or social credit
   heightened tensions within the banks and conservative political circles.
   In response, the banks secretly funded a nationwide campaign in support
   of the Lyons government in the lead-up to the 1934 federal election.
   While the campaign was successful, the outcome resulted in the
   establishment of a Royal Commission to investigate the banking sector.
   The Royal Commission's recommendations and the Lyons government's
   proposed banking legislation were about providing greater government
   control of the sector. Opposition from the Bank of New South Wales and
   its supporters during the late 1930s helped forestall the legislation.
   The onset of war and, in 1941, initiatives from the federal Curtin Labor
   government and the National Security (Wartime Banking Control)
   Regulations ended what was a decade-long struggle waged by the trading
   banks against greater government control of the banking sector.},

Title = {Geographies and politics of localism: The localism of the United
   Kingdom's coalition government},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {34},
Pages = {10-23},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {There has always been a localist element to British politics. But
   recently, a particular version of localism has been moved to the
   foreground by the 2011 Localism Act. This paper identifies various uses
   and meanings of localism, maps their geographical assumptions and
   effects, and critiques their politics. It does this using the localism
   of the United Kingdom's Coalition Government as a case study of localism
   in practice. The rationalities, mentalities, programmes, and
   technologies of this localism are established from Ministerial speeches
   and press releases, along with Parliamentary Acts, Bills, White Papers,
   Green Papers, and Statements - all published between May 2010 when the
   Coalition Government was formed, and November 2011 when the Localism Act
   became law. We argue that localism may be conceptualised as spatial
   liberalism, is never straightforwardly local, and can be anti-political.

Abstract = {This essay opens a perspective of potential governmentality on state
   transformation. It is argued that potential governmentality is a process
   of building a visionary script of an emergent governmental form linked
   to the creation of a new politico-economic path in a state. The essay
   discusses the idea of potential governmentality as a heuristic,
   elaborates the idea of state vigour as a generic form of governmentality
   and presents a case study in the context of the Finnish state. The essay
   is an attempt to chart a particular form of state transformation in the
   context of diffusing geoeconomic calculation.},

Abstract = {This paper studies the distributive impact of institutional change in
   developing countries. In such economies, property rights systems may
   preserve the interests of an influential minority, who can control
   key-markets, access to assets and investment opportunities, especially
   if they enjoy disproportionate political power. We test this hypothesis
   using cross-section and panel data methods on a sample of low- and
   middle-income economies from Africa, Asia and Latin America. Results
   suggest that: (a) increasing property rights protection increases income
   inequality; (b) this effect is larger in low-democracy environments; (c)
   some countries have developed political institutions capable of
   counterbalancing this effect.},

Abstract = {The role of source cue effects in transnational persuasion (in which a
   foreign actor attempts to persuade an audience in another jurisdiction)
   is largely unexplored in both the political communication and
   international relations literatures. This article investigates
   transnational source cue effects using two source cue experiments that
   test the persuasiveness of German chancellor Angela Merkel and UK prime
   minister David Cameron in a Canadian context. The experiments were
   embedded in an online survey administered to student participants at a
   Canadian university in January 2011. As might be expected, the foreign
   leaders exerted positive source cue effects among participants who held
   positive impressions of the leaders and backlash effects among those who
   held strongly negative impressions. These effects, however, were
   moderated by participants' level of political awareness, with the
   largest effects observed among participants who had an intermediate
   level of awareness. It is argued that this nonlinear moderating effect
   can be attributed to the countervailing effects of attitude stability
   and source familiarity (both of which are associated with political
   awareness) on individuals' susceptibility to source cue effects.
   Finally, cueing David Cameron had approximately equivalent source cue
   effects on participants' attitudes towards government spending on
   foreign aid and welfare, suggesting that foreign leaders may be able to
   move opinion on domestic as well as on foreign policy issues. Overall,
   these results validate existing models of source cue effects in a
   transnational context and point to the scope and limitations of national
   leaders' ability to engage in direct public diplomacy. {[}Supplementary

Abstract = {Maps are much more than geographic tools. They are powerful visual icons
   of statehood and identity. Created by agents tainted by their own
   historical subjectivity, maps are saturated with multiple levels of
   meaning, while their perceived status as accurate scientific tools lends
   them an authority which the map-reader is not meant to question. This
   paper examines maps from a Gadamerian hermeneutic perspective to
   investigate the layers of meaning embedded into these unquestioned,
   hypnotic emblems, and proposes that the maps produced and displayed by
   the European Union on its websites and in its continental currency are
   texts imbued with powerful imperial imaginations which reify a sense of
   collective identity and apparent superiority. This imagination is
   entwined with the territory of Europe and ultimately defines what it is
   to be European through the exclusion of the Other' those Europeans
   deemed unworthy of inclusion in the European imperium. Ultimately, the
   paper argues that maps of the Union reflect a subconscious yet gradually
   emerging imagination of Empire.},

Abstract = {Objective This study systematically investigates the factors that
   determine sending country openness or restrictiveness regarding
   intercountry adoption. It hypothesizes that larger orphan populations,
   greater global interconnectedness, and accession to the Hague Convention
   are associated with greater openness, whereas the political empowerment
   of women and larger Islamic populations are expected to be associated
   with greater restrictiveness. Methods The study employs an original,
   global data set to empirically test the significance of the hypothesized
   factors in explaining a country's openness to intercountry adoption.
   Results The study finds that burgeoning orphan populations are
   associated with greater openness to intercountry adoption and women's
   presence in political decision making is associated with greater
   restrictiveness. Conclusion The findings call into question the
   effectiveness of the current intercountry adoption regime.},

Abstract = {This paper focuses on recent theoretical contributions to the hospital
   price regulation literature. Besides the usual efficiency-rent
   extraction trade-off, some specific trade-off between quality
   enhancement and cost reduction effort or between efficiency and
   selection deterrence must be taken into account. Under moral hazard, we
   show how a prospective price can result in the first best allocation
   when health care demand increases with quality. When demand does not
   depend on quality, the first best can be achieved only in the case of a
   perfectly altruistic provider. Under adverse selection, we exhibit the
   optimal contract between a regulator and a provider when severity is not
   observable. Moreover, we analyze the consequences of the provider's
   altruism and we show how to deter patients' selection.},

Journal = {POLITICKA EKONOMIE},

Volume = {61},
Number = {5},
Pages = {639-652},
Abstract = {It is generally accepted, that output gap belongs to the main indicators
   of inflationary pressures and is often used by central banks when
   executing monetary policy. When output gap is positive, there are
   inflationary pressures in economy and inflation will rise. In case, that
   there is negative output gap in economy, inflation will decline. The aim
   of this paper is to find whether there is relationship between these two
   variables for Czech economy. To find the answer, two gap models
   following Coe, McDermott (1997) and Claus (2000a) will be used - with
   level of the output gap and change in the output gap. All tests confirm,
   that central bank should use it as indicator of inflation.},

Abstract = {The process commonly referred to as business-as-usual has given rise to
   dangerous climate change, but its social history remains strangely
   unexplored. A key moment in its onset was the transition to steam power
   as a source of rotary motion in commodity production, in Britain and,
   first of all, in its cotton industry. This article tries to approach the
   dynamics of the fossil economy by examining the causes of the transition
   from water to steam in the British cotton industry in the second quarter
   of the nineteenth century. Common perceptions of the shift as driven by
   scarcity are refuted, and it is shown that the choice of steam was
   motivated by a rather different concern: power over labour. Turning away
   from standard interpretations of the role of energy in the industrial
   revolution, this article opens a dialogue with Marx on matters of carbon
   and outlines a theory of fossil capital, better suited for understanding
   the drivers of business-as-usual as it continues to this day.},

Abstract = {This paper introduces possibilities for applying the economics of
   religion in Central European context. It reviews economic literature on
   religion, both the modern tradition of economic analysis of religious
   behavior and the Weberian tradition of analyzing consequences of
   religion for economy. Two local applications are used for illustration.
   The first one is an analysis of religious participation in
   post-communist countries; the second one is an examination of the role
   of religion in the post-communist transition. Changes in religious
   participation can be interpreted, among other models, using a model of
   individual time allocation. This model provides a good explanation for
   the post-communist period. The examination of the role of religion in
   the post-communist transition indicates that Western Christianity
   provides better conditions for introducing free market institutions as
   compared to Orthodox Christianity and Islam. Suggestions for further
   research are provided in the conclusion.},

Abstract = {The focus is on the misalignment between territory and the legal
   construct encasing the sovereign authority of the state over its
   territory-territoriality. The aim is to make visible that territory
   cannot be reduced to either national territory or state territory, and
   thereby to give the category territory a measure of conceptual autonomy
   from the nation-state. Beyond an intellectual project, this analysis
   seeks to enable a conceptual mobilizing of the category territory, here
   understood as a complex capability with embedded logics of
   power/empowerment and of claim making, some worthy and some more akin to
   power-grabs.},

Title = {How do Competing Interest Groups Influence Environmental Policy? The
   Case of Renewable Electricity in Industrialized Democracies, 1989-2007},
Journal = {POLITICAL STUDIES},

Volume = {61},

Abstract = {In this article, we examine the effect of competing interest groups on
   environmental policy. We argue that the supporters of environmental
   policy should be the most influential in the absence of opposition,
   while the opposition's importance is maximized when the supporter
   coalition is strong. This highlights an important asymmetry between
   competing interest groups: supporters are decisive in the absence of
   opposition, while the opposition is only relevant if the supporters are
   already strong. We test the argument against data on renewable
   electricity generation in nineteen OECD countries, 1989-2007. Heavy
   industries have particularly strong incentives to oppose policies that
   support renewables, because heavy industries' profitability depends on
   inexpensive electricity. We find that the supporter coalition has a
   positive effect on the growth of renewable electricity generation, but
   the positive effect diminishes with the strength of manufacturing.
   Moreover, heavy industry has a negative effect on the growth of
   renewable electricity generation and this effect increases with the
   strength of the supporter coalition.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to discuss two key challenges in the area of
   cyber-resilience. First, it asks: who owns UK cyber-resilience? Some 80
   per cent of the UK's critical national infrastructure is in private
   hands and the last decade has seen efforts to legislate away some of the
   problem of resilience by creating legal duties for service providers.
   This has contributed to a new ecology for intelligence, security and
   resilience consisting of complex state-private citizen partnerships.
   However, it is unlikely that populations will accept this approach to
   risk-shifting when systems fail. Second, it considers what constitutes
   genuinely robust cyber-defence after the Stuxnet event of 2010.
   Arguably, any system that depends on information technology, however
   well protected, is now vulnerable. There is a dawning realisation that
   the best technical solutions offer only partial assurance.
   Paradoxically, in an era when the Internet seems ubiquitous, a mixture
   of analogue and manual systems - often called systems diversity - offers
   a solution. However, mixed or diverse systems are a declining legacy and
   not the result of design. We close by discussing the immense challenges
   that the growing prevalence of electronic systems will bring.},

Abstract = {Contemporary Western war-fighting is animated by the fictitious
   imagination of a war free from antagonism. In this logic, winning wars
   is about winning the hearts and minds' of local populations, about
   persuasion rather than confrontation. In recent years, the concept of
   strategic communication' (SC) has been elevated to the top echelons of
   strategic thinking in United States military circles, focusing attention
   on how to communicate effectively' with local populations. Via an
   analysis of the concept of SC, this article examines the
   ethico-political dimensions of contemporary Western-led
   population-centric' war. Through a reading inspired by Judith Butler's
   recent work in Precarious life (London: Verso 2006) and Frames of war
   (London: Verso 2009), and an analysis that turns on the link between
   ethics and ontology, I reflect on the significance of the communications
   turn' in warfare for our study of war in ontological terms.},

Abstract = {What happens when the international' as a distinct social space is
   approached from the perspective of war rather than war from the
   perspective of the international'? Tarak Barkawi's question (Millennium,
   39:3, 2011, 701-706) is best answered by attempts to understand war not
   as part of inter/intra-state relations but as a socio-cultural,
   trans-historical institution that impacts on the everyday' lives of men,
   women and children. In this article I argue that war is not a disruption
   of the everyday', an abstraction that has a definite beginning and end,
   something we enter into and exit. Instead, it can be captured in daily
   and mundane lived experiences of people and in powerful emotions that
   constitute self', community and the other.' Drawing upon my research on
   wars in South Asia, I particularly reflect on how war shapes the banal
   and the fervent and how cultural and political narratives of war bodies'
   perform the international' in a variety of ways. Most significantly I
   want to draw attention to how international relations as a scholarly
   discipline is so deeply engaged with war and yet seems to have an
   estranged relationship with it.},

Title = {Reconceptualizing Gender, Reinscribing Racial-Sexual Boundaries in
   International Security: The Case of UN Security Council Resolution 1325
   on ``Women, Peace and Security{''}},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {57},
Number = {4},
Pages = {772-783},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The gendered boundaries of international security, historically
   identified by feminist scholarship, are being broken down since the
   passage of UN Security Council Resolution 1325, which calls on member
   states to mainstream a gender perspective into matters of conflict and
   peacebuilding. However, we should not read this as a positive step
   toward the transformation of the lives of women (and men) in conflict
   zones. Reading 1325 and subsequent resolutions through a postcolonial
   feminist lens reveals that this reconceptualization of gender occurs
   through a reinscription of racial-sexual boundaries, evocative of the
   political economy of imperialism. An examination of the discourses and
   practices of the war on terror exposes a similar configuration of
   gender, race, and sexuality. I argue that 1325 works in tandem with
   dominant security practices and discourses in the post-9/11 moment,
   normalizing the violence of counterterrorism and counterinsurgency
   measures. Understanding the significance of race and sexuality in the
   conceptualization of gender has implications for transnational feminist
   praxis and its ability to construct a counter-hegemonic project to
   transform the dominant structures of power that give rise to war,
   conflict, insecurity, and injustice.},

Abstract = {Do audience costs have to be extremely large in order to credibly signal
   resolve and affect international crises? Existing theoretical work on
   audience costs suggests an affirmative answer, and recent empirical work
   on audience costs focuses on whether a leader can generate such large
   audience costs as to create a commitment to fight where no such
   commitment previously existed. We analyze a richer crisis bargaining
   model with audience costs and find that (1) audience costs can have
   war-reducing effects on incomplete-information crisis bargaining through
   a noninformative, bargaining-leverage mechanism and (2) audience costs
   can have war-reducing effects even when such large audience costs are
   not being generated as to create a commitment to fight where no such
   commitment previously existed. Even more limited audience costs can have
   war-reducing effects in international crises. We discuss how the
   bargaining-leverage mechanism is consistent with a number of prominent
   historical cases.},

Abstract = {This two-part special issue on Understanding Localism indicates that
   this has become an increasingly important issue in a number of
   disciplines, although, as the introduction to the first issue
   highlighted, the focus on the local' is not new. It is perhaps
   unsurprising that Gentry, a Historian, and Clarke, a Geographer,
   particularly emphasise this point, although their concern is with
   locality and the local', rather than localism, which is a term that is
   much more recent and most closely associated with Public Policy
   research, and indeed practice. Here, we explore the disciplinary
   differences in approaches to the broad issues discussed here in a little
   more detail before turning to look specifically at developments in the
   public policy field in more detail. However, we begin by raising a
   question which is obvious on any reading of the articles in the two
   issues: the extent to which localism is a normative as well as an
   empirical issue.},

Title = {Localism and the paradox of devolution: delegated citizen committees in
   Victoria, Australia},

Abstract = {A central ideal in community localism is the notion of participatory
   devolution; that citizens ought to be engaged, supported and included in
   local decision-making. Community localism views participatory engagement
   as a vital ingredient in the quest to empower communities and enliven
   local democracy. Yet, critics argue that, in practice, many
   participatory initiatives inspired by community localism fail to empower
   citizens because they represent one-off consultation exercises with
   limited devolution of responsibility or control. This paper contributes
   to this debate by examining how participatory devolution is enacted in
   the messy world of local governance. It focuses on the use of a
   participatory mechanism that has received little attention in localism
   debates, the delegated citizen committee. These are committees composed
   of volunteer citizens who have formal devolved power to manage local
   assets, such as public halls or sporting fields, and, in some cases, to
   make decisions on broader policy issues. Drawing on the experiences of a
   local government in Victoria, Australia, the article asks what work do
   delegated citizen committees do?; who participates?; what issues do they
   affect?; and how are they supported? The study finds that, in practice,
   many delegated citizen committees have devolved responsibility to
   perform managerial and administrative services, but, paradoxically, they
   have limited influence on the broader functioning of local democracy.},

Journal = {GLOBAL POLICY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {4},
Number = {4},
Pages = {434-441},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Soil degradation is a critical and growing global problem. As the world
   population increases, pressure on soil also increases and the natural
   capital of soil faces continuing decline. International policy makers
   have recognized this and a range of initiatives to address it have
   emerged over recent years. However, a gap remains between what the
   science tells us about soil and its role in underpinning ecological and
   human sustainable development, and existing policy instruments for
   sustainable development. Functioning soil is necessary for ecosystem
   service delivery, climate change abatement, food and fiber production
   and fresh water storage. Yet key policy instruments and initiatives for
   sustainable development have under-recognized the role of soil in
   addressing major challenges including food and water security,
   biodiversity loss, climate change and energy sustainability. Soil
   science has not been sufficiently translated to policy for sustainable
   development. Two underlying reasons for this are explored and the new
   concept of soil security is proposed to bridge the science-policy
   divide. Soil security is explored as a conceptual framework that could
   be used as the basis for a soil policy framework with soil carbon as an
   exemplar indicator.},

Title = {Beyond consent and coercion: using republican political theory to
   understand international hierarchies},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL THEORY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {5},
Number = {3},
Pages = {382-413},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In categorizing international hierarchies, theorists often emphasize
   some balance between levels of consent and coercion. I show that
   emphasis on these terms is conceptually problematic. Borrowing insights
   from republican political theory, I argue that we can better distinguish
   hierarchies on the basis of whether they feature domination. Under
   domination the subordinate's freedom of choice is contingent upon the
   predilections of the superordinate state, which can assert its supremacy
   whenever and possibly, however, it may please. Moreover, subordinate
   states cannot unilaterally and peacefully withdraw from the hierarchy.
   By contrast, in hierarchies of non-domination the superordinate state
   enjoys the `powers of attorney' with which it might be permitted to
   practice coercion in order to advance an agreed-upon goal. The contract
   underpinning this type of hierarchy also allows for the unilateral and
   peaceful termination by the subordinate, either through withdrawal or
   expiry. I demonstrate the applicability of this conceptual framework by
   examining Soviet and American relations with Central-Eastern and Western
   Europe, respectively, during the Cold War.},

Abstract = {Welfare state research tends to assume strong and enduring public
   support for welfare state institutions. We challenge this assumption and
   show that in times of economic crisis, positive welfare state attitudes
   are confronted with conflicting preferences for improvement of labour
   market performance. We argue that such movements in public opinion have
   led to issue competition among major political parties and subsequent
   radical reform of unemployment insurance in two least-likely cases. In
   both Germany and Sweden, incumbent governments were losing voters'
   confidence as a result of high and persistent unemployment. In Germany,
   the social democratic government saw falling competence ratings at the
   same time as the issue of unemployment was highly salient among voters.
   In order to win back confidence, the party shifted its policy stance and
   introduced reforms which reshaped the unemployment insurance system. In
   Sweden, the situation was similar with falling ratings for the social
   democratic government and high levels of salience for the issue of
   unemployment among voters. When the government did not introduce
   reforms, the opposition moved in and won issue ownership, and
   subsequently the election, on an agenda of radical reform.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION},

Volume = {57},
Number = {5},

Abstract = {Can issue linkage, the combining of multiple issues into a single
   agreement, enhance the credibility of an agreement? I use the alliance
   relations of buffer states (states located between two recently or
   currently warring rivals) to test the claim that issue linkage enhances
   compliance with treaty obligations. The alliance relations of buffer
   states create a hard case for treaty compliance because, by being prone
   to invasion and occupation, buffer states have difficulties inducing
   states to remain committed to an alliance agreement. Hence, if linkage
   provisions can enhance the credibility of alliance commitments for
   buffer states, then linkage provisions should improve treaty compliance
   in nearly any context. I find that buffer states in alliances with trade
   provisions experience fewer opportunistic violations of the alliance
   terms, avoid occupation and invasion at a higher rate, and experience
   fewer third-party attacks than buffer states in other alliance
   arrangements.},

Abstract = {International institutions help governments make credible commitments to
   other state and nonstate actors by raising the costs of commitment
   violation. However, in doing so these institutions generate sovereignty
   costs for national governments by constraining the autonomy they have to
   develop and implement policy. Governments respond to this trade-off
   between the credibility of commitments and policy autonomy differently
   depending on their time horizons and this shapes their preferences over
   the design of credibility-enhancing institutions. Governments with long
   time horizons expect to govern in the future, anticipate that conditions
   may shift over time, and therefore seek institutional designs that will
   afford them greater freedom to modify policies in response to changing
   economic and political conditions. Governments with shorter time
   horizons, on the other hand, do not anticipate being in power long into
   the future and therefore are less concerned about maintaining greater
   room to manipulate policy. I develop this argument in the context of
   bilateral investment treaties (BITs), focusing in particular on the
   legalization of obligation in national treatment commitments. I test the
   argument using an original data set of the design of national treatment
   obligations in a random sample of 342 BITs. I find that net importers of
   FDI with longer time horizons are more likely to build in greater policy
   autonomy in their BITs by scaling back the legalization of their
   national treatment obligations and that this relationship is robust to
   controlling for selection into investment treaties.},

Abstract = {The growing number of preferential trading arrangements (PTAs) since
   World War II has generated substantial interest in their economic and
   political effects. It has also prompted interest in the factors that
   give rise to PTAs, but very little research has been conducted on the
   growth of extant PTAs. To address this shortcoming, we analyze why some
   arrangements expand, whereas others do not. We find strong evidence that
   expansion is most likely when the existing members of a PTA display a
   high degree of trade openness and when the size distribution of these
   members is fairly uniform. We also find that PTAs that add new members
   are likely to do so again in the near future and that, throughout the
   global system, PTAs tend to expand in clusters. Equally, there is some
   indication that the market size of a PTA affects its odds of expansion.
   Finally, we investigate which states join enlarging PTAs. We find that
   PTAs expand by taking on new members that are economically and
   politically similar to existing members.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to analyze the efforts of the Project on
   Emerging Nanotechnologies (PEN) in seeking to influence nanotechnology
   policy in the United States. Using the conceptual framework of
   anticipatory governance to guide the analysis, a series of strategies
   that PEN adopted will be described, including leveraging external
   expertise, developing cross-disciplinary research products, providing a
   future-oriented view on policy analysis, and building a brand for
   communications and outreach. This case study is a useful example in
   demonstrating the recent conceptual shift away from relying on
   government-led technology assessment efforts to consider the longer-term
   implications of new technologies toward the concept of anticipatory
   governance that includes a more substantive role for nongovernmental
   actors, that in providing forward-looking, actionable intelligence for
   decision makers. Considering the example of PEN also highlights the
   critical role that boundary-spanning organizations play in linking
   together disparate communities of expertise.},

Abstract = {Buzan and Lawson (2012) urge IR scholars to consider what the 19th
   century can teach us about the contemporary world. Although we agree
   that IR scholars should draw from a wider range of historical
   experiences in formulating and testing their theories, we disagree with
   Buzan and Lawson's contentions that the lessons of the 19th century are
   self-evident. We argue that the 19th century may have been either an
   aberration in human history, during which the traditional political and
   economic centers of gravity were temporarily displaced by Western Europe
   and its offshoots, or a Singularity, in which the takeoff of the
   industrial revolution fundamentally changed the relationship of
   politics, culture, and economics. In either case, the 19th century may
   have less to tell us about contemporary IR than Buzan and Lawson
   suggest.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {20},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1174-1195},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Although European welfare states receive high levels of public support,
   insights into what kind of welfare state individuals prefer - i.e., one
   based on the redistributive principle of equity, of equality or of need
   - is scarce and fragmented. Using the 2008 wave of the European Social
   Survey, we find that most European populations share a preference for
   applying the equality principle to unemployment benefits, while they are
   divided over applying equity and equality for pension schemes.
   Individual determinants of preferences confirm that the haves' prefer
   equity over equality, while the have-nots' prefer the need principle
   more. At the country level, cross-national variation in redistribution
   preferences is low for unemployment benefits and cannot be explained by
   relevant context factors; preferences for pension redistribution depends
   upon its institutional design and social expenditure: welfare generosity
   curbs the preference for equity.},

Title = {Nano-Industry Operationalizations of ``Responsibility{''}: Charting

Abstract = {The Collingridge dilemmathe problem of reacting to emerging technology
   either too early or too lateis one that is readily recognized by
   developers and promoters of nanotechnologies. One response can be found
   in the rise of a discourse of responsible development in the science and
   innovation policy landscape. While a number of commentators have
   discussed the potential of such initiatives, it remains unclear how
   responsible development is actually being configured on the ground, in
   private sector nanotechnology. This paper addresses this question by
   analyzing empirical engagements in Europe and the United States in order
   to map industry operationalizations of responsibility in these contexts.
   We show that a number of different articulations of responsibility are
   present, including as a response to public lack of trust and perceived
   public pressure, and as the management of risk. We close by relating
   these findings to the theoretical literature on responsibility, other
   contemporary accounts of the ways in which responsible development can
   be operationalized, and the possibilities that these articulations of
   responsibility may open up.},

Title = {Chinese State-owned Enterprise Investments in Uganda: Findings from a
   Recent Survey of Chinese Firms in Kampala},

Abstract = {Within the large body of China-Africa literature, there is a growing
   body of literature that differentiates between China's various economic
   actors, more specifically between its state-owned and private
   enterprises. This paper intends to contribute to this literature by
   comparing Chinese state-owned enterprises and hybrid (mixed owned)
   enterprises with private enterprises in Kampala, the capital of Uganda.
   An air of mystery often surrounds Chinese companies in Africa, this
   paper will provide some clarity concerning companies in Kampala. To do
   this we first look at the governmental assistance given to these
   companies, then the kind of assistance they potentially receive. Next we
   investigate what motivated these companies to come to Uganda, and how
   they established themselves, whether it is after a Chinese aid project
   or construction job, or some other route. We further investigate the
   size, employment policy and markets of these Chinese state-owned
   enterprises in Kampala. Finally we look at the employment of Ugandan
   labour and management, the problems faced by the enterprises and the
   environmental challenges, as well as how these are dealt with. We
   conclude that Chinese SOEs and mixed ownership companies in Uganda are
   involved in a small range of sectors, often capital-intensive sectors
   such as oil and construction, and are therefore also larger than the
   majority of the Chinese private enterprises. SOEs and mixed ownership
   enterprises tend to have arrived in Uganda earlier than most private
   enterprises, face slightly different problems, and are more interested
   in the Ugandan market as whole than their privately owned counterparts.
   More importantly, they have greater proportions of local employees and
   are more interested in indigenizing their workforces.},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Institutional collective action (ICA) dilemmas arise from the division
   or partitioning of authority in which decisions by one government in one
   or more specific functional area impacts other governments and/or other
   functions. The focus on externalities of choice in fragmented systems
   integrates multiple research traditions into a conceptual system to
   understand and investigate collective dilemmas ubiquitous in
   contemporary governance arrangements. The mechanisms for mitigating ICA
   dilemmas are classified according to their scope and enforcement.
   Incentives to participate in a mechanism are hypothesized to favor
   mechanisms that provide the greatest gain for the least cost under
   different conditions of collaboration risk as determined by the nature
   of the underlying ICA problem, the compositions of affected
   jurisdictions, and institutional contexts. After reviewing empirical
   applications of the framework, an agenda to advance the theoretical and
   empirical development of the ICA approach is advanced.},

Abstract = {The paper deals with comparison of fiscal decentralization systems in
   EU-27 according to selected quantitative criteria and certain European
   Charter of Local Self-Government principles. The results of comparative
   analysis show that a higher number of lower levels of government usually
   indicate a greater share of local finance within the total public
   finance, however, this finding does not confirm the inverse link. Even
   though the structure of expenditures in EU-27 countries is quite
   similar, the shares of funds for the implementation of individual tasks
   and competencies differ significantly from country to country. On
   average, the countries allocate most funds to education, social
   security, healthcare, administration and political systems, with only a
   quarter of the countries recording the same or higher amounts of
   revenues than expenditures. Most of the countries still cover the
   existing deficit either through transfers from the central to lower
   levels of government or through equalisation schemes or borrowing, which
   otherwise represents a departure from one of the basic principles of the
   Charter, which stipulates that financial resources must be commensurate
   with the responsibilities of local self-government.},

Abstract = {Despite a sharp fall in GDP, German employment in terms of employees
   stayed remarkably robust during the Great Recession. At the same time,
   hours worked per employee declined significantly. This is seen as the
   core of the German employment miracle'. A general discussion arose about
   the reasons behind this astonishing labour market performance and the
   role of short-time work (STW) as a kind of exportable panacea. In this
   article we look at the macroeconomic implications of STW and other
   measures of internal flexibility, in particular focusing on the
   quantification of safeguarded jobs during the crisis. We find that STW
   played an important role and helped to safeguard employment in Germany
   during the Great Recession. However, we show that other measures of
   internal flexibility (working time accounts, contractual arrangements on
   working time reductions, reduction of overtime) were equally important.
   Together with STW these instruments saved around 1 million jobs. To
   explain and understand the German success story, the features of the
   German core model - with a strong employer-employee relationship of
   mutual trust, strong employment protection, traditional standard working
   contracts and strong works councils at the firm level - are of key
   importance.},

Abstract = {The World Bank has always sold ideas, not just loans. Starting in 1996,
   then president James Wolfensohn rebranded the Bank by articulating a
   formal vision of a Knowledge Banka provider of state-of-the-art
   expertise on development. After a number of internal changes and
   assessments, the Bank is acknowledging that it needs to be more humble,
   pluralistic, and practical. Why do some regard the Bank as a legitimate
   knowledge actor, whereas others contest that authority? We offer an
   analytical framework that can explain stakeholders' uneven recognition
   of the Bank's knowledge role. When stakeholders define knowledge as
   products, the Bank generally obtains recognition for the quality and

   and its role within this consensus through an examination of development
   policy aimed at farmer empowerment in Kenya. This is investigated with a
   focus upon coffee producers in the context of Kenya's coffee reforms and
   the restructuring of the global coffee industry. While acknowledging the
   limitations of the dominant approach, exacerbated in the African context
   due to a problematic interpretation of the African state, it is argued
   that analyses of empowerment should also consider the opportunities for
   its re-politicisation. Drawing upon Gramscian thought, this article
   suggests that fair trade initiatives have the potential to offer an
   alternative approach to farmer empowerment more capable of challenging
   the concentration of power among roasters and buyers that has taken
   place within the coffee industry.},

Abstract = {The concept of community policing is based on constant consultations
   between the police and the local self-government and a complex system of
   preventative responses. A qualitative approach has been applied in a
   rural community based on the analysis of administrative documents from
   2003 to 2011, direct observation and a survey examining the attitudes of
   65 police officers who participated directly in the project
   implementation. The major findings include the existence of a
   centralized police model and traditional policing, the resistance of low
   and middle managers to change and the absence of continuous
   consultations between the police and local self-government.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the impact of globalization and the responses of
   farming communities in Bilar, a municipality in the province of Bohol,
   Philippines. In particular, it looks at the impact of the Plant Variety
   Protection Act of 2002, one expression of the Philippine government's
   commitment to the World Trade Organization's Agreement on Trade-Related
   Intellectual Property Rights. It uses everyday politics and history from
   below as frameworks of analysis and takes into consideration the
   strategic relations of contexts and actors. This paper also looks into
   and assesses the perceptions and courses of action taken by farmers as
   they interact with civil society groups and local and national
   governments in response to the effects of the law. The findings suggest
   that while the law has no direct impact yet in the community, different
   groups of farmers have different responses to it. Some farmers have
   taken a more proactive role in ensuring safeguards to their livelihood
   and traditional seed systems against the perceived threats posed by the
   law with the assistance of a non-government organization. Other farmers
   have reservations about the pro-active actions of the first group of
   farmers and continue with their traditional systems.},

Abstract = {Twitter has become an established feature of the contemporary landscape.
   It has been used by, among others, politicians, political parties,
   governments, international organisations, charities, think-tanks and
   individuals from academics to celebrities. Twitter has also been subject
   to a great deal of debate and analysis. This includes its impact on the
   relationship between government and citizens, a point that came to the
   fore in the 2011 Arab Spring when Twitter provided an important
   communication vehicle for popular uprising. However, less has been
   written on the use and impact of Twitter as a method to support learning
   and teaching. This article examines the use of Twitter as a way of
   promoting student engagement, arguing that it offers the opportunity to
   democratise student learning.},

   Civilian Casualty Tolerance},

Abstract = {In times of war, news media coverage of the plight of civilian
   casualties plays a critical role in shaping attitudes regarding war's
   human costs. We proposed that these attitudes may also be
   surreptitiously influenced by the commercial advertisements that often
   accompany this coverage. Specifically, we hypothesized that when
   newspaper articles pertaining to civilian victims of war are flanked by
   luxury ads, conservatives, relative to liberals, will subsequently
   exhibit less concern for these victims. This proposition was based on
   the notion that commercial ads, particularly those promoting luxury
   items, make salient the gap between the haves and the have-nots and
   thereby, at least implicitly, threaten the legitimacy of the current
   socioeconomic system. Drawing upon system justification theory, we
   posited that this threat would lead individuals with stronger
   system-justification tendencies (conservatives), relative to those more
   open to challenging the current system (liberals), to show greater
   tolerance for civilian war casualties in order to defend the system's
   integrity. Evidence consistent with this hypothesis was found in a
   quasi-experimental study (n=329).},

Abstract = {This paper examines the nexus between political instability and economic
   growth in 10 CEE countries in transition in the period 1990-2009. Our
   results support the contention that political instability defined as a
   propensity for government change had a negative impact on growth. On the
   other hand, there was no causality in the opposite direction. A
   sensitivity analysis based on the application of a few hundred different
   variants of the initial econometric model confirmed the abovementioned
   findings only in the case where major government changes were applied to
   the definition of political instability. (C) 2013 The Regents of the

Abstract = {Corruption is perceived in all societies as a social pathology that
   causes great material and moral damage and is a threat to the society's
   continual development. Especially in countries with a freshly
   consolidated democracy, as Slovenia, the phenomena of corruption must be
   treated with all due attention. This article emphasises that corruption
   in Slovenia is publicly perceived as one of the most important and even
   increasing problems in society. We are also analysing one of the crucial
   side effects of the corruption, resulting itself in ever deeper public
   distrust to most significant political and administrative institutions.

Journal = {REVISTA DEL CLAD REFORMA Y DEMOCRACIA},
Year = {2013},
Number = {56},
Pages = {5+},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In this paper, based on the results obtained from a recent regional
   study on civil service professionalization in Central America and the
   Dominican Republic, and from two other evaluations conducted previously
   by the very same task force, it is presented the situation of civil
   services in this region.
   The contents are organized in the following way. Firstly, it is exposed
   the conceptual framework and analytical methodology designed for the
   study. Secondly, it is developed its main results grouped according to
   five indexes (efficiency, merit, structural consistency, functional
   capacity and integration capacity) that constitute the main quality
   measures for an institutional system of public employment, according to
   the conceptual framework. Thirdly, it is offered a complementary view of
   the results, this time organized in terms of seven human resource
   management subsystems, which allow for a more instrumental approach and,
   therefore, for a more precise diagnosis of strengths and weaknesses of
   policies and practices in each country.
   From these results, the main conclusion is that there have been slight
   advances in human resource planning and meritocratic incorporation of
   public officers in several countries in the region. Nevertheless, there
   are still big challenges in terms of performance appraisals,
   compensation and development management, which make it very difficult to
   establish effective incentive structures for public employees. The
   document closes with a series of suggestions of critical issues to
   consider in order to professionalize civil services in Central American
   countries.},

Abstract = {The political movement led by Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez is
   subject to internal contradictions that play themselves out on various
   fronts. Members of three major social groups-the organized working
   class, the middle sectors, and the traditionally unincorporated
   sectors-identify with different lines of thinking and defend different
   interests. Chavismo's internal political currents correspond to distinct
   leftist traditions. One adheres to the Marxist view of the organized
   working class as the main vanguard, another focuses on economic
   objectives, and a third stresses revolutionary values. Three important
   areas of struggle in the recent past have impacted these internal
   currents: expropriations, factional strife in the Chavista labor
   movement, and the community councils. The expropriations, far from
   obeying preconceived ideological notions corresponding to one of the
   three currents, were a response to the challenges posed by the private
   sector linked to the opposition. The gradual and peaceful path to
   socialism faces two challenges without easy solutions: one is an enemy
   whose tactics force the government to respond in ways that sometimes
   intensify conflict and the other is cleavages among members of the
   movement who have greater capacity for mobilization than in the past.},

Abstract = {This article examines the role and use of discourse as a means of
   affecting EU cohesion policy reform. A discursive shift is traced to a
   place-based narrative, which sought to re-legitimize and reconnect the
   policy with its foundational principles during the post-2013 policy
   review. It is argued that the impact of the narrative on the
   Commission's proposals has been only partially effective owing to
   deep-rooted ideational, interest-driven and organizational resistance
   and tensions relating to the policy's objectives, governance and
   relationship with Europe 2020. Implications are drawn for ideational
   analysis in the EU.},

Abstract = {There is a widespread belief that a credible threat of governmental
   intervention was necessary to prompt industry to intensify its
   self-regulatory efforts. However, using the example of self-regulation
   in the European intermodal transport industry, this article suggests
   that this belief needs to be refined. The European Commission's threat
   to tighten the regulatory framework directly led to the failure of
   self-regulation and, somewhat paradoxically, also triggered a political
   process at the end of which the existing regulatory framework was
   relaxed. Based on the theory of policy image and venue shifts, the
   article provides an explanation of the counterproductive und unintended
   effect of the shadow of hierarchy.},

Title = {Forum Shopping in Global Governance: Understanding States, Business and
   NGOs in Multiple Arenas},
Journal = {GLOBAL POLICY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {4},
Number = {2},
Pages = {139-149},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The political strategy of forum shopping is an under-researched but
   highly relevant concept for understanding the dynamics of global
   governance. Forum shopping involves actors seeking to realise their
   policy objectives within preferred policy arenas on the basis of an
   arena's particular governing characteristics. We examine the forum
   shopping behaviour of the key states, business and non-governmental
   groups in regard to three policy issues: labour standards, intellectual
   property rights, and chemicals regulation. Our preliminary analysis is
   centred around the questions of why actors forum shop, the circumstances
   in which forum shopping enables actors to succeed in promoting their
   interests, and the impact of forum shopping on the effectiveness of
   global governance. Our cases suggest an arena's membership, issue
   mandate, decision making procedures and enforcement capacity are the key
   characteristics that shape actors' arena preferences. Another important
   implication is that a multi-arena global governance system comprised of
   duplication and overlap in issue mandate (rather than large multilateral
   single issue arenas) may be beneficial for advancing actors' policy
   agendas. The overarching goal of the article is to spark more systematic
   research into the often practiced but under-theorised phenomenon of
   forum shopping. Policy Implications center dot Global governance is
   achieved through action in multiple arenas, which provide different
   opportunities for political action. An arena's membership, issue
   mandate, decision making procedures and enforcement capacity should be
   taken into account by policymakers in assessing appropriate arenas for
   advancing their goals. center dot Entrepreneurial actors take advantage
   of strategic inconsistencies' in the characteristics of international
   policy arenas in order to progress or block the development of proposals
   through incremental decisions. center dot Policymakers must be alert to
   the likely use of forum shopping by other actors, including business
   actors and NGOs, which may advance or stymie the development of policy
   agendas in one arena via action in alternative arenas.},

Abstract = {Environmental politics research frequently centres on the analysis of
   networks but predominantly from a qualitative perspective. The case is
   made for combining quantitative analysis of policy networks alongside
   qualitative research. This enables the structure and form of the network
   to be considered and focused attention then paid to how actors
   operationalise the network and give agency to the position of central
   nodes. This is explored through an empirical analysis of the issue
   network surrounding the zero-carbon built environment agenda in the
   United Kingdom in 200911. It demonstrates the diffuse yet clustered
   nature of the network and the importance of expertise claims, internal
   communication, resources, a unified voice and the organisational
   business model in shaping organisations' activities within the network.},

Abstract = {Transitional justice is facing a kind of inverted paradox of success:
   The less effective its mechanisms seem to be in their efforts to build
   democracy and peace, the more we are demanding from them. This article
   chronicles the intellectual evolution of the field and its current
   efforts to address what are perceived to be the conceptual shortcomings
   of the approach. In doing so, it shows that to overcome its perceived
   limitations, and measure more precisely the effectiveness of its
   mechanisms, scholars are looking outside the paradigm to address how
   transitional justice may be more successful and lasting in repairing and
   restoring states and societies wrought with violence and human rights
   abuses. In mapping out the transitions of transitional justice and
   contemporary efforts to move the field forward, I argue that to better
   understand its effectiveness, we need to examine its impact on not only
   the short-term tensions of addressing victims' claims but also on the
   long-term goals of creating conditions that secure the peace and
   prosperity of peoples.},

Abstract = {Political science traditionally conceptualizes efficacy only in relation
   to politics and government. In this article, we look beyond political
   efficacy and examine the effect of general self-efficacy on young
   adults' voting behavior. General self-efficacy, an individual's
   estimation of capacity to operate successfully across a variety of
   domains, is often important to the behavioral decisions of individuals
   entering a new domain of activity. With data from the Children of the
   National Longitudinal Study of Youth, we examine the effect of general
   self-efficacy on voting behavior among young, first-time voters. We find
   that general self-efficacy has a positive effect on voter turnout, and
   this effect is strongest for young people from low socioeconomic-status
   families.},

Abstract = {In the last decades, there has been a spectacular increase in the number
   of entities providing public services in Spain. Functional
   decentralisation and externalisation processes became relevant and they
   made it possible to modernise the Spanish public sector, which was out
   of touch with new ideas in the rest of the Europe. In this study, we
   expose the evolution of these processes from 1999 to 2010, through a
   qualitative analysis using the biplot technique. The results show a
   trend toward functional decentralisation that is more important in the
   largest cities, especially through the creation of public companies and
   autonomous organisations.},

Abstract = {Saleh's solution to the civil-military problematic' (to borrow Peter
   Feaver's phrase) was to build powerful praetorian units and place his
   relatives in command of them, a counter-productive approach that
   ultimately increased the risk that Saleh faced. During Yemen's Arab
   Spring uprisings, sections of the armed forces not controlled by
   President Ali Abd'allah Saleh's siblings and cousins sought to ride the
   wave of popular revolt and emerge as a cohesive power-base in the
   post-Saleh period. To achieve these aims the military establishment made
   a conscious effort to let the tribes and civil society activists lead
   the assault on the Saleh government.},

Abstract = {Case selection is ubiquitous in public management research. Rarely do
   scholars have access to entire populations of interest. Yet, the manner
   by which scholars select samples to conduct their analyses can have
   profound consequences on their ability both to draw valid causal
   inferences and to estimate accurate relationships. In this article, we
   review the basic threats to inference that are likely to emerge in the
   presence of non-random case selection, with specific attention to their
   manifestation in empirical public management research. The article first
   reviews the threats to causal inference presented by case selection,
   focusing on their implications for internal and external validity. We
   then summarize a standard set of solutions to address potential problems
   for empirical models caused by non-random case selection. As part of
   this discussion, we review recent articles published in this journal to
   illustrate the prevalence of selection issues in contemporary public
   management studies, and then illustrate several techniques that have
   been developed to overcome specific problems to show their utility for
   public management research.},

   and March 2011. The regime's coup-proofing strategy has been efficient.
   It is notably based on the exclusion of the Shias from the security
   apparatus in a country where the ruling dynasty comes from the Sunni
   minority and where the opposition is dominated by Shia Islamic
   movements. However, the recruitment pattern of the Bahraini security
   forces also results from the general civil-military relations
   characteristic of all the Gulf states. The increasingly tense
   factionalism inside the regime is likely to have an impact on the
   security forces.},

Abstract = {The two institutions forming the bicameral EU legislature, Council and
   European Parliament, are composed of representatives who belong to
   national political parties. In traditional European bicameral systems,
   parties are the main factor linking the different chambers. Do national
   parties similarly provide a linkage mechanism between chambers in the
   EU, by co-ordinating voting behaviour of ministers and MEPs? For
   example, do MEPs unite with their' minister against a proposal if
   sincere national or party-political interests are touched? Based on a
   dataset combining Council votes with EP roll-calls, the analysis reveals
   that voting behaviour might differ considerably between institutions.
   While ministers are subject to the logic of Council consensus, MEPs are
   influenced by their transnational EP groups. Internal party
   co-ordination across institutions is thus rare. Ministers and MEPs
   hardly ever vote united against a proposal.},

Abstract = {This article examines the evolving logic to the systematic
   assassinations of Palestinian activists carried out by Israel during the
   Aqsa Intifada (September 20002005). It argues that the logic of Israel's
   assassination policy developed in three stages. During each successive
   stage, the security executive expanded the scope of who could be
   legitimately targeted and what goals could be served in doing so. This
   article further argues that normative and legal considerations played a
   key role in determining target selection and tactical means. It finds
   that during the Aqsa Intifada, the Israeli government used assassination
   not according to any unified purpose but rather as an evolving and often
   ad hoc combination of political communication, tactical action and, more
   rarely, strategic manipulation. In short: there was not one single
   rationale driving the assassinations but several.},

Abstract = {Agencies designed to inform the distribution of public resources between
   competing healthcare programmes are now commonplace across the developed
   world. While cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) has become integral to
   prescriptions for such decisions, its influence in practice remains
   modest especially at local decision-making levels. Explanations focus on
   evidence and interests and therefore overlook the role played by
   institutions in determining the use of CEA. Case studies from the
   English National Health Service indicate that institutions are critical
   to understanding the technology coverage function and the role of
   evidence, analysis and deliberation in this.},

Abstract = {This article examines how military organizations that are generally
   committed to following the laws and customs of war exploit what the
   author terms `the collateral damage exemption', by employing
   legally-sanctioned war-fighting strategies that result in significant
   numbers of civilian casualties. This exemption shields combatants from
   legal liability for `incidental' or `inadvertent' civilian losses and
   the destruction of civilian objects that may occur during lawful
   actions. The author argues that military strategies which promote the
   use of overwhelming force under conditions that are likely to adversely
   affect the civilian population on a significant scale push the
   boundaries of legal behavior. Under these conditions, collateral damage
   is not inadvertent, but the calculated results of policy decisions. Most
   academics, journalists, and political leaders focus on blatant
   violations of International Humanitarian Law (IHL), for example,
   deliberate attacks on civilian populations. However, these actions are
   in many ways the least interesting from both a policy and scholarly
   perspective. This is because such violations are usually unambiguous,
   easily detected, and difficult to defend. More insidious are practices
   that deliberately straddle the line between legitimate action and
   violation by exploiting the collateral damage exception to IHL. This
   article demonstrates that high rates of civilian casualties that occur
   under the shroud of legality threaten the integrity of the laws and
   customs of armed conflict.},

Abstract = {This research focuses on inter-organizational cooperation, a neglected
   theme of the international relations theory. The analysis of the
   European humanitarian politics emphasizes the factors, dynamics and
   effects of inter-organizational cooperation inside the ngos network
   voice and between this network and the European institutions. By linking
   different but complementary theories, the strategies of cooperation can
   be divided into three phases. If ngos gather to be recognized as
   reliable partners by intergovernmental organizations, the networks they
   create are characterized by a complex delegation structure which aims to
   meet the needs of their members and of the targeted institutions. The
   alleged flexibility of networks does not protect them from the
   pathologies of international organizations (path dependency, lack of
   adaptability).},

   construct, namely, anarchy. I maintain that due to the centrality of
   anarchyand other racially infused constructswithin these prominent
   paradigms, white supremacist precepts are not only nominally associated
   with the origins of the field, but have an enduring impact on IR theory
   and influence contemporary theses ranging from neorealist conceptions of
   the global system to liberal democratic peace claims, and constructivist
   theses as well.},

Abstract = {This paper explains and evaluates the effects of the developing crisis
   on the mobility of third-country nationals in Greece and other South
   European political economies. In doing so it explores the mobility of
   these migrants within the context of the informal economic activity in
   which many such migrants have been involved. The paper exposes the
   distance separating the law and the actual enforcement of fundamental
   employment- and mobility-related rights of irregular migrants in Greece
   and other southern European countries. It identifies the significance of
   the familistic welfare regime of the European South in framing migrants'
   characteristics and their consequent mobility in the region. The article
   argues that the familistic welfare regime of the host country is
   inextricably linked to migrants' employment trajectories and
   fundamentally affects the strategies that migrants have developed in
   order to protect themselves in lieu of effective rights regulation.},

Volume = {44},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {The author proposes a synthesis of deontological arguments in the
   ethical debate on immigration policies. The arguments are divided
   between moral obligations (cosmopolitan, national or private) and
   universal rights (freedom of movement, right to self-determination,
   right to property). From this synthesis are drawn the conclusions that
   restrictive migration policies are difficult to reconcile with the
   universal liberal principles of equality and nondiscrimination; that the
   right of peoples to self-determination would be the most compelling
   basis to justify restrictive policies; and that, ultimately, it is up to
   the democratic political process to decide between the ethical arguments
   in this debate.},

Abstract = {Although there has been increasing recognition that morality policy in
   Western democracies is a distinctive field of study, many analyses are
   relatively narrow in issues and jurisdictions. This contribution
   examines broad empirical patterns for five morality policy issues across
   18 West European democracies since World War II. The issues analysed are
   abortion, capital punishment, euthanasia, assisted reproductive
   technology (ART, including stem cell research) and same-sex marriage.
   Which of two prominent institutional theories of morality policy, policy
   type and two worlds, help explain morality policy processes? The results
   indicate that morality policy processes do differ from the usual ones of
   parliamentary government, and that important differences are captured by
   the religious/secular division of party systems, depending on which
   countries are considered for each category.},

Abstract = {This article argues that state (re)construction and functioning involves
   negotiated governance between both state and non-state actors, in which
   power relations between local actors are not just implicitly present or
   co-influencing policies but are of uttermost importance to the formation
   of policy and state. One of the main non-state actors in African service
   delivery is the church. State and church are two major poles of power
   which determine through negotiation large domains of service delivery,
   such as education. We discuss a major attempt by the Catholic Church to
   reform the school-fee system in Kinshasa (DRC). The attempt largely
   failed, but its analysis reveals the political capabilities of different
   actors involved. The arrangements of state and non-state actors largely
   evolve in a roundabout way, not at all along the lines of an explicit
   negotiation process, and are very much determined by local-level
   governance instead of higher-level policies.},

Abstract = {China is undergoing a process of decentralization that has been highly
   valued for its economic growth. However, this paper aims to explore how
   this process has affected the equality of social provision for
   rural-urban migrants in China by taking hukou system reform as a case
   study. It is argued here that the traditional assumption that
   decentralization promotes social welfare by bringing the government
   closer to the people is not necessarily true, or at least not uniformly
   so in certain institutional settings. Decentralization policies in
   contemporary China indeed make local governments more powerful and
   responsible for social welfare provision to their local citizens, but
   have also undermined the incentives for local governments to cover the
   welfare costs for migrant workers. To this extent, decentralization has
   played a negative role in integrating the large number of migrant
   workers into local cities and promoting equity within social welfare
   delivery at a national level in China. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {Research Highlights and Abstract The article seeks to make a
   contribution in the following areas: Departments that submitted a large
   proportion of books published with a top university press tended to do
   much better in the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise (RAE), especially
   in respect of their 4{*} rating. Departments that submitted large
   numbers of top-10 journal articles as a proportion of their outputs
   tended to get higher 4{*} ratings than departments that submitted only a
   few. Departments that had a member of staff on the RAE sub-panel saw
   their 4{*} rating jump considerably, all other things being equal,
   suggesting inadequate communication by the sub-panel of its working
   methods and criteria. The RAE sub-panel's judgements about research
   quality broadly reflected the judgements of the profession. This article
   analyses the results of the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise (RAE). It
   demonstrates that the reputations of political science journals and
   scholarly publishers can explain the performance of institutions
   submitted to the RAEs Politics and International Studies sub-panel, and
   that there were also clear relationships between types of output and
   research quality. Outputs in top journals and with top presses were
   strongly associated with 4{*} quality and research excellence. Moreover,
   press and journal reputations appeared to have a greater impact than the
   type of publication. These findings should encourage policy makers to
   consider more cost-effective and efficient ways of evaluating research.},

Title = {Orchestrating the Response: Somali Piracy and Ontological Complexity},
Journal = {GLOBAL POLICY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {4},
Number = {1},
Pages = {86-93},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Contemporary piracy is a complex and intricate problem. This article
   discusses different sources of complexity of the problem and suggests
   paying attention to ontological complexity. To unravel ontological
   complexity one has to ask the very fundamental question: Why is piracy
   actually considered to be problematic? Addressing this question leads to
   a set of different paradigms of piracy which underpin counter-piracy
   policy. Each of these paradigms works with different presumptions,
   foregrounds different dimensions and suggests other types of measures.
   Five paradigms of counter-piracy are outlined: Firstly, a security
   paradigm, which stresses that piracy is a threat; secondly, a legal
   paradigm, within which piracy is a crime; thirdly, an economic paradigm
   within which piracy is a business model; fourthly, a development
   paradigm that interprets piracy as a problem of structural root causes;
   and fifthly a humanitarian paradigm in which piracy is the source of
   suffering for individuals. These paradigms produce a range of tensions
   between each other. The article concludes in stressing the importance of
   paying attention to this complexity to increase reflexivity in drafting
   counter-piracy policies. Policy Implications center dot Contemporary
   piracy is not only one problem, but different ones. There are competing
   paradigms of piracy. center dot At least five paradigms of piracy exist:
   piracy as threat, as a crime, as a business model, as a problem of root
   causes, or as a humanitarian problem leads to contradicting policy
   objectives. center dot Paradigms produce tensions and contradictions
   which are not easily reconciled. center dot Complexity should not be
   reduced. Policy responses should be orchestrated, that is not
   streamlining according to a single logic, but playing with several
   logics, introducing breaks and silences as well using contradictions and
   tensions productively.},

Abstract = {A number of Western countries are currently adding exit programs
   targeting militant Islamists to their counterterrorism efforts. Drawing
   on research into voluntary exit from violent extremism, this article
   identifies themes and issues that seem to cause doubt, leading to exit.
   It then provides a perspective on how these natural sources of doubt
   might best be brought to bear in connection with an exit program by
   drawing on social psychology and research into persuasion and attitude
   change. It is argued that an external intervention should stay close to
   the potential exiter's own doubt, make the influence attempt as subtle
   as possible, use narratives and self-affirmatory strategies to reduce
   resistance to persuasion, and consider the possibility to promote
   attitudinal change via behavioral change as an alternative to seek to
   influence beliefs directly.},

Title = {A Model of Destructive Entrepreneurship: Insight for Conflict and

Volume = {57},

Pages = {20-40},

Abstract = {The research on entrepreneurship as an economic phenomenon often assumes
   its desirability as a driver of economic development and growth.
   However, entrepreneurial talent can be allocated among productive,
   unproductive and destructive activities. This allocation has important
   implications in the developing world, particularly for countries hosting
   conflict or recovering from conflict. The allocation of entrepreneurship
   is theorized as driven by institutions. Although the trade-off between
   productive and unproductive entrepreneurship has been examined,
   destructive entrepreneurship has been largely ignored. We build from
   existing theory and define destructive entrepreneurship as wealth
   destroying. We propose three assumptions to develop a model of
   destructive entrepreneurship that presents the mechanisms through which

Abstract = {This article traces the roots of ideas currently influencing the Labour
   party relating to the role of the state in Britain's political economy,
   exploring the trajectory by which such ideas have entered contemporary
   debate and how they continue to shape the party's agenda. Subsequent
   sections explore diverse interpretations of New Labour, the economic
   legacy of the Blair and Brown governments, the re-imagining of British
   political economy undertaken by Labour under Miliband's leadership, and
   the interlinking progressive dilemmas that have so far emerged. The
   article concludes by suggesting that the ambitious rediscovery of
   interventionism will only be realisable if Labour confronts historical
   dilemmas relating to the structure and efficacy of the British state.
   Such a confrontation requires serious engagement between the doctrines
   of British social democracy and the overlapping and interlinking
   narratives of liberal political thought.},

Abstract = {The Chinese government says that it supports the notion of international
   diversity of political-economic systems. This should not be regarded as
   mere propaganda. Apart from a brief period during the Cultural
   Revolution, China never was interested in exporting its ideology or in
   trying to turn other countries into a replication of itself. It is
   unlikely that China will change its attitude in this regard, even as it
   emerges as a new superpower. On the contrary: as it becomes more
   influential at the multilateral level, it is likely that China will
   promote political-economic diversity as a major norm in international
   relations. This would limit the ability of the west to promote liberal
   democracy and economic liberalism through multilateral institutions, and
   perhaps even bilaterally. One of the effects of this process would be
   that the competitive advantage of Chinese companies in developing
   countries increases vis-a-vis western firms. This would accelerate the
   power shift in the developing world towards China from the west. Policy
   Implications center dot In the years ahead China is likely to push
   international diversity as a major norm in international relations.
   center dot China's drive towards international diversity challenges the
   western support for economic and political liberal values in
   international relations. center dot The more China succeeds in making
   the institutions of global governance ideologically neutral' (i.e., not
   representing liberal values and thereby favouring the Chinese position
   vis-a-vis the west), the more difficult it becomes for the US and its
   western partners to use these institutions to export liberal democracy
   and economic liberalism to the developing world. center dot It will be
   increasingly difficult for western firms to compete with their Chinese
   counterparts in developing countries. This strengthens Chinese economic
   - and therefore political - influence in the developing world vis-a-vis
   western influence.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH},

Volume = {50},
Number = {1},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The primary purpose of many alliances is to deter attacks on members of
   the alliance by potentially antagonistic states. Yet some alliances can
   increase the probability of conflict that may be initiated by alliance
   members. Cognizant of that possibility, states that wish to sustain
   peace may nevertheless intentionally form alliance commitments with
   revisionist leaders of other states. Faced with the partially
   conflicting goals of deterring antagonistic states while at the same
   time restraining allies, leaders often include in alliance treaties
   conditions that oblige allies to provide military assistance only if a
   member of the alliance is attacked by a state outside the alliance.
   However, other treaties may contain unconditional obligations to come to
   the defense of members of the alliance. Such alliances tend to arise
   from situations where some members of the alliance feel that their
   alliance partners need to have the flexibility even to engage in
   provocative behavior in order to deter the target of the alliance. Our
   analysis of alliance formation processes in the context of priorities
   that compete with each other provides a basis for two hypotheses. The
   first is that revisionist states with unconditional commitments from
   members of their alliance to come to their defense are more likely to
   initiate militarized conflict than states without such unconditional
   commitments. The second hypothesis is that revisionist states in
   alliances whose treaties stipulate that commitments to defend are
   conditional will be less likely to initiate militarized conflict than
   such states with allies who are committed to come to their defense
   without conditions. Statistical analyses of data generated with a view
   toward evaluations of both hypotheses (some of which provide new, more
   detailed categorizations of alliance treaties) suggest that they are
   valid.},

Abstract = {The prevailing economic and budgetary climate is intensifying the search
   for methods and practices aimed at generating efficiencies in public
   sector provision. This paper investigates the increasingly popular
   bundle of techniques operating under the generic descriptor of lean,
   which promises to improve operational quality processes while
   simultaneously reducing cost. It offers a critical appraisal of lean as
   a fashionable component of public sector reform and challenges the
   received wisdom that it unambiguously delivers efficiencies'.
   Quantitative and qualitative research in HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC)
   centred on employees' experiences has indicated the extent to which work
   has been reorganized along lean principles. However, employees perceive
   that changes in organizational processes and working practices have
   unintentionally generated inefficiencies which have impacted on the
   quality of public service. These suggested outcomes raise wider concerns
   as lean working is adopted in other public sector organizations.},

Pages = {531-546},
Abstract = {The Treaty of Lisbon defines the European Parliament and the Council as
   the principal institutional actors of `representative democracy' in the
   EU, thus endorsing an essentially `bicameral' model of EU democracy. In
   this model, national parliaments focus their scrutiny on their
   governments' conduct of EU affairs, but are not themselves EU-level
   actors. However, the Treaty of Lisbon also creates an Early Warning
   Mechanism which empowers national parliaments to intervene collectively
   in the EU's legislative process. This suggests a new, `tricameral' model
   in which national parliaments constitute the third chamber in a
   reconfigured representative system for the EU. This reconfiguration
   moves the EU away from traditional models of representative democracy
   and more towards a complex `demoi-cracy,' as it now has three bodies to
   represent the citizens, governments and peoples of Europe.},

Journal = {CRITICAL POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-17},
Abstract = {The project of deliberative democracy is increasingly pursued through
   designed mini-publics. But exactly how they are designed proves crucial
   in determining whether or not mini-publics can deliver on their promise.
   This article explores the role of appreciative inquiry - a version of
   deliberative design that is gaining ground. In this approach,
   participants are primed to develop an `appreciative gaze' by focusing
   the discussion on what already works well in the system and imagining
   possibilities for building on these strengths. It is distinguished from
   contestatatory approaches in that argumentative, blame-seeking and
   deficit-oriented forms of discourse are considered counter-productive to
   the process. We argue against a one-sided emphasis on appreciative
   inquiry, which must be balanced with more contestatory forms. Focusing
   on appreciative approaches to deliberation at the expense of
   contestation obstructs the ability of a group to deliberate properly and
   secure crucial deliberative outcomes. Our analysis is grounded in the
   case of the first Australia's Citizens' Parliament.},

Volume = {35},

Abstract = {The European Parliament (EP) is branded as one of the winners of the
   Lisbon Treaty. It has seen its role expanded to more than 40 Treaty
   articles and obtained the status of co-legislator in previously
   uncharted territory such as agriculture, fisheries and legal migration.
   This raises the question of how the EP adapts itself to the newly
   obtained powers in order to fulfill its legislative role. A very
   pertinent issue in this context are the type of tasks that are delegated
   to EP civil servants as this might have implications for the democratic
   legitimacy of the directly elected Members. This contribution identifies
   the conditions under which civil servants take up different types of
   tasks by looking at four cases in two different policy areas: migration
   and fisheries. Political importance of the dossier and expertise are
   identified as key determinants for the role of civil servants in the
   ordinary legislative procedure.},

Title = {Islam, Depoliticization and the European Crisis of Democratic Legitimacy},
Journal = {POLITICS RELIGION \& IDEOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {14},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {265-283},
Abstract = {A new form of political discourse hostile to Islam has been gaining
   ground in Europe. Initiated by neo-nationalist parties it appeals to
   liberal values and is now penetrating mainstream politics. The recent
   French presidential campaign threw light on the way Centre Right parties
   vying for government are increasingly instrumentalizing hostility
   towards Islam to respond to the political crisis triggered by the
   problem of public debt across the European Union. Critics are
   approaching this phenomenon through the lens of Foucault's notion of
   governmentality, questioning the assertion that Muslims cannot integrate
   in European societies because of their religion and highlighting the
   failure of European nation states to treat them as citizens and promote
   their socio-economic inclusion. This perspective yields valuable
   insights: it shows how the presence of Muslims challenges the belief of
   European societies in their selfperceived rationality and tolerance,
   resting on their commitment to secularity as epistemic category. The
   strident defense of secularism that accompanies Islamophobia is part of
   the discourse of securitization that characterizes the neo-liberal form
   of contemporary governmentality and promotes the de-politicization of
   social problems. The notion of governmentality, however, cannot account
   fully for the root-cause of Islamophobia: the loss of collective purpose
   that has triggered a crisis of government and seen the concern for
   efficient governance to erase the goal of collective self-determination.
   At heart, Islamophobia constitutes a manifestation of the European
   states' crisis of democratic legitimacy.},

Abstract = {This contribution examines the Euro Area crisis and European economic
   governance reforms through a less technocratic lens. It argues for the
   need to reframe debate around foundation issues in normative legal and
   political theory. The defining issue is supreme emergency. The
   credibility of its capacity to act in supreme emergency is of
   existential significance for the Euro Area. At the same time this
   capacity poses is bound up with basic legitimacy issues. In particular,
   it involves ultimately contentious requirements for supranational
   executive discretion, including credible contingent commitments to take
   exceptional measures. Meeting these requirements exposed a power vacuum
   within the Euro Area, consequent on domestic political constraints. This
   vacuum was filled-if reluctantly-by the European Central Bank. However,
   difficult legitimacy issues remain. They leave open the credibility of
   the ECB contingent commitment to act in supreme emergency.},

   Minority Rights in Europe},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {35},
Number = {2},
Pages = {169-186},
Abstract = {Enjoying control over knowledge production, epistemic communities are
   central to international politics in guiding decision-maker learning.
   Yet, we do not understand fully the extent of epistemic community
   influence on diverse issue areas and the ways in which they drive
   international regimes. To illustrate an epistemic community's impact, we
   investigate the role of experts in the EU, the OSCE and the Council of
   Europe within the European minority rights regime. Conceptually, we
   argue that a hierarchy among experts matters for the epistemic
   community's influence via policy innovation, diffusion and persistence.
   Empirically, we track the operation of these mechanisms in the context
   of EU enlargement as experts on minority rights influence
   standard-setting, monitoring and standard expansion.},

   the UK beverage alcohol market},
Journal = {CRITICAL POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Pages = {53-71},
Abstract = {This article explores alcohol industry attempts to frame the debate
   about pricing and promotions policy in the United Kingdom. Framing
   theory, it is argued, offers us important insights into the dynamics of
   the policymaking process as a contest between competing
   conceptualizations of both problems and solutions. Drawing on a
   documentary analysis and a series of interviews with policymakers,
   public health advocates and alcohol industry actors, it argues that
   industry actors framed the policy debate in ways which were consistent
   with their underlying commercial interests. A clear challenge was posed
   to the industry by the shift towards whole-population interventions
   favored by the Scottish government. This led to a reassertion of the
   industry frame in which alcohol-related harm is limited to a small
   minority of the population and which advocates targeted interventions.},

Abstract = {The conventional domestic view on Norwegian use of force in
   international operations has for long appeared to be that, since our
   relative military contributions will always be of limited military
   value, it is the political effect of military participation that by
   itself is the predominant rationale for involvement - not the military
   results the military contribution may generate. Therefore, the argument
   goes, overarching conceptual thinking linking means to ends is of a more
   subordinate nature, and best left to major actors on the international
   scene. This article argues that Norway's experiences from its military
   contributions in Libya represent a breach of this premise, since the
   relative contribution in this particular conflict in both quantitative
   and qualitative terms was substantial. The question is whether we should
   consider this an exception to the rule, or whether the consequences of
   these experiences are that the logic of linking means to ends deserves a
   more prominent place in Norwegian military thinking. The article is an
   argumentative and explorative analysis debating the extent to which
   Norway exerted influence on the operations it so forcefully decided to
   contribute.},

Title = {A MODEL OF COST-CUTTING IN GOVERNMENT? THE GREAT MANAGEMENT REVOLUTION
   IN UK CENTRAL GOVERNMENT RECONSIDERED},
Journal = {PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {91},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {114-134},
Abstract = {New Public Management (NPM), particularly in its early stages in the
   1980s, is often said to have concentrated on cost-cutting and
   efficiency, but few studies have examined how far NPM succeeded in
   cutting costs. Focusing on UK central government, often claimed to be a
   leading case of NPM, and analyzing three sets of data (for running
   costs, tax collection costs, and paybill), this study finds little
   evidence of real running cost reductions in the early NPM era. It
   concludes that, contrary to stereotype, 1980s NPM in UK central
   government does not offer a model for the scale of administrative
   cost-cutting currently planned, and even the cutbacks of the 1990s fell
   far short of those current plans. The conclusion for the academic study
   of NPM is that something more than a minor revision of the received view
   of NPM as a cost-cutting movement is needed to explain these
   observations.},

   the basis of some key indicators (that is, trade flows, capital flows,
   and MNCs activities). Finally, after examining the critical issues of
   globalisation (that is, global and regional imbalances, openness vs
   protectionism, country-based and regional financial crises, and global
   governance), the chapter concludes with some comments on the
   implications of globalisation for multilateralism.},

Journal = {CONTEMPORARY SECURITY POLICY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {34},
Number = {2},
Pages = {278-301},
Abstract = {Targeted killing is not new. What has changed is the nature of armed
   conflict, states that openly admit to the practice, and the emergence of
   much more capable technology. Targeting individuals seems to make sense
   given the changing nature of armed conflict. But whether targeting
   dangerous individuals is indeed legal, effective, and ethical is often
   impossible to determine, either in specific cases or systematically,
   because of the secrecy surrounding such operations. Calls from civil
   society and legislatures for greater transparency in targeted killings
   are unlikely to result in more openness or accountability, easily denied
   by the precedence of security claims for these intelligence-driven
   operations and covert actions. This barrier also makes it very difficult
   to develop consistent domestic and international rules for targeting
   individuals outside war zones. If states became more transparent about
   how and why individuals are targeted, the approach could gain more
   legitimacy. Rather than giving states a blanket legal authority of
   secretly killing individuals they deem terrorists or threats to national
   security, a workable solution could be a systematic preference to rely
   on non-lethal means in targeted counterterrorism operations with the aim
   of subsequent prosecution of captured individuals. A systematic
   preference for non-lethality should be accompanied by a requirement for
   the humane treatment of detained terrorists/combatants and a requirement
   for a fair trial after a specified period of detention. Secret prisons
   and indefinite detentions of terrorism suspects not charged with any
   crime should not be permissible practices in democratic states.},

Abstract = {REGIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AND INTERNATIONAL POLITICS JAPANESE INFLUENCE
   OVER THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK AND THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL By DANIEL
   YEW MAO LIM and JAMES RAYMOND VREELAND Do regional hegemons use their
   power in regional organizations to advance foreign policy objectives?
   The authors investigate whether Japan leverages its privileged position
   at the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to facilitate project loans for the
   elected Asian members of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), a
   platform from which it seeks to shape global affairs. Analyzing panel
   data of ADB loan disbursements to twenty-four developing
   member-countries from 1968 to 2009, the authors find that temporary UNSC
   membership increases ADB loans, particularly during the post-1985
   period, when Japan asserted greater influence in multilateral
   organizations. They estimate an average increase of over 30 percent.
   Because of Japan's checkered history of imperialism, the ADB provides a
   convenient mechanism by which the government can obfuscate favors for
   politically important countries. Acting through this regional
   organization enables Japan to reconcile a low-key approach to foreign
   affairs with the contradictory goal of global activism-leading without
   appearing unilateralist.},

Abstract = {This chapter discusses the main difficulties with which the UN has had
   to deal in its development since the early 1990s. It provides an
   overview of the problems encountered in trying to reform the Security
   Council, in setting its financial arrangements on a sound footing, in
   working more closely with regional organisations on security
   maintenance, in promoting development in ways which do not penalise
   future generations, and in strengthening the rule of law as it applies
   to individuals. The chapter does not propose solutions, but identifies
   the controversies about reform, and the range of desirable and possible
   outcomes. A recurrent theme is the different visions about whose
   interests the UN should serve: those of particular States, or groups of
   States, the collective interest of States, or those of individuals.},

Abstract = {In general, the security situation for China's sports pageants is quite
   stable, but still China needs to face up to the threats from both
   traditional and nontraditional security areas such as terrorism,
   separatism, and extremism. Terrorism is the biggest threat to China's
   sports pageants. Effective security and defense strategies for the games
   require reliable intelligence. Reliable intelligence, however, is
   notoriously difficult to obtain even though we are immersed in vast
   quantities of information. How can we identify and obtain the useful
   intelligence from the vast sea of other less useful information? After
   analyzing the potential terrorism attacks and terrorists in the 2008
   Beijing Olympic Games and the 2010 Guangzhou Asian Games, this chapter
   analyzes the potential means for counterterrorism at the games and tries
   to set up an intelligence study system based on the Information Galaxy
   (IG), which includes five parts of Sun (S), Earth (E), Moon (M),
   Information Sharing Environment (ISE), and IG. The relationships of SEM
   are just like the Sun, the Earth, and the Moon. All the methods
   especially need to cooperate in the study of different cases in the IG
   system until valuable intelligence can be produced from the S, the S-E,
   the S-E-M, or the S-E-Ms. This chapter does not expect to put forward a
   complete and careful theoretical system of terrorism and
   Intelligence-led counterterrorism in China, but it still tries to
   establish a relatively complete theoretical framework, with a
   multi-disciplinary perspective of peace science, national defense
   economics, information science, and computer science, etc.},

Abstract = {The thesis of a `politicisation' of European integration has been
   influential both for research about the EU and comparative research on
   political parties. However, the debate triggered by this thesis remains
   elusive, inter alia, with regard to the thematic structure and the
   interaction modes of parties within controversies about EU multi-level
   governance. Against this background, the present article maps the
   thematic and party political dimension of controversies and asks for
   linkages between both dimensions in 31 parliamentary debates about the
   EU in France, Germany and the UK between 2005 and 2009. The empirical
   evidence from these debates suggests that a categorisation of different
   thematic aspects of debates can be used to map and explain the emergence
   of several types of polarisation between political parties, thus
   elucidating different variants of `politicisation' of European affairs
   and working towards their systematic explanation.},

Title = {Exploring PSC-military relations: Swedish officers and the private

Journal = {COOPERATION AND CONFLICT},

Volume = {48},
Number = {4},
Pages = {484-501},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The increasing reliance on private security companies (PSCs) in and
   around international peace operations has created new public-private
   constellations, influencing both military and civilian efforts,
   sometimes generating problematic relationships and even violence between
   public and private actors, as well as unclear divisions of labour,
   authority and responsibility. To explain how and why these problems
   occur, mapping out the understandings that these different actors have
   of each other in different contexts is of key importance. Through an
   analysis of Swedish officers' views of private security actors, this
   paper aims to contribute to our understanding of the complex
   relationships between civilian authorities, state militaries and
   commercial security actors. Particularly, the article will shed new
   light on PSC-military' relations and the ways in which the private
   security sector functions as both a competitor and a career option for
   former or active service personnel. The article draws on a study
   commissioned by the Swedish Armed Forces and is empirically based on
   in-depth interviews and a survey of Swedish officers' attitudes to PSCs.},

Abstract = {The application of European Union (EU) rules is, in general, the
   responsibility of national executives. This key intergovernmental aspect
   of the EU's administrative order makes compliance with supranational law
   vulnerable to distortion. However, the European executive has added
   important fire-alarm oversight mechanisms by means of transgovernmental
   networks (TGNs) to its toolbox. This article examines the work mode,
   horizontalness and effectiveness of such networks as newer governance
   tools to oversee and monitor the compliance with EU law. It draws on a
   unique dataset on the Solvit network, enabling us to examine
   effectiveness and variation of a transgovernmental network in operation.
   The article substantiates the relevance of TGNs in identifying and
   solving manifold and complex problems of misapplied EU law, finds that
   the Commission constitutes a focal point in this type of multilevel
   executive and points out that learning in part explains why
   effectiveness varies across member states.},

Abstract = {Competition law was viewed as a key instrument under democracy to
   address entrenched corporate power, in the context of liberalisation.
   This article examines South Africa's competition law regime and the
   changing strategies of large firms through three industry case studies.
   In the industry studies we assess, first, how corporate strategies have
   evolved to protect market power and the rents derived from this power
   and, second, how the competition regime has affected economic power and
   its exercise. We reflect on the overall record of the competition
   authorities in light of the outcomes observed.},

Abstract = {This study uses frames analysis to investigate online discourses and
   processes of political deliberation on China's weibo (microblog)
   service. It offers a comparative analysis of competing discourses
   surrounding the case ofWang Yue, a toddler who was ran over by two motor
   vehicles in Foshan, following which 18 people passed by and ignored her
   plight. The study aims to understand how weibo facilitate its users to
   express their differences and deliberate disagreements with each other.
   The study found that Internet users are rational in the sense that they
   do not simply lean towards a dichotomised choice of `pro-' or `anti-'
   official discourse, but they are able to negotiate their moral choices
   by considering a wide range of social and political factors in such an
   emotional and morally controversial incident.},

Abstract = {The idea of a (golden) age pervades most academic analysis and debate
   about the welfare state. This article interrogates this largely
   unquestioned epochal image of welfare history which is, in effect, a
   shared conventional wisdom. That vast and often disputatious scholarly
   literatures should share a conventional epochal axiom is remarkable. So
   is the absence of academic debate focused on this idea, which is both
   pervasive and vague. Perhaps paradoxically, our easy recognition of the
   (golden) age of the welfare state may contribute to the lack of
   precision in its use: taken-for-granted concepts are often sloppily
   deployed.},

Abstract = {{[}Jawdat Abu-El-Haj was named the third Latin American Perspectives
   Fellow and was in residence at the Rivera Library at the University of
   California, Riverside, from January to March 2012. His project was a
   study of the founding and evolution of LAP from the early 1970s until
   present. He examined all volumes of the journal as well as its extensive
   archive in Special Collections of the library. He reviewed nine
   interviews of founders and early editors that are also in the archive as
   part of an oral history project by founder Marjorie Bray. He attended
   two editorial meetings, initially presenting his project and later
   sharing a first draft of his paper. The editorial collective provided
   feedback, and this paper went through a half-dozen revisions. As with
   all articles published in LAP, his views and analysis are not

Abstract = {Reforming democratic political systems to handle environmental problems
   is one of the key political challenges of our time. Here, I analyse how
   local environmental officials in Sweden perceive the shortcomings of the
   current political system and what reforms they deem necessary to handle
   key environmental problems. While green political theory tends to focus
   on the need to deepen democracy through increased citizen participation,
   analysis of survey data shows that environmental officials, even though
   their perceptions of the current system's shortcomings are similar to
   those presented in the theoretical literature, are more likely to argue
   for increased expert influence than for direct citizen participation.
   This result is not easily explained as officials seeking to expand their
   power, as environmental officials have more complex perceptions of their
   roles in democracy. The different visions of green professionals and
   green theory highlight the importance of deliberation on green
   democratic reforms, including the potentially undemocratic consequences
   of empowering experts.},

Abstract = {The success of implementing human rights treaties is often dependent on
   a country's national laws and local conditions. There is an
   implementation gap in dualist regimes where courts do not implement
   human rights treaty provisions because they have not been domesticated
   by a legislative (or other necessary) incorporating act. Interpretive
   incorporation is a judicial trend that seeks to mitigate this strict
   separatist view. This article examines the use of interpretive
   incorporation in Malaysia to incorporate CEDAW's prohibition against
   pregnancy discrimination through constitutional interpretation. It
   calibrates the outcomes of interpretive incorporation based on the
   status judges effectively give to unincorporated human rights treaties.
   Finally, the article reflects on some of the continuing local
   constraints on interpretive incorporation.},

Abstract = {The Constitutive Act of the African Union envisages a multiplicity of
   continental human rights organs, including the African Court on Human
   and Peoples' Rights (the Court); the Peace and Security Council of the
   African Union (PSC); and the African Union Commission on International
   Law (AUCIL). The creation of these bodies can be seen as the fruit of
   efforts by the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights (the
   Commission) to put human rights at the heart of interstate cooperation
   in Africa. Prior to the Constitutive Act, the Commission had held a near
   monopoly on human rights promotion and protection in Africa at the
   regional level since its inception in 1987. Since 2000, however, the
   Commission's role has been reshaped to accommodate the new organs. This
   article examines the relationships that have formed between the
   Commission and the Court, the PSC, and the AUCIL.},

Abstract = {Both international legal principles and much of the literature on
   transitional justice support the provision of reparations as a necessary
   component of justice in postconflict societies. According to the UN
   Basic Principles and Guidelines (United Nations 2005: para. IX),
   adequate, effective and prompt reparation is intended to promote justice
   by redressing gross violations of international human rights law or
   serious violations of international humanitarian law. However, few
   scholarly studies have looked systematically at victims' views of the
   importance of various forms of reparations in providing justice. Using
   individual-level data collected in the aftermath of the civil war in
   Nepal, we investigate people's perceptions of the importance of various
   forms of reparations that appear in the UN Basic Principles and
   Guidelines and that have been offered in transitional justice processes.
   The findings suggest that compensation for losses, along with punishment
   of perpetrators, are viewed as being more important to providing justice
   for individuals than other forms of reparations, regardless of the type
   of grievance(s) suffered.},

Title = {Restricted Representation: The Role of Ethics and Esthetics in Framing
   Images of Suffering},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {12},
Number = {4},
Pages = {511-522},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Times of conflict produce a dizzying array of images of suffering. As
   conflict unfolds, photojournalists often scramble to capture the image
   that perfectly represents the human rights violations that are occurring
   on the ground. In turn, human rights advocates and organizations often
   utilize these images during the aftermath as a means of drawing global
   attention to a particular issue. From a surface perspective, it seems as
   though the advantages of representation through image are bountiful:
   Images generate publicity, images help people relate to a cause, images
   mobilize funds, etc. However, beneath the surface, there lie deep-seated
   and diverse ethical questions: Do photojournalists, as nonactive
   voyeurs, become a contributing factor to the suffering of the subject?
   Is the ethical course of action by the photographer sacrificed in the
   name of art? Moreover, at what point does the pursuit of the perfect
   image override one's ability to see the event as a human occurrence?
   There cannot be conclusive categorizations of these moments where
   photography straddles the border between art and morality, so this
   article does not aim to establish any. However, in the process of
   exploring questions such as these, it seeks to expose the ways that
   images of suffering can be used in both positive and negative ways in
   human rights advocacy work. Although such work has the best intentions,
   the circulation of these images through the public sphere complicates
   the status and meaning of the images, thereby leading us to the
   question: How can the witnessed suffering of one individual even begin
   to represent and redeem the unviewed suffering of countless others?},

Abstract = {This article examines the production, circulation, and interpretation of
   regulatory documents in contemporary Mozambique in order to highlight
   their central importance to processes of governance. The empirical focus
   is on orientacoes superiores - written and oral documents issued by
   figures and institutions of authority with the intention of advising on
   procedures for policy formulation and implementation. By producing
   orientacoes superiores in a way that leaves their intent ambiguous and
   their status provisional, party and state officials shift the focus of
   policy making from substance to process. In this way, bureaucratic
   authority is produced and reinforced through the manipulation of the
   timing of policy implementation. This perspective expands current
   understandings of African governance that on the whole have been limited
   to the analysis of the effectiveness of African institutions and
   policies, leaving the tactical effects of ambiguity, timing, and
   provisionality in policy implementation undertheorized.},

Abstract = {Over the last four decades, the dynamics of innovation in the US economy
   have shifted. Whereas the development of new technologies was once
   dominated by large, vertically integrated firms, since the 1980s an
   increasingly networked innovation environment has emerged in which small
   firms play a central role. But why did this shift emerge? Extant
   research emphasizes changes in the decision-making calculus of large
   firms, the rise of private venture capital, legal changes and a variety
   of subnational development initiatives. In this paper, we demonstrate
   the critical importance of government innovation programs. We argue that
   a single small, relatively unknown programuthe Small Business Innovation
   Research (SBIR) programuplayed a critical role in catalyzing this
   broader economic transformation. Drawing on programmatic data,
   employment trends and data on SBIRs intersection with venture capital
   and federal procurement, we show how SBIR catalyzed a series of
   cross-cutting institutional mechanisms that supported the growth of
   small, innovative technology firms. We propose the term social resonance
   to suggest how even small government programs can play an important role
   in altering large-scale institutional dynamics.},

Abstract = {How do Islamic political actors engage with international human rights
   discourse in new Muslim-majority democracies? While most scholarly
   research focuses on the role of transnational actors in shaping the
   local adoption of rights norms, this article focuses on how even
   incomplete democratization can empower religious actors to engage in
   meaningful local debates over how to define the relationship between
   religious values, democratic meanings, and rights. The article presents
   a case study of Nigeria, where Muslim activists have used rights talk to
   advance the implementation of Islamic law (sharia) under the post-1999
   democratic regime. It also explores how these activists' use of rights
   language to pursue sharia policies that conflict significantly with
   international rights norms challenges human and women's rights groups in
   Nigeria, who must walk a careful line between appeals to universal norms
   and religiously grounded arguments in their own advocacy.},

Abstract = {Senegal's 2012 presidential and legislative elections reaffirmed the
   country's longstanding reputation as one of Africa's most stable
   democracies. The elections also represented a critical juncture for the
   country's party system, demonstrated by the use of new campaign
   techniques as well as the gradual exit from the political scene of an
   older generation of elites. At the same time, this article argues, the
   elections revealed continuing weaknesses within the party system,
   including low levels of institutionalization and the limited ability of
   the opposition to mobilize key constituencies, such as underemployed
   urban youth. These trends are demonstrated through disaggregated
   election data that show a high degree of electoral volatility and party
   de-alignment as well as low levels of voter turnout. Thus, while Senegal
   has now achieved the two rounds of party turnover often deemed to be an
   important indicator of democratic consolidation, the elections also
   revealed that a vibrant, pluralistic party system can nonetheless fail
   to engage citizens over time.},

Abstract = {This article examines the self-positioning of the three Baltic states in
   international politics in relation to the major structural pressures
   challenging the status quo of the transatlantic security configuration.
   The constitutive role of the Russia-Georgia war of 2008, the global
   economic recession, the debt crisis in the eurozone, and the shifting
   policy preferences and force projection of the United States towards
   Asia are explored as the key sources of the emerging Baltic security
   predicament. The empirical conclusions of the poststructuralist
   discourse analysis conducted for this study demonstrate how the Baltic
   states, in particular Estonia, have recently come to redefine the
   contents of `new' Europe, thereby shifting the extant fault lines within
   the European Union. (C) 2013 The Regents of the University of

Abstract = {This article addresses democratic peace practices in a multi-actor
   arena. It introduces a typology of international crises and spells out
   hypotheses on patterns of interstate violence in situations with state
   adversaries alone compared with those with states and non-state actors
   (NSAs). The findings on 447 International Crisis Behavior (ICB) crises,
   from 1918 to 2005, show that about half of the cases were multi-actor in
   type, both within and outside the democratic zone. The democratic peace
   assertions were supported in crises with states alone, shuttered but
   still persisted in multi-actor cases with ethnic NSAs, and reversed in
   multi-actor confrontations with non-ethnic NSAs. These findings make
   actor diversity a challenging theoretical refinement for democratic
   peace research on crisis and war.},

Abstract = {The results achieved by the Ecologists-Greens (EG) between 2007 and 2009
   represented the strongest ever electoral performance of any Greek
   ecological party. Was the rapid electoral rise of the Greek Green party
   a product of growing public concern about the environment after the
   destructive 2007 forest fires, or the result of a partisan dealignment
   in the Greek political system? A quantitative analysis of the
   demographic, behavioural, and attitudinal dimensions of the Green vote
   demonstrates that while environmental concerns played a role in the EG's
   performance, so too did discontent with the programmes of the
   traditional forces of the three-pole political system. This left the EG
   vulnerable to the polarisation of political forces in the second
   election of 2012.},

Abstract = {After 2003, Australia's domestic jihadist plots shifted from being
   externally guided to being entirely self-starting, which was out of sync
   with international trends. To identify the causes behind this turning
   point, this article first provides a brief overview of jihadist activity
   in Australia, showing how the post-2003 shift differentiates it from
   comparable countries. The article then examines several potential
   explanations for the shift that prove insufficient. Following that, the
   article demonstrates that the shift occurred because key facilitators
   between Australia and South Asia were removed or deterred. This factor,
   combined with the limited strategic importance of Australia, low levels
   of jihadist radicalization, and limited diaspora involvement from the
   countries most central to Al Qaeda operations, explains Australia's
   specific pattern of jihadist activity.},

Title = {Counter-Terrorism and the Counterfactual: Producing the `Radicalisation'
   Discourse and the UK PREVENT Strategy},
Journal = {BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICS \& INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {15},

Abstract = {This article interrogates the production of the radicalisation'
   discourse which underpins efforts to govern terrorism' pre-emptively
   through the UK's PREVENT strategy. British counter-terrorism currently
   relies upon the invention of radicalisation' and related knowledge about
   transitions to terrorism' to undertake governance of communities
   rendered suspicious. The article argues that such conceptions make
   terrorism knowable and governable through conceptions of risk.
   Radicalisation knowledge provides a counterfactual to terrorismenabling
   governmental intervention in its supposed production. It makes the
   future actionable. However, while the deployment of radicalisation'
   functions to make terrorism pre-emptively governable and knowable, it
   also renders PREVENT unstable by simultaneously presenting vulnerability
   indicators' for radicalisation as threats to the wider collectivethese
   conducts are framed as both at risk' and risky', both vulnerable and
   dangerous. This instability speaks to ad hoc production of the
   radicalisation discourse by scholarly and policy-making communities for
   the governance of terrorism through radicalisation knowledge. This
   article analyses the production of the radicalisation discourse to
   explore its performance as a form of risk governance within British
   counter-terrorism.},

Abstract = {This study focuses on how voters and politicians rationally select a
   preferred policy-making venue (Politician or Agency), and its
   implications for the principal-agent relationship between voters and
   politicians in a representative democracy. This study allows for
   incomplete information, as well as solving for the comparative static
   conditions pertaining to the extent that a politician's policy-making
   venue choices mirror those preferred by a representative voter. The
   comparative static results highlight when a politician (1) chooses the
   representative voter's preferred policy-making venue (Active or Passive
   Political Responsiveness); (2) is able to choose freely either
   policy-making venue without committing agency loss (Political
   Discretion); and (3) willing to deviate from the representative voter's
   preferred policy-making venue (Political Shirking). In contrast to the
   study by Spence, this study analytically demonstrates that one cannot
   infer that the benefits accrued from agency policy-making will
   necessarily exceed those from electoral institutions.},

Title = {There is no global public: the idea of the public and the legitimation
   of governance},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL THEORY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {5},
Number = {2},
Pages = {213-237},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Scholars of global governance have made much use of the public-private
   distinction in their exploration of the power of non-state actors and
   the constitution of authority beyond the state. But is this distinction
   analytically adequate? We subject the public-private distinction to
   analytical scrutiny and argue that it does not hold when analysing
   phenomena beyond the domestic setting. State actors are universal at the
   domestic level, but they are particularistic at the global level, being
   responsible primarily to its territorially defined constituency. The
   difference between public and private actors qua participants in global
   governance is thus overstated. We differentiate between public as a
   category of analysis and a category of practice. As a category of
   analysis, public denotes a particular configuration of accountability
   and capacity, which can, in principle, be found at the global level. As
   a category of practice, public is a claim to universality and
   responsibility that different types of actors use to legitimize what
   they do. We illustrate the added value of this conceptualization through
   a discussion of possibly emerging global public actors, and of how
   actors' claim to `publicness' in an incomplete public sphere serves to
   conceal their particularistic character, thereby undermining
   `publicness' at the global level.},

Title = {A Model for a Fiscal Union? What Europe Can Learn from the German
   Experience},
Journal = {GLOBAL POLICY},

Abstract = {The euro has strengthened the economic differences between a more
   affluent north and a struggling south, which is the core problem of the
   current crisis in the euro zone. A potential solution to this problem
   could be to transform the monetary union into a fiscal union. This
   article sketches two different models for fiscal unions: a federal
   structure like that of Germany, where federal revenues and expenditures
   are controlled in significant part by federals laws, which has an
   extensive bailout system built in; and a confederal system like that of
   Switzerland, where Cantons are autonomous in their fiscal policies but
   clear bankruptcy rules are implemented. The article describes the
   reasons for which the German arrangement, one that strongly relies on
   income equalisation, have not proven successful in harmonising the
   financial position of the Lander and municipalities and why bailouts
   have become rather the rule than the exception. In consequence Germany
   has introduced a debt brake that does not allow expenditures to be
   structurally higher than revenues. Although it is too early to evaluate
   the sustainability of such a mechanism yet, the debt brake seems to be a
   promising means for preventing an unsustainable built-up of debt under
   normal economic conditions. This article concludes that as long as debt
   brakes are not fully implemented and further fiscal harmonisation cannot
   be expected, the European Union will still have to rely on market-based
   regulatory instruments and the disciplinary function of interest rates,
   possibly culminating in a bankruptcy procedure.},

Abstract = {Empirical works measuring whether interagency collaborations delivering
   public services produce better outcomes are few, and none looks inside
   the black box of collaboration management practices. We examine whether
   there are collaboration management practices associated with improved
   performance of Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships, an interagency
   collaboration in England and Wales. These exist in every local authority
   in England and Wales, so there are enough of them to permit quantitative
   analysis. And their aim is crime reduction, and crime data over time are
   available, allowing actual outcomes (rather than outputs, perceptions,
   or self-reports) to be analyzed longitudinally. We find that there are
   management practices associated with greater success at reducing crime,
   but only if applied under bakcground circumstances favorable to
   collaboration. Those potentially effective collaboration management
   practices are similar to effective tools for managing any organization:
   being a good collaboration manager involves good management, period.
   However, under circumstances unfavorable to collaboration success,
   performance is worse than it would be if no collaboration had existed at
   all, suggesting that in some circumstances, setting up a collaboration
   in the first place is a bad idea.},

Abstract = {In this paper the author substantiates a thesis that the reason for the
   emergence of the economic and general social crisis lies in the
   withdrawal of European countries from the legislatively proclaimed model
   of a social market state and the assumption of neoliberal principles,
   which are the basis of economic globalization. He finds that
   globalization gave rise to numerous negative social phenomena resulting
   from the predominance of the economic interests of capital over other
   social values. The reestablishment of the functioning of the market
   social state in Europe that would be based on human rights could
   significantly contribute to the elimination of the causes of the crisis.
   The enforcement of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human
   Rights (Ruggi's Guiding Principles) would mean the first step towards
   the change in principles and neoliberalism in the world and its negative
   effects.},

Abstract = {The ability of unelected bureaucrats to shape public policy in a
   democracy has prompted scholars to try to understand the factors that
   affect agency decision making. The conclusion from this research has
   been that political ideology plays a substantial role in the policy
   decisions and outcomes of political appointees at independent agencies.
   However, researchers have largely ignored the role and influence of
   lower level decision making. In order to study how lower level decisions
   affect public policy, I examine how administrative law judge (ALJ)
   decisions impact subsequent decisions by the political appointees of the
   National Labor Relations Board. I examine the Board decisions for the
   period between 1991 and 2007 as a function of the ALJ decision, the
   attitudes of the Board members, exception filing, economic factors,
   external political influence, and case characteristics. Results
   demonstrate that the decision of the ALJ is the most important
   determining factor in predicting Board outcomes in both routine and
   difficult cases. These results alter previous perceptions that ideology

Abstract = {This paper investigates the Maltese labour market within the context of
   the Europeanisation process. It explains the EU's labour market policies
   and presents studies in the field. The main focus is the case study of
   Malta, which evaluates formal and informal structures of the economy and
   uses the dynamics of the interaction of ideas, interests and
   institutions to analyse whether and how Europeanisation of the Maltese
   labour market has occurred. The findings indicate that different changes
   have occurred in the legislative framework, language and values about
   work, but resistance and continuity are evident in other areas such as
   flexicurity, undeclared work and a high level of female labour market
   inactivity.},

Volume = {61},

Pages = {282-300},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Diplomacy, international commerce and the academic study of
   international relations are all based on the assumption that we can
   cross linguistic borders with very complicated words and concepts in our
   cognitive luggage. This article studies the complexities of
   communicating political words and concepts from one language/culture to
   another, noting that traditional political science has shown little
   interest in this process or its dangers. From linguistics, however, come
   two opposing theories: the effability principle defends universal
   translatability, while the linguistic relativity/Sapir-Whorf hypothesis
   holds that meaning (particularly abstract conceptual thinking) is locked
   within the grammatical and semantic structure of individual languages
   and can be transmitted with difficulty or not at all. After considering
   these rival positions, we conclude that the translation of political
   ideas from culture to culture can be more problematic than we have
   commonly believed.},

Abstract = {The four essays in this forum consider the influence of J. David
   Singer's initial views and analyses dating from the 1960s and 1970s on
   topics that continue to hold great importance today. Three essays
   consider the implications of these early works and decisions on the
   subsequent study of war, as well as their continuing wisdom (or not) in
   light of subsequent research. The fourth essay examines Singer's policy
   prescriptions in light of subsequent decisions and choices. In some
   cases, the ideas continue to have resonance with contemporary conflict
   research and policy issues, but in other instances there are grounds for
   reevaluation and the adoption of new research and data collection
   strategies or policy perspectives.},

Title = {Innovation in Local Management under and Obsolete Institutional Design:
   the Challenge of Mexican Municipalities in the 21st Century},
Journal = {REVISTA DEL CLAD REFORMA Y DEMOCRACIA},

Abstract = {Decentralization is only effective and can be achieved if local
   government, the entity that receive new functions and responsibilities,
   has an institutional design that enables it to admit the new framework
   and to develop all its own potential. Because local government is the
   nearest institution to citizens and has the better knowledge of local
   context, decentralization is suppose to become in better public goods
   and services for the community. In Mexico, thirty years after starting a
   long and slow decentralization process, results are not spectacular.
   In spite of important constitutional reforms in 1982 and 1999,
   institutional design of Mexican municipalities does not seem to be
   adequate to support the big decentralization process they are
   submitting. The brief three years period of administration, the
   impossibility of reelection of elected authorities and the fast
   personnel rotation, do not allow the institutionalization of internal
   programs and proceedings and, even less, personnel professionalization.
   Municipal government is maybe where most innovation appears and where it
   seems easier to change or adjust conventional proceedings. This paper
   tries to understand if innovation in Mexican local government is a
   result of an encouraging environment for changing or if it is a
   necessity to confront the lack of institutionalized proceedings or if it
   depends on other less evident factors.},

Abstract = {How do jihadist insurgencies differ from non-jihadist ones? Jihadist
   insurgents, like all insurgents, seek to control the government, need
   money and weapons, and thrive where government is weak. Yet their
   causejihad at local, regional, and global levelsgives them instant
   friends and resources, but also built-in enemies and burdens. Jihadist
   insurgents often organize, recruit, and fund-raise differently than
   traditional insurgent groups. The agendas of these militant groups often
   go against the local residents' sense of nationalism and anger these
   communities with their extreme interpretations of Islam. To take
   advantage of this, the United States can amplify local voices that are
   best able to discredit these insurgents and press allied regimes to
   disrupt the mosques, schools, and fund-raising networks that help
   support them. However, Washington should also recognize that weakening
   these groups at the local level may make them more likely to embrace
   international terrorism. Allied efforts to co-opt jihadists may make
   area societies and governments less favorable to other U.S. policies.
   Finally, failed democratizationa particularly salient issue given the
   Arab Springrisks playing into the jihadist narrative.},

Title = {Is State Gambling Policy ``Morality Policy{''}? Framing Debates Over
   State Lotteries},
Journal = {POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {41},
Number = {2},
Pages = {217-242},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The politics of so-called morality policies including same-sex marriage,
   abortion, gun control, and gambling have captured the attention of both
   the public and political scientists in recent years. Many studies have
   argued that morality policy constitutes a category of public policy that
   has distinctive characteristics (such as technical simplicity and less
   amenability to compromise) compared with non-morality policy. However,
   in a recent contribution Mucciaroni argues that morality policy should
   instead be viewed primarily as a strategy for framing issues. Drawing on
   examples from the debate over gay rights, Mucciaroni finds that
   opponents focus on rational-instrumental or procedural frames more so
   than engaging in morality talk. In this study, I seek to extend
   Mucciaroni's analysis to the issue of lottery gambling in the United
   States. Drawing on data from legislative records in four states, I find
   that lottery critics mostly avoid private behavior-based morality
   arguments. Instead, they criticize government's role in sanctioning
   lotteries and denounce the negative consequences of gambling.
   Supporters, meanwhile, emphasize the potential benefits of lottery
   creation and the importance of allowing the state public a voice on the
   issue. The results indicate that rational-instrumental arguments coexist
   alongside morality talk in state lottery debates, and that private
   behavior morality frames are on the decline while governmental morality
   frames are on the rise.},

Journal = {HUMAN RIGHTS QUARTERLY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {35},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {Journalists play a central role in fostering a society based on the open
   discussion of facts and the pursuit of the truth, as opposed to one
   based on rumor, prejudice, and the naked exercise of power. As a result,
   journalists are often literally in the line of fire and deserve special
   protection. This article considers the characteristics of deadly attacks
   on journalists over the last two decades and examines how the applicable
   legal and policy frameworks can be used better or improved to provide a
   higher level of protection. Impunity, often a by-product of the
   politicized nature of journalistic activities, is seen as the major
   cause of continuous attacks on journalists. The conclusion is drawn that
   one of the key elements of a strategy to better protect journalists is
   to ``elevate{''} the issue on a number of fronts: to move prevention and
   accountability from the local to the central level within domestic
   jurisdictions, while simultaneously heightening the level of
   international engagement with this issue.},

Abstract = {This article presents an overview of calculations of global inequality,
   recently and over the long term, and outlines the main controversies and
   political and philosophical implications of the findings. It focuses in
   particular on the winners and losers of the most recent episode of
   globalization, from 1988 to 2008. It suggests that the period has
   witnessed the first decline in inequality between world citizens since
   the Industrial Revolution. However, the decline can be sustained only if
   countries' mean incomes continue to converge (as they have been doing
   during the past ten years) and if internal (within-country)
   inequalities, which are already high, are kept in check. Mean-income
   convergence would also reduce the huge citizenship premium' that is
   enjoyed today by the citizens of rich countries.},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {A series of critical developments in Turkish politics from 2007 has
   signalled a historic shift in the use of power in the country, long
   controlled by the staunch and virtually autonomous bureaucracy, both
   military and civilian, in the face of fragile civilian politics. A
   unique leverage used by civilian politics in bringing about the change
   has been the discourse of Europeanization. Originally a project that was
   part and parcel of the identity politics of the bureaucracy from the
   nineteenth century, the discourse seems to have been appropriated by
   forces defiant of the bureaucratic rule to reconfigure access to power.
   This shift in power may amount to nothing less than a regime change,
   completed and sealed in the last general election in June 2011, although
   it remains to be seen whether the new regime, as yet amorphous, will
   deliver the improved democracy it promises.},

Abstract = {Never Let Me Go, Kazuo Ishiguro's novel about human clones raised for
   organs, is most often critiqued as science fiction or dystopian
   literature by the scholarly community. Yet focusing on the institutional
   implementation of cloning obscures a more critically fertile theme:
   sentiment. As demonstrated in this article, the novel has deeper
   affinities with sentimental and abolitionist literature of the
   eighteenth and nineteenth centuries than with speculative fiction. This
   generic reevaluation makes way for a broader critical approach to the
   novel's notion of humanness in the post-genome age.
   ... the face speaks to me and thereby invites me to a relation .... At
   the same time, the face is what forbids us to kill.
   -Emmanuel Levinas
   {[}A]n historical analysis of posthumanity cannot be grounded solely in
   technological transformation. Rather, it must be more broadly described
   as part of a set of interconnected discourses and philosophical claims
   surrounding concepts of mind, body, nature and artifice. It must take
   into account the historiography of concepts that have emerged and the
   cultural, political and media instantiations through which moral claims
   about a shift of humanisms can be asserted.

Abstract = {U.S. journalists and commentators have helped popularize the image of
   two distinct Latin American lefts: a ``bad{''} left that is politically
   authoritarian and economically erratic and a ``good{''} left that is
   democratic and committed to free-market economics. This binary image
   oversimplifies the Latin American left in three ways: by overstating the
   contrast between the two alleged camps, by ignoring complex realities
   within each camp, and by exaggerating the failings of the so-called
   bad-left governments. The distinction makes sense, however, as a
   strategy for countering the rise of independent left-leaning governments
   in Latin America. Binary characterizations of subordinate peoples
   reflect a common discursive response to popular resistance on the part
   of imperial interests and one with many precedents in the history of
   U.S.-Latin American relations. Widespread U.S. media adherence to the
   good-left/bad-left thesis is explicable given this context and given the
   historic and continuing dependence of the press on state and corporate
   interests.},

   political violence to terrorist activity. In order to apply theories of
   contagion/diffusion to terrorism, Granger causality analysis of
   terrorist activity in three state dyadsLebanonIsrael, PeruColombia,

   general and specific terrorist tactics in particular are analyzed. The
   test results show that there are correlations of terrorist events that
   indicate evidence of contagion and/or diffusion in all three dyads
   tested, although the patterns of contagion/diffusion are different for

Abstract = {What determines the emergence and survival of democracy? The authors
   apply extreme bounds analysis to test the robustness of fifty-nine
   factors proposed in the literature, evaluating over three million
   regressions with data from 165 countries from 1976 to 2002. The most
   robust determinants of the transition to democracy are gross domestic
   product (GDP) growth (a negative effect), past transitions (a positive
   effect), and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
   membership (a positive effect). There is some evidence that fuel
   exporters and Muslim countries are less likely to see democracy emerge,
   although the latter finding is driven entirely by oil-producing Muslim
   countries. Regarding the survival of democracy, the most robust
   determinants are GDP per capita (a positive effect) and past transitions
   (a negative effect). There is some evidence that having a former
   military leader as the chief executive has a negative effect, while
   having other democracies as neighbors has a reinforcing effect.},

Abstract = {The Bush administration's Global War on Terror has, by both defenders
   and critics, been characterized as unique. However, as this article
   shows, there is a long tradition, both in the United States and in
   Europe, of fighting wars against savage tribesagainst enemies who fail
   to make a distinction between soldiers and civilians, and who use terror
   as a weapon. The problem of how to fight such groups was much discussed
   in the legal literature of the nineteenth century. This is a discussion
   from which it is possible to learn contemporary lessons.},

Abstract = {The United States has used unmanned, aerial vehiclesdronesto launch
   attacks on militants associated with Al Qaeda and other violent groups
   based in Pakistan. The goal is to degrade the target's capacity to
   undertake political and violent action. We assess the effectiveness of
   drone strikes in achieving this goal, measuring degradation as the
   capacity of Al Qaeda to generate and disseminate propaganda. Propaganda
   is a key output of many terrorist organizations and a long-standing
   priority for Al Qaeda. Unlike other potential measures of terrorist
   group activity and capacity, propaganda output can be observed and
   measured. If drone strikes have degraded Al Qaeda, their occurrence
   should be correlated with a reduction in the organization's propaganda
   output. The analysis presented here finds little evidence that this is
   the case. Drone strikes have not impaired Al Qaeda's ability to generate
   propaganda.},

Abstract = {During the twentieth century, the political action of the urban poor in
   Santiago de Chile and Rio de Janeiro was a focal point of research in
   the social sciences. A critical reading of the major theories that were
   proposed begins with an analysis of marginality theory, which
   represented the first (negative) interpretation of the political
   potential of the marginalized. Subsequently, Santiago and Rio witnessed
   a series of urban popular experiences that elicited two opposing schools
   of thought: the urban-social-movement school and the utilitarian
   perspective. Chilean and Brazilian social scientists grappled with the
   way the popular sectors reacted to each country's military dictatorship,
   and their interpretations reflected a certain indeterminacy, ranging
   from rediscovery to eulogy to denial. Urban popular struggle must be
   rethought in order to move beyond this theoretical ambivalence.},

Abstract = {In recent decades, progressive city administrations and urban
   shantytowns have both proliferated across Latin America. Many leftist
   local governments have tried to improve shantytown conditions, but
   ineffective engagement of residents has often undermined these efforts.
   Games and game techniques can enhance participation in these urban
   development programs as they already have for broader Latin American
   movements for participatory democracy such as Freire's popular
   education, Boal's Theater of the Oppressed, and participatory budgeting
   in Brazil. A case study of the Argentine development program Rosario
   Habitat shows how games can animate people, challenge their assumptions,
   and establish collaborative social ties. The program also illustrates
   how the lessons of game design can be extended even deeper by
   redesigning the entire participatory process to be more gamelike. This
   game approach has enabled Rosario Habitat to forge fairer and more
   informed community agreements and to spark more active and meaningful
   participation.},

Abstract = {The campaigns for the abolition of slavery in the British Empire,
   spanning over 40 years, represented one of the major political issues of
   the late Enlightenment, and drew in people of all backgrounds. The very
   idea of humanity was at stake and this was an issue of broad-based
   concern. For the abolitionists, the humanity of black slaves was not in
   doubt, it was the actions of a society who condoned the practice, active
   or passive, that they saw as inhuman. Against this backdrop,
   Enlightenment thinkers were working on theories of justice, rights and
   humanity which would have an enduring influence on politics, society and
   academic thought for hundreds of years to come. This article addresses
   this historical context which, it is argued, is vital in reading,
   interpreting and applying Enlightenment thought in international
   relations today. The article presents primary and secondary historical
   evidence to this end and proposes that Spivak's conceptualization of
   sanctioned ignorance' offers much for understanding how it can be that
   European political thought has been so divorced from the context of

Abstract = {Many Colombians are confronted with the ongoing conflict that influences
   their decision making in everyday life, including their behavior in
   labor markets. This study focuses on the impact of violent conflict on
   self-employment, enlarging the usual determinants with a set of conflict
   variables. Our estimation strategy compares three different estimates:
   one from fixed-effects panel data (OLS-FE), estimates using lagged
   conflict indicators instead of contemporaneous regressors, and
   instrumental variables (IV-FE) estimates. Our results show that a one
   standard deviation increase in net displacement rates increases the rate
   of self-employment by about 7 percent points. Dividing the self-employed
   into different sectors (services and agriculture), we find that net
   displacement increases self-employment in the services sector but has no
   effect in agriculture that is affected by attacks by rebel and
   paramilitary groups, instead. Looking at the income of self-employed
   individuals, an influx of displaced reduces sharply hourly income in the
   self-employment sector.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},

Volume = {22},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {95-114},

Abstract = {As power is increasingly removed from local to national and global
   arenas, local environmental activists struggle both to secure local
   redress of their grievances and to place their concerns on supra-local
   agendas. Yet some succeed in doing so. In order to elucidate the
   conditions that facilitate such successes, campaigns concerning three
   issues road-building, waste incineration and airport expansion are
   examined. In each, local campaigners in England have, at least briefly,
   achieved national attention. Local campaigns are most likely to succeed
   in elevating their concerns to the status of national issues where they
   frame those concerns as translocal issues by networking with others with
   similar grievances. They are most likely to do this with the assistance
   of non-local actors such as national environmental non-governmental
   organisations, assistance that is most likely to be provided where the
   issue concerns a problematic government policy, and to be sustained only
   so long as that issue is nationally salient and consistent with the
   campaign priorities of those organisations. The rise of climate change
   as the master frame' of environmentalism has had diverse implications
   for local campaigns.},

Abstract = {Commentators and scholars alike recognize the important role political
   dissatisfaction plays in the process of regime change. A considerable
   body of literature has used dissatisfaction with a regime and distrust
   in political institutions to explain political dynamics during
   democratization's initial phase, yet these indicators are rarely used to
   assess disaffection with politics in established democratic regimes.
   Recent research on the post-communist region has established that
   citizens demonstrate high levels of political alienation, and that
   ethnic minority communities in particular are widely dissatisfied with
   democratic politics, institutions and regimes. This paper uses the 2004
   data from the New Baltic Barometer to analyse individual-level
   disaffection with politics among the minorities in the Baltic States and
   explores the structural roots of such disaffection. The paper draws upon
   interviews with political representatives of minority communities in
   order to understand their perceptions of opportunities to participate in
   decision-making. Building on quantitative and qualitative analysis, the
   paper concludes that disaffection with politics among both the mass of
   ethnic minorities and their elite groups is best explained by the
   misrepresentation of minority interests in post-communist Baltic
   polities.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},

Volume = {20},

Pages = {132-154},
Abstract = {We empirically investigate the nature and outcomes of the liberalization
   process in European telecommunications. First, we show that decisions to
   liberalize a country's telecommunications sector have followed a
   path-dependent and cumulative pace. Moreover, we investigate the extent
   to which path dependency might have forced liberalizations, regardless
   of the creation of complementary institutions governing pro-market
   outcomes. We find that the impact of liberalizations on competition is
   strongly enhanced by the establishment of complementary institutions,
   such as the national regulatory authority. Our findings contribute to
   the existing literature by outlining the role played by path dependency
   and institutional complementarities in the process of European
   liberalization. Our conclusions may provide useful lessons for the
   optimal policy design of pro-market policies in those European network
   industries that still wait for substantial liberalization.},

Abstract = {This special issue contributes to extant empirical scholarship assessing
   governmental capacity to meet significant policy challenges, in this
   case those related to climate change adaptation. The study includes
   detailed examination of five policy sectorsfinance, infrastructure,
   energy, forestry, and transportationin two countries, Canada and the
   United Statesin order to determine what kinds of governance arrangements
   and analytical capacities exist in this area, how they are changing (if
   at all), and how they interrelate with the status and evolution of
   climate change outcomes in each sector. The articles provide a
   comprehensive sampling of policy network structure and behavior,
   organizational mandates and resources, and actual job duties and
   training of policy actors across these sectors at both the federal and
   subnational level of government.},

Abstract = {The aim is to analyze the views of the administrations of George W. Bush
   and Barack Obama regarding deterrence, the reduction of nuclear weapons
   and missile defense. It is argued that both administrations reaffirmed
   the fundamental role of nuclear weapons for deterrence, committed
   themselves to reducing nuclear weapons with initiatives for
   modernization and recognized the importance of missile defense to
   protect the US and its allies. Such views are related to the ongoing
   need to expand the flexibility to deal with contemporary threats and
   maintain diverse options for addressing these challenges.},

Abstract = {This article examines the formative platform of the Congress of Panama
   of 1826. It seeks to support the hypothesis that the nature and scope of
   the first test of integration in the Western Hemisphere depended
   critically on the platform created by Simon Bolivar and other Latin
   American Independence heroes from the Declaration of Independence of
   Venezuela in 1810 until the last bilateral agreement of 1826. In that
   respect, it corroborates the Latin American Identity of the initiative.},

Abstract = {This article presents the contribution that critical discourse analysis
   (CDA) can make to critical policy studies through comparison with two
   other approaches which also advocate a `discursive turn' in policy
   studies and that have been discussed in the journal: cultural political
   economy (CPE), and poststructuralist discourse analysis (PDA). I suggest
   that there are significant differences between CDA, CPE and PDA in their
   view of the discursive turn, and that a version of CDA which integrates
   argumentation theory and analysis with CDA can add significantly to the
   contributions that CPE and PDA might make to policy analysis. In the
   Conclusion, I address a suspicion that using argumentation analysis
   entails a commitment to Habermasian/Rawlsian `deliberative democracy,'
   suggesting that argumentation analysis is also not only consistent with
   but also necessary for Gramscian approaches to political and policy
   analysis, including CPE and PDA.},

Abstract = {Quality of township management is highly related to society, and it
   reflects the local government situation. However, past research seldom
   discusses the balanced scorecard and Importance-performance analysis
   concepts of townships management, which is a driving factor in the
   enhancement enterprises and local government performance. This paper
   proposes the concepts of balanced scored to combine the analysis and
   integration of township resident surveys for Electronic Toll Collection
   (ETC) implementation. The implication of the existing perspective on
   management concept is that performance evaluation systems emerging in
   profit and non-profit enterprises are going to meet the needs of local
   governments in terms of townships that citizens' satisfaction in Taiwan.},

Abstract = {This chapter analyses the linkage between disarmament and global
   security. Traditional notion of security has changed dramatically in the
   21st century. The attention of the world community has shifted from the
   security of the state to the security of the people. When the idea of an
   independent Commission for Human Security was launched at the 2000 UN
   Millennium Summit, there was a general agreement on the importance of
   ensuring freedom from want and freedom from fear. There is a new breed
   of threats to human and ecological security in the form of terrorist
   attacks and they may acquire nuclear weapons. Nuclear terrorism is a
   grave threat to global security. There is also a fear that the existing
   UN mechanism to halt nuclear arms race and proliferation of nuclear
   weapons is inadequate as all countries have not signed the nuclear
   Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), and the division between nuclear haves
   and nuclear have-nots is a major hurdle in the creation of the nuclear
   non-proliferation regime.},

Title = {The Israeli negotiation strategy under Netanyahu: settlement without
   reconciliation},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {24},
Number = {3},
Pages = {265-283},
Abstract = {Purpose - This article aims to analyse the Israeli negotiation strategy
   in reference to the theoretical frameworks of reconciliation and
   settlement. It focuses on the Israeli-Palestinian negotiation experience
   over the past three years, or since Netanyahu was elected Prime Minister
   of the Israeli Government in 2009.
   Design/methodology/approach - Theoretical literature provides two
   hypothetical frameworks for resolution of conflicts: a political
   settlement; and reconciliation between parties to the conflict. This
   article argues that Israel's vision of conflict resolution effectively
   attempts to integrate both hypothetical frameworks by proposing a
   political settlement for Palestinians in return for obtaining
   reconciliation from them. To analyse this strategy, this article
   explores the Israeli political discourse over the past three years, as
   well as Israel's vision of the conflict resolution as is manifest in
   this discourse.
   Findings - The article argument is based on the indication that
   willingness of a party to reach a settlement is met with reconciliation
   from the other party to the conflict. A party's insistence on offering a
   settlement and attaining reconciliation is associated with power
   relations between both parties. To maintain its powerful position, the
   stronger party usually demands reconciliation from the weaker party, at
   the same time presenting a settlement that implies a political, not
   moral, recognition of the weaker party with a view to dispossess it from
   its moral logic in the conflict.
   Originality/value - An assessment of the Israeli political discourse
   over the past three years indicates that Israel is implementing a
   compound negotiation strategy to resolve the conflict. The strategy
   entails settlement and reconciliation components. Israel wishes to deal
   with Palestinians through a political settlement. On the other hand,
   Israel wants the Palestinians to deal with it through the reconciliation
   process.},

Abstract = {The home-external nexus is stronger today than ever before; diplomacy
   has been `domesticized'. The embassy has gained in value as the home
   country's best source of comprehensive information on the country of
   location. This impacts on the work of embassies. A key target for public
   diplomacy is the home audience; and the embassy, paradoxically, has the
   potential to help the home foreign ministry in its domestic outreach. By
   receiving visitors from home, the embassy plays a key role in burnishing
   the image of the country's diplomacy and in networking with key decision
   makers, including non-state personalities, that play an influential
   role. We also examine ethical dilemmas in the work of embassies,
   including instances of corruption and the role embassies play during
   transformative events. A few foreign ministries, notably the United
   States, operate dissent channels through which embassy officials can
   express views that differ with official policy. This approach is worth
   emulating.},

Volume = {41},

Abstract = {Public policy toward the poor has shifted from an initial optimism
   during the War on Poverty to an ever-increasing pessimism. Media
   discussion of poverty has shifted from arguments that focus on the
   structural causes of poverty or the social costs of having large numbers
   of poor to portrayals of the poor as cheaters and chiselers and of
   welfare programs doing more harm than good. As the frames have shifted,
   policies have followed. We demonstrate these trends with new indicators
   of the depth of poverty, the generosity of the government response, and
   media framing of the poor for the period of 19602008. We present a
   simple statistical model that explains poverty spending by the severity
   of the problem, gross domestic product, and media coverage. We then
   create a new measure of the relative generosity of U.S. government
   policy toward the poor and show that it is highly related to the content
   of newspaper stories. The portrayal of the poor as either deserving or
   lazy drives public policy.},

Abstract = {Political science in recent years has been divided along methodological
   lines. In comparative politics but also increasingly in international
   relations, these divisions take the form of different `new'
   institutionalist approaches. This chapter discusses all four of these
   neo-institutionalisms in an effort to demonstrate the importance of
   methodological pluralism. The three long-standing neo-institutionalisms
   include rational choice institutionalism, focused on rationalist
   interests and institutional incentives; historical institutionalism,
   concerned with institutional path-dependent rules and regularities; and
   sociological institutionalism, centred on cultural norms and
   institutional frames. The most recent neo-institutionalism, discursive
   institutionalism, concentrates on the substantive content of ideas and
   the interactive processes of discourse in institutional context. It
   claims to be better able to explain the dynamics of change than the
   three other neo-institutionalisms, which tend to be better at explaining
   continuity but have lately also been concerned with `endogenizing'
   change.},

Journal = {POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {41},
Number = {1},
Pages = {70-96},
Abstract = {City councils are significant, though seldom central, actors in local
   policy networks providing public assistance to disadvantaged residents.
   Mayors and council members in 12 American cities more often support than
   oppose public assistance initiatives. They claim that their own
   normative judgments are more important to their preferences and voting
   behavior on such matters than are public opinion, group demands, or
   economic considerations. While such elected officials hold a variety of
   justice principles, the most important of these affecting their
   positions on public assistance issues is the floors principle. A broad
   ethical commitment to providing social minimums enhances support for
   living-wage ordinances, for linking subsidies for economic development
   to assistance to less advantaged citizens, and for exempting spending on
   social services from budget cuts. We discuss the implications of these
   findings for major theories of urban politics and
   policiescollective-action theory, regime theory, and pluralismand for
   advocates on behalf of the urban poor.},

Title = {Collective narratives as indicators of examining intergroup relations
   The case of Palestinian Muslims and Christians in Israel},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {24},
Number = {3},
Pages = {231-244},
Abstract = {Purpose - This study aims to examine inter-group relations between two
   religious minorities, Palestinian Christians and Muslim citizens of
   Israel, by measuring perceptions of in-group and ``other{''} group
   collective narratives.
   Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected from a representative
   sample of 1,121 Muslims and 756 Christians in Israel. The questionnaire
   presents narratives that are common among Muslim and Christian
   populations in Israel, relating to eight different historical, social,
   or political events. Subjects were asked to rate levels of legitimacy,
   feeling of empathy, and anger towards each one of the presented
   narratives.
   Findings - In comparison to Muslims, Christians reported a lower
   tendency to give legitimacy to the narrative of the other, showed more
   emotions of anger, and lower feeling of empathy towards the Muslim
   narrative. In addition, a content analysis of the narratives that were
   used in the questionnaire revealed two different patterns of response to
   narratives. One related to narratives with national issues, where
   Christians seemed to be excluded from the Palestinian nation, and the
   other related to narratives with religious issues, where Muslims
   reported more anger, less empathy and less legitimacy towards the
   Christian narratives.
   Originality/value - The paper presents a new tool based on Sagy, Adwan
   and Kaplan, developed to examine perceptions of in-group and ``other{''}
   group collective narratives. This study examined the tool in a different
   context of conflict. In addition to the quantitative measures of the
   perceptions of the collective narratives, the paper describes a new
   method for analyzing the data collected by this tool.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {15},
Number = {4},
Pages = {491-514},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This essay bridges the standard divide between traditional realist and
   critical IR theory by demonstrating their unity in the international
   thought of E. H. Carr. In recent times, numerous scholars have
   challenged Carr's mainstream disciplinary image as a traditional
   realist, seeking to dissociate him from realism and narrate him as a
   proto-critical theorist instead. However, this has implicitly reinforced
   the divide between the two perspectives and obscured their fusion in
   Carr's thought. In contrast, this essay does not deny Carr's realism,
   but rather reveals how it expressed a distinctly critical theoretical
   consciousness. Focusing primarily on his attacks on liberal statecraft
   and liberal historiography in, respectively, The Twenty Years' Crisis
   and What Is History? it demonstrates that his analyses manifested key
   critical theory elements, including anti-positivist epistemology,
   counter-hegemonic tendencies, Western Marxist ideology critique and
   sociology of knowledge, and a commitment to progressive human
   emancipation from self-imposed constraints.},

Abstract = {This article explores the growing perception, prompted by the eurozone
   crisis, of Germany as a hegemonic power in the European Union. The
   article explores the realignments in the power balance within the
   European Union (EU) by making an original application of the insights
   from the literature on hegemony. It reviews the evidence for Germany
   playing a hegemonic role, but then emphasizes three sets of constraints.
   First, German pre-eminence is largely confined to the economic sphere.
   Even in this area Germany has not acted fully in line with the role
   ascribed by hegemonic stability theory. Second, its pre-eminence in the
   EU encounters problems of international legitimacy. Third, growing
   constraints arising from German domestic politics further hamper playing
   the role of hegemon. In consequence, Germany is intrinsically a
   reluctant hegemon: one whose economic leadership is recognized but
   politically contested. The conclusion considers the significance of
   these findings on the EU's most important member state.},

Abstract = {This article examines the nuclear command and control (C-2) system
   implemented in Pakistan since 1998, and discusses its potential
   consequences for the risk of inadvertent or unauthorised use of nuclear
   weapons. I argue that troubled civil-military relations and Pakistan's
   doctrine of asymmetric escalation' account for the creation of a command
   and control system with different characteristics during peacetime and
   military crises. Although the key characteristics of Pakistan's nuclear
   C-2 system allow relatively safe nuclear operations during peacetime,
   operational deployment of nuclear weapons during military standoffs is
   likely to include only rudimentary protections against inadvertent or
   unauthorised nuclear release. The implication of this study is that any
   shift from peacetime to wartime command and control procedures is likely
   to further destabilise Indo-Pakistani relations during the early stages
   of a diplomatic or military standoff, and introduce a non-trivial risk
   of accidental escalation to the nuclear level.},

Title = {Slavery in Europe: Part 1, Estimating the Dark Figure},
Journal = {HUMAN RIGHTS QUARTERLY},

Volume = {35},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The estimation of the ``dark figure{''} for any crime (the number of
   actual instances of a specific crime committed minus the reported cases
   of that crime within a population) has primarily rested on the ability
   to conduct random sample crime surveys. Such surveys are based on the
   assumption that victims experience crimes that are discrete, time-bound,
   and of relatively short duration. The crime of enslavement, however,
   presents a special challenge to estimation because it is of
   indeterminate duration. This challenge is compounded by the fact that
   victims of slavery are also often isolated by the stigma linked to
   sexual assault, or a sense of shame over their enslavement. Using a
   unique dataset, based in part on the random sample surveys of Julia
   Pennington et al. (2009), and extended through a process of
   extrapolation, this paper estimates the numbers of victims of slavery
   and human trafficking for thirty-seven countries in Europe. These
   estimated numbers of slavery victims are then compared with reported
   cases of slavery and trafficking for the same countries.},

Volume = {50},

Abstract = {The recent recovery of an empirically and ethically richer realist
   tradition involves an explicit contrast with neorealism's more
   scientistic explanatory aspirations. This contrast is, however,
   incomplete. Although Waltz's theoretical work is shaped by his
   understanding of the requirements of scientific adequacy, his empirical
   essays are normatively quite rich: he defends bipolarity, and criticizes
   US adventurism overseas, because he believes bipolarity to be conducive
   to effective great power management of the international system, and
   hence to the avoidance of nuclear war. He is, in this sense, a theorist
   divided against himself: much of his oeuvre exhibits precisely the kind
   of pragmatic sensibility that is typically identified as distinguishing
   realism from neorealism. His legacy for a reoriented realism is
   therefore more complex than is usually realized. Indeed, the nature of
   Waltz's own analytical endeavour points towards a kind of international
   political theory in which explanatory and normative questions are
   intertwined.},

Abstract = {Morgenthau's characterizations of the politics among nations in the
   twentieth century remain a contested, but still compelling, vision of
   international relations in the twenty-first century. Hence, different
   strains of `critical theory' are needed as the means of crisis
   detection, interpretation and legitimation. Without accepting the terms
   of Morgenthau's analysis uncritically, this article looks at how
   critical theory insights, as developed in different streams of Frankfurt
   School-inspired critique, can arguably guide new discourse coalitions
   and policy experts in coping with the challenges of crises in the
   post-Cold War world. The contradictions posed by the inequities of
   social wealth's production and distribution are profound and obdurate.
   Exerting verdictive power, like Morgenthau, in managing the global
   crises, national security challenges or financial instability conflicts,
   can be useful.},

Abstract = {Andri's fiction is closely identified with Bosnia and often taken for a
   faithful reflection of that country's culture, social relations, and
   tragic history. Rather than reflecting Bosnian pluralism, however, his
   oeuvre undermines its very metaphysical underpinnings, in part because
   his works are so firmly rooted in the European experience of the
   nineteenth and twentieth centuries. From the perspective of a dominant
   modernity, certain cultures and peoples came to be presented as
   un-European, Oriental, and essentially foreign. Bosnia, which had always
   been a religiously plural society, now became one where ideological
   models excluded its Muslim inhabitants. In line with long-standing
   European practice, Andri drew an image of the Bosnian Muslim as Turk and
   the Turk as Bosnian Muslim, converting the real content of Bosnian
   society into a plastic material for the ideologues of homogenous
   societies to use in modelling external and internal enemies that were
   essentially identical. This process required as its precondition the
   destruction of that enemy through a process described as the social and
   cultural liberation of the Christian subject. Over time, this exclusion
   took on forms now termed genocide. In creating this image, Andri
   deployed narrative techniques whose function may fairly be characterized
   as the aesthetic dissimulation of our ethical responsibilities towards
   the other and the different. Such elements from his oeuvre have been
   used in the nationalist ideologies anti-Muslimism serves as a building
   block. In this paper, certain aspects of the ideological reading and
   interpretation of Andri's oeuvre are presented.},

Abstract = {To what extent do transnational companies (TNCs) have the capacity to
   influence public policy? This article uses the results of a major new
   study of TNC ownership to shed light on this issue. It is found that TNC
   ownership and control is extremely concentrated and that there is an
   inner core of firms with strong co-ownership links that is
   overrepresented in the membership of major business organizations. It is
   concluded that these factors enhance the potential for TNCs in general,
   and core TNCs in particular, to influence public policy.},

Abstract = {This article argues that the future of public services will be shaped
   increasingly by the evolution of global, Internet-enabled, digital
   platforms, with two distinctive technical and commercial features.
   First, use of open standards and architectures that separate standard
   business logic from supporting applications will allow government to
   become technology- and vendor-agnostic, freeing it from its
   overdependence on proprietary systems and suppliers. Second, over time,
   open standards and increased market choice will drive both innovation
   and progressive convergence on cheaper, standard utility public
   services. These two features will combine to create a powerful dynamic
   situation, driving disintegration of traditional black boxed
   technologies and services, traditionally organized around systems
   integrators and departmental structures, and their reaggregation around
   the citizen in the form of services. Such reaggregation is allowing
   progressively sharp distinctions between niche/innovative and
   commodity/standard offerings, supplied by a plural, innovative, and more
   cost-effective marketplace, with unprecedented implications for the way
   in which the state buys and deploys technology. We draw on a range of
   data from across public and private sectors to illustrate our argument
   and identify some key policy and implementation recommendations.},

Title = {Resource curse or resource disease? Oil in Ghana},
Journal = {AFRICAN AFFAIRS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {112},
Number = {449},
Pages = {583-601},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Ghana has recently joined the ranks of oil-producing states with a
   projected output of 120,000 barrels per day. This has greatly elevated
   hopes among the general public, but also sparked fears of a `Nigerian
   scenario' in which oil becomes a problem rather than a solution. This
   article argues that Ghana, as a latecomer to the oil industry, may
   possess a structural immunity against the natural resource curse. The
   argument centres on three main factors: the country's stable political
   system, its relatively robust and diversified economy, and the strength
   of civil society. As a result, the usual symptoms linked to oil
   extraction across the developing world are unlikely to turn the country
   upside down. Instead, we suggest that the `curse' should be perceived as
   a treatable `disease'. The article pursues this analogy by showing that,
   since the discovery of oil, Ghana has been strengthening its `immune
   system' through a new legal framework, improvements in transparency and
   accountability, and modest attempts to strengthen non-resource sectors
   of the economy.},

Abstract = {English local authorities face a combination of deep budget cuts and
   sharp increases in citizen demand, linked to the costs of recession and
   demographic changes. Evidence from case study research shows the
   dominance of cost-cutting and efficiency measures, as in previous
   periods of austerity. But creative approaches to service redesign are
   also emerging as the crisis deepens, based upon pragmatic politics and
   institutional bricolage. While the absence of radical new ideas and
   overt political conflict is surprising, local government reveals a
   remarkable capacity to reinvent its institutional forms to weather what
   amounts to a `perfect storm'.},

   period 1987-2005 by analysing the characteristic features of Israel's
   approach and its ability to adapt to the challenges posed by the
   Palestinian and Lebanese insurgencies. It first outlines the evolution
   of the Israeli counterinsurgency. It subsequently examines the Israeli
   approach through the lens of the country's strategic culture,
   illuminating its features, rationales and goals, and concludes by
   examining to what extent Israel managed to adapt to the challenges of
   fighting insurgents.},

Abstract = {Despite similar conceptual underpinnings, estimates of program
   replacement rates in the Comparative Welfare Entitlements Dataset and
   the Social Citizenship Indicators Project do not always correspond with
   each other. Understanding why these similar conceptual measures vary is
   important both for understanding replacement rate generosity and for
   promoting the comparative study of social rights. We find that major
   differences in estimates of replacement rates in the two projects hinge
   on a few operational assumptions and some less obvious measurement
   errors. It seems likely that many of these differences can (and should)
   be reconciled to produce much more closely correlated measures.},

Abstract = {It can be risky for governments to renege on exchange rate commitments,
   but it is misleading to characterize the costs as audience costs. While
   an audience costs approach assumes that the punishment for reneging is
   automatic, we model the choice of exchange rate policy in the shadow of
   elections as a signaling game between voters and governments, where
   governments have private information and voters are rational. We find
   that voters draw different inferences when they see reneging by
   different actors, and only Left governments are punished for breaking
   their promises. We test this hypothesis in the context of the
   post-Communist countries from 1990 to 2007 and find that Left
   governments were more likely to fall if they reneged on exchange rate
   commitments, but Right governments were not.},

Abstract = {The cinema has been used by Egyptian regimes, from the monarchy until
   Mubarak, to resist the political agenda of Islamic radicals and
   terrorists. Edward Said and others describe Islamic terrorists' images
   in the Western media as Western fantasies. Nevertheless, for Egyptian
   intellectuals, terrorists were and remain a stark reality. In Egypt, the
   entire state apparatus was set in motion to fight Islamic terrorism. The
   state was unprepared for the massive popular uprising of 2011. While the
   direction that Egyptian culture will follow after Mubarak remains
   unclear, an important objective is to study pre-revolutionary Egyptian
   cinema and to understand its ideological tendencies.},

Year = {2013},
Volume = {50},
Number = {5},
Pages = {623-638},

Abstract = {The United States, Richard Hofstadter once remarked, is a country that
   has the misfortune not to have an ideology but to be one. In this
   article, an amendment to Hofstadter's claim is made, suggesting that
   tied in with the United States's sense of self, is not only what people
   usually see as some version of US `exceptionalism' - the United States
   as the `shining city on the hill' or, more recently, the `indispensable
   nation' - but also a constant and continuing Manichaeism in both the
   understanding and the practice of its foreign policy. There is a
   permanent temptation for the United States to `moralise' its relations
   with others, often rationalising its own actions by demonising its
   opponents. This article argues that any understanding of US foreign
   policy must embed an understanding of a long-standing imperative to
   transform global and regional politics through opposition to `evil'. The
   Manichean `temptation' is alive and well in contemporary US foreign
   policy, invoking `evil' to justify US actions abroad sometimes leading
   to the infliction of unnecessary and often avoidable suffering.},

Abstract = {This article is an empirical analysis of China's use of the Shanghai
   Cooperation Organization (SCO) to engage in soft balancing behaviour
   against the United States. The author argues that China aims to expand
   its security and power in Central Asia primarily through the SCO.
   However, China's rise in the region is taking place within an
   international system, dominated by the United States. Perceiving a
   threat from the hegemon, China makes instrumental use of the SCO to soft
   balance US influence in the region. The author further identifies the
   major soft balancing tactics that China employs through the SCO,
   including pursuing collective action, promoting institutional norms and
   competing for supporters. The author concludes by stating that soft
   balancing is a natural strategic option for China given its current
   commitment to the concept of `peaceful rise'.},

Abstract = {Visual imagery in environmental politics can be an effective way to
   engage the public. However, research based on 21 interviewees with
   activists from nine environmental non-governmental organisations (ENGOs)
   in China suggests that the value of images in promoting environmental
   initiatives is not limited to the exhibition of them, but is also seen
   in the making of them. Increasingly in China, ENGOs are offering free
   natural photographic tutoring to the public. Camera lenses are seen as
   conduits to recast self-nature relations, which has the potential to
   raise environmental awareness and promote ENGO membership. Drawing on
   both theories of social movements and contemporary Chinese subaltern
   political sociology, this paper provides new insights into grass-roots
   environmental mobilisation in China.},

Abstract = {In European Union (EU) countries, public debates about immigrants and
   citizenship are increasingly framed in cultural terms. Yet, there is no
   agreement within the citizenship literature on whether a cultural
   citizenship representation can be distinguished from the more
   established ethnic and civic representations and on how its measures
   relate to anti-immigrant attitudes. The present study tested measures of
   citizenship representations among high school students (N=1476) in six
   EU countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands, and
   Sweden). Factor analyses favored a three-factor model of citizenship
   representations (i.e., ethnic, cultural, and civic factors), which
   showed partial metric invariance. Across countries, ethnic and cultural
   scales correlated positively with each other and negatively with the
   civic scale. Moreover, ethnic and cultural scales related positively and
   the civic scale negatively to anti-immigrant attitudes. However, when
   analyzed simultaneously, relations of the ethnic scale with
   anti-immigrant attitudes were no longer significant, while those of the
   cultural and civic scales proved to be robust. Implications of these
   findings are discussed.},

Abstract = {The Swiss economy's comparatively robust performance in the current
   economic crisis is partly the result of its characteristics, but public
   institutions also made Switzerland resilient. We focus here on
   institutions that foster sound public finances. The Swiss federal debt
   brake played a key role in keeping the federal debt in check; along with
   fiscal rules, institutions such as direct democracy and federalism
   counteract the biases that tend to make elected representatives less
   fiscally conservative than citizens. This leads to more well-targeted
   public expenditure and greater public efficiency and helps to avoid
   excessively high taxes. These features are beneficial in ordinary times,
   and they increase the scope of action in times of crisis.},

Abstract = {U.S. energy firms are increasingly expanding their production of natural
   gas oftentimes by relying on a controversial extraction technique known
   as hydraulic fracturing. While proponents cite a litany of benefits
   including economic development and reduced carbon emissions, opponents
   articulate concerns typically centering on environmental quality. Caught
   between these opposing points of view, states are turning to disclosure
   requirements. Yet all disclosure statutes are not created equally. In
   order to better understand this variation, I utilize Abel, Stephan, and
   Kraft's (ASK) 2007 performance model, which evaluates the effectiveness
   of information-based disclosure rules for industry. The model here,
   however, is applied in an attempt to understand why disclosure
   regulations emerge and vary across states. Results generally validate
   the ASK approach but with one caveat. I find that in the context of
   differing disclosure regulations, the ASK model's pollution
   severity/risk measure may be refined by including risk perception.},

Abstract = {More than half a decade after the outbreak of the greatest economic
   crisis since the Great Depression, the world economy is still facing
   serious difficulties. Much more than during a `normal' recession, the
   Great Recession of recent years has uncovered serious structural
   problems in the world economy and has brought about levels of
   unemployment unprecedented in modern times (Elsby et al. 2010). It first
   became clear that the financial sector had become in effect
   self-referential and too much removed from its traditional role of
   allocating finance throughout the whole economy (Menkhoff and Meyer,
   2010). Following this, the structural weaknesses of the Euro were
   exposed leading to serious questions about the long-term sustainability
   of the most ambitious currency union ever attempted.},

Abstract = {Recent waves of accumulation have been well documented in this journal
   with regard to land and natural resources, but labour is missing from
   these important analyses of profound continuity and change. This article
   focuses on step-wise' migrations and specifically on cases of emigration
   from Senegal and entry to the Spanish labour market. The labour regime
   is conceptualised as unfree labour mobility, which integrates
   dispossession, territorial control, illegalisation, the ideology of
   racism and the exploitation of labour. Finding salience in earlier
   theories of unfree labour, this article shows how the control of capital
   over migration to Europe perpetuates underdevelopment.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to inform the debate about strategies and
   options for countering online radicalization within the U.S. domestic
   context. Its aim is to provide a better understanding of how the
   Internet facilitates radicalization; an appreciation of the dilemmas and
   tradeoffs that are involved in countering online radicalization within
   the United States; and ideas and best practices for making the emerging
   approach and strategy richer and more effective. It argues that online
   radicalization can be dealt with in three ways. Approaches aimed at
   restricting freedom of speech and removing content from the Internet are
   not only the least desirable, they are also the least effective.
   Instead, government should play a more energetic role in reducing the
   demand for radicalization and violent extremist messagesfor example, by
   encouraging civic challenges to extremist narratives and by promoting
   awareness and education of young people. In the short term, the most
   promising way for dealing with the presence of violent extremists and
   their propaganda on the Internet is to exploit their online
   communications to gain intelligence and gather evidence in the most
   comprehensive and systematic fashion possible.},

Volume = {61},

Abstract = {This study maps the language that legislators use to define women's
   interests in the context of contemporary Germany. Using party groups'
   manifestos from the 2005 legislative elections and personal interviews
   with members of the 16th Bundestag (20059), the study compares female
   and male legislators within parties and female legislators across
   parties, with particular attention to how these interviewees' language
   cleaved to and from their party scripts (parties' positions on and
   language regarding women's interests). The map that emerges from this
   analysis suggests that legislators' language in talking about women's
   interests is mediated by sex and party affiliation in combination, such
   that female and male legislators differ within each party and female
   legislators differ across parties. The study shows that female
   legislators across parties share an emphasis on the inadequacy of formal
   equality in yielding women's equality in practice, but they diverge
   markedly in the policies that they recommend to address this problem.
   Much previous research on women's representation has focused on the
   finding that female legislators advocate for women at higher rates than
   their male colleagues, underplaying both the significant variation among
   female legislators as well as the contributions of conservative female
   legislators.},

Abstract = {Bolivia is living a moment of transition that has raised expectations of
   a profound transformation of the state-civil-society relationship and of
   conflict dynamics. The Movimiento al Socialismo has promoted the direct
   participation of previously excluded sectors in public affairs and the
   integration of the traditional practices of indigenous groups into
   formal institutional structures. The heterogeneity of its ruling
   coalition has posed serious challenges with regard to the management of
   potential tensions among diverse social sectors. A key role in the
   promotion of a hegemonic project is played by discourse. Conflict is
   structured in terms of a strong, self-reinforcing set of narratives
   about crucial aspects of social life, among them the identification of
   external enemies and the generation of new merging categories that
   invent new collective subjects. This rhetorical strategy has not,
   however, been able to eliminate the oppositional politics of Bolivian
   social movements.},

Abstract = {In socialist Romania of the mid-1980s, workers' clubs, theaters, student
   centers, opera houses, and even philharmonics used the new medium of the
   videocassette to organize film-viewing venues exhibiting pirated
   cinematic material. They were called videotheques and sold tens of
   thousands of admission tickets to an audience hungry for Western
   commercial films. This article studies the development of this
   quasi-legal and hybrid economic experiment. It describes its operation,
   analyzes its spectatorship, the alternative public spheres and patterns
   of resistance it produced, and the reaction of the Communist
   authorities, revealing the politically subversive dimension of
   entertainment consumption in socialist economies.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS},

Volume = {12},

Abstract = {The article analyzes how H.I.J.O.S. has rejuvenated the struggle for
   memory, truth, and justice in postauthoritarian Argentina, in particular
   through its carnivalesque demonstrations, the escraches. While they are
   often presented as a form of resistance that is democratic insofar as
   they foster participation in politics, the article warns against
   equating memory with both resistance and democracy. The relationship
   between them should be critically explored rather than taken for granted
   or ignored, which requires clarifying the conceptualization of democracy
   underling the analysis of memory struggles and practices. The article
   draws on theories of agonistic democracy to re-assess the politics of
   memory and highlight some of its limits and tensions through an analysis
   of the struggle and activism of H.I.J.O.S. in postauthoritarian
   Argentina. The implications for the (re-)construction of democracy are
   highlighted. The analysis of H.I.J.O.S. and the escraches is finally
   explained in the context of the reconceptualization of reconciliation as
   a political task by agonistic democracy. The conclusion reasserts the
   importance of exploring the relationship between memory and democracy
   for, if H.I.J.O.S. reminds us that remembering is as much about the past
   as it is forward-looking, it should not be forgotten that the future
   that memory struggles and practices envision is a democratic future.},

Title = {How are language constructions constitutive? Strategic uses of
   conventional discourses about immigration},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AND DEVELOPMENT},

Abstract = {Metaphor theorists often state that metaphors are constitutive of
   thought and action. This article asks how language constructions are
   constitutive of policy, using the example of immigration policies in the
   United States. First, the claims of some metaphor analysts are
   scrutinised. Then a different approach is proposed, one that focuses on
   formulaic, oft-repeated schemas, or conventional discourses.
   Conventional discourses are not the same as Foucauldian discursive
   frameworks. Instead, they are stock rhetorical-interpretive frameworks.
   For policymakers they serve as mental shortcuts and political identity
   signals. Political speeches are constructed from multiple conventional
   discourses; 18 conventional discourses about immigration were drawn upon
   in just one Congressional debate. Their variety and numbers indicate the
   possibilities for differing policy emphases. Such constructions,
   including the foimulaic metaphors that are typical of a particular
   conventional discourse, are constitutive in only a limited sense; they
   are suggestive without being determinative. Skilful politicians can
   creatively combine conventional discourses with rhetorical strategies of
   concession, springboarding, and co-optation to align with multiple
   constituencies, including ones on opposing sides of an issue. These
   points are illustrated with the example of U.S. Congressional debate
   about HR 4437, the Border Protection, Antiterrorism, and Illegal
   Immigration Control Act of 2005. journal of International Relations and

Abstract = {The dominant institutions of economic governance vary considerably
   between countries in both Northeast and Southeast Asia, generating four
   nationally distinct varieties of politicaleconomic organization in terms
   of varying state direction of the economy and degree of business
   co-ordination of economic activities: co-governed, state-led, networked
   and personalized. In the 1980s, Malaysia and Taiwan represented more the
   state-led variety of capitalist development, while Japan and Thailand
   shared many characteristics of the networked form. In the 1990s and
   2000s, these four political economies began to change, but to different
   degrees and in different directions. In particular, Taiwan became more
   similar to the co-governed variety of capitalism, while the degree of
   business co-ordination declined significantly in Thailand so that its
   political economy became more personalized. These contrasting kinds of
   changes in the four economies can best be explained by shifts in the
   interest and power configurations of dominant coalitions.},

Abstract = {The rationalist-constructivist divide that runs through the discipline
   of International Relations (IR) revolves around two figures of agency,
   the rational actor and the constructivist ``self.{''} In this article I
   examine the models of agency that implicitly or explicitly underpin the
   study of international politics. I show how both notions of the rational
   actor and the constructivist self have remained wedded to individualist
   understandings of agency that were first incarnated in the discipline's
   self-understandings by Hobbes's natural individual. Despite its turn to
   social theory, this persistent individualism has hampered
   constructivism's ability to appraise the ways in which the actors and
   structures of international politics mutually constitute one another
   ``all the way down.{''} My purpose is to lay the foundations for a
   nonindividualist, adequately relational, social theory of international
   politics. To this end I propose a third model of agency, Lacan's split
   speaking subject. Through a Lacanian reading of the Leviathan, I show
   how the speaking subject has in fact laid buried away in the
   discipline's Hobbesian legacy all along.},

Abstract = {This article challenges the theorem of non-polarity in international
   relations theory by employing mimetic theory', a notion associated with
   the French anthropologist Rene Girard. The article argues that
   non-polarity is a distorted visual effect that conceals the actual polar
   configurations in global politics. So-called new wars' are seemingly
   asymmetrical and are said to mobilize fronts on the basis of identity'.
   However, on closer inspection new wars appear to be shaped by underlying
   mimetic forces, whereby the contenders behave like doubles', each
   reflecting its own image in the wishes and actions of the other. The
   article picks up and develops a clue from political theorist Herfried
   Munkler, that the Israeli/Palestinian conflict is a miniature copy of
   global political line-ups'. The conflict is placed here in its mimetic
   context, and implications for political theory and the theory of
   international relations are drawn.},

   relations has been substantially overlooked in the scholarly literature.
   Drawing on the Portuguese case, this study examines to what extent
   radical left parties have established different links with civil
   society, namely by allying with social movements and trade unions. Our
   findings confirm that party organisational models significantly shape
   the relationship between the radical left and civil society. However,
   external challenges and internal pressures increase the influence of
   party leadership in determining linkage strategies. Finally, the impact
   of the recent economic and financial crisis has been limited, especially
   in terms of programmatic and organisational renewal.},

Abstract = {In the last three decades, China has experienced dual decentralization
   in transforming its economy, resulting in decentralization and
   deconcentration in public administration and social service delivery.
   Under the policy framework of decentralization, particularly when
   welfare financing has been decentralized to local governments, the
   emergence of welfare regionalism is evident in China. This paper sets
   out against this policy context to examine how three local governments
   in eastern coastal areas in China handle changing labour welfare needs
   by institutionalizing social and labour protection measures to meet the
   local needs instead of implementing central policy. With particular
   reference to examine why regional variations exist in welfare provision
   even though the socio-economic development status is similar in these
   areas, this paper shows how different forms of capitals, government's
   governance style and diversity of industries have affected welfare
   arrangements for labour in China. (C) 2013 Policy and Society Associates

Abstract = {Media scholars looking into the relationship between political and media
   systems in the former communist countries have mainly worked on the
   assumption that parties seek control over the media in order to suppress
   critical voices and to gain favourable coverage so that they can
   influence voting behaviour, but have barely explored political actors'
   other possible motivations. Meanwhile, political scientists studying the
   region's countries have often focused on parties' relationship to the
   state and the resources that they extracted from state institutions such
   as ministries and municipalities but largely ignored the relationship
   between parties and the media. This article, written as part of the
   project Media and Democracy in Central and Eastern Europe, attempts to
   link these two traditions of research. Introducing the concept of the
   party colonisation of the media, it looks into what benefits other than
   suppressing criticism and gaining favourable coverage parties may gain
   from controlling the media. It uses the example of Hungary to illustrate
   how the party colonisation of the media works. It also intends to assess
   how different patterns of media colonisation affect media freedom.},

Abstract = {In our 2005 paper, Rethinking Sustainable Cities, we made a case for the
   increasing significance of climate change in the urban politics of
   sustainability. Taking a multilevel governance perspective, we argued
   that the urban' governance of climate protection was not confined to a
   local arena or to the actions of the state, but rather was orchestrated
   through the interrelations between global, national and local actors
   across state/non-state boundaries. We revisit these arguments and
   examine their validity in the light of the rapidly changing landscape of
   urban responses to climate change and the growing academic literature in
   this field. We consider in turn: the ways in which climate change is
   shaping urban agendas; the utility of multilevel governance perspectives
   for understanding this phenomenon; and the extent to which we can
   identify a new' politics of urban climate change governance and its
   consequent implications for the development of theory and practice in
   this field.},

Abstract = {In its Lisbon ruling, the German Constitutional Court claims that the
   formation of a government with the powers of a state from within the
   European Parliament would require its seats to be apportioned in a
   strict relationship to the share of each member state in the population
   of the Union. In reaching this conclusion, the Court distinguishes
   between the equal representation of whole democratic peoples and the
   equal representation of individual citizens. However, we question that
   the composition of a European Parliament with powers of government
   formation would need to give strict priority to the equal representation
   of persons, rather than continue to give some weight to both equalities.
   The Court's concern that a European Government should not be elected by
   those who represent a minority of the population could also be met if
   the Parliament's choice had to be confirmed by a qualified majority of
   the European Council.},

Abstract = {Acquiring and maintaining public support is frequently cited as an
   important requirement for governments fighting non-state actors. But how
   exactly can public support influence the course of counterterrorism
   campaigns and thereby contribute to an escalation or de-escalation of
   violence? This article argues that public support can provide a mandate
   for action but that it can also set boundaries for the measures
   governments and their non-state adversaries can legitimately use.
   Fluctuations in the quantity and quality of public support for either
   side can expand or contract these boundaries, potentially instigating
   marked changes in conflict-related violence levels and affecting the
   efficacy of government countermeasures.},

Abstract = {The debate over healthcare reform in the United States has been
   divisive. Research demonstrates that beliefs that policy beneficiaries
   violate values strongly predict opposition to these policies. Similar
   dynamics may be happening regarding opposition to healthcare reform.
   Specifically, this study tested the hypothesis that opposition to a
   public option in healthcare reform results from stereotypes that
   public-option beneficiaries violate values. In two studies utilizing
   three samples, beliefs about beneficiaries violating values of hard work
   consistently predicted opposition to a public option and an alternative
   market-based healthcare reform plan, often proposed by public-option
   opponents. Results also suggest that assertions that a public option
   would lead to bigger government increases opposition to a public option
   by indirectly masking underlying stereotypes about value violations.},

Abstract = {This article aims at studying school guidance from a policy analysis
   point of view. Based on the observation of French educational guidance
   practices, it discusses Thomas Risse's logic of arguing thesis. Through
   focusing on the room left for deliberation within the micro
   decision-making process that is educational guidance in France, this
   analysis sets out to reveal the constraints that press upon a mechanism
   for, and a logic of, deliberation. Based upon a quantitative and
   qualitative study carried out in the Aquitaine region, it concludes that
   this procedure ultimately only rarely results in practices of debate
   that go beyond formalist commitments to open and equitable
   argumentation.},

Journal = {CONTEMPORARY SECURITY POLICY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {34},
Number = {3},
Pages = {446-472},
Abstract = {This article provides a comparative analysis of relations between the
   European neutral states Austria, Finland, Ireland, Sweden, and
   Switzerland - and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). The
   European neutrals have established broadly similar partnerships with
   NATO since the end of the Cold War, but significant variation in their
   relations with NATO can also be observed (the origins of which can be
   traced back to the Cold War and earlier). This pattern - continued non-
   membership of NATO, partnership with the alliance, and significant
   variation in terms of national relations with NATO - can be explained by
   a historical institutionalist perspective, combining path dependency and
   policy adaptation. This perspective also helps to explain why the
   relationship between the European neutrals is - and is likely to remain
   - an ambiguous partnership: policy adaptation at the elite level,
   implying close cooperation with NATO, sits alongside path dependency at
   the general public level where NATO is still viewed as representing `
   public bads' such as power politics, militarism, and nuclear weapons.
   The deeply embedded domestic path dependency of neutrality suggests that
   even those states with the closest relations with NATO - Sweden and
   Finland - may never join the alliance. The article also argues that the
   neutral states' divergent patterns of engagement with NATO parallel
   those of NATO members with the alliance: more attention needs to be paid
   to the different ways in which both partners and members engage with
   NATO and the reasons for such differences.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {24},

Pages = {421-436},
Abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to explore the relationships between
   self-construals, religious identification, and conflict styles in India.
   Design/methodology/approach - Data were gathered in India (n = 1,108)
   among Hindus (n = 744) and Muslims (n = 364) in various organizations
   throughout India. Conflict styles were measured using Oetzel's conflict
   style measure. Self-construal was measured using Singelis'
   self-construal measure. Pearson correlations and multiple regressions
   were conducted.
   Findings - Correlation analysis showed significant negative correlation
   between the independent and interdependent self-construal. Multiple
   hierarchical regression modeling demonstrated significant interactions
   between religious identification, self-construal, and conflict style.
   Hindus are more likely to dominate in conflict situations, while Muslims
   are more likely to avoid conflict and prefer more group-oriented
   conflict styles.
   Research limitations/implications - Self-report measure is a possible
   limitation and the sample is religiously homogeneous.
   Practical implications - The results of this study could assist
   community organizers and others who work in conflict mediation resolve
   conflict among religious groups.
   Originality/value - Few studies have examined conflict styles in India
   and this study employs a macro and micro-level approach to the study of
   conflict.},

Abstract = {Ideology: based on its redeeming mission unto mankind, its racial
   superiority, and the unlimited nature of its righteous power. Strategy:
   Successful containment of the Soviet Union aided by the global network
   of military and intelligence bases proved less effective when dealing
   with the Islamic jihad, combined with the deep economic recession of
   2007-11. Political economy: Post-9/11 national priority to defense and
   security combined with the outsourcing of many activities needed by the
   armed forces, plus modern weapons systems involved corporate America and
   its science infrastructure in support of the expanded armed forces.
   Institutional Infrastructure: Deeply entrenched and generously financed
   organizations within American society and government that support and
   help to sustain the American garrison state. Culture: A powerful strain
   of America's political culture provides a firm foundation for the
   garrison state. Americans are highly patriotic, supportive of the armed
   forces, and convinced that extraordinary measures are required to
   protect the homeland and the nation's overseas interests.},

Abstract = {New Zealand has long been regarded as a country with little or no
   governmental corruption. In recent times it has been ranked consistently
   as one of the five least corrupt countries in the world, on Transparency
   International's (TI) Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI). In 2009 and
   2011 it was ranked as the single most corruption-free country on the
   CPI, and in 2012 it shared first place with Denmark and Finland. This
   chapter examines the reasons why historically New Zealand has been
   largely free of governmental corruption, using widely accepted
   definitions of what constitutes corrupt behavior. It goes on to argue
   that, at least by its own normal standards, the country might now be
   more susceptible to corruption, for a variety of reasons, in both the
   public and private sectors, and that more political and administrative
   attention may need to be paid to this issue. This chapter discusses New
   Zealand's surprising tardiness in ratifying the United Nations
   Convention against Corruption, an apparent reluctance that leaves the
   country sitting alongside other non-ratifying countries which have
   endemic levels of corruption in all its forms. In this context, this
   chapter also notes some international dissatisfaction with New Zealand's
   anti-money laundering legislation, enacted in 2009.},

Pages = {56-75},
Abstract = {While it is sometimes characterised as a dominant party, South Africa's
   African National Congress (ANC) has failed to demonstrate consistent
   dominance in provincial and municipal elections. It is argued that this
   incongruence is related to the ways in which the national political
   imaginary is successfully (and unsuccessfully) framed by ANC elites who
   have managed to make the story of the ANC largely inseparable from the
   national character of the post-apartheid state. At the local and
   municipal levels, The ability of the ANC to frame this inseparability is
   hobbled by more policy-oriented frames as well as the institutional
   character of South Africa's constituent-legislator relationships.},

   Afghanistan},
Journal = {PEACEBUILDING},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {1},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {381-396},
Abstract = {In Afghanistan, peacebuilding is conducted in parallel to the military
   involvement. This article unpacks some of the frictional encounters that
   emerge during efforts to promote local ownership of the security sector
   reform which seeks to prepare Afghan actors for taking full
   responsibility for security from 2014. It contributes to the research
   field both empirically by shedding light on the insider attacks in the
   context of police training, and theoretically by developing the
   challenges of local ownership in relation to international support to
   institutional reconstruction. The outcomes of these frictional
   encounters include a lowering of the ambition of the international
   engagement to `Afghan good enough', an orphaned peace process, and an
   uneasy coexistence of informal and formal security organisations.},

   formulation in the European Union},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Pages = {59-76},
Abstract = {Why does lobbying success in the European Union (EU) vary across
   interest groups? Even though this question is central to the study of EU
   policy-making, only few have dealt with it. The small number of existing
   studies is moreover characterized by a multitude of hypotheses and
   contradictory findings. This article aims to overcome these shortcomings
   by presenting a theoretical exchange model that identifies information
   supply, citizen support and economic power of entire lobbying camps as
   the major determinants of lobbying success. The hypotheses are
   empirically evaluated based on a large new dataset. By combining a
   quantitative text analysis of interest group submissions to Commission
   consultations with an online survey among interest groups, the
   theoretical expectations are tested across a large number of policy
   issues and interest groups while controlling for individual interest
   group and issue characteristics. The empirical analysis confirms the
   theoretical expectations indicating that lobbying is a collective
   enterprise.},

Abstract = {While Senate reform is a continual topic of interest for partisans,
   academics, and the media in Canada, the nature of the Senate's
   legislative activity is less widely reported. That the Senate provides
   sober, well-researched political advice through its committee work is
   the refuge of ardent Senate defenders. However, what type of policy work
   do Senate committees accomplish and in what volume? This paper
   investigates Senate committees' policy reports and legislative output
   with an original dataset covering the 34-40th parliaments (1988-2011).
   The findings highlight committees' contributions to the legislative
   process, empirically testing long-held hypotheses about the Senate's
   legislative behaviour.},

Title = {Neither Bandwagoning nor Balancing: Explaining Europe's Security Policy},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY SECURITY POLICY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {34},
Number = {2},
Pages = {353-373},
Abstract = {Realists continue to bend their analytical concepts and vocabulary in an
   attempt to subsume recent developments in European security policy under
   their traditional nomenclature. Yet neither balancing (preceded by some
   diminutive adjunct) nor bandwagoning captures what is happening in
   Europe. The balancing proposition fails to explain the overwhelming
   incidence of European Union member states supporting rather than
   constraining American foreign policy. Yet that does not automatically
   entail bandwagoning, a concept which implies that they gave in to
   American threats or sought opportunistic gains through an alliance of
   convenience. Instead, European security policy is driven partly by a
   shared liberal consensus, and partly by diverging national preferences
   and priorities rooted in idiosyncratic political cultures. This article
   examines these diverging approaches by looking at how British, French,
   and German governments acted in the context of the European Union's
   Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP). Examining the drivers behind
   key operations undertaken in this framework, it focuses on CSDP's
   intended impact on the transatlantic relationship. EU foreign policy has
   generally furthered rather than countered American foreign policy
   preferences. But it is conceptually misleading to subsume this behaviour
   under bandwagoning. In contemporary EU-Europe (or Europe), the relevant
   arena for the struggle for power is the domestic stage. Beyond Europe,
   this perspective also challenges realists to reconsider the importance
   of domestic calculations in foreign policy.},

Abstract = {This research examines the awareness of evidence-based practices by the
   public organizations that fund services in the North American Quitline
   Consortium (NAQC). NAQC is a large, publicly funded, goal-directed
   ``whole network,'' spanning both Canada and the United States, working
   to get people to quit smoking. Building on prior research on the
   dissemination and diffusion of innovation and evidence-based practices,
   and considering differences between network ties that are homophilous
   versus instrumental, we found that awareness of evidence-based practices
   was highest for quitline funders that were strongly connected directly
   to researchers and indirectly to the network administrative
   organization, controlling for quitline spending per capita and
   decision-making locus of control. The findings support the importance of
   maintaining instrumental (a technical/rational argument) rather than
   homophilous ties for acquisition of evidence-based practice knowledge.
   The findings also offer ideas for how public networks might be designed
   and governed to enhance the likelihood that the organizations in the
   network are better aware of what evidence-based practices exist.},

Title = {Two decades of semi-presidentialism: issues of intra-executive conflict
   in Central and Eastern Europe 1991-2011},
Journal = {EAST EUROPEAN POLITICS},

Abstract = {Semi-presidentialism has become an increasingly popular form of
   government worldwide and has emerged as the most common regime type in
   Central and Eastern Europe and among the post-Soviet states. An often
   identified - although rarely empirically addressed - peril of
   semi-presidentialism is the risk of intra-executive struggles between
   the president and the prime minister. This study analyses the trend and
   issues of intra-executive conflicts in eight semi-presidential
   (premier-presidential and president-parliamentary) countries in Central
   and Eastern Europe: Bulgaria, Croatia, Lithuania, Moldova, Poland,
   Romania, Russia, and Ukraine. By utilising expert survey data as well as
   indicators derived from documentary and literature analysis, 76
   instances of intra-executive (president-cabinet) pairs between 1991 and
   2011 are examined. The results show that intra-executive conflict has
   been a frequently occurring phenomenon under both types of
   semi-presidentialism, and one that has persisted at similar levels
   throughout the post-communist era. In addition, we unexpectedly find
   that the character of conflicts have only slightly changed from being
   predominantly power struggles over formal rules and competences to being
   more issue-specific and policy-oriented.},
